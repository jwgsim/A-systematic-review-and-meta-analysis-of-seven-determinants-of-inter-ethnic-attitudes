T1  - Going global: Filmic appropriation of Jane Austen in India
AN  - 2419909128
AB  - The dual edged implications of the introduction of English literary studies notwithstanding – the presentation of a fresh cultural perspective and the complete cultural takeover of colony – the pride and fascination of the British with the works of Jane Austen has had a deep impact on cultural production in India and its diaspora. Down the years, keeping pace with changing times and backed by technological developments, the Jane Austen-facilitated coming together of the two nations and two cultures, has seen several multilingual, multicultural screen adaptations of the Austen novels for both television and the big screen: Sense and Sensibility by Tamil cinema as Kandukondain Kandukondain; Pride and Prejudice as Trishna, a serialized Hindi adaptation for Indian national television, and later, for the big screen by a British Indian in English and Hindi as the internationally acclaimed Bride and Prejudice/Balle Balle Amritsar to L.A. and more recently, Emma by mainstream Bollywood in Hindi as Aisha. The essay broaches an analysis of the nuancing that takes place in the interstices between the word and the visual art forms and of the complexities arising from this interface. The complex agenda of the adaptive engagement underlying this vibrant colloquy between two cultures, between two mediums is interesting enough, but the added dynamic of a hybrid cosmopolitanism that is sometimes gratifying and sometimes problematic, makes the study even more challenging.

T1  - Sedative effects of intergroup contact on support for ethnic activism among Kosovo Albanians in Switzerland: The interplay of ethnic, national, and dual identification
AN  - 2419853175
AB  - A large body of research has demonstrated that intergroup contact is a powerful tool for reducing prejudice among majority group members. Yet, research among minority group members has revealed a more complex picture. The present contribution advances recent research on sedative effects of intergroup contact on support for ethnic activism, by investigating how identity dynamics undermine ethnic minorities' claims for better conditions and equal rights. More precisely, we disentangled the mediating roles played by reduced ethnic and increased national identification as a consequence of intergroup contact, while considering the moderating role of dual identification. Results from a cross‐sectional study among an understudied immigrant minority, Kosovo Albanians in Switzerland, indicate that dual identification moderated the sedative effect of intergroup contact on support for ethnic activism via decreased ethnic identification, while no support for conditional processes of intergroup contact via increased national identification were found. Intergroup contact was linked to reduced ethnic identification, which in turn related to increased support for ethnic activism, but only when dual identification was low. Conversely, when dual identification was high, ethnic identification was unrelated to support for ethnic activism, and intergroup contact reduced ethnic activism directly. To conclude, we discuss the mobilizing role of dual identification, and reflect on how ethnic and national components of dual identities affect the politicization of stigmatized minorities.

T1  - Social Identity and Attitudes toward HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis: A Structural Equation Model
AN  - 2400022971
AB  - This study focuses on the role of social identity and prejudice as causal variables in public attitudes toward pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in a UK sample. In all, 222 participants participated in an experimental vignette study with a 2 × 2 × 2 design with between-participants factors of ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender, and completed measures of attitudes toward gay men, Black Africans, and PrEP. Kruskal–Wallis tests showed significant effects of gender on attitudes toward gay men and Black Africans; of ethnicity on attitudes toward gay men and PrEP; and of religion on attitudes toward gay men. A univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed more positive attitudes toward PrEP when it was presented as benefitting men (vs. women). Structural equation modeling showed that the relationship between the independent variables of gender, ethnicity, and religion and the dependent variable of attitudes toward PrEP was mediated by attitudes toward gay men and Black Africans. Individuals must perceive the principal beneficiaries of PrEP (i.e., gay men and Black Africans) positively to endorse PrEP for these groups, and sexism may reduce public acceptability of PrEP for women. Future research should use representative samples and alternative experimental manipulations, and include strength of social identification as an independent variable.

T1  - How Adult Women Who Trade Sex Navigate Social Services: A Grounded Theory Study
AN  - 2367781797
AB  - Access to and engagement with social services among women who trade sex is essential to address issues including substance use, posttraumatic stress disorder, and housing instability. This grounded theory study aims to understand how adult women who trade sex accessed and engaged with social services. Drawing from semistructured, in-depth interviews with 30 mostly Black and White women, results suggest that women’s differing viewpoints of sex trading and experiences of racial prejudice impacted their access and engagement with services. Women’s experiences ranged from affirmed to disrespected, which influenced whether and how they chose to continue seeking services. Implications are discussed.

T1  - Who Thinks Outside the Gender Box? Feminism, Gender Self-Esteem, and Attitudes toward Trans People
AN  - 2252550335
AB  - Trans people are targeted with widespread prejudice and discrimination in the United States. In order to better understand this hostility, we examined how different gender beliefs (gender traditionalism, gender self-esteem, feminist attitudes, and feminist identity) are associated with cisgender heterosexual individuals’ trans prejudice. We found that cisgender heterosexual men reported more trans prejudice, more gender traditionalism, less feminist attitudes, and a weaker feminist identity than cisgender heterosexual women. Participants who reported less traditional gender beliefs and more feminist attitudes reported less trans prejudice. Although feminist identity was not associated with trans prejudice for cisgender heterosexual women, cisgender heterosexual men who more strongly identified as feminists reported less trans prejudice. These findings underline the complexity and multiplicity of gender beliefs and their distinct associations with trans prejudice. Our results also have implications for clinicians and feminist activists, calling on them to critically examine their own gender beliefs and to advocate for the inclusion of trans people within their respective contexts, as well as trans rights more broadly.

T1  - Thai wives in Europe and European husbands in Thailand: how social locations shape their migration experiences and engagement with host societies
AN  - 2392499634
AB  - This study examines the migration experiences of women and men in Thai-European transnational couples, focusing on how their respective identities and social locations affect their engagement with the host society. It is based on in-depth interviews with 13 European husbands in Thailand and 13 Thai wives who have recently returned from Europe. We find that European husbands in Thailand experience elevated status as they are perceived by Thai locals to be transnationally privileged with wealth and power; while Thai wives in Europe experience cultural and social downward mobility, often facing prejudice and discrimination. The elevated status that European husbands experience in Thailand leads many to adopt a ‘Eurocentric’ approach, leading to a lack of engagement with Thai society. However, both groups of migrants are relatively vulnerable: the perceived elevated status of European husbands tends to decline over time; while Thai wives in Europe lack substantive social and emotional safety nets.

T1  - “Don’t Get Above Yourself ”: Heterosexual Cross-Class Couples Are Viewed Less Favorably
AN  - 2354002048
AB  - We examined perceptions of cross-class heterosexual couples, that is, couples where couple members differ in social class. Informed by social dominance theory, system justification theory, and equity theory, we predicted that (a) cross- (vs. same-) class couples would be perceived more negatively, (b) cross-class couples with the woman (vs. the man) in the higher class position would be evaluated more negatively, and (c) same-class low-low (vs. high-high) couples would be evaluated more negatively. We examined perceptions of cross-income, cross-education, and cross-occupation status relationships. We found support for our predicted patterns, with some exceptions. In general, high-high class couples were preferred. In three of four studies, a higher-class woman paired with a lower-class man was evaluated most negatively of all couples. Recognition of this prejudice may explain challenges faced by certain couples and couple members; as such, implications for clinicians and counselors are discussed. Further, our research generates directions for future research.

T1  - Evaluating and dismantling an intervention aimed at increasing White people's knowledge and understanding of racial justice issues
AN  - 2471501030
AB  - In this study, we built upon prejudice reduction interventions research (primarily in social psychology) and ally development investigations (primarily in applied psychology). We aimed to develop an intervention to foster knowledge and attitude change identified in both areas as central to reducing prejudice and increasing intentions to promote racial justice. Specifically, we aimed to determine whether online imaginal and psychoeducational interventions could contribute to White people's needed understandings to engage in racial justice work. Additionally, if some interventions were successful, we aimed to determine which components were most effective. We used three intervention components, two of which were created for this study: imaginal contact with a person of color, learning and reflecting about racism and its impact on people of color, and increasing awareness of White privilege and positionality. We randomized participants to different combinations of the intervention components and control components to not only evaluate combined components but also dismantle the intervention, determining whether specific aspects of the intervention were more effective. Participants completed outcome measures about their attitudes and understandings prior to the intervention, immediately postintervention, and 3 weeks after completing the intervention. Findings demonstrated that the intervention and its components positively impacted outcomes of interest, with increasingly complicated learning requiring more comprehensive intervention to change.

T1  - What is threatening about refugees? Identifying different types of threat and their association with emotional responses and attitudes towards refugee migration
AN  - 2310141719
AB  - Threat is one of the most important predictors for attitudes towards refugees and migration. The current research addresses the role of different threat types and emotional reactions in the context of refugee migration with a multi‐method approach. Using qualitative (Study 1, N = 202) and quantitative (Studies 2–4, N = 873) methods, we identified six types of threat that majority group members in Germany experience in the face of refugee migration: Concerns about cultural differences (symbolic threat), financial strain (realistic threat), criminal acts (safety threat), conflicts within society (cohesion threat), increasing xenophobia (prejudice threat), and refugee care (altruistic threat). All these threat types elicited negative emotions and were associated with negative attitudes towards refugees and support for restrictive migration policies. Paradoxically, concerns about refugee care predicted support for restrictive migration policies particularly well (altruistic threat paradox), which can be explained by a lack of emotional responses to this type of threat. Based on these findings, we propose a bidirectional model of intergroup threat.

T1  - National identification and support for discriminatory policies: The mediating role of beliefs about <i>laïcité</i> in France
AN  - 2253034273
AB  - In France, laïcité is a legal principle enforcing State secularism. However, research indicates that Modern (vs. traditional) beliefs about laïcité (ML) help legitimate prejudice against minorities. From Social Identity Theory, we hypothesized that ML should be positively linked with national identification, stereotyping, prejudice and support for discrimination. Accordingly, we demonstrate that ML independently predicts support for discriminatory policies (Study 1a, N = 241) and Maghrebi IAT scores (Study 1b, N = 242). ML mediates the link between national identification and Generalized Prejudice (Study 2a, N = 215; Study 2d, N = 114) as well as Support for Discriminatory Policies (Study 2b, N = 250). Experimental corroboration of this mediation was provided (Study 2c, N = 100). An exploratory study showed that priming ML led to more support for discrimination through national identification (Study 3, N = 89). These results reveal the important intergroup regulation feature of ML beliefs in France.

T1  - The influence of perceived warmth and competence on realistic threat and willingness for intergroup contact
AN  - 2253034033
AB  - Unwillingness for contact with outgroup members is a form of prejudice. In two studies, we tested the proposition that perceived competence has an indirect effect on willingness for intergroup contact through its effect on realistic threat, and that perceived warmth moderates this relationship. In Study 1, Hong Kong students (N = 144) rated the perceived warmth and competence of an outgroup, Mainland Chinese students, as well as the extent to which they perceived the group as presenting a realistic threat, and willingness for contact with them. In Study 2 (N = 205), we attempted to manipulate the warmth (high vs. low) and competence (high vs. low) of an unfamiliar outgroup, and tested the effects on realistic threat and willingness for intergroup contact. In both studies, we found an interaction effect between warmth and competence in the prediction of realistic threat. When the outgroup was perceived as warm, competence was found to have a negative association with realistic threat (Study 1), whereas when the outgroup was perceived as lacking warmth, competence was found to have a positive association with realistic threat (Study 2). In both studies, perceived warmth moderated the indirect effect of perceived competence on willingness for intergroup contact. Implications for the role of warmth and competence stereotypes in threat perception and prejudice are discussed.

T1  - Reducing Social Judgment Biases May Require Identifying the Potential Source of Bias
AN  - 2249480409
AB  - Social judgment is shaped by multiple biases operating simultaneously, but most bias-reduction interventions target only a single social category. In seven preregistered studies (total N > 7,000), we investigated whether asking participants to avoid one social bias affected that and other social biases. Participants selected honor society applicants based on academic credentials. Applicants also differed on social categories irrelevant for selection: attractiveness and ingroup status. Participants asked to avoid potential bias in one social category showed small but reliable reductions in bias for that category (r = .095), but showed near-zero bias reduction on the unmentioned social category (r = .006). Asking participants to avoid many possible social biases or alerting them to bias without specifically identifying a category did not consistently reduce bias. The effectiveness of interventions for reducing social biases may be highly specific, perhaps even contingent on explicitly and narrowly identifying the potential source of bias.

T1  - Challenge your stereotypes! Human Library and its impact on prejudice in Poland
AN  - 2253054373
AB  - Human Library is a public event aimed at reducing stereotypes and prejudices, in the form of an interactive, contact‐based intervention. It employs the logic of a regular library yet with readers “borrowing” Living Books, which are real people representing various minority groups. Readers engage in 30‐min conversations, during which they can challenge their stereotypes and widen their scope of knowledge and understanding. This pre‐post intervention study examined the effectiveness of the Human Library (held in Wrocław, Poland) in reducing social distance towards Roma, Muslims, dark‐skinned, and transgender people, as well as in decreasing homonegativity. Also, we measured whether participation in the Human Library changes individual attitudes towards diverse workgroups. We found that the Human Library decreased social distance towards Muslims. Also, the more Living Books that the participants “read,” the bigger the shift in their social distance towards Muslims. Furthermore, we observed an increase in positive affective attitude towards working in diversified groups, as a result of participation in the event. The study serves as partial support for the effectiveness of the Human Library in altering one's attitude towards minority groups and diversity. The intervention is discussed as a promising but not yet entirely understood tool to improve intergroup relations.

T1  - Empathy and social closeness toward refugees from Syria: The mediating role of cultural intelligence
AN  - 2241792013
AB  - The predictors of social closeness toward refugees are rarely examined. In this study (N = 337), higher cultural intelligence (CQ) and higher empathy were defined as predictors of higher social closeness (lower social distance [the Social Distance Scale] and warmer feelings [the Feeling Thermometer]) toward refugees from Syria. This is the target group of prejudice and intensive coverage in the European mass media. The obtained results indicated that other‐oriented empathy (empathic concern and perspective taking) and the motivational CQ predicted higher social closeness and warmer feelings toward refugees from Syria. Empathic personal distress predicted lower social closeness and colder feelings toward this group. Motivational CQ consistently served as the mediator of the relationship between empathy dimensions and social closeness toward Syrian refugees. Our findings reveal the previously unexplored correlations between empathy dimensions and cultural intelligence factors, including the mediational effects in predicting social closeness toward Syrian refugees.

T1  - Selling with Prejudice: Social Enterprise and Caste at the Bottom of the Pyramid in India
AN  - 2210452453
AB  - How do you sell a solar powered lamp to India's un-electrified, rural poor? This contribution to Anthropology for Sale explores the work of direct selling in rural India, reflecting on the forms of prejudice, difference and exclusion that are produced as multinational companies create markets for consumer goods in places of chronic global poverty. In the highlands of Orissa, India, a US company sells solar powered lights through a network of young male sales agents. The company and its products express empathy and proximity, attachment and connection to India's indigenous and low caste communities. Yet the company's salesmen are often more concerned with maintaining forms of structural advantage and their sales practices articulate social differences based on caste, class and gender. Rather than see prejudice as a peripheral effect of expansion and growth in emerging markets this paper proposes that we see it as a constitutive feature of markets at the 'bottom of the pyramid'.

T1  - Mapping Religion's Other: A Review of the Study of Nonreligion and Secularity
AN  - 2246702539
AB  - In this article, we review the research literature on nonreligion, secularity, the nones, and other forms of “religion's other.” As a relatively new area of sustained and still growing research activity, with its attendant theoretical and methodological implications continuing to take shape, our focus is on the social science research from the mid‐2000s to the present. We consider the challenges of definition and perspective in this line of inquiry, highlight key arguments, and summarize the main findings from empirical studies of nonreligion and its relationship to topics including identity, health, family, and prejudice. After discussing the organizational and social movement aspects of nonreligious communities, as well as related developments in how scholars are studying these communities, we conclude our assessment of the state of this field by proffering questions relevant to both current efforts and whatever future directions are in store for research on religion's other.

T1  - Toward an Integral, Professional-Public Sociology: The Example of Gordon W. Allport
AN  - 2213652442
AB  - There has been much recent debate within sociology regarding academic versus applied approaches, as well as how to integrate these during a career. Sociologists interested in such issues might find both inspiration and an exemplar in social psychologist Gordon W. Allport. Well known for his leadership role in both personality and psychological social psychology, Allport has still not gained widespread recognition for his sociological contributions, especially his “public sociology.” As an undergraduate, Allport embraced the tradition of “social ethics” as taught at Harvard, which focused on social problems and social policy, and on individual engagement. Over the first two decades of a half-century career, Allport adapted to his “hard science” organizational and professional contexts and earned a tenured position primarily by building up a naturalistic psychology. But beginning in the early 1940s, he increasingly re-engaged with social ethics and overt reform efforts, with a focus on the social psychology and sociology of rumor, prejudice and racial and religious discrimination. Though a key architect of the interdisciplinary Department of Social Relations, he came to see that project as excessively value-neutral and he lobbied to revive a clear ethical commitment. Fittingly, Allport ended his career as the first incumbent of the Richard Clarke Cabot Professorship of Social Ethics. In this way, he bridged naturalistic psychology, sociology and social ethics in order to create an integral science oriented toward social justice.

T1  - Prejudice against Women Leaders: Insights from an Indirect Questioning Approach
AN  - 2129777811
AB  - To avoid social disapproval in studies on prejudice against women leaders, participants might provide socially desirable rather than truthful responses. Using the Crosswise Model, an indirect questioning technique that can be applied to control for socially desirable responding, we investigated the prevalence of prejudice against women leaders in a German university community sample of 1529 participants. Prevalence estimates that were based on an indirect question that guaranteed confidentiality of responses were higher than estimates that were based on a direct question. Prejudice against women leaders was thus shown to be more widespread than previously indicated by self-reports that were potentially biased by social desirability. Whereas women showed less prejudice against women leaders, their responses were actually found to be more biased by social desirability, as indicated by a significant interaction between questioning technique and participants’ gender. For men, prejudice estimates increased only slightly from 36% to 45% when an indirect question was used, whereas for women, prejudice estimates almost tripled from 10% to 28%. Whereas women were particularly hesitant to provide negative judgments regarding the qualities of women leaders, prejudice against women leaders was more prevalent among men even when gender differences in social desirability were controlled. Taken together, the results highlight the importance of controlling for socially desirable responding when using self-reports to investigate the prevalence of gender prejudice.

T1  - Teaching for Coalition: Dismantling "Jewish-Progressive Conflict" through Feminist and Queer Pedagogy
AN  - 2258684261
AB  - Clashing definitions of Jewishness and anti- Semitism oft en divide Jews from progressives in the United States today, while stranding Jewish progressives in between. Many American Jews view themselves as a vulnerable minority, in solidarity with fellow minorities. Conversely, progressive (feminist, queer, and anti- racist) thought regularly conflates Jews with white gentiles, or mentions Jews exclusively as colonial oppressors in Israel- and- Palestine. Therefore progressive analysis frequently overlooks anti- Semitism, or treats it solely as religious prejudice against privileged white people. These fields also schematize privilege, oppression, and violence in ways that obscure anti- Semitism. Teaching about Jewishness and anti- Semitism enhances feminist and queer pedagogy on multiple levels. First, these topics are valuable in their own right. Second, these lessons can help students better analyze categories like race, gender, sexuality, and nation as well as concepts like intersectionality and systemic violence.

T1  - Racism, anger and the move towards reconciliation: a modest proposal about returning to a stable base: Studies in Religion & Education
AN  - 2213226900
AB  - Racism is still a scourge of our time. Those who find themselves at the centre of this onslaught carry in their hearts and minds centuries of debilitating prejudice, recognising that their own experience of discrimination is simply another stage in its unfolding history and the ongoing social structure which underpins it. Carrying such weight is bound to have a deleterious effect on their personal lives and determines their responses to any discrimination felt and perceived. Reconciliation is required to heal the wounds inflicted by such false representation. I suggest that the Desert Christians offered insights into this matter and offered remedies for reconciliation, all of which constituted a stable base for self-renewal and a solid foundation in the struggle for social justice. Like twentieth-century liberation theologians, reading scripture encouraged them to be confident about finding ways, both personal and social, to be freed from oppression and anger and to support others who desired the same. Perhaps victims of racist abuse and hatred might look to both phenomena in finding possible ways forward for their predicament.

T1  - "The difference of colour": reading and writing abolitionism
AN  - 2235683867
AB  - Through an analysis of words and images as they moved through material production, circulation, and reception, "The Difference of Colour" explores the literary and pictorial practices of African American women who read and wrote antislavery. Calling on antebellum Americans to join them in the struggle against slavery and racial prejudice, the women who formed Philadelphia's Female Literary Association articulated a powerful antislavery at a series of sites ranging from oral to scribal to print. As printed words and images increased in number and extended their reach in the nineteenth century, they commingled with other forms that remained crucial in the construction of individual identities and discursive communities engaged in social and moral reform.

T1  - The Politics of Homosexuality: Perseverance of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Community in a Repressive Social Milieu in Afghanistan
AN  - 2239162573
AB  - In Afghanistan, minorities are subjected to harassment, intimidation and even death by Islamic fanatics and conservative leaders as they try to impose their own interpretation of religious scriptures and punish those who do not agree with their interpretation of religious precepts and follow their rulings. Application of such measures has impacted the safety and security of the gender-minority community, as its members are forced to hide their identities, and cannot speak about their sexual orientation. Government agencies and civil society organizations do not advocate for the rights of this community, and deliberately avoid any discussion about them, fearing a backlash from religious vigilantes, conservative religious leaders and clerics. A lack of public education and social awareness programs about the gender-minority community has contributed to the perpetuation of discrimination, hatred and bigotry toward them − a community that is part and parcel of the social fabric of modern Afghanistan.

T1  - A Test of the Three-Component Model of Gender-Based Prejudices: Homophobia and Transphobia Are Affected by Raters’ and Targets’ Assigned Sex at Birth
AN  - 2023850602
AB  - The present study tested a three-component model of homophobia and transphobia that differentiates between general and specifically gender-based social threats that motivate these prejudices. A sample of 187 female and 107 male heterosexual U.S. college undergraduates were randomly assigned to complete survey measures of homophobia and transphobia with either born-female (lesbian and female-to-male transgender, respectively) or born-male (gay man and male-to-female transgender, respectively) targets, as well as measures of religious fundamentalism, right wing authoritarianism, aggression, and ambivalent sexism. The participant by target-gender interaction for transphobia showed that transphobia was particularly high for male participants judging born-male transgender targets. Possibly reflecting a fear of any social non-conformity, religious fundamentalism and right wing authoritarianism were positively correlated with homophobia and transphobia regardless of participant or target gender. Possibly reflecting specific fears among men about threats to male privilege, physical aggression proneness was strongly positively correlated with homophobia and transphobia for men judging a male target. Aggression proneness was also positively correlated with homophobia for women judging a female target. Possibly reflecting specific fears among women about threats to female social roles, benevolent sexism was only positively correlated with transphobia for female but not for male participants, with no target-gender difference. Benevolent sexism was also correlated with homophobia for female participants judging a male target. These findings were largely supportive of the three-component model of gender-based prejudice.

T1  - Persistent Ambivalence: Theorizing Queer East German Studies
AN  - 2186633719
AB  - The German Democratic Republic (GDR; East Germany) had an ambivalent relationship with homosexuality. Under the principles of socialism, everyone was welcome to contribute to the greater good. The situation for queer people, here lesbians and gay men, was different: one of illegality and invisibility. A difficulty in analyzing these experiences is the theory and methodology necessary to find them and draw them together in a historical narrative. This essay offers a mode of analysis in which theories of affect illustrate long-term trends in East German conceptualizations of same-sex sexuality. By discussing a 1950 court ruling and a 1989 film, the essay demonstrates the persistence of homophobic prejudice and fear of homosexual seduction of young people and the links to historical and legal developments.

T1  - Disarming racial microaggressions: Microintervention strategies for targets, White allies, and bystanders
AN  - 2173762291
AB  - Given the immense harm inflicted on individuals and groups of color via prejudice and discrimination, it becomes imperative for our nation to begin the process of disrupting, dismantling, and disarming the constant onslaught of micro- and macroaggressions. For too long, acceptance, silence, passivity, and inaction have been the predominant, albeit ineffective, strategies for coping with microaggressions. Inaction does nothing but support and proliferate biased perpetrator behaviors which occur at individual, institutional and societal levels. This article introduces a new strategic framework developed for addressing microaggressions that moves beyond coping and survival to concrete action steps and dialogues that targets, allies, and bystanders can perform (microinterventions). A review of responses to racist acts, suggest that microaggression reactions/interventions may be primarily to (a) remain passive, retreat, or give up; (b) strike back or hurt the aggressor; (c) stop, diminish, deflect, or put an end to the harmful act; (d) educate the perpetrator; (e) validate and support the targets; (f) act as an ally; (g) seek social support; (h) enlist outside authority or institutional intervention; or (h) achieve any combination of these objectives. We organize these responses into four major strategic goals of microinterventions: (a) make the invisible visible, (b) disarm the microaggression, (c) educate the perpetrator, and (d) seek external reinforcement or support. The objectives and rationale for each goal are discussed, along with specific microintervention tactics to employ and examples of how they are executed.

T1  - Factors Associated with North Korean Refugees’ Intention to Resettle Permanently in South Korea
AN  - 2153516019
AB  - Issues for North Korean refugee integration and resettlement have, in recent times, been a subject of great attention in South Korea. Previous studies documented that North Korean refugees faced significant obstacles in resettlement because of maladjustment and marginalisation, socioeconomic status differences between the North and the South, prejudice, suspicion, national identity, and strong nationalism. This study attempts to fill the research gap by examining factors that impede or facilitate the successful resettlement of North Korean refugees in South Korea using a holistic approach (i.e. market and means, social connections, facilitators, and foundations). To this end, we analysed a sample of 405 North Korean refugees. Univariate comparison of descriptive statistics and logistic regressions were performed. Factors such as foundations (i.e. citizenship and other rights) were found to have strong positive associations with successful resettlement after controlling for sociodemographics and other characteristics. The study concludes that citizenship and rights need to be considered for the successful resettlement of North Korean refugees in South Korea.

T1  - Effect of valenced vicarious online contact on out‐group prejudice and perceived out‐group variability: A study of online poker
AN  - 2118269010
AB  - Online poker has become a multibillion dollar industry, with millions of people from around the world both playing and watching online poker each year. Unlike live poker, players and watchers, typically cannot rely on physical cues of other players; in fact, the only information often available to poker players is others’ nationality. Because these poker games often involve members of different national groups, it constitutes a context of indirect contact that has considerable potential to examine how attitudes and beliefs about people from other nationalities can be influenced by interactions in online poker. In the current research, we examined how observing an in‐group player have positive or negative contact with a player of another nationality impacted one’s own attitudes and beliefs about the out‐group nation. Participants (N = 157) watched an online poker video recording of a fellow in‐group member have negative, positive, or no intergroup contact with an out‐group member at an online poker table. Subsequent affective (out‐group attitudes) and cognitive (perceived out‐group variability) measures of intergroup bias were taken. Data revealed that while observing negative contact increased out‐group prejudice, observing positive contact reduced prejudice (all relative to no intergroup contact). However, no differences were found in perceived out‐group variability. Implications for online poker and future research intergroup contact are discussed.

T1  - Police Bias, Social Identity, and Minority Groups: A Social Psychological Understanding of Cooperation with Police
AN  - 2112708544
AB  - The present study uses Social Identity Theory as a framework to investigate the collective effects of perceived police bias, ethnicity and self-identification with different groups on respondents' intentions to cooperate with police in general crime control efforts and in counter-terrorism policing. Drawing on survey data collected from 1,272 individuals from three ethnic minority backgrounds in Australia, the present study reports findings including: (1) significant and large direct positive associations between superordinate identity and willingness to cooperate with police, (2) small-to-moderate significant associations between perceived police bias and cooperation with police (positive for Vietnamese subsample; negative for Indian and Arab subsamples), and (3) significant interaction patterns between subordinate identity, perceived police bias, and ethnicity. Findings are discussed with respect to community-engaged prevention and prejudice reduction.

T1  - Imaging Disaster: Puerto Rico through the Eye of Hurricane María
AN  - 2111474307
AB  - During Hurricane María, individuals throughout the Caribbean uploaded video and photographs to social media, but as winds downed communication towers and electric lines, sharing stopped. Still, satellites orbiting high above Earth transmitted views of the massive hurricane. In the following weeks, the media bombarded viewers with scenes of devastated landscapes, people wading through waist‐deep water, infrastructure shredded beyond recognition, apocalyptic desolation, and desperation. Media portrayals focused on a “powerless” people, literally without electrical power, further reduced into social, economic, and political powerlessness. This article combines ethnographic elicitation with cultural analysis to understand how images of trauma and suffering affect diverse audiences. Do these images compel viewers to fight for justice or do they desensitize them? Do they lead people toward feelings of pessimism, resignation, and cynicism? I explore how people's backgrounds and relationships to specific places inform the ways they are even able to look at, grapple with, and work through traumatic images. I demonstrate how long‐term prejudice is imbedded into the media's imagery and representations of Hurricane María to show how associated governmental neglect exacerbates the trauma of disaster. Lastly, I engage with the place of responsibility and sorrow as I raise the question of how the specter of future natural disasters haunts the current state of devastation.

T1  - Biased, Therefore Unhappy: Disentangling the Collectivism-Happiness Relationship Globally
AN  - 2086916239
AB  - A relationship between individualism and happiness has been observed in many studies, with collectivist cultures having lower indices of happiness. It is often argued that this effect arises because people in individualist countries have greater independence and more freedom to pursue personal goals. It appears, however, that the association is much more complex than this as many collectivist countries suffer from more basic problems, such as social conflicts, discrimination, and prejudice. We hypothesized that global differences in happiness could be the result of ingroup bias and its consequences, rather than of collectivism itself. To test our hypotheses, we applied a country-level design, where a country is considered a unit of analysis. We found that individualism predicted various aspects of a country’s aggregated level of happiness, but was only a marginal predictor of happiness when ingroup favoritism and group-focused enmity were controlled for. We discuss the implications of these findings from evolutionary and social psychological perspectives.

T1  - Differential Effects of the US Supreme Court’s Same-Sex Marriage Decision on National Support for Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Civil Rights and Sexual Prejudice
AN  - 2084168207
AB  - The US Supreme Court (SCOTUS) in Obergefell v. Hodges legalized same-sex marriage throughout all US states and territories. Before that decision, after, and 1 year later, this successive-independent samples study identified clusters of individuals across the US based on worldview ideologies and used those clusters to examine effects of the SCOTUS decision on support for gay rights and sexual prejudice. Participants were 407 adults from 49 US states and territories. A cluster analysis identified three worldview groups: conservatives (23.6%), moderates (30.2%), and progressives (46.2%). Although no overall changes emerged over time in support for gay rights or sexual prejudice, the conservative group showed a marked polarization after the SCOTUS decision, becoming less supportive of gay rights and more prejudiced. Worldviews explained 68.3% of the variance in same-sex marriage support, 67.5% in gay rights support, and 68.8% in sexual prejudice, effects approaching nearly three times a large-sized effect in the social sciences. These findings add nuance to our understanding of the attitudinal impact of court decisions or legislation around progressive issues like same-sex marriage and gay rights, as well as the potential barriers to cultural progress on these issues.

T1  - Post-Postracial America: On Westworld and the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture
AN  - 2113776494
AB  - A seismic shift in the racial landscape of the United States occurred in 2016. The prevailing discourse about a “postracial America,” though always, in the words of Catherine Squires a “mystique,” was firmly and finally extinguished with the election of Donald J. Trump. Race, in the form of racial prejudice, erupted in Trump’s political rhetoric and in the rhetoric of his supporters. At the same time, the continued significance and consequences of racial division in America were also being asserted for politically progressive ends by the increasingly prominent #blacklivesmatter movement and by the newly opened National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall in Washington, DC, not far from the White House. This article tracks the resurgence of race in the US cultural landscape against the racially depoliticized myth of the “postracial” by focusing first on the HBO television series Westworld, which epitomizes that logic. The museum, which opened its doors against the backdrop of the presidential campaign, lodges a scathing critique of the very notion of the postracial; in fact, it signals the return of race as an urgent topic of national discussion. Part of the work of the museum is to materialize race, to move race and white supremacy to the center of the American national narrative. This article points to the way the museum creates what Jacques Rancière calls “dissensus,” and thus becomes a site of possibility for politics. The museum, in its very presence on the Mall, its provocative display strategies, and its narrative that highlights profound contradictions in the very meaning of America, intervenes in what Rancière calls “the distribution of the sensible” and thus creates the conditions for reconfiguring the social order. In part, it achieves this by racializing white visitors, forcing them to feel their own race in uncomfortable ways. The article suggests that this museum, and the broader emerging discourse about race in both film and television, offers new ways to think about the political work of culture.

T1  - Theory of Prejudice and American Identity Threat Transfer for Latino and Asian Americans
AN  - 2050281185
AB  - Latinos and Asian Americans confront similar stereotypes as they are often presumed to be foreigners and subjected to American identity denial. Across six studies (total N = 992), we demonstrate that Latinos and Asians anticipate ingroup prejudice and specific types of subordination (e.g., American identity threat) in the face of outgroup threats that target one another (i.e., stigma transfer). The studies explore whether stigma transfer occurred primarily when shared Latino and Asian stereotype content was a salient component of the prejudice remark (e.g., foreigner stereotypes; Study 3), or when outgroup prejudice targeted a social group with shared stereotype content (Study 4), though neither appeared to substantively moderate stigma transfer. Minority group members who conceptualize prejudiced people as holding multiple biases (i.e., a monolithic prejudice theory) were more susceptible to stigma transfer suggesting that stereotype content is not necessary for stigma transfer because people assume that prejudice is not singular.

T1  - Performative Progressiveness: Accounting for New Forms of Inequality in the Gayborhood
AN  - 2054163274
AB  - Attitudes toward homosexuality have liberalized considerably, but these positive public opinions conceal the persistence of prejudice at an interpersonal level. We use interviews with heterosexual residents of Chicago gayborhoods—urban districts that offer ample opportunities for contact and thus precisely the setting in which we would least expect bias to appear—to analyze this new form of inequality. Our findings show four strategies that liberal‐minded straights use to manage the dilemmas they experience when they encounter their gay and lesbian neighbors on the streets: spatial entitlements, rhetorical moves, political absolution, and affect. Each expression captures the empirical variability of performative progressiveness, a concept that describes the co‐occurrence of progressive attitudes alongside homonegative actions. Our analyses have implications more broadly for how conflicting visions of diversity affect placemaking efforts; how residents with power and privilege redefine cultural enclaves in the city; and the mechanisms that undermine equality in a climate of increasing acceptance.

T1  - Exploring How National Politics Influences the Outcome of Intergroup Contact among Muslim Minority Members
AN  - 2025521481
AB  - This article adds to the existing research in intergroup contact among ethnic minority members by hypothesizing that national political debate has the capacity to enhance the positive outcomes of cross‐group interaction. Analyses show that the capacity of intergroup contact to reduce prejudice toward majority members is disproportionately stronger among Muslims than among non‐Muslim minority members. Specifically, at the time of data collection, the two categories—Muslims and majority members—were highly salient in the public debate, whereas the non‐Muslim minority member category was not primed as a contrast to the majority culture. The political debate most likely stimulated Muslims to generalize their positive contact experiences to the entire majority group. The analysis contributes to the theoretical refinement of the so‐called categorization model by focusing on politically induced reactions among contacted ethnic minority members toward majority members. The analysis utilizes a tailor‐made national sample (fielded during the Mohammad Cartoon Crisis in 2006) among ethnic minority members in Denmark (N = 3,272).

T1  - Toward a Social Psychological Understanding of Migration and Assimilation
AN  - 2024709922
AB  - The experience of migrating and attempting to integrate into a host society is personally and interactionally daunting. This article suggests ways social psychological perspectives may deepen our understanding of the interactional processes that shape experiences of migration and assimilation. We argue that existing migration literature highlights assimilation outcomes while undertheorizing the social psychological processes that constitute assimilation. In this article, we begin by showing how social psychological perspectives on migration relate to traditional sociological studies of assimilation by reviewing research on stereotyping and prejudice. Next, we review studies utilizing social identity theory and symbolic interactionism to explore how immigrants cast off stigma and give positive meaning to themselves. We conclude by suggesting how incorporating social psychological perspectives into research on migration and assimilation gives us important insights into the dynamic, interactive social processes that give meaning to those experiences.

T1  - Schools of Thought in Islamophobia Studies: Prejudice, Racism, and Decoloniality
AN  - 2410492825
AB  - Anti-Muslim racism and Islamophobia are not just phenomena-they have increasingly become the focus of a new field of research: Islamophobia studies. Frequent national and international conferences and publications in this area bear witness to this. This article discusses the different prominent approaches to the concepts of Islamophobia and anti-Muslim racism that can be found in academic literature. It discusses the different theoretical strands within Islamophobia studies rather than the commonalities they share. In broad terms, three schools of thought can be identified in Islamophobia studies. The first conducts research on Islamophobia in the context of prejudice studies, the second is informed by racism studies and draws on the postcolonial tradition, and the third contributes to the second through the addition of a decolonial perspective.

T1  - The benefits of studying immigration for social psychology
AN  - 2017709483
AB  - This Agenda article argues that studying the continuing world‐wide migration and the resulting cultural diversity has specific benefits for social psychology: it raises new questions for the field, introduces new topics of research, and challenges conventional ways of thinking. The argument is developed in relation to four issues. The first one relates to the literature on ethnic and civic nationhood and the importance for social psychology to study citizenship and lay understandings of genetics. The second issue relates to the social psychological literature on threat and prejudice and the relative lack of interest in prosocial behavior and intergroup toleration. Third, the limiting implications of the majority–minority schematic framework that dominates in social psychology are discussed. Finally, the relevance of studying immigration for the evidentiary value movement that has developed in response to the current ‘crisis’ in (social) psychology is discussed.

T1  - Multicultural Teaching in Flemish Secondary Schools: The Role of Ethnic School Composition, Track, and Teachers’ Ethnic Prejudice
AN  - 1992792104
AB  - In this study, we investigate the association between a school’s ethnic composition, the track in which teachers teach, and their level of involvement with multicultural teaching (MCT) in the Flemish context, taking into account the ethnic prejudice of teachers. Multilevel analyses of data from 590 Flemish teachers in 40 Belgian secondary schools suggest that teachers in schools with more ethnic minority pupils, teachers in vocational education, and ethnically unprejudiced teachers implement more MCT. These findings highlight the need for more research into the relationship between school features, the sociopsychological characteristics of teachers, and their involvement with MCT.

T1  - Young, Innocent and Sexist? Social Differences in Benevolent and Hostile Sexist Attitudes towards Women amongst Flemish Adolescents
AN  - 1987220665
AB  - Over the past few decades the position of women in Western societies has substantially improved in several domains. However, persistent inequalities remain and gender prejudice is thought to play a key role in this. In this article, we contribute to the literature which holds that in current Western societies, gender prejudice manifests itself in a more 'benevolent' form which encompasses subjectively favourable but patronizing attitudes towards women. We investigated the distribution of hostile sexism (HS) and benevolent sexism (BS) towards women amongst a large sample of Flemish adolescents (N = 952). We found that while HS towards women is most prevalent amongst boys in technical and vocational education, girls in technical and vocational education also comply with macho culture. Moreover, these less educated girls also display the most BS towards women.

T1  - The links between gender role beliefs, conceptions of the family, attitudes toward Poland's membership in the European Union, religiosity, and Polish support for gay and lesbian rights
AN  - 2571083891
AB  - Much has been written about the sources of public opinion regarding gay and lesbian civil rights and liberties in the West. In contrast, we know far less about the dynamics of sexual prejudice in other places in the world, including in Eastern Europe, where social movements on behalf of gay and lesbian rights are a more recent phenomenon. My goal in this article is to examine the etiology of Poles’ views on gay and lesbian rights. In light of the theory and empirical evidence that suggest significant links between religiosity, cultural beliefs regarding family, gender roles, and attitudes toward Poland's membership in the European Union on the one hand and support for equal treatment of gays and lesbians on the other, I seek here to explore the nature of these links. The analysis I summarize also contributes to the larger literature on attitudes toward sexual minorities by simultaneously modeling the relationships between these variables using nationally representative survey data.

T1  - Is bisexuality invisible? A review of sexualities scholarship 1970–2015
AN  - 1995448310
AB  - This article provides a review of sexualities scholarship within the social sciences between 1970 and 2015. It takes an innovative approach by focusing on the way in which bisexuality is addressed in this body of literature. The article reveals the marginalisation, under-representation and invisibility of bisexuality within and across the social sciences in relation to both bisexual experience and identity. Reasons for this varied across the different eras, including the heterosexist nature of the literature, the impact of gay and lesbian-focused identity politics, and queer deconstructionism. In addition, patterns of bisexual erasure and invisibility were uneven, with some scholarship taking inclusive approaches or criticising prejudice against bisexuality. The initial findings of the review were enriched by critical commentary from key relevant sociologists and political scientists. The article concludes that future sexualities scholarship could be enhanced by greater consideration of bisexuality.

T1  - Achieving a Global Mind-set at Home: Student Engagement with Immigrant Children
AN  - 1943439525
AB  - Developing a global mind-set in college students is a goal of many colleges and universities. Most often this goal is met by encouraging students to study abroad. This article explains how a service learning student engagement program at home achieves this goal by pairing Introduction to Sociology students with young immigrant children in a weekly formal mentoring relationship. Research on the program shows that students develop new perspectives about immigrant issues and that students report a reduction of their level of prejudice against immigrants coming from around the globe. Quantitative outcomes assessed on a Likert prejudice scale support service learning participants' reports of lower prejudice levels than those in a control group. This teaching method has significant implications for providing opportunities to students from all socioeconomic backgrounds to engage in service learning, achieving global mind-sets at home.

T1  - Beyond the dyadic perspective: 10 Reasons for using social network analysis in intergroup contact research
AN  - 2008938227
AB  - This article presents 10 reasons why social network analysis, a novel but still surprisingly underused approach in social psychology, can advance the analysis of intergroup contact. Although intergroup contact has been shown to improve intergroup relations, conventional methods leave some questions unanswered regarding the underlying social mechanisms that facilitate social cohesion between different groups in increasingly diverse societies. We will therefore explain the largely unknown conceptual and methodological advantages of social network analysis for studying intergroup contact in naturally existing groups, which are likely to help contact researchers to gain a better understanding of intergroup relations and guide attempts to overcome segregation, prejudice, discrimination, and intergroup conflict.

T1  - A Qualitative Study of the Integration of Arab Muslim Israelis Suffering from Mental Disorders into the Normative Community
AN  - 1890005485
AB  - This study focuses on the process of the integration of Arab Muslim Israelis suffering from mental disorders into the normative community, addressing perspectives of both people with mental disorders and the community. This qualitative-constructivist study seeks to understand the dynamics of face-to-face meetings by highlighting the participants' points of view. The main themes of the findings included stereotypes and prejudices, gender discrimination, and the effect of face-to-face meetings on integration of people with mental disorders (PMD) into the community. The findings support former studies about the integration of PMD into the normative community, but add a unique finding that females suffer from double discrimination: both as women in a conservative society and as PMD. The study findings indicate a perception of lack of self-efficacy of PMD as a key barrier preventing integration into the community, which also prevents community members and counselors from accepting them or treating them as equals. We recommend on a social marketing campaign to be undertaken with the Arab Muslim community to refute stigmas and prejudices, particulary with double gender discrimination suffered by women with mental disorders in the Muslim community and training of community center counselors who have contact with the PMD population.

T1  - Toward a Comprehensive Understanding of Intergroup Contact: Descriptions and Mediators of Positive and Negative Contact Among Majority and Minority Groups
AN  - 1869634286
AB  - Positive contact predicts reduced prejudice, but negative contact may increase prejudice at a stronger rate. The current project builds on this work in four ways: establishing an understanding of contact that is grounded in subjective experience, examining the affective mediators involved in the negative contact-prejudice relationship, extending research on the effects of positive and negative contact to minority groups, and examining the contact asymmetry experimentally. Study 1 introduced anger as a mediator of the relationships between positive and negative contact and prejudice among White Americans (N = 371), using a contact measure that reflected the frequency and intensity of a wide range of experiences. Study 2 found a contact asymmetry among Black and Hispanic Americans (N = 365). Study 3 found initial experimental evidence of a contact asymmetry (N = 309). We conclude by calling for a more nuanced understanding of intergroup contact that recognizes its multifaceted and subjective nature.

T1  - Effects of the community engagement of migrants on their well-being: The case of Moroccan leaders in southern Spain
AN  - 1858767042
AB  - Community engagement of migrants has been identified as an important element in developing both individual well-being and cohesive multicultural receiving communities. Through 10 in-depth interviews, this study explores the profile of Moroccan migrant leaders in community organizations in the receiving context (south of Spain) and the reasons for which they engage. Moreover, it analyzes the relationship established between community engagement and their well-being. The results show that migrants commit for both intrinsic (e.g., support their compatriots) and extrinsic (e.g., increase their social connection) reasons. Their social action has a positive influence on their well-being because it activates the following paths: (1) improvement of bicultural competences; (2) development of social relationships with receiving members; (3) strengthening of social bonds with compatriots; (4) increase of abilities in dealing with unjust social conditions in the new environment; and (5) decrease of prejudice towards their own cultural group.

T1  - Religious Quest Orientation and Anti-Gay Sentiment: Nuancing the Relationship Between Religiosity and Negative Attitudes Toward Homosexuality Among Young Muslims and Christians in Flanders
AN  - 1880626540
AB  - Public opinion research has repeatedly shown that religious people generally report more prejudice against homosexuality. However, previous research exploring the general mechanisms that underpin this relationship mostly relied on Christian samples in North America. Studies outside North America are few in number and limited in the forms of religiosity they address. Of all indicators that have been studied so far, a religious quest orientation was found to be the only one negatively related to anti-gay sentiments. This leaves open the question whether the mechanisms for different forms of religiosity can also be found outside North America. Against that background this research note assesses how religious quest orientation, self-rated religiosity, religious behavior, and authoritarianism are related to prejudice against homosexuality among Christian and Muslim youth aged 14-23 in Flanders (N = 2,834). This study is the first that investigates the relationship between religious quest orientation and anti-gay sentiments among Muslims. For both Christians and Muslims, we found that even taking into account a wide range of social background and religious characteristics, having a religious quest orientation is related to less prejudice toward homosexuality.

T1  - Developing explicit measures of stereotypes and anti-Roma prejudice in Slovakia: Conceptual and methodological challenges: Postdisciplinary Humanities & Social Sciences Quarterly
AN  - 2026728871
AB  - The paper discusses the conceptual and methodological challenges of developing measures of stereotypes and prejudice for use in Slovakia. Developing these measures was the first step in a research project aimed at testing the effectiveness of direct and indirect contact interventions to reduce prejudice against stigmatized minorities, particularly the Roma. The first major problem in this kind of research relates to measuring the impact of interventions, as standardized instruments for measuring prejudice have yet to be developed in Slovak. The second problem concerns the risk that the interventions will fail to reduce anti-Roma prejudice, because of the strong stigmatization of the Roma minority in Slovakia. The paper also reviews existing measures of stereotypes and prejudice in social psychology and discusses their applicability for measuring anti-Roma prejudice in Slovakia. It is argued that measures of stereotypes and prejudice should be designed and used in a sensitive manner and that in the process of measuring various forms of social bias we should avoid reproducing its cognitive, emotional and behavioural manifestations.

T1  - Political involvement moderates the impact of worldviews and values on SDO and RWA
AN  - 1799173957
AB  - The Dual Process Model (DPM) of social attitudes and prejudice proposes that Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) and Right Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) reflect two distinct motivational processes. In two studies, we investigated how political involvement moderates the impact of social worldviews and value-based dimensions on SDO and RWA. We proposed that political involvement constrains SDO, RWA and their antecedents into a tighter left-right ideological dimension, therefore transforming the double dissociation pattern of the DPM into a double additive pattern. As expected, for stronger political involvement, Study 1 (N=237) showed that SDO and RWA were a function of both the competitive jungle and the dangerous world worldviews, whereas Study 2 (N=143) pointed out that SDO and RWA were both connected with the value dimensions of self-enhancement and conservation.

T1  - The limits of hospitality: coping strategies among displaced Syrians in Lebanon
AN  - 1779201668
AB  - Based on qualitative fieldwork in the Sunni village of Bebnine, located between Tripoli and the northern Syrian border, this paper explores how displaced Syrians adjust to life in Lebanon under the threat and actuality of violence. The marginalised refugees do not only appear as passive victims of crisis but draw on a diverse repertoire of coping strategies to deal with displacement and dispossession. Self-settled Syrians have exploited social networks, savings, aid, education and work opportunities to create a new livelihood system for themselves. Nevertheless, everyday life in Lebanon is not conceptualised as a safe zone. Syrian refugees are increasingly being used as scapegoats for the poor economy and political challenges in the country. While practices of hospitality towards the Syrian refugees were widespread, ambivalent feelings and prejudice frequently surfaced. Refugees expressed concern that the Syrian civil war would escalate into further sectarian violence in Lebanon, pushing the country closer to war.

T1  - The vicious circle of religious prejudice: Islamophobia makes the acculturation attitudes of majority and minority members clash
AN  - 1790523724
AB  - Public discourse often portrays Islam as the main obstacle for Muslim minorities' integration, paying little attention to the contextual factors hindering this process. Here, we focus on islamophobia as one destructive factor that hinders the mutual integration between Muslim minority and Western majority members, affecting both groups. In Study 1, the more islamophobic majority members were, the more they expected Muslims to give up their heritage culture and the less they wanted them to integrate. In Study 2, only when Muslims experienced substantial religious discrimination did religious identity negatively relate to national engagement and particularly positively relate to ethnic engagement. Together, the studies suggest that religious prejudice in the form of islamophobia is a major obstacle to Muslims' integration because it increases the incongruity between majority and minority members' acculturation attitudes.

T1  - Inequality and Prejudice. German Social Scientist as Producers of Feeling Rules
AN  - 1926269927
AB  - This article is about how sociological research in Germany addresses issues that first seem to be unconnected: young new Fascists and migrants. We will present research in these two areas to show how social scientists contribute to feelings about their respective objects of research. We will argue that although both have cultural disorientation of their study objects as their point of departure, they offer differing explanations for it and as a consequence construct contrasting emotions towards the new Fascists and migrants: they portray new Fascists as disoriented victims of modernization in need of sympathy, while they blame migrants for their disorientation resulting from migration and thus call for indifference or antipathy towards this group. Comparing both research fields we can show that both sets of emotions interconnect and thus form a dichotomous emotional regime. Sociological research helps to sustain lines of inclusion and exclusion from the German society.

T1  - Gender representation in the Malaysian Year Six (UPSR) English Language examination papers for Chinese national-type primary schools
AN  - 1811576031
AB  - Gender bias is somewhat reflected in linguistic expressions and pictorial depictions. By examining these items, the status of a gender can be determined. Many sexist phenomena have displayed that women are always the victims of prejudice. To identify such sexist phenomena in the assessment context, textual and pictorial representations contained in the 2007-2013 Malaysian Year Six (or Ujian Penilaian Sekolah Rendah, UPSR) English Language examination papers designed for the Chinese national-type primary schools were cumulatively content analysed. The results of the non-parametric binomial test reported fair representation for two aspects, namely visibility and occupation with a p-value > .05. By using the same test coupled with the chi-square test, other aspects such as firstness, activeness and private sphere were proved sexist against women with a p-value < .05. In addition, the content analysis also qualitatively revealed that females tended to be depicted as being weak, focusing on shopping and trivial items. Males on the other hand were pictured to be helpful persons despite being portrayed as weak and bad persons in some instances.

T1  - The motivation to express prejudice
AN  - 1767329637; 201605487
AB  - Contemporary prejudice research focuses primarily on people who are motivated to respond without prejudice and the ways in which unintentional bias can cause these people to act in a manner inconsistent with this motivation. However, some real-world phenomena (e.g., hate speech, hate crimes) and experimental findings (e.g., Plant & Devine, 2001, 2009) suggest that some prejudice is intentional. These phenomena and findings are difficult to explain solely from the motivations to respond without prejudice. We argue that some people are motivated to express prejudice, and we develop the Motivation to Express Prejudice Scale (MP) to measure this motivation. In 7 studies involving more than 6,000 participants, we demonstrate that, across scale versions targeted at Black people and gay men, the MP has good reliability and convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity. In normative climates that prohibit prejudice, the internal and external motivations to express prejudice are functionally nonindependent, but they become more independent when normative climates permit more prejudice toward a target group. People high in the motivation to express prejudice are relatively likely to resist pressure to support programs promoting intergroup contact and to vote for political candidates who support oppressive policies. The motivation to express prejudice predicted these outcomes even when controlling for attitudes and the motivations to respond without prejudice. This work encourages contemporary prejudice researchers to give greater consideration to the intentional aspects of negative intergroup behavior and to broaden the range of phenomena, target groups, and samples that they study.

T1  - Can Evidence Impact Attitudes? Public Reactions to Evidence of Gender Bias in STEM Fields
AN  - 1752994643; 201601766
AB  - Our research capitalized on a naturalistic data collection opportunity to investigate responses to experimental evidence of gender bias within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). We analyzed 831 written comments made by members of the public in response to three prominent articles reporting on experimental evidence of science faculty members' gender biases. Utilizing a mixed-method approach (i.e., thematic and quantitative analysis), we identified the nature and frequency of positive and negative responses, and we investigated possible gender and professional differences in what commenters wrote. Although acknowledgment of gender bias was the most prevalent category, a wide range of positive (e.g., calls for social change) and negative (e.g., justifications of gender bias) reactions emerged. Among the subsample of 423 comments for which it was possible to code commenters' gender, gender differences arose for the majority of categories, such that men were more likely than women to post negative responses and women were more likely than men to post positive responses. Results were unaffected by commenters' own STEM field affiliation. We discuss implications for the role of clearly demonstrated bias in prejudice recognition and reduction as well as the development of STEM diversity interventions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The social aetiology of essentialist beliefs
AN  - 1660025148; 201505511
AB  - This commentary highlights the importance of attending to the sociocultural contexts that foster essentialist ideas. It contends that Cimpian & Salomon's (C&S's) model undervalues the extent to which the development of essentialist beliefs is contingent on social experience. The result is a restriction of the model's applicability to real-world instances of essentialism-fuelled prejudice and discrimination. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Can the Dalit articulate a universal position?': the intellectual, the social, and the writing of history
AN  - 1667951118; 201509055
AB  - The term intellectual, whether understood as a certain kind of human or as a social activity, is marked by a striking tension between a claim to universality and searching questions about what that universality excludes. The claim to universality gathers force with the Enlightenment, which demands 'man's emergence from his self-imposed immaturity'. Now the intellectual's reason not only places him above the social but makes him the midwife and harbinger of its future; he will bring about the 'transformation of consciousness by the dispelling of prejudice and the spread of theoretical truth'. The futurity and universality of the intellectual is enshrined even more firmly in place with the consolidation of what Foucault has described as 'total history'. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Biographical Narratives of Encounter: The Significance of Mobility and Emplacement in Shaping Attitudes towards Difference
AN  - 1708525625; 201529302
AB  - This paper is located within work in Urban Studies about the significance of contact with difference as a means for reducing prejudice and achieving social change. Recent approaches, influenced by theories of affect, have emphasised non-conscious everyday negotiations of difference in the city. In this paper it is argued that such approaches lose sight of the significance of the subject: of the reflective judgements of 'others' made by individuals; of our ability to make decisions around the control of our feelings and identifications; and of the significance of personal pasts and collective histories in shaping the ways we perceive and react to encounters. Rather, this paper uses a biographical approach focusing on interviewees' narratives of encounter. Through its attention to processes of mobility and emplacement, it contributes to debates about when contact with difference matters by highlighting the importance of everyday social normativities in the production of moral dispositions.

T1  - Forming impressions of in-group and out-group members under self-esteem threat: The moderating role of the need for cognitive closure and prejudice
AN  - 1559007551; 201432136
AB  - This study aims to investigate whether and how participants' need for cognitive closure (NCC) and their level of the prejudice moderate the self-esteem threats' influence on their perception of in-group and out-group members. There is still an open debate concerning the relationship between in-group favoritism and out-group negativity, as well as concerning factors that may increase these two phenomena and their reciprocity. Participants (78 students) completed a questionnaire containing the scales of prejudice and NCC. Subsequently, after they watched a short movie clip showing an interaction between an in-group member behaving negatively and an out-group member behaving positively, participants were exposed to a self-esteem threat (vs. self-enhancement), and, finally, they were requested to evaluate these in-group and out-group members. Results, as hypothesized, show that self-esteem threats increase negative evaluations of the out-group members and decrease negative evaluations of the in-group members only among participants with a high need for closure and a high level of prejudice.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Prejudice Against People With Schizophrenia
AN  - 1559006950; 201431897
AB  - There is a growing awareness that responses to mental health disorders differ according to the label. Still, research on contact and prejudice against people with mental health disorders has generally focused on the broader label, 'mental illness,' as though various disorders were interchangeable. The present research specifically investigated the relationship between intergroup contact and avoidance of people with schizophrenia-a particularly stigmatized and challenging group-as well as mediators of that relationship. In Study 1, 78 students completed measures of their prior contact with and prejudice against people with schizophrenia. Prior contact predicted less desired avoidance of people with schizophrenia, and this relationship was mediated by more favorable attitudes. Study 2 (N = 122) replicated the results of Study 1, and also found that less fear and less intergroup anxiety mediated the relationship between contact and avoidance. This suggests that contact may effectively reduce prejudice, even against this highly stigmatized group. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Assets Disparities among Social Groups: A Cross Sectional Analysis of Census 2011
AN  - 1728661360; 201535231
AB  - Accepting the socio-economic backwardness of some castes and tribes, the Indian Constitution has made special provisions for their improvement. To address the issue of social inequality, several policies in the post-Independence period have caste-based orientation. But the results have been far from satisfactory. Backward communities suffer prejudice, poverty and severe material hardships even now. The present article highlights the inequality between Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribe (STs) and non-SC/STs with the help of asset possession approach of poverty measurement based on Census data of 2011. It reveals that overall assets possession status of Indian households has improved between Census 2001 and 2011. All states and Union Territories (UTs) have shown positive asset growth during the above-mentioned period. STs have registered growth during that period but it is still not adequate to redress the assets inequalities. SCs have made some progress but there are still giant strides to be made before inequalities are appropriately addressed. This article also tries to show regional disparities among the groups within a state/UT as well as disparities among the states/UTs along the individual group. The analysis has revealed that asset poor regions remained poor throughout the period under the article. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Tuning in to the RTLM: Tracking the Evolution of Language Alongside the Rwandan Genocide Using Social Identity Theory
AN  - 1512220743; 201409983
AB  - Transcripts from radio broadcasts that aired in pre-, early-, and late-genocide Rwanda were content analyzed from a social identity theory perspective to examine whether language use was consistent with theoretical predictions. The data yielded by these analyses (N = 59) are noteworthy because the broadcasters on this station were eventually charged with war crimes for inciting and endorsing the violence between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups. The results from this study found that the transcripts contained language in support of theory such that the Tutsi out-group was increasingly dehumanized as the conflict escalated, the Tutsi were blamed for their fate-while the Hutu were presented as victims of the violence, and an overt prejudice that was initially directed at Tutsi rebel group grew to include all Tutsi people near the end of this conflict. These data provide compelling support for the communication processes that arise within intergroup conflict situations and support the continued application of social identity theory to real-world situations.

T1  - Fluid Movement and Fluid Social Cognition: Bodily Movement Influences Essentialist Thought
AN  - 1934525613
AB  - Rigid social categorization can lead to negative social consequences such as stereotyping and prejudice. The authors hypothesized that bodily experiences of fluidity would promote fluidity in social-categorical thinking. Across a series of experiments, fluid movements compared with nonfluid movements led to more fluid lay theories of social categories, more fluidity in social categorization, and consequences of fluid social-categorical thinking, decreased stereotype endorsement, and increased concern for social inequalities. The role of sensorimotor states in fluid social cognition, with consequences for social judgment and behavior, is discussed.

T1  - Female Tunisian Revolutionaries: Leadership and Social (Dis)order in Global News Production
AN  - 1718065106; 201531468
AB  - This study offers a critical analysis of ways women were represented during the peak of protests associated with the Tunisian civil resistance campaign in North Africa from late 2010 through early 2011 among newspapers, wire services, and blogs-launch of the Arab Spring (or Arab Awakening). Theoretical underpinning includes norm theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 198237. Kahneman, D., & Tversky, A. (1982). The simulation heuristic. In D. Kahneman, P. Slovic, & A. Tversky (Eds.), Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases (pp. 201-208). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.) and gender role congruity theory (Eagly & Karau, 200216. Eagly, A. H., & Karau, S. J. (2002). Role congruity theory of prejudice toward female leaders. Psychological Review, 109, 573-598.), as well as Gans's (197926. Gans, H. J. (1979). Deciding what's news. New York, NY: Pantheon.) concept of social order as an enduring news value. Enjoined, these frameworks facilitate interrogation of print and visual texts to reveal characterizations of women and how the outcomes may have shaped public opinion on the global stage. Seven themes describe media representations of women among written and photographic reportage: Female Victims, Comparatively Lucky Women, Frivolous Girls, Female Culprits, Invisible Women, Women as Agentic Leaders, and Female Patriotic Citizens. Results underscore how print and wire media consistently clung to traditional female gender stereotypes, representing women as emotional, communal, and nurturing mothers and wives, whereas blog content represented women as fully engaged agentic leaders and citizens.

T1  - Stigma Toward Individuals Engaged in Consensual Nonmonogamy: Robust and Worthy of Additional Research
AN  - 1504422147; 201407965
AB  - In our target article, 'The Fewer the Merrier: Assessing Stigma Surrounding Consensual Nonmonogamous Relationships,' we documented a robust stigma toward consensual nonmonogamous relationships and a halo surrounding monogamous relationships. In the present piece, we respond to six commentaries of our target article with the aim of promoting future research and policy change. First, we address questions and concerns raised by commentators using existing data and found that regardless of perceived relationship happiness, sexual orientation, or gender (of experimental targets), individuals in consensual nonmonogamous relationships were more negatively viewed on a variety of qualities (both relationship-specific and nonrelationship specific) compared to those in monogamous relationships. Second, we suggest productive future research avenues with regards to implications for social change, and strengthening methodology used in consensual nonmonogamous research. Finally, we consider common ground among the commentators as an avenue to promote coalition building through the examinations of prejudice toward individuals in nonnormative romantic relationships. We conclude that this is only the beginning of a fruitful line of research and argue that the stigma toward departures from monogamy is robust and, of course, worthy of additional research.

T1  - Representations of Religious Words: Insights for Religious Priming Research
AN  - 1463007905; 201346860
AB  - Researchers often expose participants to a series of words (e.g., religion, God, faith) to activate religious concepts and observe their subsequent effects on people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This research has revealed many important effects of experimentally manipulated religious cognition in domains ranging from prosocial behavior to prejudice. However, it is not exactly clear what constitutes a "religious cognition," and no research has yet investigated conceptual distinctions between different kinds of religious prime words. In the present research we used a card-sorting task to examine laypeople's subjective understanding of religious prime words, and the central categories or dimensions of these religious concepts. Using multidimensional scaling, property fitting, and cluster analysis methods to analyze the proximities among the words, we find evidence for the mental representation of three relatively distinct kinds of religious concepts: agents (e.g., God, angel), spiritual/abstract (e.g., faith, belief), and institutional/concrete (e.g., shrine, scripture). Theoretical and methodological implications for religious priming research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Examining Lijphart's favourable factors for consociational democracy: Guyana
AN  - 1541999057; 201427408
AB  - Since the late 1950s, the competition for state power under a Westminster majoritarian system in Guyana between Indo-Guyanese (East Indians) and Afro-Guyanese (Africans/Blacks) has produced social conflict, political instability and intermittent inter-ethnic violence. Unsurprisingly, it has long been proposed that the country's ethnic problem could most effectively be solved through the establishment of a government of national unity or executive power-sharing. Passions, prejudices and political calculations, however, dominate the 'academic' debate, resulting in a research void on the applicability of power-sharing models to Guyana. In particular, Lijphart's consociational democratic model has been considered suitable for Guyana with only infrequent attempts to explore its empirical and theoretical implications. This paper assesses how Guyana measures up against Lijphart's nine factors favourable for the emergence and maintenance of consociational democracy, demonstrating that Guyana possesses the majority of these. This positive overall score suggests that a government of national unity could be viable. Nevertheless, executive power-sharing has not materialised. Some inhibiting factors are discussed.

T1  - Trends in Occupational Segregation by Gender 1970-2009: Adjusting for the Impact of Changes in the Occupational Coding System
AN  - 1318835005; 23055237; 23440734
AB  - In this article, we develop a gender-specific crosswalk based on dual-coded Current Population Survey data to bridge the change in the census occupational coding system that occurred in 2000 and use it to provide the first analysis of the trends in occupational segregation by sex for the 1970-2009 period based on a consistent set of occupational codes and data sources. We show that our gender-specific crosswalk more accurately captures the trends in occupational segregation that are masked using the aggregate crosswalk (based on combined male and female employment) provided by the U.S. Census Bureau. Using the 2000 occupational codes, we find that segregation by sex declined substantially over the period but at a diminished pace over the decades, falling by only 1.1 percentage points (on a decadal basis) in the 2000s. A primary mechanism by which segregation was reduced was through the entry of new cohorts of women, presumably better prepared than their predecessors and/or encountering less labor market discrimination; during the 1970s and 1980s, however, occupational segregation also decreased within cohorts. Reductions in segregation were correlated with education, with the largest decrease among college graduates and very little change in segregation among high school dropouts.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Modern Prejudice and Same-Sex Parenting: Shifting Judgments in Positive and Negative Parenting Situations
AN  - 1313501111
AB  - The current study compares the effects of traditional and modern antihomosexual prejudice on evaluations of parenting practices of same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Undergraduate university student participants (N = 436) completed measures of traditional and modern antihomosexual prejudice and responded to a vignette describing a restaurant scene in which parents react to their child's undesirable behavior. The parents' sexual orientation and the quality of their parenting (positive or negative quality) were randomly varied. It was predicted that participants who score higher in modern prejudice would rate the negative parenting behaviors of same-sex parents more negatively than similar behaviors in opposite-sex parents. It was also predicted that this modern prejudice effect would be most pronounced for male participants. Both hypotheses were supported. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - This article analyses  in the social imaginary in Portugal through the Foucaultian analytical triad 'knowledge-power-subjectivation', combined with feminist and de-colonial perspectives. The article begins with a retrospective genealogy of media and touristic discourses, based on interviews and documents, in order to unveil the knowledge-power discursive order in the image of . The second part analyzes subjectivations of Brazilian immigrant women in Portugal, drawing on interviews and participant observation, to unveil situations of prejudice and discrimination and shed light on how the women confront the discursive order by resisting and re-existing as subjects. According to the conclusions, Brazilian women are seen as a 'colonial body' to the extent that they are defined, essentialized, and stigmatized through characteristics attributed to them ever since the historical colonial period and related to hypersexuality. Three modes of subjectivation are identified by which these women resist stigma and re-exist: passive, affirmative, and combative resistance. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Beyond prejudice: Are negative evaluations the problem and is getting us to like one another more the solution?
AN  - 2637323449
AB  - For most of the history of prejudice research, negativity has been treated as its emotional and cognitive signature, a conception that continues to dominate work on the topic. By this definition, prejudice occurs when we dislike or derogate members of other groups. Recent research, however, has highlighted the need for a more nuanced and “inclusive” (Eagly 2004) perspective on the role of intergroup emotions and beliefs in sustaining discrimination. On the one hand, several independent lines of research have shown that unequal intergroup relations are often marked by attitudinal complexity, with positive responses such as affection and admiration mingling with negative responses such as contempt and resentment. Simple antipathy is the exception rather than the rule. On the other hand, there is mounting evidence that nurturing bonds of affection between the advantaged and the disadvantaged sometimes entrenches rather than disrupts wider patterns of discrimination. Notably, prejudice reduction interventions may have ironic effects on the political attitudes of the historically disadvantaged, decreasing their perceptions of injustice and willingness to engage in collective action to transform social inequalities.These developments raise a number of important questions. Has the time come to challenge the assumption that negative evaluations are inevitably the cognitive and affective hallmarks of discrimination? Is the orthodox concept of prejudice in danger of side-tracking, if not obstructing, progress towards social justice in a fuller sense? What are the prospects for reconciling a prejudice reduction model of change, designed to get people to like one another more, with a collective action model of change, designed to ignite struggles to achieve intergroup equality?

T1  - Discursive psychology and feminism
AN  - 1315598691; 201307424
AB  - This appraisal highlights the productive engagement between feminism and discursive psychology (DP). It discusses some of the confluence and tensions between DP and feminism. The two share critical perspectives on science and psychology, a concern with prejudice, and have ideas in common about the constructed nature of social categories, such as gender. One difficulty arises from the relativism associated with the post-structural theoretical underpinnings of DP, which can be understood as politically paralyzing. Another problem comes from an endorsement of a conversation analytic mentality, where identity categories such as gender can only be legitimately used in an analysis when participants' orient to their relevance. The high-profile debates and literature in DP shows it has made a notable contribution to social psychology and its influence can also be found in other areas. A particular influence of DP highlighted in the present appraisal is on gender and language research. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Gender, Religion and an Immigrant Minority: Jewish women and the suffrage movement in Britain c.1900-1920
AN  - 2115202247
AB  - Middle- and upper-class Jewish women enjoyed less equality within their faith communities than Christian counterparts. They were represented in every strand of the suffrage movement, and in 1912 formed the Jewish League for Woman Suffrage (JLWS), modelled on similar Christian leagues. A study of the origins of the JLWS, and its relations with parallel organisations, shows religious difference to have been no barrier, and even conducive to, cross-denominational collaboration. The JLWS confounded (largely male) communal expectations that it would not influence London's East End, and would exacerbate prejudice against Jews. Post-1918, Jewish women were denied the level of equality within their faith congregations achieved by their Christian peers.

T1  - Dynamics and dilemmas in social psychology: Social relations, identities and cognition
AN  - 1718068170; 201530932
AB  - This paper aims to provide a systematised overview of the paradigmatic orientations in social psychology in Portugal by identifying the most cited publications. Results show that the eight most cited thematic are: (1) deviance and reactions to deviance, (2) methodology, (3) prejudice and discrimination, (4) gender studies, (5) risk, environment and safety, (6) information processing, social judgment, familiarity and mood, (7) social representations and (8) social justice and belief in a just world. These eight most salient thematics can be sorted into three current paradigmatic orientations in contemporary social psychology: (a) social cognition; (b) the study of collective beliefs, ideologies and social representations; and (c) the study of identity and its impact on intra- and intergroup processes. The paper finishes with a reflection on the future developments of the discipline and the dilemmas that social psychology in Portugal could face. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Trajectories of Body Mass and Self-Concept in Black and White Girls: The Lingering Effects of Stigma
AN  - 940349870; 22382717
AB  - As a stigmatizing condition, obesity may lead to the internalization of devalued labels and threats to sel-fconcept. Modified labeling theory suggests that the effects of stigma may outlive direct manifestations of the discredited characteristic itself. This article considers whether obesity's effects on self-concept linger when obese youth enter the normal body mass range. Using longitudinal data from the National Growth and Health Study on 2,206 black and white girls, we estimated a parallel-process growth mixture model of body mass linked to growth models of body image discrepancy and self-esteem. We found that discrepancy was higher and self-esteem lower in formerly obese girls compared to girls always in the normal range and comparable to chronically obese girls. Neither body image discrepancy nor self-esteem rebounded in white girls despite reduction in body mass, suggesting that the effects of stigma linger. Self-esteem, but not discrepancy, did rebound in black girls. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - THE INFLUENCE OF WORLD SOCIETAL FORCES ON SOCIAL TOLERANCE. A TIME COMPARATIVE STUDY OF PREJUDICES IN 32 COUNTRIES
AN  - 1081868514; 201235004
AB  - Societal variation in xenophobia, homophobia, and other prejudices is frequently explained by the economic background and political history of different countries. This article expands these explanations by considering the influence of world societal factors on individual attitudes. The empirical analysis is based on survey data collected within the World Value Survey and European Values Study framework between 1989 and 2010. Data are combined to a three-wave cross-sectional design including about 130,000 respondents from 32 countries. Results show that xenophobia and homophobia are influenced by the national political history, societal affluence, and the presence of international organizations. Global forces, however, are of particular importance for homophobia. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Principles over Prejudice: Social Dominance Theory and the Mosques' Controversy in American Cities
AN  - 1015617891
AB  - There are two challenges that confront elected leaders in American cities in regards the building of mosques within their precincts. The first involves Constitutional principles that ensure freedom of religion. The second is being responsive to the demands of one's constituents. These two challenges surface many issues in public administration such as representing the public interest, maintaining equality/protecting minorities and upholding the principles of the Constitution. This paper explores the relationship between mosque controversies and hate group organizations in cities in America in recent years. The social dominance theory, as propounded by Jim Sidanius and Felicia Pratto in 1999, supports the rationale behind the analysis. Following discussion and in conclusion recommendations are provided for government officials to secure religious freedom while improving governmental responsiveness, thus ensuring that principles are upheld over prejudice.

T1  - Islam Moves West: Religious Change in the First and Second Generations
AN  - 1283643025; 201305383
AB  - What happens to the religious identity, belief, and practice of Muslims who settle in Western countries? Do they, or their children and subsequent generations, gradually become more secular? Or do they react against the dominant ethos and perceived prejudice by becoming more religious? We review recent research that touches on these questions. Most Muslim immigrants outside the United States come from rural areas of less developed countries where religiosity is higher than in the receiving societies. Residence in areas of high coethnic concentration, support from religious communities, and religious endogamy help to maintain religious commitment. The situation is more complicated for the second generation. Western culture has an influence, but structural integration does not necessarily reduce religiosity. Some children of immigrants try to follow a "real" Islam that has been purified of culturally specific practices. Hostility toward Muslims may lead some to react by increasing their own religious involvement. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Beware of National Symbols: How Flags Can Threaten Intergroup Relations
AN  - 1037886651; 201230850
AB  - The present research examined effects of exposure to the German flag on outgroup prejudice in Germany. In agreement with social identity theory, we demonstrated that exposure to the German flag increased outgroup prejudice among highly nationalistic German respondents. This finding seems to contradict prior research illustrating that exposure to the US flag reduced outgroup prejudice among highly nationalistic American respondents. This contradiction is considered the result of various concepts Germans associate with the German flag compared to concepts Americans associate with the US flag. Practical implications for flag exposure are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A psycho-political profile of party activists and left-wing and right-wing extremists
AN  - 1037878457; 201232419
AB  - Previous studies comparing ideological groups have been restricted to tests of between-group differences in the means of relevant political psychological variables, thereby neglecting group differences in the variances, meanings and nomological networks of the tested variables. A first exploratory study used data from the European Social Survey (N=7,314) comparing groups of political party members on the basis of their scores on a self-placement left-right scale. The second study (N=69) constituted an in-depth test for the presence of differences between samples of political activists of moderate parties, communists, anarchists and right-wing extremists. The results revealed that there is a fair amount of heterogeneity within left-wing and right-wing extremists, indicating a substantial amount of within-group variance of social attitudes, values and prejudice. Moreover, the extremist ideologies are best approached as distinct ideologies that cannot be reduced to extreme versions of moderate ideology, and differences in the meanings and nomological networks of the various extremist ideologies were also obtained. It is erroneous to consider members of extremist groups as being "all alike". The findings obtained from samples of political moderates are not a particularly solid basis for theories about extremism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Contact, Congregations, and Children of Color: The Effects of Interracial Contact in Religious Settings on Whites' Attitudes towards Transracial Adoption
AN  - 930687256
AB  - On multiple occasions research has substantiated a positive relationship between interracial contact in religious settings and Whites' attitudes towards interracial marriage, but would the same be true regarding other interracial family relationships? Moreover, would such a relationship hold true for both Protestants and Catholics? This study examines the effects of interracial contact in Protestant and Catholic churches on Whites' attitudes towards transracial adoption (TRA). Using nationally representative survey data (N = 986), bivariate and multivariate analyses are employed to determine how an increase in the percentage of racial minorities at one's church affects the TRA attitudes of Whites, while holding relevant social and ideological factors constant. Results indicate that Whites who attend the most uniracial churches are, ceteris paribus, significantly less likely to approve of TRA than Whites who attend churches with only a slightly greater percentage of racial minorities. These effects do not differ for Protestants or Catholics. Further research should be done to determine the extent to which significant social change can be fostered by interracial contact under certain positive conditions. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - On the Links between Perceptions of Desecration and Prejudice toward Religious and Social Groups: A Review of an Emerging Line of Inquiry
AN  - 1037882955; 201232935
AB  - With the introduction of a theory of spirituality, a new line of research has emerged that can facilitate a more in-depth understanding of religion and prejudice. Central to this line of research is the concept of desecration, or perceived violations of what the individual holds sacred. Empirical studies of desecration have consistently shown that appraisals of desecrations predict prejudice even after partialling out traditional religiously-based predictors of prejudice (e.g., fundamentalism, particularism). Studies have also indicated that the impact of desecration on prejudice may be affected by several spiritual coping factors that may mitigate (e.g., compassion, exposure to the core values and teachings of other groups) or exacerbate (e.g., demonizing others, believing others are being punished by God) these effects. Research and theory on spirituality, sanctification, desecration and spiritual coping more generally, can help researchers and society gain a deeper appreciation of how specific religious beliefs and behaviors significantly intensify or ameliorate prejudice towards social subgroups.

T1  - Global organizational change in sport and the shifting meaning of disability
AN  - 1023026630; 201224817
AB  - There are 650 million people with disabilities worldwide and 450 million of them are in the global south. They are the largest minority, the poorest and the most marginalized. Sport has underlined the contradictions of prejudice and discrimination and the gap between low expectations and ability. The passage of the 2006 UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities included Article 30, which defined rights in sport, physical activity and recreation, and shifted the meaning of disability globally. The historical framing of disability as a social welfare issue, charity-based and medically defined, was replaced by a rights-based approach to support inclusion. This Introduction outlines the issues related to disability in sport and physical activity in different cultural settings intersected by gender, race and ethnicity, class and age, and situates the articles that follow.

T1  - Social stereotypes and masculine homosexualities: The Spanish case
AN  - 964186456; 201209360
AB  - The Spanish democracy has brought about important transformations in the cultural construction of homosexual masculinities. Leaving behind the classical southern Mediterranean stereotypical images -- structured around the binary opposition between 'top' and 'bottom' Sexualities -- a new model has emerged where the idea of 'gayness' replaces old ways of thinking about male homosexuality. These changes have shaped both the hegemonic view of homosexuals in society and perceptions by homosexuals themselves. Slowly, Spanish homosexuals have created new narratives dissociated from strategies of adaptation to the homophobic contexts of the Francoist regime. Spanish homosexuals no longer mechanically reproduce social prejudices about male homosexuality. They have also developed new frameworks to think about themselves. These new narratives help Spanish society enrich its own view of homosexual identity by incorporating variables such as social class and age. This article explores these transformations from a socio-historical perspective and delineates key historical moments: pre-gay, gay and hyper-gay.

T1  - Familiarity with and Social Distance from People with Mental Illness: Testing the Mediating Effects of Prejudiced Attitudes
AN  - 919903583; 201201495
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine prejudiced attitudes as a factor associated with social distance from people with mental illness. A total of 289 university students from Greece completed written measures assessing social distance from, prejudiced attitudes about, and familiarity with mental illness. A structural equation model with manifest variables was tested. Participants who reported to be more familiar with mental illness held stronger social care and weaker prejudiced beliefs, and consequently expressed a less strong desire for social distance. Implications of the results and suggestions for future research are outlined. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Is Discrimination an Equal Opportunity Risk? Racial Experiences, Socioeconomic Status, and Health Status among Black and White Adults
AN  - 892053478; 21896687
AB  - Using the 2004 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we explore the relationship between racial awareness, perceived discrimination, and self-rated health among black (n = 5,902) and white (n = 28,451) adults. We find that adjusting for group differences in racial awareness and discrimination, in addition to socioeconomic status, explains the black-white gap in self-rated health. However, logistic regression models also find evidence for differential vulnerability among black and whites adults, based on socioeconomic status. While both groups are equally harmed by emotional and/or physical reactions to race-based treatment, the negative consequences of discriminatory experiences for black adults are exacerbated by their poorer socioeconomic standing. In contrast, the association between racial awareness and self-rated health is more sensitive to socioeconomic standing among whites. Poorer health is more likely to occur among whites when they reflect at least daily on their own racial status-but only when it happens in tandem with mid-range educational achievement, or among homemakers.

T1  - "We'd Be Free": Narratives of Life Without Homophobia, Racism, or Sexism
AN  - 1221412117; 201245930
AB  - Stigma and social inequality deprive disadvantaged social groups of a sense of social well-being. Stress researchers have focused on prejudice-related events and conditions but have not described more intangible stressors experienced by sexual minorities. We use narrative methods to examine how sexual minorities experience stigma and social inequality as we focus on the more intangible stressors that are both pervasive and difficult to measure. Three themes emerged in the narratives of our ethnically diverse sample of 57 adult sexual minority women and men: (a) stigma deprived them of access to critical possibilities and opportunities; (b) stigma deprives them of safety and acceptance; and (c) despite this, the experience of stigma is also related to the adoption of a positive and collective orientation towards their stigmatized identities. Recognizing these stressors and related resilience can direct policy makers toward interventions that go even beyond eliminating prejudice by including goals to strengthen minority communities.

T1  - Discrimination and Reaction: The Practical Constitution of Social Exclusion
AN  - 964190291; 201207343
AB  - This article explores and extends Blumer's work on race prejudice and discrimination by using empirical data from an ethnographic study of minority communities in Greece. Blumer explains prejudice as the result of an interactional process through which one group defines itself as superior or dominant in relation to the other. His work on race prejudice has often been misinterpreted as emphasizing the individual's subjective imaginary of the "other." Here I illustrate the importance of the intersubjective processes involved in defining a particular social situation as discriminatory. A central point of the article is to elaborate on his analysis by looking at the experience of prejudice and discrimination from the receiving end, through the participants' interpretation of their social interactions with the dominant group. Therefore I focus on how members of the subordinate group interact with the process that Blumer identifies. Adapted from the source document.

Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrated that a neutral imagined contact task can have negative effects, compared to a control condition, even when paired with incidental positive information (Experiment 2). Experiments 3 and 4 demonstrated, however, that an integrated positive imagined contact scenario does result in less intergroup anxiety and more positive attitudes, even toward this challenging group. Analyses of participants' descriptions of the imagined interactions in and across the first three studies confirm that positive and high quality imagined contact is important for reducing prejudice, but failing to ensure that imagined contact is positive may have deleterious consequences. We emphasize the importance of investigating the quality of the imagined contact experience, and discuss the implications for using imagined contact as a prejudice-reducing intervention.

T1  - Community Norms About Suppression of AIDS-Related Prejudice and Perceptions of Stigma by People With HIV or AIDS
AN  - 1910832290
AB  - We investigated the relationship between community motivations to control AIDS-related prejudice and the experience of stigma by community members with HIV or AIDS, using self-reports from 203 New England residents with HIV or AIDS and 2,444 randomly selected residents of the same New England communities. Multilevel regression analyses revealed that the disclosure concerns of participants with HIV or AIDS were lower in communities where residents were motivated by personal values to control AIDS-related prejudice, and were higher in communities where residents were motivated by social pressure to control AIDS-related prejudice. Reported experiences with discrimination and exclusion were unrelated to community motivations. The results of our study suggest that external and internal pressures to control prejudice shape the experience of stigmatization.

T1  - Predicting support for racial transformation policies: Intergroup threat, racial prejudice, sense of group entitlement and strength of identification
AN  - 862596795; 201109539
AB  - Policies and programs designed to challenge the effects of racial discrimination (such as affirmative action) are hotly contested. Factors which have been proposed to explain opposition to these policies include racial prejudice, group threat and self-interest, and perceptions of intergroup justice. We report the results of two random national telephone surveys which tested a theoretically based model of the predictors of policy support in post-apartheid South Africa. The results provided limited support for Blumer's group position model. Compensatory and preferential treatment policies had different underlying predictors: Violated entitlement featured in the models of compensatory policy attitudes, but not preferential treatment policy attitudes, where threat was the strongest predictor. In addition to threat and violated entitlement, policy attitudes among the black sample were related to ingroup identification but those of the white sample were related to prejudice. The effects of these variables were in the opposite directions for the two samples: Policy support was associated with strong ingroup identification and high levels of threat among the black sample (i.e. prospective beneficiaries of the transformation policies), but with low levels of prejudice and threat among the white sample. We conclude by considering the implications that these findings have for social change programs. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Intergroup contact and reduction of explicit and implicit prejudice toward immigrants: a study with Italian businessmen owning small and medium enterprises
AN  - 835111725; 201100074
AB  - A field study was conducted to test the effectiveness of intergroup contact (Allport, The nature of prejudice, 1954) as a predictor of explicit and implicit attitudes toward immigrants and to examine the processes driving its effects. Participants were Italian businessmen owning small and medium enterprises in Northern Italy who had daily contact with their immigrant workers. We tested a model in which contact ameliorated explicit attitudes, measured as support for social policies toward immigration, through reduced negative outgroup stereotypes. Furthermore, we predicted that contact would have a direct, unmediated effect on improved implicit attitudes toward immigrants, assessed with an Implicit Association Test (Greenwald et al., J Personal Soc Psychol 74:1464-1480, 1998). The results were fully consistent with predictions, thus providing strong support for the contact hypothesis at both an explicit and at an implicit level. The lack of correlation between explicit and implicit attitudes supports dual-process models, suggesting that the two types of attitudes are formed through different processes. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Social Psychology of the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election
AN  - 835113959; 201102025
AB  - This article introduces the 16 articles appearing in the 2009 and 2010 volumes of Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy that were submitted in response to a call for papers on 'The Social Psychology of the 2008 United States Presidential Election.' The papers touch a wide array of election topics, comparing the backgrounds and values of voters and nonvoters, those voting for different candidates, and those who choose which candidates they support early vs. late during the campaign. These papers, together with several others on media representations of candidates, highlight the continuing presence of race in shaping political attitudes and preferences, and also emphasize the evolution of American prejudices in the election process, from overt rejection of individuals who are racially different, to qualified political support under certain circumstances. Other papers in the collection focus on the role of gender as well as race, and also on some of the many ways in which presidential elections reflect and shape the self-concepts of American voters.

T1  - The People Doth Protest Too Much: Explaining Away Subtle Racism
AN  - 1928171181
AB  - The present study examined whether the length of an individual's written explanation for an instance of subtle, attributionally ambiguous racism related to their perception of racism, levels of prejudice, and social dominance orientation. Individuals (n = 51) read a brief vignette describing an instance of subtle racism and then wrote a description explaining what they believed was happening in the situation. Individuals higher in prejudice and social dominance orientation wrote longer situational explanations. Individuals who wrote longer situational explanations were less likely to perceive the situation as racist and more likely to attribute that situation to a chance happening. Finally, longer explanations also contained more situational attributions unrelated to race. As the number of attributions unrelated to race increased, the perception of racism decreased. The present results suggest that longer explanations helped individuals explain away subtle racism.

T1  - Prejudice: rethinking geographies of oppression
AN  - 758129750; 201059867
AB  - Despite equal opportunities legislation in many western societies, overt prejudice against minority groups is still evident. Yet, despite the persistence of equality issues, 'prejudice' is a term that is not widely employed in geography because of its association with a particular history of meaning within social psychology. In this paper I explore the concept of prejudice and its relationship to geographical research on discrimination and oppression. Then using original empirical research in three communities I examine how prejudice is justified and articulated by majority people. In doing so, I explore the complex intersectionalities of negative attitudes towards specific minority groups and the ways that specific mechanisms of sub-ordination can reinforce and support one another.

T1  - Secondary Transfer Effects of Intergroup Contact: Alternative Accounts and Underlying Processes
AN  - 764417429; 201064651
AB  - Although intergroup contact is one of the most prominent interventions to reduce prejudice, the generalization of contact effects is still a contentious issue. This research further examined the rarely studied secondary transfer effect (STE; Pettigrew, 2009), by which contact with a primary outgroup reduces prejudice toward secondary groups that are not directly involved in the contact. Across 3 cross-sectional studies conducted in Cyprus (N = 1,653), Northern Ireland (N = 1,973), and Texas (N = 275) and 1 longitudinal study conducted in Northern Ireland (N = 411), the present research sought to systematically rule out alternative accounts of the STE and to investigate 2 potential mediating mechanisms (ingroup reappraisal and attitude generalization). Results indicated that, consistent with the STE, contact with a primary outgroup predicts attitudes toward secondary outgroups, over and above contact with the secondary outgroup, socially desirable responding, and prior attitudes. Mediation analyses found strong evidence for attitude generalization but only limited evidence for ingroup reappraisal as an underlying process. Two out of 3 tests of a reverse model, where contact with the secondary outgroup predicts attitudes toward the primary outgroup, provide further evidence for an indirect effect through attitude generalization. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed, and directions for future research are identified. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Nepali Concepts of Psychological Trauma: The Role of Idioms of Distress, Ethnopsychology and Ethnophysiology in Alleviating Suffering and Preventing Stigma
AN  - 356946810; 20309724
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Trauma and Idioms of Distress              In the aftermath of a decade-long Maoist civil war in Nepal and the recent relocation of thousands of Bhutanese refugees from Nepal to Western countries, there has been rapid growth of mental health and psychosocial support programs, including posttraumatic stress disorder treatment, for Nepalis and ethnic Nepali Bhutanese. This medical anthropology study describes the process of identifying Nepali idioms of distress and local ethnopsychology and ethnophysiology models that promote effective communication about psychological trauma in a manner that minimizes stigma for service users. Psychological trauma is shown to be a multifaceted concept that has no single linguistic corollary in the Nepali study population. Respondents articulated different categories of psychological trauma idioms in relation to impact on the heart-mind, brain-mind, body, spirit, and social status, with differences in perceived types of traumatic events, symptom sets, emotion clusters and vulnerability. Trauma survivors felt blamed for experiencing negative events, which were seen as karma transmitting past life sins or family member sins into personal loss. Some families were reluctant to seek care for psychological trauma because of the stigma of revealing this bad karma. In addition, idioms related to brain-mind dysfunction contributed to stigma, while heart-mind distress was a socially acceptable reason for seeking treatment. Different categories of trauma idioms support the need for multidisciplinary treatment with multiple points of service entry.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Mental health disparities research: The impact of within and between group analyses on tests of social stress hypotheses
AN  - 743045007; 201029767
AB  - Social stress models are the predominant theoretical frame for studies of the relationship between social statuses and mental health ([Dressler et al., 2005] and [Horwitz, 1999]). These models propose that prejudice, discrimination and related social ills exert an added burden on socially disadvantaged populations (populations subjected to stigma, prejudice and discrimination) that can generate mental health problems. Researchers have used a variety of methodological approaches to study this hypothesis. In this paper we argue that researchers have not paid sufficient attention to the implications of this methodological variability, particularly the distinction between studies of within-group and studies of between-groups variation, in interpreting empirical tests of social stress theory. To fully evaluate the evidence, we need to carefully consider the convergence and divergence of results across diverse methodologies. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]
