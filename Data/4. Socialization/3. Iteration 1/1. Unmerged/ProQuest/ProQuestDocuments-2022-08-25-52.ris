T1  - Imagined contact and mental illness stigma in an Asian context: Bolstering the effect and examining the impact of factual information
AN  - 2400268190
AB  - Imagined contact can be effective at reducing social stigma. However, the effect may depend on the strength of the stigma held. We tested the robustness of imagined contact in an Asian setting where stigmatization of mental illness is stronger than in Western countries. In Experiment 1 (n = 167) with five conditions, only an enhanced version of positive imagined contact was able to decrease stigma towards people with schizophrenia through decreasing intergroup anxiety. Given the potential discrepancy between imaginations and reality about experiences with stigmatized groups, in Experiment 2 (n = 121), we tested the hypothesis that after presenting participants with factual information about a mental illness group, imagined contact might backfire, resulting in more negative perceptions. However, enhanced imagined contact alongside factual message about schizophrenia did not increase stigma. The backfiring hypothesis was therefore not supported. Nevertheless, providing realistic information did negate the positive effects of enhanced imagined contact on stigma reduction. In both experiments, we also showed that intergroup anxiety mediated the effect of enhanced imagined contact on various measures of stigma.

T1  - Two Sexes, Two Genders Only: Measuring Attitudes toward Transgender Individuals in Poland
AN  - 2263779109
AB  - Transphobia is an under-examined but important type of prejudice to study in Polish culture. Poland is a country where a majority of transgender people feel discriminated against. There is a need for a more evidence-based measures for researchers and practitioners to better understand transphobia. The main purpose of the present three studies (n = 300 participants for each study) was to validate the Genderism and Transphobia Scale (GTS; Hill and Willoughby 2005) and the Transphobia Scale (TS; Nagoshi et al. 2008) in Polish culture and to identify the possible psychological and demographic factors that matter in forming attitudes toward transgender individuals. The results confirm that Polish versions of both the GTS and the TS are reliable instruments to measure attitudes toward transgender individuals. Moreover, the studies revealed that both traditional and modern homonegativity, right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, religious fundamentalism, attitudes toward gender roles, and biological and cultural beliefs about the origins of gender differences were significant predictors of transphobia. As in previous studies, men were more prejudiced toward gender nonconformists in comparison to women. These studies contribute well-adapted tools for measuring transphobia and data-driven collection of significant predictors of transphobia.

T1  - “A Golly was simply a toy. End of”: Inoculation, attention deflection, and attempted puzzle‐resolution in contesting racism in online discussions
AN  - 2384449210
AB  - In producing arguments against minority groups that are designed to avoid accusations of prejudice, speakers routinely deploy two discursive strategies. One strategy of “inoculation” seeks to ward off such accusations, while the other strategy of “attention deflection” directs attention away from the potential target group. Where despite use of one or both strategies accusations arise, the result is a puzzle that needs to be resolved through explanation. Here, in a discourse analysis of online discussions as to whether “blacking up” is to count as racism, we see contributors contest (a) whether absence of intention to offend inoculates individuals from accountability for potentially racist actions, (b) whether “blacking up” depicts toys/characters rather than people, and (c) whether attempted explanations of accusations of racism work to resolve the apparent puzzle that has arisen. Contributors do not reach any consensus. These findings point to the difficulties in attempting to challenge potential racism.

T1  - Perceptions of Violent Encounters between Police and Young Black Men across Stakeholder Groups
AN  - 2383733728
AB  - Violence between police and young black men is a longstanding issue that has gained national attention in recent years due to high-profile violent encounters. We conducted 48 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from different groups (young black men aged 14–24 years, parents, educators, police officers, and staff in youth serving organizations). Stakeholders were asked to (1) identify causes of violent encounters between police and young black men; (2) describe police officers who serve in their communities; and (3) describe interactions between police and young black men. Data were collected and analyzed using thematic analysis and content analysis methods. All stakeholder groups except police felt that violent encounters between police and young black men were caused by officers lacking a connection with communities. Fear and distrust across stakeholder groups was also seen as a cause of violent encounters; youth feared police after having seen or heard of violent encounters, while officers feared youth due to the availability of firearms and previous assaults on officers. Several stakeholder groups recognized that racism and prejudice among police was another cause of violence between police and young black men. Positive interactions between police and youth were seen as the result of established, trusting relationships developed over time. Future efforts to prevent violent encounters between police and young black men should engage multiple stakeholder groups. One avenue for engagement is through community mobilization efforts that foster collaboration, build community trust, and encourage implementation of policies, programs, and practices that prevent future violent encounters.

T1  - Lay discourses about Brexit and prejudice: “Ideological creativity” and its limits in Brexit debates
AN  - 2369760551
AB  - Much research on Brexit has studied whether the vote to leave the EU is a marker of growing prejudice. In this article, we study instead how the relationship between support for Brexit and prejudice is constructed, negotiated and contested in lay discourse. Our analysis of focus groups (N = 12) conducted prior to and following the EU referendum shows that support for Brexit was predominantly constructed as based on nationalism and anti‐immigration prejudice, especially in Remain‐supporting accounts. This prompted identity management strategies and counter‐arguments by Leave supporters, such as providing alternative constructions of prejudice and racism; relating Brexit with “progressive” values; and presenting it as rational and economically sound. In our discussion, we draw attention to the “ideological creativity” that underpins these accounts and also reflect on the possibilities and constraints of developing alternative political narratives under conditions of political polarisation.

T1  - The immigrant labeling effect: The role of immigrant group labels in prejudice against noncitizens: GPIR
AN  - 2323389808
AB  - Five experiments (N = 2,251) and a meta-analysis examine how group labels shape Americans’ levels of prejudice, behavioral intentions, and policy preferences toward immigrants living in the US without authorization. These studies extend research documenting how the perceived negativity of group labels (e.g., those describing gay people) affects people’s downstream attitudes. To this end, Study 1 examines the perceived negativity of the five most commonly used labels to describe unauthorized immigrants. Study 2 found that relatively negative (vs. neutral) labels (e.g., illegal aliens vs. noncitizens) engendered more prejudice, punitive behavioral intentions, and greater support for punitive policies. Study 3 replicates these effects and examines the role of familiarity. People who personally knew members of the group were more positive towards them overall, but were nevertheless susceptible to the labels’ influence. Studies 4 and 5 provide additional replications and explore prejudice as a mediator of behavioral intentions and policy preferences.

T1  - Using the Past to Recuperate the Present: The Authentic Evil of Madame Delphine Lalaurie in <i>American Horror Story: Coven</i>
AN  - 2306710703
AB  - The premiere episode of American Horror Story: Coven (2013–14) offers a glimpse into the life of the nineteenth‐century New Orleans socialite Madame Delphine Lalaurie before she is punished for her crimes by the “Voodoo Queen,” Marie Laveau (Angela Bassett), who gifts her with immortality before burying her alive beneath her own home. Lalaurie is then catapulted into the present when she is rescued by Fiona Goode (Jessica Lange), the dying leader—called the Supreme—of a witch coven who wants to know how Lalaurie has managed to stay alive. Lalaurie becomes embroiled in the coven's attempts to rejuvenate itself and with its ongoing conflict with Laveau, who is also immortal. Although her presence allows for many of the most horrific scenes in the show's third season, Lalaurie's character does not add much to the major plotline. What, then, is her primary function? In American Horror Story: Coven, the historical figure and the character of Madame Delphine Lalaurie serves a crucial role in deconstructing the nature of “evil” in women characters. While she would be considered evil in just about any sense, the “authentic” evil of Madame Lalaurie, based on the facts and folklore of her life, is compounded by the way she is portrayed as either flouting or failing gender norms, both in her own time and in the present. Although she is but one “evil” character among several, the nature of her evil—stemming as it does from a connection to “real” history, overt racial bigotry, and a failure to conform to gender norms—resonates with audiences living in an ostensible postfeminist, postracial moment. She is certainly not the only character who destabilizes naturalized gender roles. But while viewers may find themselves uneasily speculating on the complex portrayal of evil in a character, such as Fiona Goode, Lalaurie's more straightforward evil provides an easy alternative for passing moral judgment because she embodies both failed feminine socialization as well as a racial prejudice that is perceived by white audiences to have long since passed. The combination of failed motherhood (and thus failed femininity), racial bigotry, and a verifiable history of atrocities makes Lalaurie the clear antagonist in a season filled with so‐called evil women. Madame Lalaurie thus provides an “authentic” means of recuperation for mainstream (white) audiences struggling against accusations of ongoing systemic sexism and racism in contemporary society.

T1  - Personality and ideological bases of anti-immigrant prejudice among Croatian youth
AN  - 2291296473
AB  - In this paper, we explore the relationship between personality, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO) and anti-immigrant prejudice of Croatian youth (N = 1050). We base our hypotheses on the Dual-process motivational model of ideology and prejudice (DPM) and the meta-theoretical framework of McCrae and Costa's five-factor theory of personality (FFT), assuming that dispositions (basic tendencies) relate to ideological attitudes (characteristic adaptations) that further relate to prejudice (objective biography). The present study contributes to the existing literature by disentangling the mechanism of the personality-prejudice relation in thus far under-researched anti-immigrant prejudice domain. In addition, as one of the rare examinations of the personality-prejudice relation conducted outside the Western Europe and North America, the study offers valuable insight about the cross-cultural stability of the current findings. On the present sample, extraversion and openness to experience exerted direct effects on anti-immigrant prejudice. Indirect effects via RWA were found for extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness, and indirect effects via SDO were found for agreeableness, neuroticism and openness. Intriguingly, indirect effects of agreeableness on prejudice via RWA and SDO operated in opposite directions. Overall, the results support the DPM and FFT assumptions and provide fair replication of the existing empirical evidence.

AN  - 2285045382
AB  - People deeply value their social bonds with companion animals, yet routinely devalue other animals, considering them mere commodities to satisfy human interests and desires. Despite the inherently social and intergroup nature of these complexities, social psychology is long overdue in integrating human-animal relations in its theoretical frameworks. The present body of work brings together social psychological research advancing our understanding of: 1) the factors shaping our perceptions and thinking about animals as social groups, 2) the complexities involved in valuing (caring) and devaluing (exploiting) animals, and 3) the implications and importance of human-animal relations for human intergroup relations. In this article, we survey the diversity of research paradigms and theoretical frameworks developed within the intergroup relations literature that are relevant, perchance critical, to the study of human-animal relations. Furthermore, we highlight how understanding and rethinking human-animal relations will eventually lead to a more comprehensive understanding of many human intergroup phenomena.

T1  - Anonymity, Membership-Length and Postage Frequency as Predictors of Extremist Language and Behaviour among Twitter Users
AN  - 2384584274
AB  - The rise in participation of social media networks is accompanied with a corresponding rise in online extremism. The present research was carried out to ascertain whether anonymity, membership length and postage frequency are predictors of online extremism. A total of 205 Twitter accounts and 102,290 tweets were examined. To address the research question, both a corpus linguistic analysis (CLA) and content analysis (CA) were conducted. The former looked at extreme words associated with Islam and the latter looked at four types of extremist behaviour (extreme pro-social, extreme anti-social, extreme anti-social prejudicial biases and extreme radical behaviours). Keyness tests demonstrated that extreme words were most significantly associated with Twitter accounts with high anonymity, low membership length and low postage frequency. A series of multiple regressions found that anonymity significantly predicted four types of extremist behaviour. Membership length only predicted extreme anti-social behaviour and postage frequency did not display any significant predictive power for any of the four types of extremist behaviour. These results suggest that anonymity, membership length and postage frequency differ in terms ofpredicting extremist language and behaviour.

T1  - Contextual factors and prejudice at the beginning of the migrant influx: The Moroccan case in Seville, Spain
AN  - 2296289427
AB  - Studies addressing contextual factors associated with anti‐immigrant prejudice have focused on out‐group size and rapid demographic changes in receiving locations. However, the territorial concentration and distribution of ethnic minorities at a local and intraurban level has received little attention. We analyse the relationship between emerging territorial concentration points—alongside other contextual variables—by Moroccans and receiving society's growing prejudice towards them in a city experiencing the start of a migrant influx. We combine survey and census data from five Seville districts (southern Spain). Our results show how rapid changes in the general population's ethnic composition, coupled with Moroccan and economic migrants' territorial concentration, correlate strongly with negative attitudes towards Moroccans at this early stage. However, a weaker relationship between the immigrant percentage and degree of prejudice by the receiving group is observed. We also discuss guidelines for ensuring good, local diversity management to prevent socioterritorial fragmentation in multicultural cities.

T1  - (In/exclusion) Humor and diversity in Finnish public radio: ‘If all immigrants were as funny as you guys, nobody would have any problems’
AN  - 2205313002
AB  - Similar to the rest of Europe, multicultural programming in Finland has become risky for public broadcasting. Programs aimed at encouraging social inclusion may not attract sufficiently large audiences and may be attacked by ever louder anti-immigration voices. This article focuses on what seems to be an exception in this respect: Ali and Husu. Hosted by immigrants from Iran and Somalia – a stand-up comedian and a politician – this popular talk show aired on Finnish public radio between 2013 and 2016. Through interviews with the producers and the analysis of a selection of episodes, we examine Ali and Husu’s daring and unapologetic ethnic/racial humor as well as its combination of funny and serious talk. Our findings underscore specific ways in which multicultural programming can use humor strategically to engage relatively large and diverse audiences in discussions meant to humanize immigrants and challenge social prejudices, while minimizing right-wing criticism and unintended readings.

T1  - In Group and Out Group Perceived Discrimination in Students of different Social Categories
AN  - 2262644863
AB  - The aim of the study was to explore the effect of social categories discrimination treatment on in group and out group perceived discrimination. Discrimination behavior is a prejudicial treatment of individual based on his/her membership or perceived membership in certain group or category (Correll et al., 2010). 360 participants (120 general category, 120 other backward category and 120 scheduled caste/scheduled tribe category) were participated. This research paper is a part of post doctoral research project. Perceived discrimination data was used in this research paper. One way repeated measure ANOVA and one way between group ANOVA were utilized. It was found that in group members reported lower level of perceived discrimination than out group members. Scheduled caste/scheduled tribe category members reported highest score on general category discrimination treatment. Each social category discrimination treatment effect was perceived by three social categories. Category effect in perceived discrimination was found significant for general category and scheduled caste/scheduled tribe category discrimination treatment. Between group effect of perceived discrimination in three social categories was found significant for general and other backward category discrimination treatment but not for scheduled caste/scheduled tribe categories discrimination treatment.

T1  - Euro-Americans Favoring People of Color: Covert Racism and Economies of White Colorism: PROD
AN  - 2158088522
AB  - African American colorism in the United States is often viewed as an intraracial problem in which prejudice and discrimination are relegated to the scope of internal issues. What is often lacking in the discourse on colorism is the interracial component of intraracial hierarchies—referred to as White colorism. Colorism is not a phenomenon that originated within the Black community. Rather, it is a result of European American practices that further divided Blacks according to skin color. The historical underpinnings of colorism include colonialism and slavery, yet these ideologies continue to inform racism today. This article explores how colorism was established and is now sustained by Whites in various capacities, including social and economic spheres. Additionally, racialized dichotomies, borders of Whiteness, and Black consciousness are considered to demonstrate the intersection of historical racism and current racial rhetoric. Last, the effects of White colorism on Black achievement status, including education and employment, is elucidated through an analysis of data and literature.

T1  - Race and the Race for the White House: On Social Research in the Age of Trump
AN  - 2128993270
AB  - As it became clear that Donald Trump had a real base of political support, even as analysts consistently underestimated his electoral prospects, they grew increasingly fascinated with the question of who was supporting him (and why). However, researchers have also tended to hold strong negative opinions about Trump, and have approached research with uncharitable priors about the kind of person who would support him and what they would be motivated by. This essay presents a series of case studies showing how analyses of the roles of race and racism in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election seem to have been systematically distorted as a result. However, motivated reasoning, confirmation bias, prejudicial study design, and failure to address confounds are not limited to questions about race (a similar essay could have been done on the alleged role of sexism/ misogyny in the 2016 cycle, for instance). And while Trump does seem to generate particularly powerful antipathy from researchers – perhaps exacerbating negative tendencies – ideologically-driven errors likely permeate a good deal of social research. Presented evidence suggests that research with strong adversarial or advocacy orientations may be most susceptible to systemic distortion. Activist scholars and their causes may also be among those most adversely impacted by the resultant erosion of research reliability and credibility. Ultimately, however, these are problems which all social scientists must remain vigilant against, and which we all have a stake in working to address.

T1  - Implicit-explicit attitudinal discrepancy and the investigation of language attitude change in progress
AN  - 2116787755
AB  - Socio-psychological research has frequently reported low correlations between explicit and implicit attitude measures for a range of socially sensitive topics. There is mounting evidence that implicit and explicit evaluations do not change at the same rate and thus any implicit-explicit attitudinal discrepancy (IED) may indicate attitude change in progress. However, researchers have yet to investigate whether differences between implicit and explicit attitudes towards language use can determine the direction of any language attitude change underway; somewhat surprising given recent evidence indicating that community language attitude change can result in micro-level language change over time. The present study employed an Implicit Association Test (IAT) and self-report attitude scale to measure the relationship between 90 English nationals' implicit and explicit ratings of Northern English and Southern English speech in England. Multivariate analysis demonstrated significant IED, providing evidence of language attitude change in progress, led by younger females, with explicit attitudes changing more rapidly towards a greater tolerance of the English spoken in the north of England. The paper discusses the potential contribution of investigating implicit and explicit language attitudes to help account for the persistence of deeply embedded linguistic prejudice, as well as to measure language attitude change in progress.

T1  - Coping with Stigma and Social Exclusion of Terror-Convicts' Wives in Indonesia: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis
AN  - 2062623386
AB  - This research aims to: (1) understand the various forms of stigma and social exclusion toward the wives of those convicted of terrorism, (2) understand the psychological impact of stigma and social exclusion toward the wives, (3) understand the coping mechanism of the wives toward stigma and social exclusion. The all Muslim participants were 24 wives of terror convicts or former convicts who lived in East Java, Central Java, and West Java. The data were collected through interviews and Focus Group Discussion (FGD), whereas interpretative psychological analysis were used to explore the participants' experience. Results of the study show that participants were stigmatized as "terrorist, " and "ISIS. " As a result, they received verbal abuse both directly and indirectly as well as threats of physical violence. The psychological impact felt by participants were a deep sense of shame and trauma. Three participants often still regret the situation although their husbands' arrest happened 3 to 12 years ago. The way participants deal with the stigma is through ignorance, hiding the real condition, and resettling at a different place.

T1  - Media’s Influence on Perceptions of Trans Women
AN  - 1992792646
AB  - Although media representations of trans women are becoming increasingly common, many trans women still face discrimination in their daily lives, in part due to prejudices and stereotypes that are perpetuated by media. In two studies, we investigated group differences in baseline transphobia linked to gender, sexual orientation, religiosity, and political ideology; we then measured whether different representations of trans women in media led to attitude change. After providing information about their baseline attitudes, participants were randomly assigned to positive, negative, or control film-viewing conditions, with a problematic condition (i.e., sympathetic portrayal of a trans woman by a cisgender male actor) added in study 2. In each condition, participants viewed two depictions of trans women from film or television shows. After watching the clips, participants’ attitudes toward trans individuals were re-assessed. Heterosexuals, Christians, conservatives, and men (study 2 only) showed greater transphobia at pretest than LGB individuals, atheists, liberals, and women, respectively. Attitudes of participants who viewed negative film depictions of trans women became more negative after viewing the clips. We discuss implications of these findings in relation to recent media interest in representing trans women.

T1  - Stereotypes as Pseudocontingencies
AN  - 2025287184
AB  - We introduce a heuristic called pseudocontingencies (PCs) as an alternative account of various stereotyping phenomena. PCs give rise to the expectation that attributes are correlated based solely on asymmetries in attribute base rates. Attributes that are encountered frequently and attributes that are encountered rarely are perceived to be correlated with each other. Such differences in information densities are typical of many stereotyped targets, including the self vs. others, the in-group vs. out-groups and majority vs. minority groups. Evidence is reviewed for PCs underlying illusory correlations, confirmation biases, gender stereotypes, Simpson's paradox, and in procedures used for implicit stereotype measurement. PCs are shown to predict specific patterns of self-enhancement and self-depreciation, the effects of intergroup contact on in-group biases and the readiness to infer stereotypes from aggregated "big-data". Although PCs can lead to seriously flawed stereotypic expectations, they afford an efficient and possibly adaptive inference strategy.

T1  - On the Paradox of 'Organised' Encounter
AN  - 1961017893
AB  - Encounters are politically and pedagogically charged. They have long been celebrated for their ability to chip away at prejudices, enact cultural destabilisations, shape subjectivities, and produce new knowledges. Yet encounters come with risk. The paper argues that encounters should be taken as very specific genres of contact and offers a conceptual interrogation of the notion of encounter, and its (dis)organisation, as a way of reflecting on the paradox of 'organised encounter'. In particular, the paper suggests that the promise and hope of organised encounter stands in tension with the recognition that encounters are inherently unpredictable -that they are about rupture and surprise. Taking this tension forward, the paper asks what possibilities remain for forms of planned encounter in intercultural contexts and focuses on two concerns. First, a concern with what happens when something that is inherently unpredictable becomes a site of intervention and secondly, a concern with the risks of encounter, and for whom the risks are most acutely felt. It finishes by reflecting on what it might mean to keep hold of the unpredictability of encounter in organised settings and what it means for questions of difference, power, and privilege.

T1  - Academic Freedom and the Future of Anthropology in India
AN  - 1928299830
AB  - With the rise of nationalistic and xenophobic movements in different parts of the world today, it is important to question the role and ability of anthropologists to offer critical insights into the workings of the larger society. Several scholars have pointed to the need for anthropologists to “step up” and produce incisive analyses of contemporary sociopolitical trends. For instance, Paul Stoller (2016)called on ethnographers to contribute their “anthropological impute to combat the coming onslaught of Trumpism,” including “racial and religious intolerance” (Henrietta Moore,in a Hufﬁngton Post blog [2016], has written on the need for Trump to look at internal socioeconomic problems in America rather than targeting migrants); and Brexit saw anthropologists demand of each other more vocal treatment of issues of ethnocentrism, racial prejudice, and immigration (Stein 2016). In all these calls, a central theme has been the need to address audiences beyond the conﬁnes of academia, interlinked with the question of language, both in the sense of medium of instruction (an issue particularly relevant in the context of postcolonial, multilingual nations such as India where English is the ofﬁcial medium of instruction and preferred by academic elites) and as a discursive space of engagement between anthropologists and their audiences.This essay questions anthropologists’ need and ability to engage with the public in India in the context of growing religious nationalism that claims to express majoritarian interests. What are the implications of growing religious nationalism for scholarly pursuits in India and the ways in which we as anthropologists from or living in India grapple with the challenges posed to us in the form of rising anti-intellectualism? This is an important question to ask be-cause the extent to which anthropology in India can and/or should address nonacademic audiences depends on the availability of a dialogic space to articulate these views without fear of repercussions. I ask if we ought to pay more attention to the political opinions of the urban, upwardly mobile middle classes of India and their reaction to academic work that is seen as “insulting” to majoritarian ideology. In particular, the language of anthropological work needs to be more mindful of its readership and its audiences’ contestation of academic authority.

T1  - Multiculturalism, Racialism and the Dilemma of the African-American in the Twenty-First Century
AN  - 1943051080
AB  - The paper sets out to explore the nature and dynamics of multiculturalism- an ideology that has the potency of integrating and interconnecting the world by the promotion of cultural identity, diversity and equity. The paper argues that decades after the dismantling of the apparatus of legal segregation and subsequent erosion of many of the cultural supports of racial domination in America, racial discrimination has remained a norm and pervasive fact of life which has been demonstrated both in mundane social interactions and in the major institutional contexts. The paper further argues that the birth of multiculturalism in America has done little to circumvent the rising tide of racial inequality and stigma against the African-Americans. The effects of this are more subtle and deeply embedded in the symbolic and expressive life of the American society. A secondary method was used to collect data which included review of journal articles, books, electronically downloaded materials and critical reviews of official documents. Qualitative descriptive analysis was employed to analyze the data.

T1  - Not your average bigot: The better-than-average effect and defensive responding to Implicit Association Test feedback
AN  - 1877776639
AB  - A robust body of literature on the better-than-average effect suggests that people believe that they are better than the average others across a variety of domains. In two studies, we examined whether these better-than-average beliefs occur for bias related to stereotyping and prejudice. Moreover, we investigated the hypothesis that better-than-average beliefs will predict defensive responding to feedback indicating personal bias (e.g., preferences for majority groups, societally endorsed stereotypes). Specifically, we examined defensive responses to implicit attitude feedback. Study 1 examined this prediction using archival analysis of two large, online samples of participants completing a Weight-related Implicit Association Test (IAT). Study 2 conceptually replicated Study 1 using nine different, randomly assigned IATs and additional measures of defensiveness. In both studies, people generally believed that they were less biased than others. Moreover, people responded defensively to feedback indicating they were biased. This effect was moderated by better-than-average beliefs such that feedback indicating societally consistent bias was related to defensiveness most (and sometimes only) when people believed they were better than average initially. This work represents the first foray into examining the possible moderating role of social-comparative beliefs in predicting responses to implicit attitude feedback and spurs several important avenues for future research.

T1  - The Complexity of Hate Crime and Bias Activity: Variation across Contexts and Types of Bias
AN  - 1846723678
AB  - Are racially-motivated hate crimes, non-criminal bias incidents, and general forms of crime associated with the same structural factors? If so, then social disorganization, a powerful structural correlate of general crime, should predict rates of hate incidents. However, tests of social disorganization's effects on racially-motivated hate crime yield inconsistent results. This study uses data from the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (PHRC) to explore such inconsistencies. Specifically, we assess the effects of social disorganization across contexts and types of bias motivation using bias incidents over 12 years. The results suggest that (a) social disorganization, particularly residential instability, is robustly correlated with rates of both hate crime and other prejudicial conduct, and that (b) the interactive effects of social disorganization help explain variations in incident rates by motivation type. Specifically, anti-black incidents are most frequent in unstable, homogeneous (i.e. white) and advantaged communities, while anti-white incidents are most frequent in unstable, disadvantaged communities.

T1  - The intersection of cisgenderism and hate crime: learning from trans people's narratives
AN  - 2647680818
AB  - Whilst trans people are gaining recognition and positive attention in some respects, many continue to experience discrimination and social exclusion in everyday life. This paper will illuminate violence outside the home – in the form of hate crime – and the interplay with transphobia (the irrational dislike of trans people) and cisgenderism (a prejudicial ideology based on notions of gender normativity). To-date, there is a rather limited body of work detailing trans people’s experiences of hate crime, with the tendency to subsume trans people’s narratives under the lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans (LGBT) umbrella. This invisibility results in problems with detailing and examining the specificity of trans people’s hate crime experiences. Findings from a qualitative study that explored trans people’s experiences of domestic abuse, using narrative interviewing, will be presented. A total of twenty-four interviews were undertaken with trans people (n = 15) and domestic abuse practitioners (n = 9). Data was examined using a voice-centred relational technique. Whilst trans people were asked about domestic abuse, each participant provided narratives about their experience of abuse in public; with each constituting hate crime. Four narratives have been purposely selected to illuminate the workings of cisgenderism in relation to hate crime. This paper adds new insight and problematizes the entrenched nature of normative and dominant discourses about gender identity and practice.
 Key Take Away Points  
 Trans people experience many forms of discrimination and social exclusion in everyday life; including hate crime.   Trans-related hate crime is hidden and significantly under-reported.   Hate crime intersects with transphobia (the irrational dislike of trans people) or cisgenderism (a prejudicial ideology based on notions of gender normativity).

T1  - The "words inside": "Disabled" Voices in Contemporary Literature for Young People
AN  - 1906351332
AB  - The article explores recently published coming of age texts for young people using a range of lenses to focus on the real and fictional "disabled" voices that articulate their right to societal inclusion. The stuttered, cleft-lipped, and autistic words of the protagonists are considered for the ways in which they dramatize the experiences and effects of linguistic ableism as well as authorial messages that may counter or uphold this form of discrimination.

T1  - Multicultural experiences reduce prejudice through personality shifts in Openness to Experience
AN  - 1891309318
AB  - Across two studies we test the prediction that multicultural experiences reduce intercultural prejudice by increasing Openness to Experience. In Study 1, frequency of self-reported multicultural experiences was associated with greater openness and less ethnic prejudice, and openness explained the relationship between multicultural experiences and ethnic prejudice. In Study 2, we experimentally manipulated a multicultural experience. Compared to those in a control condition, participants exposed to the cultural members and elements of foreign cultures reported being higher in Openness to Experience and expressed less prejudice toward these cultural groups. There was also some evidence that multicultural exposure, through openness, caused secondary transfer effects in prejudice reduction. Our findings suggest that exposure to multicultural environments can improve intercultural attitudes by personality shifts in Openness to Experience.

T1  - Emotional reactions to the French colonization in Algeria: The normative nature of collective guilt: Information sur les Sciences Sociales
AN  - 1844777412
AB  - Fifty years after the end of the Algerian war of independence, French colonization in Algeria (1830-1962) is still a very controversial topic when sporadically brought to the forefront of the public sphere. One way to better understand current intergroup relationships between French of French origin and French with Algerian origins is to investigate how the past influences the present. This study explores French students' emotional reactions to this historical period, their ideological underpinnings and their relationship with the willingness to compensate for past misdeeds, and with prejudice. Results show that French students with French ascendants endorse a no-remorse norm when thinking about past colonization of Algeria and express very low levels of collective guilt and moral-outrage related emotions, especially those students with a right-wing political orientation and a national identification in the form of glorification of the country. These group-based emotions are significantly related to pro-social behavioral intentions (i.e. the willingness to compensate) and to prejudice toward the outgroup.

T1  - Radicalisation theories, policing practices, and "the future of terrorism?"
AN  - 1825570429
AB  - This article explores how theories of radicalisation have placed an emphasis on the development of an indicators-based approach to identify individuals who might engage in politically motivated violence. We trace how policing agencies have juxtaposed the search for indicators as a defence against criticisms of racial profiling. However, through an analysis of Canadian counter-terrorism training programmes, we demonstrate that the search for radicalisation indicators reaffirms pre-emptive and discriminatory security practices. We insist that despite efforts to theorise radicalisation outside of the practices of the "war on terror", current trends risk rationalising prejudicial policing that affirms social exclusion and injustice.

T1  - Public Stigma against People with Mental Illness in Jimma Town, Southwest Ethiopia
AN  - 1844333314
AB  - Background 
Stigma towards people with mental illness (PWMI) can result in low self-esteem and isolation and threaten employment. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the magnitude of public stigma against PWMI and factors associated with it among Jimma town residents.
 Methods 
A community-based, cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted in adult residents of Jimma town. Data were collected among 820 randomly selected residents with the interviewer-administered Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill (CAMI) scale. Linear regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of stigma against PWMI.
 Result 
A total of 444 (54%) of the 820 respondents were females, and the mean (SD) age was 35 (8.5) years. The minimum and maximum possible values on each CAMI subscale were 10 and 50, respectively. The respondents had high scores for a stigmatizing attitude towards PWMI across all the subscales, as indicated by the mean (SD) scores: authoritarianism, 27.17 (4.96); social restrictiveness, 32.41 (4.20); benevolence, 35.34 (4.42); and community-based mental health ideology, 33.95 (5.82). Compared to housewives, private organization employees showed more autocratic and socially restrictive views (std. β = 1.12, P<0.01). Single people had a lower social restrictiveness stigma score than married people (std. β = -0.20, P<0.001), and participants’ academic levels correlated inversely with the stigma score (std. β = -0.12, P<0.001). A higher benevolence stigma score was observed among participants with no relationship with PWMI than among those with PWMI in their neighborhood (std. β = 0.08, P< 0.046).
 Conclusion 
The study revealed that a negative attitude towards PWMI is widespread. Therefore, there is a need to develop strategies to fight the stigma attached to PWMI at the community level.

T1  - Bruised but not broken: De Lange v Presiding Bishop of the Methodist Church of Southern Africa and Another 2016 (2) SA 1 (CC)
AN  - 1923800682
AB  - The fight for gender equality affects women's rights in society (socially, economically, politically and spiritually) to practise their choice of faith without prejudice. The church as an important non-secular institution that influences everyday beliefs and practices, not least gender equality and attitudes to sexual difference, has been slow to question the consequences of gender discrimination. In particular the idea that tolerance of homophobic prejudice is acceptable or normative can be widely criticised. In many cases churches demonstrate a patriarchal, heteronormative attitude which denies the right to belonging and spiritual freedom to sexual minorities. While the post-apartheid state does not allow discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and has extended the rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex (LGBTI) persons to marry the spouses of their own choice, non-secular organisations actively use religious and other grounds to continue the practice of exclusion. This article discusses leadership in the church and the right to marry one's partner of choice in the case of Reverend Ecclesia De Lange. De Lange, a self-identified lesbian, lost her job in the Methodist Church when she announced that she planned to get married. De Lange resolved to rectify the injustice meted out to her in pursuance of her chosen vocation and raised her constitutional right to equality and dignity and her right to keep her religious beliefs intact. The article looks at how De Lange was confronted by church rules which were used to question her conduct and dismiss her, and her opposition to the church's decision. The complicity of the church in reproducing discrimination and homophobia is questioned and serves to demonstrate that religion, gender and job security intersect in multiple and complex ways. The article argues there is a need to be attentive to the difficulties faced by women who belong to religious organisations who endeavour to navigate through the complexities of religious freedom and sexual difference. The church constitutes part of the problem when it requires conformity to heteronormativity, effectively marginalising and othering those who do not conform. De Lange was penalised for being open about her sexual orientation to the church. She argued that the church should be an integral part of the solution by accepting and serving the spiritual needs of LGBTI persons rather than holding what she saw as double standards.

In an exploratory comprehensive study of this phenomenon, we conducted 12 focus groups with 57 individuals: four groups composed of heterosexual women, four composed of heterosexual men, and four composed of mixed-gender sexual minorities. In this article, we present our findings on participant conceptions of heterosexual marking that are related to gender stereotypes, gender differences, and gender inequality. Much of the heterosexual marking described by our participants reflects and reinforces stereotypes that equate gender conformity and heterosexuality. Our data suggest that heterosexual marking by men/boys and women/girls differs in several ways, including gender conformity, sexual prejudice, extent of marking, and types of marking. Furthermore, some aspects and types of heterosexual marking described by our participants reflect and reinforce gender inequality. As a result, our discussion notes some problematic implications of the heterosexual marking we describe, including rendering gender non-conformity among heterosexuals invisible and unacceptable, supporting discrimination against gender non-conformity, and more directly reinforcing gender inequality.

T1  - Hijra Communities of Delhi
AN  - 1807662748
AB  - This article explores Hijra communities, attempts to understand what it means to take on the Hijra role, and describes the process involved in becoming a Hijra. It is based on an ethnographic study of the Hijras living in Delhi, India and investigates the birth of a Hijra as a social body. The Hijra community has always been on the fringes of society, dwelling in abject poverty and excluded from the process of normalization. Being victims of various forms of prejudices and intolerance, the Hijra community lives in fear and isolation, often in clandestine, ghettoized locations. The problems confronting these groups of people have not been adequately explored, primarily as a result of the hidden nature of the community. By addressing exclusionary practices, the article draws out intersections between identity politics and the reproduction of social difference triggered by existing inequalities and inequities of class, gender and sexuality.

T1  - Attachment and prejudice: The mediating role of empathy
AN  - 1796451718
AB  - In two studies, we examined the novel hypothesis that empathy is a mechanism through which the relationship between attachment patterns and prejudice can be explained. Study 1 examined primed attachment security (vs. neutral prime), empathy, and prejudice towards immigrants. Study 2 examined primed attachment patterns (secure, avoidant, anxious), empathy subscales (perspective taking, empathic concern, personal distress), and prejudice towards Muslims. Across both studies, empathy mediated the relationship between primed attachment security and low prejudice levels. The findings suggest that enhancing felt security and empathic skills in individuals high in attachment-avoidance may lead to reduced prejudice.

T1  - Prejudice in person memory: Self-threat biases memories of stigmatized group members
AN  - 1782205211
AB  - The present research investigated whether self-threat biases memory via retrieval-induced forgetting. Results show that people under self-threat whose goal is to restore their self-worth by making prejudicial judgments that deprecate others are more likely to exhibit an enhanced RIF effect for positive items and a reduced RIF for negative items ascribed to a stereotyped target (i.e., homosexual). Overall, the present findings are consistent with the view that motivation can affect the magnitude of RIF effects in person memory and that, in turn, they can serve as mechanisms for justifying desired conclusions.

T1  - Cutting Gordian Knots: Reducing Prejudice Through Attachment Security
AN  - 1725035918
AB  - The positive role of secure attachment in reducing intergroup biases has been suggested in prior studies. We extend this work by testing the effects of secure attachment primes on negative emotions and aggressive behaviors toward outgroup members across four experiments. Results from Studies 1A and 1B reveal that secure attachment prime, relative to neutral, can reduce negative outgroup emotions. In addition, Studies 1B and 3 results rule out positive mood increase as an alternative explanation for the observed effects. Results from Studies 2 and 3 reveal that secure attachment primes can reduce aggressive behavior toward an outgroup member. The effect of secure attachment primes on outgroup harm was found to be fully mediated by negative emotions in Studies 2 and 3. An interaction between secure attachment primes and ingroup identification in Study 2 indicated that the positive effects of secure attachment in reducing outgroup harm may be especially beneficial for highly identified ingroup members.

T1  - How Women of Color Detect and Respond to Multiple Forms of Prejudice
AN  - 1719468151
AB  - The processes by which women of color and White women living in the United States detect and respond to prejudice may differ because women of color experience racism, sexism and intersectional bias. This review builds on past research by articulating how existing process models of stigmatization, when applied to the stigmatization of women of color, leave important research questions unanswered. Stigmatized individuals' interpretations of and responses to others' behaviors are continuously shaped by the possibility that they will be targeted by prejudice. In each interaction in which prejudice is plausible, targets first determine whether they have experienced prejudice and, if so, they cope with the psychological and emotional consequences of prejudiced treatment. Current theories of stigmatization best account for the experiences of people who face only one form of prejudice. In contrast, we consider how women of color, who possess multiple stigmatized identities, respond to the multiple forms of prejudice they face. First, we identify barriers to including women of color in stigma research. Second, we describe research examining how targets with one stigmatized identity detect, respond to and cope with prejudice. Third, we draw on related research on multiple identities in areas outside of the stigma literature (e.g., intergroup bias, cognition) to raise questions that are important to address in future stigma research. Our analysis is supported primarily by research conducted in the U. S. Addressing the research questions raised in this review will position the stigma literature to more readily capture the stigmatizing experiences of women of color.

T1  - The Pernicious Problem of Ageism
AN  - 1750054801
AB  - If you are not already part of a group disadvantaged by prejudice, just wait a couple of decades -- you will be. Unlike all other prejudices, ageism is relevant to every person fortunate enough to make it beyond a sixth decade of life. Unlike the attention focused on other prejudices, however, ageism has been poorly studied and rarely confronted. Until recently, little was known about its origins and consequences. This is a staggering statistic when considering the ubiquitous nature of ageism. In one study, 70% of older adults surveyed reported that they had been insulted or mistreated on the basis of their age. In a survey of eighty-four people, ages 60 and older, nearly 80% of respondents reported experiencing ageism. With this baseline of understanding, the Frame- Works Institute has begun to investigate language -- a new frame, so to speak -- that expands the public's willingness to more productively engage with older adult issues and opportunities.

T1  - Developing a Research Agenda to Combat Ageism
AN  - 1750054649
AB  - The workplace, the healthcare industry, and scientific research are three areas that could benefit from interventions aimed at breaking down -- and eliminating -- ageism. As the US undergoes a transformation from a young to an old society, it is essential we address the problems individuals face as they age, and prepare for the opportunities longer lives afford. In light of the speed with which the world is aging, Americans are moving too slowly on both fronts. They argue that ageism is largely the crux of the problem. Widespread pessimism about the inevitability of age-related decline held by individuals, policy makers, and even the scientific community divert attention away from potentially solvable problems and reduce the likelihood that longer lives lived will improve quality of life at all ages. The presence of substantial numbers of older people offers societies a resource that has never before existed -- millions of experienced, wise, older citizens who are healthier and better educated than any previous generation.

T1  - What Determines Religious and Racial Prejudice in Europe? The Effects of Religiosity and Trust
AN  - 1735655095; 201538189
AB  - This paper analyzes the effects of different dimensions of religiosity and trust on religious and racial prejudice in Europe. The sample is based on 37 European countries that are current or potential members of the European Union (EU). Using multi-level logistic regression modeling and the latest wave from the European Values Study data, we test the effects of both individual and country-level variables. Our results suggest that religious particularism is correlated with more religious and racial prejudice. Doctrinal belief and individual spirituality are both correlated with less religious prejudice only. Nonreligious individuals have the highest religious prejudice compared to members of religious denominations. Individual and country-level generalized trust, as well as trust in the EU, are all negatively correlated with religious and racial prejudice. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Interests, Values, and Geopolitics: The Global Public Opinion on China
AN  - 1718067908; 201531349
AB  - The essay discusses the public opinion surveys on the rise of China in the United States, Asia and Latin America since 2010, conducted by Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Duke University's collaborative research team headed by the author. It examines the world public recognition of China's growing influence, their attitudes toward China's influence, and reactions to the 'China Model' and impressions of China's political, economic, social, and cultural development. These assessments of China's domestic issues or internal behavior show not only the amount of information and knowledge that the people in various countries know about China, but the intrinsic value judgments and ideological biases that influence their perceptions of China. The essay argues that the rise of China is a complicated phenomenon with a multifarious nature, including material dimensions, such as military power, economic development, and technological innovation, as well as ideational dimensions, such as perception, understanding, or prejudice. Public opinion, attitudes and perceptions of China's rise are the outcome of dynamic interactions and assemblage of factors, a synergy of material interests, ideational and emotional reactions, and values, ideologies, principles, unraveling themselves against a highly volatile, precarious and contentious geopolitical backdrop, in which the interests of nation-states and individuals became all intertwined and inseparable.

T1  - On Building Better Mousetraps and Understanding the Human Condition: Reflections on Big Data in the Social Sciences
AN  - 1679033464
AB  - Over the past few years, we have seen the emergence of "big data": disruptive technologies that have transformed commerce, science, and many aspects of society. Despite the tremendous enthusiasm for big data, there is no shortage of detractors. This article argues that many criticisms stem from a fundamental confusion over goals: whether the desired outcome of big data use is "better science" or "better engineering." Critics point to the rejection of traditional data collection and analysis methods, confusion between correlation and causation, and an indifference to models with explanatory power. From the perspective of advancing social science, these are valid reservations. I contend, however, that if the end goal of big data use is to engineer computational artifacts that are more effective according to well-defined metrics, then whatever improves those metrics should be exploited without prejudice. Sound scientific reasoning, while helpful, is not necessary to improve engineering. Understanding the distinction between science and engineering resolves many of the apparent controversies surrounding big data and helps to clarify the criteria by which contributions should be assessed.

T1  - The Downside of Being Up: A New Look at Group Relative Gratification and Traditional Prejudice
AN  - 1671990783
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Relative Deprivation and Justice Research              In two experiments, we examine the moderating effect of the legitimacy and the stability of the advantaged in-group status on the relationship between measures of group relative gratification (GRG) and traditional prejudice among members of a structurally advantaged group. In Study 1, 133 participants learned that their advantaged in-group status was based on legitimate or illegitimate grounds. As expected, when participants learned of the legitimate status of their in-group, GRG was associated with the endorsement of traditional prejudice. In Study 2, 188 participants learned that their advantaged in-group status was expected to remain stable or to fluctuate. As predicted, when participants were alerted to the decline in the privileged status of the in-group, GRG was positively associated with traditional prejudice. These findings illuminate the ways in which members of advantaged groups perpetuate intergroup inequities and point to a fuller, more nuanced conceptualization of system stability.

T1  - Preference for consistency and value dissimilarities in dehumanization and prejudice toward asylum seekers in Australia
AN  - 1700676275; 201524984
AB  - Recent research has highlighted the importance of differential attribution of uniquely human characteristics in dehumanization and prejudice. Relatively little is known, however, about the importance of perceiving dissimilarities between the ingroup and outgroup in different types of values (beyond prosocial values), or the role of preference for consistency (PFC). This study investigated values, perceived dissimilarities in values, and PFC, in dehumanization of and prejudice toward asylum seekers in Australia. Results from a survey of 140 Australians revealed a strong relationship between dehumanization and prejudice. Individuals with stronger conservation and self-enhancement values, and greater perceived dissimilarity to asylum seekers on self-transcendence and self-enhancement values, dehumanized asylum seekers more and were more prejudiced toward them. The relationships between perceived self-transcendence and self-enhancement dissimilarities and prejudice were mediated by dehumanization, whereas PFC moderated the relationship between conservation value differences and dehumanization. These findings offer important insight into the conditions that promote dehumanization and prejudice, which may in turn help explain the negative perceptions of asylum seekers in Australia.

T1  - Commentary: Encouraging Confrontation
AN  - 1667950940; 201513064
AB  - Sexism differs from other prejudices due to intimate interdependence between the sexes, requiring gender-specific research on effective ways to confront sexist behavior. Two central themes emerge from the current issue: (i) who can confront sexism successfully and (ii) how organizations and leaders should intervene. The burden to confront often falls on female targets, who experience social costs for doing so, especially when perpetrators have greater power. Targets therefore need allies, including men, who are not perceived as having self-interested motives for confronting. Organizations-through leaders and policies-represent the most important and effective allies. Organizational priorities can determine whether female targets suffer in silence or are empowered to confront. Fortunately, there is increasing popular interest, both among women and organizations, to address barriers to women's advancement. This special issue represents an important first step, outlining promising strategies for confronting sexism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Discipline or Prejudice? Overrepresentation of Minority Students in Disciplinary Alternative Education Programs
AN  - 1621771890
AB  - The study seeks to determine the underlying factors contributing to the overrepresentation of minorities in school disciplinary programs. Data from 207 Disciplinary Alternative Education Programs (DAEPs) in Texas are analyzed. The data represent more than 62 % of the student population of Texas school districts. Results support the hypothesis that the 'whiteness' of school district undesirably affects the overrepresentation of Black students (but not Hispanic students) in DAEP. Overrepresentation of Black students in disciplinary programs is significantly higher in urban school districts than in rural districts. The findings, however, add a new layer of complexity to the debate on the overrepresentation of minorities in disciplinary programs. This is because not only White school districts are more likely than other districts to exercise their discretionary authority to punish minorities but they also more frequently subject their minority students to mandatory disciplines that are well defined by the state. Plausible explanations of such overrepresentation is offered for future research. Neither wealth nor the districts' type (urban, suburban, rural and mid-size) have been found to have significant impact on discretionary or mandatory disciplinary actions against minority students.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A Social Psychological Perspective on the Achievement Gap in Standardized Test Performance between White and Minority Students: Implications for Assessment
AN  - 1684189644
AB  - This article addresses the issue of standardized test performance gaps, and academic achievement gaps more generally, between White and minority students. While many explanatory frameworks can be applied to this issue. This article specifically examines the issue from the perspective of social psychology, which examines how individual psychology is affected by social interactions and groups. This article reviews now classic research on attributional ambiguity as well as stereotype and identity threat as potential precursors to academic disengagement, disidentification, and disenfranchisement. Overall, this research suggests that academic performance and achievement are as much influenced by cognitive processes, as they are by relational processes, and that concerns about discrimination and being the target of prejudice serve to undermine students performance. Newer assessment tools that do not rely on biased assessments are presented and discussed.

T1  - Subordination in Home Service Jobs: Comparing Providers of Home-Based Child Care, Elder Care, and Cleaning in France
AN  - 1738477302; 201539405
AB  - Home-based service jobs have developed considerably across Western societies. In fact, chances are high that a working-class woman in France today will, at some point in her life, be a house cleaner, home-based child care provider, or home aide for the elderly. Going against political, scholarly, and everyday discourses that, saturated with the double prejudices of gender and class, treat all these home service occupations, which require little prior training, the same, this article illuminates the variability of the forms of subordination experienced by women practicing these occupations in France. Comparing these jobs with the ensemble of low-skill jobs and with each other exposes what is specific to the particular form of subordination each job type entails, in terms of the extent of job supervision and the nature of the home where it is practiced, the presence or absence of relations with coworkers and/or a 'public,' and the nature of this 'public.' It mobilizes nationwide statistical data in a new way to shift attention to these numerous ordinary work situations, which are much less studied than those of the domestic workers of the wealthiest cities of the Western world.

T1  - Older people as co-researchers: a collaborative journey
AN  - 1559005339; 201433981
AB  - In recent years there has been a distinguishable trend towards user involvement in ageing research. Researchers and policy makers both are increasingly convinced that user involvement is necessary to adapt research questions and methods to meet the needs of older people. Little is known, however, about the quality of collaborations between older people and researchers. This study systematically evaluates a collaboration undertaken between two academic researchers and three older people acting as co-researchers in an effort to identify the conditions required for equal collaboration. To evaluate the collaboration the co-researchers and academic researchers took part in individual in-depth interviews (after six months) and two reflection meetings (after six and 12 months). Throughout the collaboration, field notes were taken by both academic researchers and co-researchers. A detailed description of the collaboration is provided here, using the metaphor of a journey to illustrate the dynamics and the learning process of the participants. Interim reflection meetings -- at which mutual expectations were expressed along with a frank discussion of prejudices, tasks and role divisions, and the sharing of personal and project-related needs and information -- were found to be fruitful in achieving a positive working relationship and fostering an effective collaboration. We conclude that a learning perspective on participation can be a resource for learning and adaptive change. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Quality Controlled: An Ethnographic Account of Tea Party Messaging and Action
AN  - 1559006867; 201432780
AB  - What strategies do Tea Party movement organizers use to achieve frame alignment, that is, uniformity of grievance, purpose, and action, with their participants? Evidence to answer this question is gathered from a year-length participant-observation case study of one city-based Tea Party organization, primarily through the meetings of its localized grassroots chapters. Principal findings are that Tea Party organizers employ quality control of off-message grievances, for example, abortion, as well as any action or communication that would or could be perceived as racially prejudicial, or otherwise inflammatory. Formally, these findings demonstrate the influence of organizational hierarchy on grassroots practice. Substantively, they demonstrate the complex relationship between a broader conservative ideological repertoire as empirically deployed by participants, and the more focused frame alignment attempts of a particular social movement organization. In short, the findings elucidate the importance of interaction and organizational structure as they influence social movement messaging and action. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Changing prejudiced attitudes by thinking about persuasive messages: implications for resistance
AN  - 1520822028
AB  - This research showed that changing attitudes toward stigmatized groups can result from both the simple processes that require little thinking and the traditional elaborative forms of persuasion that require high thinking processes. Importantly, even when the obtained attitude change was equivalent for situations in which there was high and low message elaboration, the changes produced in high thinking conditions were found to be more resistant to further attacks than equivalent changes produced by less thoughtful mechanisms. Not only were those attitudes more resistant as measured objectively (Study 1) but participants also perceived their attitudes to be subjectively more resistant (Study 2). These studies suggest that examining the processes by which prejudice is changed can be important for understanding the consequences and long-term implications of treatments and campaigns oriented to changing attitudes toward stigmatized groups.

T1  - Socio-cultural influences on the transmission of HIV among gay men in rural China
AN  - 1559007244; 201433596
AB  - Bisexual behaviours are relatively common among men who have sex with men in China. This pilot study aims to reveal the complex processes through which such men manage their sexuality, family responsibilities and sexual behaviours in a rural Chinese setting. A total of 15 men who have sex with men were recruited by purposive sampling. Face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted to explore participants' views about their sexual experiences and practices. The Chinese traditional moral code, family values and gender roles that form the crucial components of Confucianism were reflected in the participants' efforts to maintain familial and social harmony through a compromised form of sexual partnership. Most study participants demonstrated a mixed experience of social stigma, sexual naivete and ignorance of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Under cultural and family pressure, men who have sex with men entered heterosexual marriages with the intention of maintaining a balance between their collectivist (familial) obligations and their individualistic (same-sex sexual) desires. However, the opaque nature of their concurrent sexual relationships may endanger their personal health and accelerate HIV and STI transmission. Reducing the stigma and social prejudice associated with male same-sex sexual relations is essential for any culturally sensitive HIV-prevention programme to succeed in rural China.

T1  - Octavio Paz's India
AN  - 1559007196; 201432533
AB  - Third World citizens have the unique difficulty of attempting to self-define as a community independent of colonial Orientalism. This paper explores the emergence of Third World Orientalism, where the people of underdeveloped states are themselves the perpetrators. It critiques scholars' description of Third World interactions, which simultaneously dismiss the impact of intra-orientalist prejudices as non-existent, unimportant or benign. The use of Paz's exploration of Indian identity illustrates how the benefit of being even a nuanced, cosmopolitan intellectual was also an alienating weakness in trying to conceive what it meant to be a member of the developing world. Using Paz as a prism, Indians became subject not only to evolving historical circumstances, but also the personal evolution of individuals who studied them. The instability created by these fluctuations made identity inherently paradoxical. Paz creatively conciliated these paradoxes by ultimately embracing them. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Anyone Can Be an Illegal': Color-Blind Ideology and Maintaining Latino/Citizen Borders
AN  - 1886689362
AB  - Previous research has shown that nativist ideology racializes nonwhite immigrants, but little research has looked at how color-blind racist discourse shapes how people accomplish this while maintaining a race-neutral identity. This study examines how online discussion forum participants of an anti-immigrant organization in the United States use color-blind racist discourse. The qualitative analysis of 200 threads (2,168 posts) shows that forum participants use the color-blind discursive tactic of diminishing the importance of race through rhetoric of legality, cultural racism, and reverse racism. This rhetoric frees forum participants to conflate illegal, criminal, and Hispanic. This neutralizes contradictions in their claims of a race-neutral stance, which is most evident in their discussions of Puerto Rico whereby participants reinforce a dichotomy between citizen and Latino. While color-blind racism has been used to explain race relations between white and nonwhite citizens, this research shows how the ideology extends to include nonwhite immigrants.

T1  - Service in the Lion's Den: Jews in the Russian Army in the First World War
AN  - 1700675305; 201524751
AB  - Starting in 1827, Russia's Jews were subject to general conscription. In the army, however, they were not welcome. Jews were considered unreliable and only limitedly combat worthy. With the start of the First World War, this prejudice became all the more evident. Numerous Jewish soldiers were executed as suspected saboteurs or spies. Many Jews nonetheless linked associated wartime deployment with hopes for an improvement in their social standing. However, the patriotic enthusiasm that had also embraced Jewish circles at the start of the war soon collapsed again. The officer's career path and certain decorations continued to be denied to Jews, no matter how courageously they might have fought. This changed only after the October Revolution. During the Civil War, many leading positions in the Red Army were occupied by Jews who had been soldiers in the tsarist army. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - When Actions Speak Louder Than Words: Preventing Discrimination of Nonstandard Speakers
AN  - 1504424509; 201406703
AB  - Prejudice against a social group may lead to discrimination of members of this group. One very strong cue of group membership is a (non)standard accent in speech. Surprisingly, hardly any interventions against accent-based discrimination have been tested. In the current article, we introduce an intervention in which what participants experience themselves unobtrusively changes their evaluations of others. In the present experiment, participants in the experimental condition talked to a confederate in a foreign language before the experiment, whereas those in the control condition received no treatment. Replicating previous research, participants in the control condition discriminated against Turkish-accented job candidates. In contrast, those in the experimental condition evaluated Turkish- and standard-accented candidates as similarly competent. We discuss potential mediating and moderating factors of this effect.

T1  - Pride and Prejudice: Gay Rights and Religious Moderation in Belfast
AN  - 1993524610
AB  - In the summer of 2008, a Northern Irish politician began publicly denouncing homosexuality. Her remarks galvanized responses from a broad range of groups and individuals. New voices joined the discussion of LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) civil rights, including trade unions and political parties that had previously been silent. Notably, some Christian churches expressed their support for gay rights by participating in Belfast's annual LGBT Pride Festival. Since 2008, long-standing opponents of gay rights have modulated their critiques. This article draws upon ethnographic research with Belfast's Pride Festival to examine religious groups' increasing support for LGBT rights since 2008. I describe this engagement as a practice of moderation in terms of its social and political effects. Here, moderation is conceived not in spatial terms as a position between opposed poles, but as a discursive practice that transforms political and religious debates. Drawing from Bakhtin's (1981) concept of ‘dialogism’, I consider how these discussions of Christianity, sexuality and politics unfolded. A Bakhtinian approach to the production and reception of these debates reveals how moderation is socially and historically situated. Moderation is practised in relation to particular conditions and histories, yet has the potential to transform them.

T1  - Mobilising 'Minutemen': Predicting Public Support for Anti-Immigration Activism in the United States
AN  - 1926267215
AB  - Advances in social movement research conceptualise micromobilisation as - at least - a two-step sequential process in which willingness to participate must first be generated and then translated into actual participation. However, such research often ignores a more fundamental first step in this process: the generation of movement support. I address this gap by drawing on a nationally representative sample of adults in the United States - who either sympathised with or opposed anti-immigration activism - to identify individual attributes differentiating anti-immigration movement supporters and non-supporters. Perceptions of economic threat, waning confidence in political leadership, and prejudicial cultural beliefs about Latinos represent attributes differentiated movement supporters from non-supporters. Power devaluation theory is used as an overarching framework to meaningfully interpret these results. More generally, I argue that grievances play an important, yet under theorised role in jumpstarting conservative micromobilisation and that principles from power devaluation theory can help us understand the differentiation of movement support, irrespective of a social movement's political orientation.

T1  - Disgust facilitates outgroup dehumanization
AN  - 1504423769; 201405293
AB  - Outgroup dehumanization figures centrally in historical intergroup violence, yet little is known about the factors that promote dehumanized perceptions of others. Drawing on research highlighting the importance of disgust-relevant social categorizations and disgust sensitivity to outgroup dehumanization, the authors hypothesized that feelings of disgust causally facilitate dehumanized social cognition. To test this hypothesis, participants (N = 94) were randomly assigned to receive inductions of disgusted, sad, or neutral emotions. We then assessed their implicit associations between animals and an arbitrary outgroup created with a minimal-groups procedure. Results showed that although all participants demonstrated dehumanizing biases, disgusted participants showed the strongest associations between the outgroup and animals (and the ingroup with humanity). Participants in the sad and neutral groups did not differ. Disgust thus appears to have the unique capacity to foster the social-cognitive dehumanization of outgroup members.

T1  - Prevent-ing Muslimness in Britain: The Normalisation of Exceptional Measures to Combat Terrorism
AN  - 1475258351
AB  - This paper argues that the Prevent strand of the British counter-terrorism strategy (CONTEST) and the related normalisation of exceptional measures to combat terrorism have had a significant impact on the ways in which Muslim communities can play out their Muslimness in Britain. State treatment of Muslims as a suspect community facilitates the (re)production of widespread Islamophobia that penetrates the social fabric and reinforces a popular image of Muslims as folk devils of late modernity. Those Muslims who exhibit popularly understood signifiers of their identity (e.g.: skin colour, beard, hijab) risk becoming an easy, immediate target for state discrimination and social prejudice. After exploring how this vicious cycle is produced and reproduced at both the macro-(state) level and the meso/micro (community and individual) level, some tentative recommendations will be provided. These recommendations advocate for: preventative measures that are grounded on bottom-up approaches and that are able to empower Muslim communities; the promotion of a better, more nuanced understanding of Islam within broader society; and a reflection on the philosophical ideas of difference and diversity as they relate to the coexistence of pluralistic, multi-ethnic communities within post-modern, global societies.

T1  - Religiosity and Prejudice: Different Patterns for Two Types of Religious Internalization
AN  - 1559005075; 201431767
AB  - The literature on the relationship between religiosity and prejudice has shown inconsistent findings. We argue that it is necessary to distinguish between different types of religiosity and that its relationship with prejudice is mediated by different values. Results of two studies conducted in Italy show that identified religiosity and introjected religiosity predict different levels of prejudice toward Muslim immigrants. Moreover, the negative relationship between identified religiosity and prejudice was mediated by prosocial values, whereas valuing conformity mediated the positive relationship between introjected religiosity and prejudice. The results show that it is possible to better understand the relationship between religiosity and prejudice by disentangling the different ways of being religious. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Categories We Share': Mobilising Common In-groups in Discourse on Contemporary Immigration in Greece
AN  - 1429639919; 201335620
AB  - Prejudice reduction has been an important concern within social psychology both in theory and applied research. According to the premises of Social Identity Theory, redrawing of the category boundaries is often considered a necessary step in order to battle prejudice, because in-group favouritism when the category boundaries change is diffused to the previously distinct identities. The present paper offers a review of the relevant research, and following a discourse analytic perspective argues that recategorisation can also be viewed as a rhetorical resource that people use in verbal interaction in order to achieve certain rhetorical ends. This point is exemplified using interview data from Greece with Greek participants who mobilise common in-groups between themselves and the immigrants in Greece. Different common in-groups were mobilised on the basis of common human nature, common ethnic descent and through the use of the common experience of migration that many Greek people have because Greece has been an emigrant sending country for the biggest part of the 20th century. Occasionally, these category constructions were used to differentiate between immigrants of different ethnic descent claiming that only certain immigrant groups can integrate to Greek society, whereas on other instances, these common in-groups were used in order to inoculate speakers of accusations of prejudice.

T1  - Systematic review of instruments measuring homophobia and related constructs
AN  - 1427817633
AB  - Since its conceptualization, the construct of homophobia has been the subject of many speculations about its specificity, reach, and possibility of empirical assessment. Several instruments have been created aiming to measure the prejudice against homosexuals. Peer-reviewed articles of studies using measures to assess homophobia and related constructs were systematically reviewed in 4 databases (Medline, PsycINFO, ERIC, JSTOR). The articles were classified as they displayed evidence of the instrument's validity, reliability, or both. Finally, the instruments were rated according to that evidence. Out of 1076 results, 115 studies between 1993 and 2010 were identified as relevant. Those studies used 47 different instruments. This review focused in 5 instruments that concentrated the majority of the citations. Psychometric properties were acceptable.

T1  - Age-Related Differences in Ethnic Prejudice: Evidence of the Mediating Effect of Right-Wing Attitudes
AN  - 1512220252; 201408648
AB  - The present study revealed age-related differences in ethnic prejudice in a heterogeneous (total N=1,308) and a representative (N=800) sample, using measures of blatant and subtle prejudice. The relationship between age and blatant and subtle prejudice was found to be fully mediated by right-wing social-cultural attitudes (i.e. authoritarianism and cultural conservatism).

T1  - What do I Think of Others in Relation to Myself? Moral Identity and Moral Inclusion in Explaining Prejudice
AN  - 1512218202; 201408692
AB  - The aim of this article is to analyze the effect of moral identity on prejudice in conjunction with moral inclusion/exclusion attitudes. In particular, the hypothesis is that even if high moral identity people tend to be less prejudicial than low moral identity people, this result can be explained with reference to moral inclusion/exclusion attitudes. A questionnaire was distributed to 192 Italian subjects. According to the hypothesis, results show that moral identity is negatively correlated with blatant prejudice, but that this effect is completely mediated by the perception of moral inclusion/exclusion with the other groups. These results suggest that it is not how morally you behave (symbolization), or the relevance you give to moral traits for your identity (internalization), that have an effect on prejudice, but rather it is who you include within the moral community within which moral values apply.

T1  - 'The people know they need religion in order to develop': Religion's Capacity to Inspire People in Pune's Slums
AN  - 1364702726; 201326536
AB  - People's understanding of their own situation, ideas about a better life and strategies for achieving their visions are influenced, among other things, by religious values and beliefs, with implications for the objectives and strategies of state and non-government development actors. Semi-ethnographic research in two slum settlements in Pune, Maharashtra, sought to understand whether and how religion influenced and shaped people's ideas about how to pursue development. The research focused on poor Hindu and Buddhist Dalit communities. Unsurprisingly, the people interviewed linked their lack of social and economic development to caste prejudice. Despite agreement that caste was a barrier to equality, however, different responses to it were expressed. Building upon ideas put forth by Appadurai (2004), we analyse the ways in which people exercise varying forms of non-economic capital to achieve social recognition and equality, which are believed to underpin development more generally. .

T1  - Imagined intergroup contact promotes cooperation through outgroup trust
AN  - 1364700973; 201323148
AB  - The present research aims to investigate whether salience of memberships during imagined contact is necessary for producing generalized positive attitudes toward the outgroup and promoting intergroup cooperation. After a warm-up task that involved reciprocal self-disclosure during the imagined interaction with an outgroup member, we manipulated interpersonal versus intergroup features of imagined contact. Results indicated that participants who imagined a conversation with a Muslim focusing on intergroup differences subsequently reported more positive attitudes and cooperative intentions toward Muslim immigrants compared to either participants who imagined the interaction at the interpersonal level or participants in a control condition. Moreover, these effects were found to be mediated by outgroup trust. These findings attest to the strength of interventions based on imagined intergroup contact and suggest a possible implementation of the technique.

T1  - Relationships and World Peace: A Peace Movement Survey
AN  - 1622296018; 201438890
AB  - This study aims to investigate the role of different levels of relationships (interpersonal, intergroup and international) to promote world peace in accordance with the vision of the participants of the organization / movement Servas International. The frameworks are the studies about interpersonal relationship and Peace Psychology. Its approach is qualitative and the sample consisted of ten of Servas's leaders around the world, centering in providing and analyzing a number of personal contacts which each participant has made through the Servas and the participants' perspective on how interpersonal relationships have affected the international peace. Servas is an international, non-governmental, multicultural peace association run by volunteers in over 100 countries. Founded in 1949 as a peace movement, Servas International is a non-profit organization, working to build understanding, tolerance and world peace. Data were collected through a semi-structured interview, which lasted for about an hour each, and were analyzed by content analysis. Results indicate the importance of interpersonal relationships to world peace, since it starts with contact between two people that can spread their experiences to the groups and to the nations. However this contact must be qualified in the sense that the person should be open to contact to different people of different races, religions, cultures, and countries to overcome prejudices and to break stereotypes.

T1  - Are Liberals Agreeable or Not? Politeness and Compassion Differentially Predict Political Conservatism Via Distinct Ideologies
AN  - 1504423655; 201405379
AB  - Documenting the relationship between Agreeableness and political conservatism has proven elusive. We address this anomaly by showing that two aspects of Agreeableness -- politeness and compassion -- have countervailing relationships with political conservatism through right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO). To test this, we analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of New Zealanders (N = 4,553). Politeness was positively, but compassion was negatively, correlated with political conservatism. Consistent with the differential mediation hypothesis derived from the dual process model of ideology and prejudice, these opposing relationships were differentially mediated by RWA and SDO. This attenuated the bivariate relationship between the higher-order trait of Agreeableness and political conservatism. These results demonstrate the complex relationship between personality and political orientation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Linguistic Description Moderates the Evaluations of Counterstereotypical People
AN  - 1494749235; 201401928
AB  - The present research investigated linguistic description as a moderator of biased evaluations of counterstereotypical individuals. Members of an online participant pool (N = 237) indicated their liking for stereotypical and counterstereotypical individuals who were described using adjectives or behaviors. There was a significant interaction between target typicality and linguistic description: People liked counterstereotypical individuals more than stereotypical individuals when target individuals were described using adjectives. In contrast, they showed no bias or a negative bias against counterstereotypical individuals who were described using behaviors. This interaction effect generalized across gender targets (men/women) and sexuality targets (gay/straight), and it was partially mediated by subjective processing fluency. Implications for the backlash effect and prejudice reduction are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Turning the Lens Inward: Cultural Competence and Providers' Values in Health Care Decision Making
AN  - 1438549557; 201341797
AB  - The population of older adults in the United States is growing in size and diversity, presenting challenges to health care providers and patients in the context of health care decision making (DM), including obtaining informed consent for treatment, advance care planning, and deliberations about end-of-life care options. Although existing literature addresses providers' need to attend to patients' cultural values and beliefs on these issues, less attention has been paid to how the corresponding values and beliefs of providers color the care they deliver and their assessments of older adults' DM capacity. The provider's challenge is to understand her own unacknowledged anxieties, prejudices, and fears around such charged issues as truth telling, individual agency, capacity, death and dying, and the value of life itself and address their impact on the delivery of care. A social constructivist perspective and the clinical concept of cultural countertransference are proposed as aides in achieving this awareness and improving care. . Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Automatically activated facets of ageism: Masked evaluative priming allows for a differentiation of age-related prejudice
AN  - 1373428360; 201328380
AB  - This study investigated the automatic activation of ageism by using a go/no-go version of the masked evaluative priming task. Pictures of younger persons, of older persons in everyday contexts, and of older persons depicting age-related conditions of decline were used as masked primes that preceded positive and negative target adjectives conveying either other-relevant valence (e.g., just and mean) or possessor-relevant valence (e.g., serene and lonely). The evaluative priming effect (denoting relative negativity of old-everyday primes in comparison with younger primes) was significant, as hypothesized, only for possessor-relevant targets. It was not moderated by explicit ageism. A second priming index (denoting relative negativity of old-decline primes in comparison with old-everyday primes) predicted, however, explicit ageism. Again, this result was, as expected, constrained to the index based on possessor-relevant targets. This study provides further evidence that prejudice in terms of automatic evaluations of social stimuli can be more fine grained beyond a mere one-dimensional positive-negative differentiation.

T1  - Islamophobia and Threat Perceptions: Explaining Anti-Muslim Sentiment in the West
AN  - 1188305855
AB  - This article investigates the determinants of anti-Muslim sentiment in the West. Starting from the premise that Islamophobic attitudes are more nuanced than a simple dislike of Muslims, I focus on specific forms of attitudes which link Muslims to violence and terrorism. Data from the Pew Global Attitudes Surveys are used to test three theories: perceived threat, social identity, and cognitive capabilities. A series of logit estimations are used for the empirical analysis of individual level data in the USA, Great Britain, France, Germany, and Spain. The results show that perceived realistic and symbolic threat is the most significant source of Islamophobic attitudes in the West. While individuals cognitively differentiate between general feelings toward Muslims and their specific characteristics, higher levels of education significantly reduces negative sentiments. A good number of Westerners think of Muslims as violent individuals while some believe that they support al-Qaeda. Citizens in the West are more likely to associate Muslims with terrorism if they feel threatened by their physical and cultural existence. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Cricketing Multiculturalism in Caryl Phillips's Playing Away
AN  - 1266146836; 201301548
AB  - This essay explores the critique of 1980s' multiculturalism in Caryl Phillips's 1986 screenplay Playing Away, which depicts a cricket match held between a black British team from Brixton and the well-to-do white villagers of the fictional town of Sneddington. It proceeds by considering Phillips's long-standing commitment to sport as an opportunity where new social and cultural relations can be built which question established prejudices and divisions, captured in the notion of 'sporting tribalry', before turning to a close engagement with the film's key elements. Rather than depict two teams, one black and urban, the other white and rural, at loggerheads both on and off the cricket pitch, Playing Away attends to the many overlappings and similarities shared across communities that are discerned as a way of challenging prevailing models of multicultural difference. Phillips shows how these shared challenges may bring communities together through 'sporting tribalry', where they might learn from each other and move forward from entrenched and divisive notions of difference or 'race relations'. Ultimately, the remoulded model of multiculturalism suggested by Playing Away exists more as a promise than an achieved reality: as is indicated by the vexed cricket match between the teams which forms the climax of the film, the tensions of class, culture, race and gender are not easily erased in the late 1980s.

T1  - Older women and their representations of old age: a qualitative analysis
AN  - 1023779861
AB  - In this article we shall be analyzing the representations of old age and ageing made by three generations of older women with different life stories (single, married, children and childless). Our principal findings, based on a qualitative analysis of 25 in-depth interviews conducted with three generations of older women (65-74, 75-84 and 85 and older), mainly reveal their reluctance and even refusal to define themselves as 'older or elderly women', largely due to persistent stereotypes linking old age to dependency, social isolation and fragility. Aware of the social prejudice regarding women and old age, they reject it unanimously. Older women represent a challenge to these homogenizing preconceptions of old age, which they, on the contrary, experience in a multitude of ways, often enjoyable. Their conceptions of 'ageing well' are diverse and do not correspond to a clinical definition of ageing. Their representations of 'ageing well' and of ageing express positive values of autonomy, independence, consistency and integrity, maintenance of physical and intellectual health, and being socially active so they can 'stay in the swing of things', in the continuum of their lives and future projects, rather breaking with contemporary life or existing on the margins of society.

T1  - Are Stereotypes Relative to Gender Usage Applicable to Virtual Worlds?
AN  - 1417524904; 201335225
AB  - Common stereotypes of virtual game or community users are often portrayed as young and socially inept male addicts. Recent studies, however, defy many of the common prejudices about game or community users. As an extension of recent research, this study looks at gender differences in Virtual Worlds and finds that female users are actually a driving force behind the recent success of online communities. The study results indicate that female users more actively participate in social life, information seeking, and building activities in Virtual Worlds than their male counterparts. Similarly, female users have greater appreciation for the value of Virtual Worlds, although both male and female users recognize Virtual Worlds as a highly useful entertainment tool.

T1  - Engagement enacted: Essentials of initiating an Action Research project
AN  - 1125217983; 201243259
AB  - Engagement is seen as an important characteristic of Action Research. The term is often used to refer to the participation and involvement of the research participants. Within this article we take another angle and explore the concept of engagement in relation to the main Action Researcher. Using an auto-ethnographic approach, we illustrate that the involvement and 'closeness' of the researcher, although necessary within Action Research, can also have a darker side as people have the tendency to get trapped in their own beliefs and prejudices. If not mindful enough of their own involvement and way of being within the context, the researcher can lose him- or herself in the situation and no longer be able to encourage or facilitate the participation of others. We give suggestions for realizing productive engagement as a (participatory) researcher using concepts such as mindfulness and mindsight.

T1  - Collective narcissism and anti-Semitism in Poland
AN  - 1023028885; 201223683
AB  - Two studies examined the relationship between collective narcissism-an emotional investment in an unrealistic belief about the greatness of an in-group (Golec de Zavala, Cichocka, Eidelson, & Jayawickreme, 2009) -- and anti-Semitism in Poland. The results indicate that this relationship is simultaneously mediated by (a) a belief that the in-group is constantly threatened by hostile intentions of other groups (Polish siege beliefs; Bar-Tal & Antebi, 1992a, 1992b) and (b) a belief that the Jews are a particularly threatening out-group because they secretly aim to dominate the world (the conspiracy stereotype of Jews; Bergmann, 2008; Kofta & Sdek, 2005). These results confirm that collective narcissism predicts prejudice against social groups perceived as threatening. Collective narcissists' sensitivity to intergroup threat is composed of beliefs about vulnerability of the in-group and hostility of the out-group.

AB  - The aim of the present article is twofold First, it tests and demonstrates the supplementary use of focus groups to construct quantitatively oriented survey on anti-minority sentiment. Second, it clarifies two major theoretical concepts-prejudice versus perceived threat-in the research on discriminatory attitudes towards minority populations. More specifically, by using data from focus group discussions on foreign workers in Israel, the study examines the use of such groups for measurement of prejudice and perceived threat within the social and cultural context of Israeli society. The analysis of focus group discussions provides adapted questionnaire scales for measuring prejudice and perceived threat. The findings support the premise that prejudice and perceived threat are two distinct theoretical concepts. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 925714299; 201204042
AB  - Two studies (a) explored the role of pervasiveness of discrimination (pervasive vs. rare) in determining targets' responses to discrimination, and (b) examined the extent to which threats to participants' worldview can account, in part, for detrimental effects of pervasive discrimination. As predicted, across both studies, pervasiveness of discrimination moderated the relationship between attributions to prejudice for failure to obtain a job and psychological well-being (depressed affect and state self-esteem). When discrimination was presented as pervasive, attributions to prejudice related to lower state self-esteem and greater depressed affect. When discrimination was portrayed as rare, attributions to prejudice were related to higher state self-esteem and unrelated to depressed affect. Study 2 further showed that being able to affirm the world as just countered the negative consequences of pervasive discrimination, whereas it did not influence responses to discrimination that was perceived as rare.

T1  - Indigeneity and consciousness in Brazil: Analyzing Sousa (1587) and Mendes Jr (1912)
AN  - 1928292127
AB  - This article analyzes understandings of indigeneity and legal consciousness in Brazil in the 16th, early 20th and 21st centuries. The article focuses on the often ignored work of João Mendes Junior, written in 1912, about the indigenous peoples of São Paulo and on Gabriel Soares de Sousa's Tratado descritivo do Brasil em 1587 [A Descriptive Treatise of Brazil in 1587]. Mendes' ideas about race, biology and indigeneity diverge considerably from hegemonic Western theories of racial purity and Social Darwinism, but his contribution has never really been acknowledged. This article argues that theories that better fit the organizing model of the free market have become more hegemonic and widespread. For this reason, social scientists should strive to bring into discussion epistemological alternatives to the hegemonic principles of capitalism, which foster exploitation, destitution and the privatization of public space.

T1  - Evidence of a gene x environment interaction between perceived prejudice and MAOA genotype in the prediction of criminal arrests
AN  - 1037877927; 201234012
AB  - Purpose: The current study builds on a large body of research that has revealed that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of antisocial behaviors. While a number of studies have indicated that stressful environments interact with specific genetic polymorphisms to create antisocial phenotypes, studies have not yet examined whether perceived prejudice and specific genetic polymorphisms combine together to predict criminal arrests over the life course. Methods: The current study builds on the existing gene x environment literature by using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to examine the effects of MAOA and perceived prejudice on the probability of being arrested. Results: The results of the multivariate models reveal a statistically significant gene x environment interaction between MAOA and perceived prejudice in the prediction of arrest for males. Conclusions: The results indicate that the presence of both perceived prejudice and MAOA increase the likelihood of being arrested. The implications of these results are discussed and limitations are noted. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Stigmatization of Patients Suffering from Schizophrenia
AN  - 1030869448; 201229882
AB  - For the general public, but also for healthcare professionals, schizophrenia is still one of those areas of medicine connected with feelings of unease, fear and prejudice. These feelings lead to stigmatization and discrimination which are unjust processes which put patients suffering from mental illnesses into undesirable and unequal positions. Aim of this research was to establish the extent of stigmatization of mentally ill patients among the population of healthcare professionals and future healthcare professionals and if they differ from general population. Results show that stigmatization of schizophrenic patients is high among all included populations. Although there were no statistical differences between groups regarding the assessment of schizophrenic patients, nurses employed in psychiatric wards exhibited a tendency towards higher acceptance of schizophrenic patients, as well as better understanding of that illness. This data emphasizes a growing need for continuous education of general population but also of healthcare professionals. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The integrative prejudice framework and different forms of weight prejudice: An analysis and expansion
AN  - 907929087; 201124516
AB  - We use the integrative prejudice framework to further our understanding of weight prejudice, while simultaneously testing the generalizability of this framework. Participants completed measures of implicit and explicit weight prejudice, egalitarian-based nonprejudicial goals, and perceived weight discrimination. In line with predictions of the integrative prejudice framework based on cognitive consistency principles, implicit and explicit weight prejudice were positively related when nonprejudicial goals were low and perceived discrimination was high, and when nonprejudicial goals were high and perceived discrimination was low, reflecting central components of old-fashioned and modern prejudice, respectively. Furthermore, implicit and explicit weight prejudice were negatively related when nonprejudicial goals and perceived discrimination were both high, reflecting central components of aversive prejudice. In addition to supporting the generalizability of the integrative prejudice framework, this research demonstrates that weight prejudice may operate in different forms that map onto existing theories of prejudice.

T1  - Recent advances in intergroup contact theory
AN  - 872845523
AB  - Recent advances in intergroup contact theory and research are reviewed. A meta-analysis with 515 studies and more than 250,000 subjects demonstrates that intergroup contact typically reduces prejudice (mean r = -.21). Allport's original conditions for optimal contact -- equal status, common goals, no intergroup competition, and authority sanction -- facilitate the effect but are not necessary conditions. There are other positive outcomes of intergroup contact, such as greater trust and forgiveness for past transgressions. These contact effects occur not only for ethnic groups but also for such other groups as homosexuals, the disabled and the mentally ill. Intergroup friendship is especially important. Moreover, these effects typically generalize beyond the immediate outgroup members in the situation to the whole outgroup, other situations, and even to other outgroups not involved in the contact. They also appear to be universal -- across nations, genders, and age groups. The major mediators of the effect are basically affective: reduced anxiety and empathy. And even indirect contact reduces prejudice -- vicarious contact through the mass media and having a friend who has an outgroup friend. Of course, negative contact occurs -- especially when it is non-voluntary and threatening. Criticisms of the theory and policy implications are also discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Behavioral Immune System (and Why It Matters)
AN  - 914767474; 201200121
AB  - Like many other animals, human beings engage in behavioral defenses against infectious pathogens. The behavioral immune system consists of a suite of psychological mechanisms that (a) detect cues connoting the presence of infectious pathogens in the immediate environment, (b) trigger disease-relevant emotional and cognitive responses, and thus (c) facilitate behavioral avoidance of pathogen infection. However, the system responds to an overly general set of superficial cues, which can result in aversive responses to things (including people) that pose no actual threat of pathogen infection. In addition, the system is flexible, such that more strongly aversive responses occur under conditions in which perceivers are (or merely perceive themselves to be) more vulnerable to pathogen infection. Recent research reveals many provocative implications -- for the experience of disgust, for extraversion and social interaction, for xenophobia and other prejudices, and for the origins of cultural differences.

T1  - Secondary transfer effects from imagined contact: Group similarity affects the generalization gradient
AN  - 875716804; 201115251
AB  - An experiment examined the effects of imagining contact with an illegal immigrant on attitudes towards illegal immigrants and subsequent effects of that attitude change on feelings about other groups (secondary transfer). Compared to a condition in which participants imagined negative contact with an illegal immigrant, participants who imagined positive contact reported more positive attitudes concerning illegal immigrants. Using bootstrapped mediation models, effects of positive imagined contact on attitudes towards illegal immigrants were shown to generalize to other groups that were independently ranked as similar to illegal immigrants, but not to dissimilar groups. This generalization gradient effect was relatively large. Implications for theory and practical applications to prejudice reduction are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Mind the Gap: Increasing Associations Between the Self and Blacks With Approach Behaviors
AN  - 919903882; 201201560
AB  - Although perceived differences between outgroup social categories and the self are often cited as a major contributor to prejudice and intergroup tension, surprisingly few studies have examined ways to improve associations between the self and racial outgroups. The present research investigated one strategy to increase these associations -- approach training. Specifically, 3 studies investigated the impact of training participants to conceptually approach Blacks on 3 separate measures: 2 response latency measures indexing the strength of association between the self and Blacks and a psychophysiological measure indexing brain activity in response to Blacks in the context of the self. A fourth study examined the link between earlier research on the impact of approach training on implicit prejudice against Blacks and the current results related to self-Black associations. Together, these findings provided consistent evidence that training in approaching Blacks increases associations between the self and Blacks that in turn reduce implicit prejudice against Blacks.

T1  - Stigma and intimacy in same-sex relationships: A narrative approach.
AN  - 1023026950; 201226038
AB  - Lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals in romantic relationships experience stigma, prejudice, and discrimination stemming from widespread social devaluation of same-sex relationships. Research on same-sex couples has demonstrated a negative association between experiences of stigma and relationship quality. However, critical questions remain unanswered regarding how experiences of stigma become more or less meaningful within the context of same-sex relationships. This paper presents a study of the stories that a purposive sample of 99 individuals in same-sex relationships wrote about their relational high points, low points, decisions, and goals, as well as their experiences of stigma directly related to their relationships. Narrative analysis of these stories revealed that participants utilized several psychological strategies for making meaning of their experiences of stigma within the context of their relationships. Some participants framed stigma as having a negative impact on their relationships, while others framed stigma as relevant, but external to their lives. Some participants saw stigma as providing an opportunity to (re)define notions of commitment and relational legitimacy. Additionally, many participants framed stigma as bringing them closer to their partners and strengthening the bond within their relationships. The results of this study illuminate the psychological strategies individuals in same-sex couples use to make meaning of, cope with, and overcome societal devaluation thereby furthering understandings of the association between stigma and intimacy within marginalized relationships.

T1  - The Future in Inequality
AN  - 1883033771
AB  - Recently an article in Personality and Social Psychology Review urged social psychologists to reacquire their "sociological imagination" and incorporate broader, structural factors in their work. Studies of social inequality in particular seem ripe for this kind of collaboration. Psychological investigations relating to inequality typically center on interpersonal prejudice, stigma, or power relations. The sociological concept of social capital—loosely, benefits derived from social networks—has great relevance to social psychological theories of prejudice and discrimination. Psychologists often conceptualize prejudice as exclusion from ingroup resources and status based on a stigmatized characteristic. Research on the reciprocal relationship between neural and social networks also shows interdisciplinary promise. From this perspective, psychologists and sociologists both can model, for example, the diffusion of stereotypes or racial prejudice in a social system based on assumptions about how people process outgroup information and the likelihood of intergroup interaction. Together, these independent streams of research can jointly develop a structural theory of action that explains how neural and social networks change reciprocally. It is here that the future (understanding) of inequality lies.

T1  - The trouble with assimilation: Social dominance and the emergence of hostility against immigrants
AN  - 822521978; 201072833
AB  - In exploring the "status boundary enforcement hypothesis," Thomsen, Green and Sidanius (2008) theorized and confirmed that Social Dominance Orientation would be more strongly correlated with a general willingness to aggress against immigrants when respondents are primed with an immigrant who is eager to assimilate into the dominant culture than when they are primed with an immigrant who prefers cultural isolation (separation). However, because assimilation differs from separation on both the home culture component and the host culture component, the actual source of this effect remains unclear. By using an assimilation versus integration contrast that differ only on the home culture component, the present study confirmed and extended Thomsen et al.'s findings. We were able to conclude that this counter intuitive effect, at odds with most research in this area, is primarily driven by people with high SDO having more negative reactions to immigrants' willing to abandon their original cultures rather than to immigrants wanting to maintain contact with the host culture. The theoretical implications of these findings are discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Self-Reported Racial Discrimination and Substance Use Among Asian Americans in Arizona
AN  - 749720357; 20012204
AB  - Issue Title: Special Focus: Occupational and Environmental Health              We examined associations between different forms of self-reported racial discrimination and current substance use (i.e., smoking, alcohol use, and controlled substance use) among Asian Americans living in Arizona. The data are from 271 Asian American adults participating in the 2008 Asian Pacific Arizona Inititative (APAZI) Survey, which is part of a larger collaboration between community members, organizational leaders, and researchers. Asian Americans treated like they were not American because of their race were at increased risk of tobacco use, after controlling for covariates, including age, gender, education, family income, health insurance, nativity status, and language, and other types of racial discrimination. Also, individuals treated differently because of their race were at increased risk of alcohol use and controlled substance use, after controlling for covariates and other types of racial discrimination. The results indicate that Asian Americans experience a wide range of racial discrimination types and some forms of racial discrimination may have greater associations with tobacco, alcohol, and controlled substance use than others.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Theorizing social change
AN  - 764418151; 201064995
AB  - We outline primary features of a theoretical perspective on processes of social change in human systems that deals with broadly defined kinds of process, the nature of variants that are expressed and consolidate as change occurs, and, with specific reference to agency, the ways in which intentional actors are implicated in the changes that befall them. Our aim is to contribute to a general theory of process that is not prejudiced by the possible misrepresentation of outcomes arising in particular contexts (e.g. modernity), or the contexts themselves, as being causal processes. We direct attention to four problems of a methodological and ethical nature that may arise when analysts strive for generality. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cultural stereotypes of disabled and non-disabled men and women: Consensus for global category representations and diagnostic domains
AN  - 758122018; 201056809
AB  - Despite the fact that disabled people comprise a heterogeneous social group, cross-impairment cultural stereotypes reflect a consistent set of beliefs used to characterize this population as dependent, incompetent, and asexual. Using a free-response methodology, stereotypical beliefs about disabled men (DM) and women (DW) were contrasted against the stereotypes of their non-disabled counterparts illustrating the dimensions considered most diagnostic of each group. Results revealed that both disabled and non-disabled participants expressed consensus about the contents of group stereotypes that exaggerate traditional gender role expectations of the non-disabled while minimizing perceived differences between DM and DW. Implications for the field of stereotyping and prejudice, and the individual and system justifying functions of cultural stereotypes are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Reactions to Ethnic Deviance: The Role of Backlash in Racial Stereotype Maintenance
AN  - 764420117; 201064644
AB  - Backlash effects are social and economic penalties for counterstereotypical behavior (Rudman & Phelan, 2008). Five experiments support a model of the role of backlash in racial stereotype maintenance from the standpoint of perceivers and actors (Rudman & Fairchild, 2004). In Experiment 1, perceivers sabotaged Asians and Whites for succeeding in counterstereotypical domains, thereby preventing their future success. In Experiment 2, a White rapper suffered prejudice and economic discrimination, relative to a Black rapper, and prejudice mediated discrimination. Further, actors threatened by backlash for achievement in cross-racial domains responded to success in ways that bolster ethnic stereotypes. For example, Black men and women who feared backlash for academic skill (Experiment 3), and non-Black (Experiment 4) and non-White (Experiment 5) men who experienced backlash for cross-racial achievement, resorted to defensive strategies that preserve racial stereotypes (e.g., refusing to publicize and pursue counterstereotypical talents). Implications for cultural stereotype maintenance are discussed. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Pride and prejudice: Comparative corruption research and the British case
AN  - 754041688; 201055664
AB  - In recent years, comparative corruption analysis has been fuelled by the growth of international survey data on related perceptions. Taking issue with the typological vein of such analysis, this article questions both the treatment of perceptions indices and the validity and pertinence of variables used to explain them. It is argued that perceptions are conflated with practice, whilst explanatory variables appear ungrounded in empirical reality. These limitations serve to reinforce expectations that corruption is a menace to be associated primarily with societies of the global periphery. Drawing on the supposedly paradigmatic case of Britain, the article suggests that the problem of bias in comparative scholarship is compounded by three factors: the failure of comparative and domestic-focused literatures to engage with one another in sufficient depth; the relative lack of qualitative research into corruption within core Western states; and the neglect of power in the study of perceptions and practices at comparative and domestic-focused levels of analysis.

T1  - Concerns about appearing prejudiced: Implications for anxiety during daily interracial interactions
AN  - 743047783; 201031481
AB  - We investigated the relationship between Whites' and ethnic minorities' concerns about appearing prejudiced and anxiety during daily interracial interactions. College roommate pairs completed an individual difference measure of concerns about appearing prejudiced at the beginning of the semester. Then they completed measures of anxiety and perceptions of their roommates' anxiety-related behaviors for 15 days. Results indicated that among interracial roommate pairs, Whites' and ethnic minorities' concerns about appearing prejudiced were related to their self-reported anxiety on a daily basis; but this was not the case among same-race roommate pairs. In addition, among interracial roommate pairs, roommates who were concerned about appearing prejudiced began to 'leak' their anxiety towards the end of the diary period, as indicated by their out-group roommate who perceived their anxious behaviors as increasing across time, and who consequently liked them less. The implications of these findings for intergroup relations are discussed in this article. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Using the stereotype content model to examine group depictions in Fascism: An archival approach
AN  - 743060786; 201032873
AB  - The Stereotype Content Model (SCM) suggests potentially universal intergroup depictions. If universal, they should apply across history in archival data. Bridging this gap, we examined social groups descriptions during Italy's Fascist era. In Study 1, articles published in a Fascist magazine - La Difesa della Razza - were content analyzed, and results submitted to correspondence analysis. Admiration prejudice depicted ingroups; envious and contemptuous prejudices depicted specific outgroups, generally in line with SCM predictions. No paternalistic prejudice appeared; historical reasons might explain this finding. Results also fit the recently developed BIAS Map of behavioral consequences. In Study 2, ninety-six undergraduates rated the content-analysis traits on warmth and competence, without knowing their origin. They corroborated SCM's interpretations of the archival data.

T1  - Legislating love: Norwegian family reunification law as a racial project
AN  - 743044017; 201030469
AB  - Love is often portrayed as helping us overcome racism and other forms of prejudice, yet this article argues that imperatives towards love and romance-based marriage in Norwegian family reunification law constitute a racial project. Through a detailed reading of the 2004 Green Paper on a new Immigration Act, and a particular focus on the use of immigration law to combat forced marriages evident there, the centrality of romantic love in constructions of national subjects is considered. These constructions are seen to render some groups of Norwegian citizens simultaneously invisible as national subjects and hyper-visible as objects of national management. Adapted from the source document.
