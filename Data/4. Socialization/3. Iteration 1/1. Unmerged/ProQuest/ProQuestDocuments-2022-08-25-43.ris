T1  - A Journey Researching Prejudice and Discrimination
AN  - 2404395244
AB  - This paper surveys 1 of the author's 3 lifetime research themes, namely the social psychology of prejudice and discrimination. We first review large-scale surveys documenting the prevalence of prejudice and discrimination suffered by minorities in Canada including Indigenous, African Canadians, Francophone minorities in EnglishCanada, and English-speaking communities in Quebec. There is growing evidence of the mental and physical health consequences of being victim of discrimination in Canada and elsewhere in the world. We review laboratory studies using the Minimal Group Paradigm showing that the mere categorisation of people as us versus them and ingroup identification is sufficient to trigger prejudice and discrimination. In line with Social Identity Theory, the degree of ingroup identification and the need to achieve a positive social identity help account for the classic ingroup favoritism effect obtained in Minimal Group Paradigm studies. Thus, both social identity needs (Social Identity Theory) and competition for scarce resources articulated within Realistic Conflict Theory combine to account for prejudice, discrimination, and intergroup antagonisms. Interventions to reduce prejudice and discrimination are discussed including intergroup contact and diversity training. As scientific consultant, the author helped develop the French Radio-Canada television documentary, La Leçon de Discrimination, which won best television educational program in the world and was successfully adapted as a prodiversity pedagogical tool in Canada and worldwide.

T1  - Transforming Diffifficulties into Possibilities: Family Training as an Action for Educational Success in Contexts of Poverty
AN  - 2391220705
AB  - This research focuses on the implementation of a series of actions and training workshops with families of a school located in a socially excluded area in the city of Cordoba, Spain. The study explores how the participants perceived the experience and the educational and social benefits of this formative process. The research methodology was based on a participatory action research approach, which involved successive cycles of research and action in different phases: planning and analysis of the problem, action, observation and reflection. Five key informants, selected according to the criterion of structural heterogeneity, participated in the research. Semi-structured interviews and field journals were used as research instruments and content analysis was the technique of choice to analyses the information. The results reveal that the participants found the workshops to be highly beneficial both personally and in terms of the image they project to their children. They also faced challenges regarding their continuity in the activity, such as prejudices or different communication codes. The discussion underlines the importance of conducting training activities with families in contexts of poverty as an educational action that can increase their interest and motivation towards the school and hence enhance their participation in school life.

T1  - White Sexual Politics: The Patriarchal Family in White Nationalism and the Religious Right
AN  - 2384141290
AB  - In this paper, I explore how the US‐based Religious Right and white nationalist movements are both organized around a similar politics of gender rooted in defending the patriarchal family. While the broader meanings of the family differ in each framework—either providing the foundation for the racial nation or the religious order—there is surprising agreement across these movements around understanding the family as a heterosexual and patriarchal institution that is under attack. Based on long‐term ethnographic research in both movements, I show how defending the heteropatriarchal family provides valorized gendered identities for their participants along with a moral justification for prejudice, particularly through a discourse of defending women and children from feminism and queerness. This analysis shows how contemporary right‐wing and authoritarian movements rally around this family—modern, classed and raced, and patriarchal—as an anchor of stability in a time of increasing economic and social change.

T1  - The Causes and Pervasiveness of DMC: Stakeholder Perceptions of Disproportionate Minority Contact in the Juvenile Justice System
AN  - 2375454766
AB  - This study explores perceptions and awareness of disproportionate minority contact (DMC) by stakeholders in juvenile justice, youth-serving community organizations, schools, social services, and the faith community. This study is derived from a statewide assessment, which included in-person interviews with individuals that have personal and professional relationships within the juvenile justice system. Findings support the contention that individuals are either unaware of the prevalence of DMC, have already formed prejudices about minority youth within the system, or do not appreciate the degree of importance DMC has on the development of minority youth.

T1  - Gender Bending and Gender Conformity: The Social Consequences of Engaging in Feminine and Masculine Pro-Environmental Behaviors
AN  - 2242647714
AB  - Although pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs) have been characterized as feminine, some PEBs are masculine suggesting that gender bending (e.g., engaging in pro-environmental behaviors inconsistent with one’s own gender) and gender conformity (e.g., engaging in pro-environmental behaviors consistent with one’s own gender) are possible for both women and men. Social consequences for gender bending versus conformity with PEBs were assessed in three studies. Gender bending created uncertainty about an actor’s heterosexual identity (Studies 1 and 2). Consistent with stigma-by-association, actors’ gender bending influenced judgments about an actor’s friend’s sexual identity (Study 2). However, gender bending had limited effects on ascription of gendered traits: More feminine than masculine traits were ascribed to PEB actors, even actors of masculine PEBs (Studies 1 and 2). Consistent with social ostracism, Study 3 illustrated that men were most likely to socially distance themselves from female gender benders, likely as a result of prejudice against gender-bending women. In contrast, women preferred to socially interact with gender-conforming women, likely resulting from a combination of their greater interest in feminine than masculine PEBs and preferring to interact with women more so than with men. Social repercussions are discussed in terms of stigmatizing engagement in PEBs.

T1  - A Study of Cultural Empathy and Attitude toward Diversity: The Case of Australian Church Attenders
AN  - 2477270660
AB  - Australia's context is one of increasing ethnic and religious diversity. Intercultural communication is an everyday reality, with cultural empathy fostering intercultural competence. Yet ideas about belonging to Australia are complex and contested. This study addresses a paradox within the context of Christian churches. Church attenders have a high sense of belonging to Australia, which has been found in other studies to be negatively related to empathy. Yet, individuals have opportunities for intercultural contact within church settings, which is associated with positive intercultural relations and reduced prejudice. This study examines data from 1,700 participants (aged 15 years and over) in the 2016 National Church Life Survey to test relationships between empathy, attitude to diversity, and belonging to Australia, taking into account congregational ethnic diversity, levels of bonding, and country of birth. Results provide some evidence that culturally diverse congregations provide opportunities to foster cultural empathy. There was also an interaction between country of birth and belonging. Belonging and attitude to diversity were not related amongst attenders born in non-English speaking countries, but were negatively related amongst those born in English-speaking countries, despite opportunity for regular contact with outgroup members. Future work would benefit from improved measures of ethnicity and further understanding of how belonging and identity operates for different groups of Australians. Implications for church leaders are that while intercultural proximity alone may not be sufficient to foster positive attitudes towards diversity, positive interactions among perceived peers with shared goals may be more effective.

T1  - Youth of Color Living and Learning in the Age of Racial Paranoia: What Social Justice Educators Need to Know
AN  - 2341735585
AB  - Fearing the other has been entrenched in the minds of many Americans. With Donald J. Trump becoming president of the U.S., overt racism is being reinserted into mainstream politics. Trump's victory has ushered in an era beset by racial paranoia-fear socially constructed about Black and Brown bodies, learned at home, in schools, and from the mainstream media, and expressed in unjust and, at times, violent manners. Indeed, racial paranoia has caused racially prejudiced individuals or groups to behave and act in violent ways against people of color. This essay draws from critical race theory and present day political events involving the Donald Trump government to explore racial paranoia and its multilayered effects on people of color, particularly youth of color. This article underscores plausible parallels between racial paranoia and the attitude, behavior, and actions of people holding White supremacist ideology and their violence against people of all colors, particularly youth of color. This articler provides suggestions that might serve educators who are working with historically disenfranchised youth of color, including immigrant youth of color.

T1  - Reactions from family of origin to the disclosure of lesbian motherhood via donor insemination
AN  - 2336262670
AB  - Most studies of planned lesbian motherhood via donor insemination (DI) have sampled lesbian mothers in individualistic societies where adults have relatively distant connection to their family of origin. Our study examined the experiences of biological and non-biological lesbian mothers in five families who had children through DI after disclosing their motherhood status to their family networks in Portugal, a familistic society. The first theme identified by thematic analysis-"But why do you want to have a child?"-encapsulated the reactions of biological mothers' family of origin to the announcement of motherhood. Disclosure was mostly met by a shocked response in the family, rooted in the belief that lesbian women should not have children. The second theme-"But you weren't pregnant, how is this your child?"-summarized the reactions of non-biological mothers' family of origin to the disclosure of motherhood status as they considered refusing to recognize their grandchild in the absence of biological connection. Prejudice against lesbian-mother family formation was associated with the specific intersection of lesbianism and motherhood, but relationships between the mothers and their families were largely repaired because of familistic values.

T1  - Pride and prejudice: Exploring how identity processes shape public attitudes towards Australian counter-terrorism measures
AN  - 2319170986
AB  - Counter-terrorism measures are often described as pre-emptive, punitive, and afford authorities exclusive and expanded powers. Yet they continue to attract public support. Why is this the case? A consistent finding in traditional crime control research shows a link between perceived threat from racial or ethnic minority groups and their perceived involvement in crime. This perceived relationship results in public support for punitive crime control measures for such groups. Similar connections can be made between terrorism and Muslims. It is thus possible that perceiving Muslims to be threatening may help explain enhanced public support towards harsh counter-terrorism measures. This study draws on survey data of a national sample Australian residents (N = 1199) to test this hypothesis. Findings show the importance of both identity processes and perceptions of Muslims as threatening in shaping support for punitive counter-terrorism strategies. Results also demonstrate how social identity can moderate the effect of perceived threat on support for such strategies. Theoretical and policy implications of this study are outlined.

T1  - Individual and Contextual Factors Associated with School Staff Responses to Homophobic Bullying
AN  - 2131741826
AB  - This cross-sectional research investigates the individual (i.e., sexual prejudice, contact with lesbian and gay [LG] people, and perceived seriousness of homophobic epithets) and contextual (i.e., homophobic bullying observed by school staff and perceived colleague reactions to homophobic bullying) factors as predictors of school staff intervention against vs. legitimization of homophobic bullying. Data were collected in secondary schools in the North of Italy via a paper-and-pencil survey. Participants were school staff members (N = 273) from 24 Italian secondary schools. The results have indicated that the higher the sexual prejudice and the lower the contact with LG individuals, the higher the legitimization of homophobic bullying. Also, perceiving colleagues as legitimizing or intervening in cases of homophobic bullying predicted similar reactions on the part of school staff participants. The findings are discussed with respect to the current literature regarding homophobic bullying, and applied interventions for school staff training programs to tackle homophobic bullying at school are put forward.

T1  - Gender stereotypes and contact with gay men and lesbians: The mediational role of sexism and homonegativity
AN  - 2314168954
AB  - This study is grounded in Allport's intergroup contact theory and Herek's sexual prejudice theory. We aimed at (a) investigating the mediational role of sexism and homonegativity on the relation between gender, age, and contact with gay and lesbian people with gender stereotypes about gay men and lesbians; and (b) replicating and corroborating the direct associations found in previous research among these variables. The present research used secondary data from a survey conducted by the Italian National Institute of Statistics and comprehending a representative sample of 5,863 Italian adults. The results from path analysis indicated that both homonegativity and sexism partially mediated the effect of gender and age on gender stereotypes, whereas they totally mediated the effect of contact with gay and lesbian persons. Findings suggest that reducing sexist and homonegative attitudes and increasing contact with gay and lesbian people may reduce stereotypical beliefs about homosexual people.

T1  - White innocence as an investigative frame in a schooling context
AN  - 2287219522
AB  - Ineffective and oppressive schooling of people of color has been obstinate and widespread. Disinviting and hostile practices often engaged through written and oral discourses contribute to this condition. Thus, identifying such discourses becomes imperative to reversing these conditions and creating equitable schooling. This essay proposes the use of critical analysis of white innocence as a concept to investigate prejudicial schooling practices. Borrowing from legal studies, the author proposes analyzing the rhetoric of white innocence and its simultaneous opposite, person of color as perpetrator, as an investigative frame in the schooling context. In this work, white innocence is reviewed as a social representation that assists in making more transparent the unmarked standard of white supremacy. The essay first conceptualizes the rhetoric of white innocence. Then, a methodological framework of social cognition through discourse and its (re)production of social representations is offered and utilized to exemplify the manifestations of white innocence in a social studies context.

T1  - All the lonely people, where do they all belong? An interpretive synthesis of loneliness and social support in older lesbian, gay and bisexual communities
TT  - An interpretive synthesis of loneliness
AN  - 2307086608
AB  - PurposeLoneliness is a phenomenon which affects people globally and constitutes a key social issue of our time. Yet few studies have considered the nature of loneliness and social support for older lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) people; this is of particular concern as they are among the social groups said to be at greater risk. The paper aims to discuss this issue.Design/methodology/approachPeer-reviewed literature was identified through a search of Scopus, PsycINFO and PubMed. A total of 2,277 papers were retrieved including qualitative and quantitative studies which were quality assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme.FindingsIn total, 11 papers were included in the review and findings were synthesised using thematic analysis. The studies were conducted in five countries worldwide with a combined sample size of 53,332 participants, of whom 4,288 were drawn from among LGB communities. The characteristics and circumstances associated with loneliness including living arrangements, housing tenure, minority stress and geographical proximity.Research limitations/implicationsThe review suggests that among older LGB people, living alone, not being partnered and being childfree may increase the risk of loneliness. This cohort of older people may experience greater difficulties in building relationships of trust and openness. They may also have relied on sources of identity-based social support that are in steep decline. Future research should include implementation studies to evaluate effective strategies in reducing loneliness among older LGB people.Practical implicationsReaching older LGB people who are vulnerable due to physical mobility or rural isolation and loneliness because of bereavement or being a carer is a concern. A range of interventions including individual (befriending), group-based (for social contact) in addition to potential benefits from the Internet of Things should be evaluated. Discussions with the VCS suggest that take up of existing provision is 85:15 GB men vs LB women.Social implicationsFormal social support structures which were provided by voluntary sector agencies have been disproportionately affected by recent austerity measures.Originality/valueThe authors sought to interrogate the tension between findings of lower levels of social support and discourses of resilient care offered by families of choice.

T1  - Homosexuality as <i>Haram</i>: Relations among Gender, Contact, Religiosity, and Sexual Prejudice in Muslim Individuals
AN  - 2135410243
AB  - Most research on sexual prejudice has focused on Western and Christian samples. Using the framework of social identity theory, we investigated the relations among gender, contact, religiosity, and sexual prejudice in a sample of 166 heterosexual Muslim individuals (70.7% from Saudi Arabia) residing in the United States. Consistent with prior research, men reported higher levels of prejudice than women did, especially toward gay men. Higher levels of religiosity predicted higher levels of sexual prejudice for both men and women, but the association was stronger for women. Additionally, more frequent and positive contact with friends and/or family members who were lesbian or gay predicted less sexual prejudice. However, contact was more strongly associated with less sexual prejudice in women than in men. Exploratory analyses revealed that more time spent in the United Sates predicted lower levels of sexual prejudice, and participants from Saudi Arabia reported more sexual prejudice than Muslims from other countries. The current research contributes to the understanding of factors that influence sexual prejudice within Islam and sheds light on the heterogeneity of attitudes within this group of individuals. Furthermore, our findings may help inform efforts to decrease sexual prejudice and increase awareness, advocacy, and future research within Islamic cultures.

T1  - Social Desirability Bias among Prejudice Instruments: An Integrated Threat
AN  - 2334197657
AB  - A considerable amount of research has examined the extent to which members of dominant cultures perceive minority groups as threatening their way of life. While various instruments measure these perceptions of threat, few researchers have empirically analysed the statistical properties of these scales. Specifically, studies have not adequately explored social desirability of threat scales. The current study investigates the extent to which one set of threat scales is internally consistent or reliable (González et al., 2008), and explores social desirability within the González et al. (2008) integrated threat instruments by comparing self-reports to other reports (intimate other and friend reports). Results indicate the instruments are internally consistent and that self-reports and other reports of threat do not differ on most indices of threat.

T1  - Microaggressive classroom language and diminished cognitive functioning
AN  - 2276066926
AB  - PurposeThe current literature has not provided insight into the effects of using racially derogatory words in the context of academic instruction or when reviewing historical texts. This study aims to examine the impact of such microaggressive language on cognitive performance among university students.Design/methodology/approachUsing experimental methodologies, the participants were recruited to the research lab and assigned to one of the three conditions, as they were exposed to a derogatory word, heard a replacement of the word or did not hear it at all. Given the results of prior studies, researchers hypothesized that participants holding marginalized racial/ethnic identities would experience greater levels of cognitive depletion, as measured by the Stroop (1935) color-naming task, when compared to their white counterparts, as it was expected that students from underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds would be more affected by use of such language.FindingsThe primary hypothesis was supported, as students from underrepresented backgrounds who were exposed to the microaggressive language displayed diminished Stroop (1935) performance as compared to those not exposed and their white counterparts who heard the same language.Originality/valueThis study adds to the literature surrounding the immediate impact of microaggression of university students holding marginalized racial/ethnic identities.

T1  - Understanding Appalachian Microaggression from the Perspective of Community College Students in Southern West Virginia
AN  - 2339037811
AB  - The term "Appalachian" is wrongly understood to represent a single culture of rural White poverty (Keefe, 2005). This conception contains stereotypical images that obscure hardships many rural White Central Appalachians face. Similar to other oppressed minorities in the U.S., what it means to be Appalachian is a social construction based on what differs them from the White hegemony. Recent scholarship on discrimination recognizes the importance of microaggression, small insults and slights experienced frequently by people from minority groups (Sue, et. al., 2007). Microaggression may be an especially insidious mechanism in the oppression of Appalachian people, since the derogatory stereotypes are broadly accepted while their oppressed status tends to not be acknowledged. This study applied qualitative focus group methodology to understand perceptions of microaggression and oppression among a sample of college students living in rural Central Appalachia. Results reveal themes of microaggression. Identifying Appalachian microaggression provides evidence of marginalized status and offers a framework for understanding how the social construction of White Appalachian perpetuates reduced status, stereotypes, and prejudice. Implications are discussed to consider how to foster resilience to oppression among rural White Central Appalachian people.

T1  - HIV-related care for transgender people: A systematic review of studies from around the world
AN  - 2246255296
AB  - Rationale Transgender people face unique challenges, such as structural, interpersonal, and individual vulnerabilities to chronic diseases. Stigma and prejudice may hamper their access to health care and prevent their inclusion in the labor market, as well as cause exposition to violence. Labor market exclusion contributes to engagement in survival sex work, which increases HIV infection vulnerability. HIV continuum of care combines HIV prevention (including antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), antiretroviral post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) and HIV testing) with linkage to care (that is, initiating, maintaining and monitoring antiretroviral therapy). Currently, many studies evaluate the access barriers and facilitators to HIV care for transgender people. Objective The present systematic review aimed to provide a clear summary of the current literature on HIV-related care for transgender men, transgender women and gender diverse people. Method Inclusion criteria were peer-reviewed quantitative studies, published through April 04, 2018, concerning transgender women, transgender men and gender diverse people and HIV-related care, which was any intervention aiming to prevent, treat or alleviate the impact of HIV on these populations. Results From 6,585 references, 62 articles were included: Three articles had results on PEP, 18 on PrEP, 29 on HIV-testing, 17 on access to health care, and 13 on adherence to treatment. Conclusions The present study is the first systematic review evaluating HIV-related care for transgender people. Data collection is still scarce regarding transgender men and gender diverse people. Worldwide, testing for HIV infection does not necessarily enable access to the HIV continuum of care for transgender populations or even guarantee awareness of HIV seropositivity.

T1  - Love and Justice: African American Women, Education, and Protest in Antebellum New England
AN  - 2180882669
AB  - African Americans who pursued higher education in antebellum America often faced harassment and violence. Historians link the struggle over African American education with broader protest strategies, with African American men taking center stage. This essay enlarges the narrative on African American education and social protest by examining how young African American women students contested racism and white supremacy. Focusing on the controversy that surrounded the first high school for young African American women in New England, this essay argues that young African American women deployed an ethic of Christian love as a form of social protest. These women named racial prejudice as anti-Christian while also advocating for a just and loving nation inclusive of African Americans. Though white opposition eventually shuttered the school, this essay shows how African American women’s activism in the antebellum era is part of a longer genealogy of social protest.

T1  - Effects of a companion dog on associations of danger and threat with oriental‐looking targets
AN  - 2185683485
AB  - In the current study we extend previous findings on the shooter bias toward targets with Arab ethnicity. In an adapted shooter task, we presented stereotypically oriental‐looking targets without explicit symbols of Islam (e.g., a turban) and additionally tested if presenting a “harmless” companion dog, together with Arab versus White targets, would affect the shooter bias. Participants responded faster and made fewer errors for armed Arab than for armed White targets. Moreover, compared to the “neutral” no dog condition, the presence of a dog triggered fewer false alarms for White than for Arab targets and slowed down (correct) responses in general. Implications and potential underlying mechanisms are discussed.

T1  - Incoming Medical Students' Political Orientation Affects Outcomes Related to Care of Marginalized Groups: Results from the Medical Student CHANGES Study
AN  - 2173843723
AB  - This article characterizes the political ideology of first-year medical students and describes the extent to which their political ideology was associated with attitudes and beliefs related to the care of marginalized patients assessed during their fourth year. Analyses use data from online questionnaires administered to 3,756 medical students from a stratified random sample of forty-nine medical schools in their first and fourth years of study. The primary measure of political ideology was a five-point scale anchored by “very conservative” and “very liberal.” Mixed-effects linear regression was used to test the predictive power of political ideology at year 1 on year 4 outcomes. Among incoming medical students, 47.7% identified as liberal, 33.3% as moderate, and 19.0% as conservative. More conservative ideology was associated at year 4 with greater implicit bias against black and gay individuals, more negative explicit attitudes toward stigmatized groups, lower internal motivation to control racial prejudice, lower levels of trait empathy and empathy toward patients, and lower levels of patient-centered attitudes. Future research is needed to inform and develop interventions to improve care of patients from marginalized groups that are effective for medical students and health care providers across the political spectrum.

T1  - Racing Law: Legal Scholarship and the Critical Race Revolution
AN  - 2291125044
AB  - The advent of critical race theory (CRT) in legal scholarship changed the way in which legal scholars think about race and racism in at least three ways. First, CRT scholars argue that the problem of racial justice is fundamental to American law, whereas the previous generation of civil rights scholars saw racial justice as a problem of institutional dynamics resolvable through ordinary legal process. Second, CRT scholars have infused greater social, disciplinary, and scholastic “reflexivity” into legal scholarship on race. Third, CRT scholars have developed a rich and nuanced language for understanding race and racism, replacing an earlier and less sophisticated legal conception of people of color as “discrete and insular” minorities facing unreasoning prejudice.

T1  - Theories for Race and Gender Differences in Management of Social Identity-Related Stressors: a Systematic Review
AN  - 2171209726
AB  - Sociodemographic group-specific strategies for stress management may contribute to racial and gender disparities in health outcomes in the USA. We aimed to systematically review theoretical and empirical investigations of factors influencing variation in response to and management of identity-related stress among black and white Americans. OvidPsychInfo and PubMed databases were searched to identify eligible studies. Criteria were participant age of ≥ 18 years, conducted in the US sampling black or white participants, and published in English in a peer-reviewed journal. The final sample included 167 articles. Theories suggesting social status inequities as the primary contributor to disparate strategies employed by black and white women and men to manage social identity-related stress were most frequently tested and supported. Studies disproportionally focused on how women and black persons cope as targets of prejudice and discrimination rather than on how management strategies of men or white persons are affected as perpetrators. Finally, there was theoretical support for an interactive effect of race and gender on stress management, but empirical evidence was lacking, particularly among black men, white women, and white men. The literature could be strengthened through the use of prospective cohorts and nationally representative samples, as well as study designs accounting for potential within-race and within-gender variation in the effects of social identity-related stressors on coping. With greater consistency in methodology, future empirical studies may yield additional information regarding group differences in stress management pertinent to clarifying mechanisms for the health consequences of exposure to social inequity among black and white women and men.

T1  - Social dominance orientation as an obstacle to intergroup apology
AN  - 2171190187
AB  - Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) has engaged the interest of social and personality psychologists as it has deep implications for the psychology of intergroup conflict, particularly regarding factors such as prejudice and discrimination, as well as international conflict resolution. Nevertheless, few studies have directly assessed how SDO relates to intergroup reconciliation. This study (effective N = 819) measured participants’ SDO along with their attitudes toward various governmental apologies to test the hypothesis that SDO is associated with unwillingness to issue intergroup apologies. The results showed that SDO was negatively correlated with supportive attitudes toward government-issued international apologies. This negative correlation remained intact after controlling for the effects of political conservatism and militarism.

T1  - The Strength of Whites’ Ties: How Employers Reward the Referrals of Black and White Jobseekers
AN  - 2427332956
AB  - Sociologists commonly point to jobseekers’ racially segregated networks and employers’ discriminatory behavior to explain racial inequality in employment. Network scholars argue that, given segregated networks and black and white employees’ unequal position in the labor market, employers’ reliance on employee referrals reproduces black disadvantage. Scholars of discrimination focus instead on employers’ unequal treatment of equally qualified black and white jobseekers. Drawing on an original experiment with a sample of white individuals with hiring responsibilities, I seek to bridge these literatures by examining whether respondents’ racial prejudice affects how they reward employee referrals of black and white applicants from black and white employees. I use a measure of implicit prejudice that is resistant to social desirability and that can capture biases among people who genuinely believe they are unbiased. Whether evaluated by low-prejudiced or high-prejudiced respondents, white applicants benefit greatly from same-race referrals. In contrast, black applicants do not benefit from same-race referrals, even when they are evaluated by low-prejudiced respondents. In fact, black applicants only benefit from having a referral when two conditions are met: the referring employee is white and they are evaluated by a relatively low-prejudiced respondent. These findings suggest that in addition to their disadvantage in access to employee referrals, black jobseekers suffer from a disadvantage in returns to these referrals.

T1  - Prejudices and discrimination as goal activated and threat driven: The affordance management approach applied to sexual prejudice
AN  - 2138607364
AB  - Stereotypes, prejudices, and discriminatory behaviors directed toward people based on their sexual orientation vary broadly. Existing perspectives on sexual prejudice argue for different underlying causes, sometimes provide disparate or conflicting evidence for its roots, and typically fail to account for variances observed across studies. We propose an affordance management approach to understanding sexual prejudice, which weds the fundamental motives theory with the sociofunctional threat-based approach to prejudice to provide a broader explanation for the causes and outcomes of sexual prejudice and to explain inter- and intragroup prejudices more broadly. Prejudices arise as specific emotions designed to engage functional behavioral responses to perceived threats and opportunities (i.e., affordances) posed by different sexual orientation groups, and interact with the perceiver’s chronic or temporarily activated fundamental motives (e.g., parenting, mating), which determine the relevance of certain target affordances. Our perspective predicts what stereotype content is likely to direct specific affective and behavioral reactions (i.e., the stereotypes that relay threat- and opportunity-relevant information) and when the affordance-emotion-behavior link is likely to engage (i.e., when those threats and opportunities are directly relevant to the perceiver’s current fundamental goal). This article synthesizes the extant sexual prejudice literature from an affordance management approach to demonstrate how fundamental goals interact with preexisting perceptions to drive perceptual, affective, and behavioral responses toward sexual orientation groups, and provides a degree of explanatory power heretofore missing from the prejudice literature.

T1  - The Motivated Cognitive Basis of Transphobia: The Roles of Right-Wing Ideologies and Gender Role Beliefs
AN  - 1963776582
AB  - Transgender individuals challenge the traditional assumption that an individual’s gender identity is permanently determined by their assigned sex at birth. Perceiving ambiguity surrounding indeterminate gender identities associated with transgender individuals may be especially disturbing for those who generally dislike ambiguity and have preference for order and predictability, that is, for people scoring higher on Need for Closure (NFC). We tested the associations between NFC and transphobia in two studies using community samples from the United Kingdom (n = 231) and Belgium (n = 175), and we examined whether right-wing ideological attitudes and traditional gender role beliefs mediated these relationships. Confirming our expectations, we found that NFC was significantly associated with transphobia through both stronger adherence to social conventions and obedience to authorities (i.e., right-wing authoritarianism) and stronger endorsements of traditional gender roles in the UK and Belgium, as well as through stronger preferences for hierarchy and social inequality (i.e., social dominance orientation) in the UK. Our results suggest that transgender individuals are more likely to be targets of prejudice by those higher in NFC at least partly due to the strong preference for preserving societal traditions and the resistance to a perceived disruption of traditional gender norms. Hence, attempts to reduce transphobia might be especially challenging among those high in NFC. Nevertheless, prejudice-reducing interventions could incorporate techniques that satisfy epistemic needs for predictability, certainty, and simple structure which may have higher chances of success among high NFC individuals.

T1  - Initial prejudices create cross-generational intergroup mistrust
AN  - 2030877949
AB  - The present investigation modeled the emergence and persistence of intergroup bias and discrimination in artificial societies. Initial unfair prejudices held by members of a dominant group elicit confirmatory behavior (diminished cooperation) from members of a subordinate group via a self-fulfilling prophecy. Further, when individual learning is tempered by conformity to peers, inaccurate beliefs about the stigmatized subordinate group persist long-term. Even completely replacing dominant group members with enlightened individuals through generational change is inadequate to break the cycle of intergroup distrust and non-collaboration. The longer the enlightenment of a society is delayed, the more intergroup trust is irretrievably lost.

T1  - Does intergroup contact affect personality? A longitudinal study on the bidirectional relationship between intergroup contact and personality traits
AN  - 2011520651
AB  - We conducted a longitudinal study to test whether, in addition to being predicted by personality, intergroup contact is longitudinally associated with personality traits. Participants were 388 majority (Italian) and 109 minority (immigrant) first‐year high school students. Results revealed a bidirectional relationship between contact and personality: Quality of contact was longitudinally associated with greater agreeableness and openness to experience, whereas agreeableness and openness to experience were longitudinal predictors of contact quality. An unexpected negative longitudinal association also emerged between quantity of contact and agreeableness. These effects were not moderated by group of belonging (majority vs. minority). Our findings highlight the importance of integrating research on intergroup contact with research on personality.

T1  - Globalization, Ageing Process and Attitudes of Younger Generations to Ageing
TT  - GLOBALIZACIJA, PROCES STARENJA I STAVOVI MLAĐIH GENERACIJA PREMA STARENJU
AN  - 2187918351
AB  - Due to the increase of aging population in all societies, it seems important to explore this issue from different aspects in order to improve the position of the elderly and recognise their contribution to the society. The aim of this study was to examine the experiences and views of the Generation Z on the discrimination and prejudices against the elderly. There were 6 participants in the focus group, 4 girls and 2 boys, all of whom belong to the Generation Z. The data was collected in the focus group who answered open-ended questions. Results of the qualitative research indicate: 1) that there is an unfavourable attitude towards the elderly in the investigated group of children; 2) causes of discrimination against the elderly; 3) prejudice against the elderly. Encouraging the society to provide better education (especially for children and young people), direct contact with the elderly (organising exchange of experience and transfer of traditional and cultural values), as well as better presentation of ageing and old age in the media would contribute to the decrease of global ageing and improve attitude of the younger generation towards ageing animosity. Family has the main influence on young people’s views and it is necessary to motivate parents to present ageing and old age in a favourable light. Furthermore, it is important to work with the elderly in terms of empowerment and developing a more positive self-image.Alternate abstract:S obzirom na porast udjela starije populacije u većini društava, čini se važnim istražiti ovu problematiku s različitih aspekata u cilju poboljšanja položaja starijih i prepoznavanja njihovog doprinosa u društvu. Cilj istraživanja bio je ispitati iskustva i mišljenja generacije Z, o predrasudama i diskriminaciji prema starijim osobama. Ispitanici su bili mlađe životne dobi, prema starosti pripadaju generaciji Z. Podaci su prikupljeni putem fokus grupe, a koristila su se pitanja otvorenog tipa. Rezultati kvalitativnog istraživanja ukazuju na: 1) nepovoljan odnos društva prema starijim osobama, 2) uzroke diskriminacije starijih osoba, 3) predrasude prema starijim osobama. Bolja edukacija (posebno djece i mladih), neposredni kontakt sa starijim osobama (omogućavanje susreta za razmjenu iskustava te prenošenja tradicijskih i kulturnih vrijednosti), te bolja medijska prezentacija starenja i starosti doprinijela bi smanjenju globalizacije starenja i boljem odnosu mlađih generacija prema starenju. Važan utjecaj na poglede mladih ima obitelj i potrebno je motivirati roditelje da pozitivno prezentiraju starenje i starost. Također, važno je raditi i sa starijim osobama u smislu njihovog osnaživanja i razvijanja pozitivnije slike o sebi.

T1  - The Global Adoption of National Policies Protecting Children from Violent Discipline in Schools and Homes, 1950–2011
AN  - 2007414788
AB  - With a focus on the relationship between women's and children's rights and theories of globalization, we conduct an event history analysis of more than 150 countries between 1950 and 2011 to assess the factors associated with policies banning corporal punishment in schools and homes. Our research reveals that formal condemnation of corporal punishment in schools is becoming a global norm; policies banning corporal punishment in the home, in contrast, are being adopted more slowly. We find that the percentage of women in parliament is associated with the adoption of anti-corporal punishment policies in both schools and homes, suggesting a nexus between women's and children's issues. Countries with more ethnic diversity are slower to adopt home policies, however. We propose that minority groups in these countries may be resistant to laws because of the risk of selective or prejudicial enforcement. In terms of globalization, more aid is associated with both school and home policies, and countries that have ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child are more likely to adopt home policies. Surprisingly, international nongovernmental organizations are not significantly associated with either type of policy adoption.

T1  - Narrative Ethnographies of Diverse Faculty in Higher Education: "Moral" Multiculturalism among Competing Worldviews
AN  - 2017951321
AB  - Since the Civil Right Movement in the United States, African Americans and other diverse students have forged through "integrated" educational systems to terminal graduate degrees. Some studies suggest racial integration in U. S. schools made White participants less prejudiced toward others, although the data showed that after schooling, many Whites again lived (and still do) in segregated neighborhoods with separation in places of employment, churches, and social groups (Wells, Holme, Revilla, & Atanda, 2004). One diverse participant in this study asked whether, after decades of integration, there has been any real progress, citing excellent educational experiences with all Black teachers within the all Black schools where he grew up. Is it truly progress for diverse students when they are bussed across town to be treated as minorities in mostly White schools? More diverse students do graduate from college; however, the diversity rate of professors is still abysmal. This study reports the contextual experiences of three African American (one an administrator) and one Latina faculty member with decades of experience in the public educational system and as they engaged in the culture of higher education struggling with a moral multiculturalism-whether worldviews (therefore free speech) could be morally determined and whether they as diverse faculty truly belong and are truly respected.

In the days before the referendum, we asked more than 400 British people how they planned to vote. We measured a number of demographic factors expected to predict voting intentions as well as individuals’ prejudice towards and intergroup contact experience (positive and negative) with EU immigrants. Anti‐immigrant prejudice was a strong correlate of support for Brexit. Negative intergroup contact experience was associated with higher anti‐immigrant prejudice and, in turn, increased support for ‘Leave’. Positive intergroup contact, on the other hand, seemed to play a reparative role, predicting lower prejudice and increasing support for ‘Remain’.

T1  - From Colorism to Conjurings: Tracing the Dust in Beyoncé's Lemonade
AN  - 2049666014
AB  - Colorism creates relentless tension and pressure in the lives of Black women. Pop-star Beyoncé Gisele Knowles-Carter is an interesting case in the discussion of colorism because her career has expressed a rich intimacy to Southern Black culture and female empowerment while also playing into tropes of the mulatta "fancy girl," whose relative proximity to whiteness adheres social value within mainstream culture. Finding aesthetic and thematic parallels between Beyoncé's recent project Lemonade (2016) and Julie Dash's cult-classic film Daughters of the Dust (1991) I draw a critical connection between Yellow Mary Peazant and Beyoncé, the prodigal child and the licentious "post-racial," pop-star to argue that while Lemonade may not present the same critique of exclusionary Black womanhood present within Daughters of the Dust, reactions to the Beyoncé's visual album and the "Formation" music video inadvertently demonstrate the longevity of harmful colorist prejudices and the disparaging of Black female sexual and creative agency within the Black community. This article engages conflicting reactions between the "Formation" music video and Lemonade visual album, as well as some of Beyoncé's earlier works, to consider the continued role of colorism, as it intersects with racism and sexism, to construct exclusionary notions of Blackness that attempt to restrict the expressivity of those considered "outside" of Blackness. Through a barrage of specifically Black feminist conjurings, Lemonade draws upon the legacy of Daughters of the Dust to break through the colorist barriers placed upon the Black female body while practicing diasporic melancholia to link the trauma of the past and the struggles of the present to articulate grievances and express desires for improved Black future.

T1  - The Intergenerational Effect of Maternal Multicultural Experience on Children's Tolerance: An Example From Palestinians and Jews in Israel
AN  - 1941843109
AB  - Although recent research has demonstrated the benefits of multicultural experience for reducing personal levels of intergroup bias, the potential for an intergenerational effect has yet to be explored. Using samples of Jewish-Israeli (Study 1a) and Palestinian-Israeli (Study 1b) mother-child dyads, we found that maternal multicultural experience was indirectly related to greater social tolerance among children via lower levels of maternal need for cognitive closure which, in turn, triggered higher levels of maternal social tolerance. These results show that when it comes to multicultural experience, its impact can extend beyond the self to also affect the next generation. Implications for developmental theories of prejudice acquisition and prejudice interventions are discussed.

T1  - Relatives in Residence: Relatedness of Household Members Drives Schooling Differentials in Mozambique
AN  - 1917939051
AB  - Children typically receive investments from their fathers, but absent fathers often invest at low levels. In a father's absence, what types of nonfathers invest heavily in children? This article investigates educational participation as a reflection of childhood investments on Ibo Island, Mozambique, where only one third of school-aged children live with their biological fathers. Father-present children generally attended school at the highest rates. Stepchildren and father-absent relatives (e.g., grandchildren, nieces) attended school at comparably high rates if any coresiding children were father-present. This may signal high altruism among present fathers toward some nonoffspring. Consistent with this result, a fixed effects model indicates that, within the same household, adult males invested equally in their own children, relatives, and stepchildren. Prejudicially lower investments were made in children who were unrelated to the household's adult males, however; this result has strong negative implications for the well-being of African children fostered by nonrelatives.

T1  - Gender Roles in the Arab World: Development and Psychometric Properties of the Arab Adolescents Gender Roles Attitude Scale
AN  - 1917822689
AB  - Scant research has been conducted on gender in the Arab world; one explanation is due to a lack of Arabic measures on gender-related issues. To advance scientific work on gender in the Arab world, we developed the Arab Adolescents Gender Roles Attitude Scale (AAGRAS), the first known reliable and valid Arabic measure of gender-role attitudes. To develop this measure, we conducted two studies based on data collected from 776 high school students 15-19 years-old from the state of Qatar. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis produced 12 items divided equally into two subscales. One subscale assesses traditional gender-role attitudes, whereas the other measures egalitarian gender-role attitudes. Our findings indicate that young men are more likely to resist gender equality than young women are. Moreover, those who hold traditional attitudes are more likely to disapprove of women occupying positions of authority. The AAGRAS is a useful assessment tool that policymakers, researchers, practitioners, and educators can use to study gender-role attitudes in the Arab world and to develop educational and intervention programs that encourage adolescents to identify, confront, and avoid prejudice and discrimination against women and ultimately adopt more egalitarian gender roles.

T1  - STEREOTYPICAL GENDER REPRESENTATIONS IN CHHOTA BHEEM: KIDS' CARTOON PROGRAMME ON POGO CHANNEL
AN  - 1990432567
AB  - Cartoon watching is usually supposed to be a fun time for children; it also serves as a potential learning tool This paper is based on content analysis of a popular television cartoon series in the Hindi/Urdu languages, Chhota Bheem by Pogo, an Indian channel for young children that is televised by local and foreign T V channels. To analyse the contents of these programmes, seven dialogues are selected through purposive sampling to help understand how gender discrimination is projected through these kids' shows. Qualitative data analyses is made in the light of the model presented by Mills' (1995) and Beauvoir's (1997) notion of social construction of women as the "other" and is applied to assess societal oppression and stereotypic treatment of women as inferior to males. Analysing these cartoons with respect to gender representation by looking at the ratio of male to female characters shown, the physical characteristics of these characters, and the language of selected dialogues, this research shows that the cartoons reflect gender prejudices that exist in the psyche of adults, thereby transmitting negative messages to children during the formative stage of their brain development. The findings show that the portrayal of male and female characters in these series is stereotypical to the extent that they influence children to believe and idealize these roles in their everyday social interaction.

T1  - When the Majority Becomes the Minority: A Longitudinal Study of the Effects of Immersive Experience With Racial Out-Group Members on Implicit and Explicit Racial Biases
AN  - 1910849145
AB  - The present study investigated the effects of immersive exposure to other-race individuals on racial bias. In Study 1, we tracked African students (N = 85) who went to study at a Chinese university and thus experienced daily contact with Chinese individuals en masse for the first time. Using a cohort-sequential longitudinal design, we found that an implicit pro-Chinese racial bias emerged within 3 months after these students arrived in China, and that this bias remained stable for at least a year. In contrast, their explicit racial bias did not change. In Study 2, we assessed another group of African students (N = 47) at 1 month and at 3 months after their arrival in China, looking at not only their implicit and explicit racial bias, but also their intergroup contact quantity, intergroup contact quality, and intergroup friendship. We found that intergroup contact quantity and intergroup friendship predicted implicit but not explicit racial bias 2 months later. The findings suggest that immersive experiences with racial out-groups can have early and lasting effects on implicit racial bias.

T1  - Parenting Transgender Children in PFLAG
AN  - 1835699965
AB  - Parents of transgender children (N = 14) recounted four ways in which their parenting experiences were more difficult and isolating than those of other parents of a national GLBT support organization: the physical changes their children undergo, the lack of media representations of transgender lives, the effect of their child's gender transition on their identity as a parent, and the tensions involved in their child's successful transition in public settings. Parental isolation may be alleviated, however, by recognizing four unrecognized similarities shared among parents of GLBT children: adjusting to changes in their child's appearance, the process of grief and mourning, the tendency to hierarchically rank parental difficulties, and fears of being a bad parent. The isolation faced by parents of transgender children is imposed not only by antitrans prejudice and lack of information, but also by the unacknowledged and undiscussed ways in which a child's gender transition affects parental gender identities.

T1  - Judged by the Company You Keep? Exposure to Nonprejudiced Norms Reduces Concerns About Being Misidentified as Gay/Lesbian
AN  - 1837634981
AB  - Social contagion concerns, heterosexuals' fears about being misidentified as gay/lesbian, can lead to avoidant and hostile responses toward gay men/lesbians. We argue that apprehension about becoming the target of prejudice if misidentified as gay/lesbian contributes to contagion concerns. We hypothesized that exposing heterosexuals to others' nonprejudiced attitudes would reduce their contagion concerns. Consistent with these predictions, perceptions of peer prejudice statistically predicted contagion concerns, over and above personal prejudice (Study 1). In addition, participants exposed to a nonprejudiced versus a high-prejudiced norm (or control condition) expressed lower contagion concerns and less anxious/avoidant responses toward gay men/lesbians (Studies 2 and 4). Finally, exposure to fellow students' nonprejudiced views resulted in lower contagion concerns than a control group (Study 3) due to decreased concerns about becoming the target of prejudice if misidentified as gay/lesbian (Study 4). These results provide evidence that changing perceptions of others' prejudice can reduce contagion concerns.

T1  - Cultural Identification and Religious Identification Contribute Differentially to the Adaptation of Australian Adolescent Muslims
AN  - 1821766187
AB  - Australian Muslims are generally perceived as a devalued group in Australia and the public attitudes towards them are generally negative. This context raises questions about belonging and adaptation among Australian adolescent Muslims. The current study investigated how adolescent Muslims relate to their heritage culture, religion, and Australian culture, and which of these three factors is most important to adolescent Muslims' psychological and socio-cultural adaptation. The study employed a mixed-method design. A total of 321 high school Muslim students (149 males and 172 females) aged between 14 and 18 years completed self-report questionnaires, and a subset sample of 18 students in the same age range, evenly split between males and females, participated in semi-structured interviews. The study revealed a hierarchical pattern of identification among Australian adolescent Muslims, with attachment to their religion being the most important, followed by heritage culture identification and being Australian in third place. Australian adolescent Muslims' religious identification was perceived overall as more crucial to their socio-cultural and psychological adaptation, than their heritage culture identification or Australian identification. There was an overall modest contribution of Australian identification to adolescent Muslims' adaptation. This might be connected with the relatively less attachment they show to their Australian identity due maybe to perception of being the target of prejudice, an issue that can be addressed by implementation of prejudice reduction strategies.

T1  - The Impact of Victimization and Neuroticism on Mental Health in Young Men Who Have Sex with Men: Internalized Homophobia as an Underlying Mechanism
AN  - 1802422313
AB  - Sexual minorities experience greater mental health issues compared with heterosexuals due to minority stressors. This study focused on the impact of victimization and neuroticism on mental health in young men who have sex with men (YMSM) and the mediating role of internalized homophobia (IH). IH refers to when a sexual minority person internalizes social bias and develops a negative view of themselves, which is a likely process through which victimization and neuroticism impact mental health. Data were collected over three time points across 12 months, with 450 YMSM (mean age=18.9) and an 80.7 % retention rate. Two mediation analyses with bias-corrected bootstrapping using 1000 samples were conducted, controlling for age, race, and sexual orientation. Results revealed that victimization [F (9, 440)=4.83, p<0.001, R 
 
  2
 =0.09] and neuroticism [F (9, 440)=12.23, p<0.001, R 
 
  2
 =0.20] had a significant indirect effect on mental health via increased levels of IH. These findings show how external experiences of stigma and personality-level characteristics may impact YMSM in terms of their sense of self. Furthermore, these results support addressing social conditions that marginalize YMSM in order to promote better mental health through decreasing IH.

T1  - Youth experiences with multiple types of prejudice-based harassment
AN  - 1810529361
AB  - Despite prejudice-based harassment's associations with serious physical and mental health risks, research examining multiple forms of harassment among children/adolescents is lacking. This study documents the prevalence of prejudice-based harassment (i.e., harassment on the basis of gender, race/ethnicity, weight or physical appearance, sexual orientation, and disability status) among a large, statewide, school-based Midwestern U.S. sample of 162,034 adolescents. Weight-/appearance-based harassment was most prevalent among both girls (25.3%) and boys (19.8%). Adolescents from certain vulnerable groups experienced higher rates of multiple types of harassment, even when controlling for other sociodemographic characteristics. Prejudice-based harassment experiences are prevalent among adolescent girls and boys. Differential rates of each type of harassment are reported across groups within the corresponding sociodemographic status (e.g., white female adolescents report a significantly lower rate of race-based harassment (4.8%), as compared to Native American (18.6%), mixed/other race (18.9%), Hispanic/Latina (21.5%), Asian/Pacific Islander (24.2%), or Black/African American (24.8%) female adolescents); but a pattern of cross-harassment also is evident, such that differences in prevalence of each harassment type emerge across a variety of statuses (e.g., disability-based harassment was statistically significantly higher among discordant heterosexual (12.7%), gay (13.0%), bisexual (15.3%), and unsure (15.3%) male adolescents than among heterosexual male (7.2%) adolescents). Adolescents from specific sociodemographic groups are particularly vulnerable to certain types of harassment.

T1  - At the University but Not of the University: The Benching of Willis Ward and the Rise of Northern Racial Liberalism
AN  - 1924609775
AB  - "2 Kean's observation exposed the racial marginalization that black students confronted at the University of Michigan. Segregation and stratification withstood racial liberalism and the pro-integration ethos that accompanied it.3 At Michigan, lodging restrictions, institutionalized racial quotas, and racist ridicule from professors in the classroom, among other forms of racial prejudice, stood as salient reminders to the school's small black population of the gulf between their integration into a northern white institution and their attainment of full equality.4 Inclusion had its limits. Whereas Kean summed the experiences of all black students at the University of Michigan, nowhere was the battle for full inclusion more fraught than in sport. In other sports like swimming, gymnastics, and wrestling, they were unable to start joining those teams until the late 1950s and early 1960s when a newer wave of Michigan coaches began to discard the unwritten quota system for African Americans. In baseball, though Michigan's door was swung wide open by Moses "Fleetwood" Walker in 1882, only seven black men lettered in the sport, while no black athlete was permitted to play golf.6 In tennis, Kean became the second of only two African Americans to earn a letter in the sport in the university's history when he did so in 1934, following behind Henry Graham, who first achieved the honor in 1928. Nowhere was this gap between integration and inclusion more visible to Kean than during his senior season in 1934 when the university experienced its most embarrassing racial incident-the benching of Willis Ward,...

T1  - The Ever-Shifting Excuses for Demonizing Black People in America
AN  - 1800544259
AB  - Eric Garner is choked to death in Staten Island, New York. Michael Brown is executed in the streets of Ferguson, Missouri. Another year passes and many more unarmed Black men die at the hands of law enforcement. Brutality against people of African ancestry continues to be justified by the American establishment. As citizens, how do we make sense of the police killing of unarmed young Black men? How do we make sense of the ways in which these killings continue to be justified by the White establishment? How do we talk to a new generation of children in ways that will prevent the horrors of racial profiling against Black people from being replaced by White supremacist narratives of justification? This article examines the entrenched racism in a country that started with a Declaration of Independence written by slave-owners, and how so many White people of all ages, religions, classes, and regions can claim not being prejudiced against African Americans while, under the same breath, justifying the police killing of unarmed African American men. It criticizes the colorblind movement and proposes ways to move toward more powerful narratives of solidarity and redemption for the historical violence against Black people in America.

T1  - (B)Locked sites: cases of Internet use in three British prisons
AN  - 1774840829
AB  - Based on a qualitative scoping exercise in three British prisons, this article discusses digital inequalities experienced by prisoners and the potential opportunities that digital media in prisons offers for offender rehabilitation and resettlement. As they are currently denied access to online and social media that most of us take for granted, physically cut off from their communities, and unable to communicate with family and friends in ways that have become normal in society, we argue that prisoners experience profound social isolation and constitute one of the most impoverished groups in the digital age. Our results show that prisoners display high levels of both curiosity and enthusiasm as well as fear and reservation toward Internet-enabled technologies, depending on age and gender as well as the length of their sentence. On release from prison, they are not only faced with prejudice and poorer job prospects than the average citizen due to their criminal record, but their digital exclusion during incarceration may have compound effects and lead to supercharged digital and social exclusion. We argue that secure access would be highly beneficial to prisoners who pose a low risk to society, especially during the rehabilitation and release phases.

T1  - The Social Construction of Retirement and Evolving Policy Discourse of Working Longer
AN  - 1938516241
AB  - This article is concerned with the evolving social construction of older workers and retirement. Evolving and competing 'world-views' from public policy, and social advocacy of productive and vulnerable older workers, are described and critiqued. Contradictions and disjunctions, in terms of public policies aimed at changing employer behaviour towards older workers, are identified. It is argued that present representations of older workers have serious flaws that provide a weak basis for policy development and may not only undermine the prospects for overcoming prejudicial societal attitudes but may in fact strengthen them. It is further argued that sheltering older workers in employment placements will inevitably limit the extent and nature of their participation. Instead, the mainstreaming of their employment is justified, bearing in mind negative attitudes towards ageing.

T1  - Friends With Moral Credentials
AN  - 1816868285
AB  - People commonly reference minority friendships when expressing conceivably prejudiced attitudes. The prevalence of this strategy suggests a widespread belief that having minority friends makes one look less racist, but to date, there is little research demonstrating whether or not this is the case. White and Asian participants were presented with a Facebook profile depicting a White target who posted an anti-Asian statement. Being depicted with Asian friends (Study 1) or even verbally claiming that they had Asian friends (Study 2) reduced attributions of racism irrespective of whether they were being evaluated by White or Asian observers. Furthermore, the presence of Asian friends made the conceivably racist comments seem relatively benign, and observers were less offended and upset by them. The data suggest that minority friendships can partially offset costs associated with expressing prejudice.

T1  - The Dangers of Posthumous Diagnoses and the Unintended Consequences of Facile Associations: Jeffrey Dahmer and Autism Spectrum Disorders
AN  - 1749245347
AB  - Posthumous diagnoses are not uncommonly given to notorious public and historical figures by applying retrospectively, and typically in the absence of the individual being diagnosed, contemporary diagnostic criteria. Although this may be relatively easy and free of consequences when it concerns clear-cut medical conditions, it may have unintended repercussions in the case of psychiatric disorders by creating myths and perpetuating stigma. The case of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer is a typical example where a somewhat facile and almost syllogistic application of perhaps over-inclusive criteria may have contributed to the legend of solitary murderers as possibly suffering from an autism spectrum condition. Although there may be an understandable human need to explain abominable and heinous behaviors, the lack of the possibility to verify a diagnostic theory and the ill-advised attempt to make a diagnosis fit may de facto be the basis of prejudice and profiling that do not correspond to clinical reality. Although there is no doubt that the brain is the organ of behavior, the authors caution against a budding neo-Lombrosian approach to crime and criminality and against the all too common use of widely differing terms in the study of deviance, such as crime, delinquency, and aggression, the operational use of which, often used interchangeably even in association studies, often erroneously leads to further confusion.

T1  - How Does Intergroup Contact Affect Social Change? It's Impact on Collective Action and Individual Mobility Intentions among Members of a Disadvantaged Group
AN  - 1710569239
AB  - A current debate surrounds the issue of whether prejudice-reducing interventions such as intergroup contact may reduce resistance to unequal intergroup relations among disadvantaged groups. Addressing this question, this research investigates how positive contact with members of the advantaged group shapes action strategies to cope with disadvantage. Using survey data from a sample of Latino Americans (N = 112), structural equation modeling revealed that friendship contact with Anglo-Whites was overall negatively associated with interest in collective action. This relation was due to both reduced identification with the disadvantaged group and positive attitudes toward the advantaged group, which predicted reduced anger about inequality. Contact was also positively associated with an individual mobility orientation, a relation which was explained through increased perceived permeability. Individual mobility orientation did not, however, predict reduced motivation for collective action. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings for societal change and novel directions for future research are discussed.

T1  - Fostering diverse friendships: The role of beliefs about the value of diversity: GPIR
AN  - 1933572517
AB  - Encouraging dialogue between people of differing social backgrounds and beliefs can reduce prejudice and lead to greater appreciation of diversity, which in turn fosters attitudinally diverse friendships. We investigated how beliefs about the value of diversity relate to attitudinal diversity within relationship dyads. In a field study of naturally occurring relationship pairs in two neighborhoods of Boston (N = 89 dyads), participants completed measures of diversity beliefs and sociopolitical attitudes. People placed higher value on diversity in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood compared to people in the North End neighborhood, and relationship pairs were more attitudinally diverse in Jamaica Plain than in the North End. Attitudinal diversity within pairs was predicted by how highly the pair jointly valued diversity. Further, pairs' greater valuing of diversity in Jamaica Plain mediated the effect of neighborhood on attitude diversity. These findings suggest that individual differences in appreciation for diversity are meaningful predictors of diverse relationships.

T1  - When Prejudice Is Popular: Implications for Discriminatory Behavior
AN  - 1667300891
AB  - Prejudice and popularity represent two major areas of research. Yet studies have not considered whether prejudiced adolescents actually can be popular. Among 572 high school students (Mage = 15.80 years), the current study tested the association between popularity (based on sociometric peer nominations) and sexual prejudice against gay and lesbian individuals, moderated by gender and perspective taking. As hypothesized, the association was significant for males but not females, and it was significant for adolescents lower on perspective taking but not those higher on perspective taking. Moreover, adolescents who were popular and expressed strong sexual prejudice were more likely to engage in homophobic behavior than prejudiced adolescents who were less popular. Popular adolescents with strong sexual prejudice beliefs may be more prone to use homophobic behavior as a way to maintain their dominant position. Similarly, prejudiced adolescents who are popular may face less pushback for their engagement in homophobic behavior. Continued attention to the connection between sexual prejudice and popularity is important because of the high status, influence, and visibility of popular adolescents.

T1  - Anti-Islam or Anti-religion? Understanding Objection against Islamic Education
AN  - 2076972367
AB  - Opposition against the accommodation of Islam in Western societies is often attributed to a prejudice against Muslims. This overlooks the possibility that opposition against Islam could also be caused by a more general aversion towards religion and a desire for a stricter separation between the state and religion in general. Based on the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS) of 2012, the current study investigated the non-Muslim majority's attitude towards religious education preferences in German public schools. By applying a multinomial logit model, we examined to what extent Islamophobic, xenophobic and religious attitudes predict whether people (i) support the provision of Islamic education, (ii) prefer only Christian education or (iii) opt for no religious education at all. Results show that Islamophobic and xenophobic attitudes are relevant indicators of objection against the provision of Islamic education in particular, while religiosity and religious style determine whether people support having religious education in general. Furthermore, the effect of Islamophobia and xenophobia depends on religious style. With these results the current study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying resistance towards accommodating Islam in the public sphere.

T1  - BRAVE NEW WORLD OF BIOSOCIAL SCIENCE
AN  - 1700673721; 201527751
AB  - The last attempt to marry biological and social science occurred in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and at that time, the union did not go well. Neither biology nor social science was very well developed, leaving scientists in both disciplines ill positioned to make use of the two perspectives. The field of genetics, in particular, was in its infancy. The managed breeding of simple organisms such as sweet peas and fruit flies confirmed that something called 'genes' existed, that genetic traits could be inherited, and that gene expression depended on combinations of dominant and recessive genes; but no one knew what genes were made of or how genetic information was transmitted in the course of reproduction. Social science, for its part, had only recently been invented, and powerful statistical techniques, complex data sets, and sophisticated analytic models lay years in the future. As a result, there was much theorizing and little hard data analysis, yielding slow progress adjudicating between competing concepts and theories. This reality left ample room for fallible human scientists to project their own prejudices into the theoretical schemes they constructed, leading to a proliferation of competing schools of thought -- structuralist, functionalist, Marxist, Freudian, and Darwinian -- all with very different political implications. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Contact Theory in a Small-Town Settler-Colonial Context: The Reproduction of Laissez-Faire Racism in Indigenous-White Canadian Relations
AN  - 1654737239
AB  - This article builds on group position theory and the subcategorization model of intergroup contact by illustrating how, in a small-town settler-colonial context, contact tends to reproduce, rather than challenge, the inequitable racial structure. In Northwestern Ontario, Indigenous-settler relations are characterized by widespread intergroup marriage and friendship as well as pervasive prejudice and discrimination. Using 18 months of fieldwork and 160 interviews and surveys with First Nations, Metis, and non-Indigenous residents, I show that although contact is associated with less "old-fashioned" prejudice (i.e., overt categorical hostility), it does not necessarily eliminate whites' superior sense of group position. Even white individuals who have close Indigenous friends or spouses often express laissez-faire racism. Three mutually reinforcing social processes -- subtyping, ideology-based homophily, and political avoidance norms -- interact to sustain whites' sense of group superiority and justifications for racial inequity. These processes are facilitated by historical and structural conditions, in this case colonization and small-town dynamics.

T1  - Are Urbanites More Permissive? Germany's Urban Geography of Prejudice
AN  - 1700673218; 201526506
AB  - Traditionally, bowing to the migration history of Germany, larger proportions of foreigners live in major German cities than in other parts of the country. According to contact theory, famously developed by social psychologist Gordon Allport in the 1950s, intergroup contacts between different ethnic groups reduce prejudice. The main aim of the article is to examine whether the level of prejudice toward foreigners is lower among the German urban population due to greater contact opportunities and habituation among different ethnic groups in Germany's major cities, which reduces prejudice as well. The presented findings show, first, that prejudice is only slightly lower in the major cities. Second, this finding crucially depends on the quality of contacts. Only friendships between Germans and foreigners show a significant impact on reducing prejudice. Clearly, beyond the level of acquaintance with individual members of an out-group, only voluntary contacts are able to diminish prejudice. Third, in terms of spatial context effects, the switch between majority and minority group positions in residential areas appears to be a tipping point for prejudice, which means that even people with low levels of prejudice wish to live as the ethnic majority in their respective residential area.

T1  - Developmental Trajectories of Prejudice and Tolerance Toward Immigrants from Early to Late Adolescence
AN  - 1680155089; 201515952
AB  - Adolescence is an important period for the development of relationships between immigrants and non-immigrants, yet little is known about how problematic personality traits affect adolescents' relationships with and attitudes toward immigrants. This work identified the roles of intergroup relationships and one dimension of problematic personality traits, namely callous-unemotional traits, in the development of adolescents' tolerance and prejudice. Three annual measurements of a large community sample (N = 1,542) of non-immigrant adolescents (M age = 15.31 at first measurement; 50.2 % girls) were used to show that tolerance and prejudice toward immigrants represent two dimensions with distinct developmental trajectories from early to late adolescence. Callous-unemotional traits predicted fewer decreases in prejudice toward immigrants, yet were not directly associated with tolerance. Intergroup friendships predicted stronger increases in tolerance, which, in turn, predicted decreases in prejudice toward immigrants. Thus, tolerance and prejudice toward immigrants seem to be differentially influenced by social experiences and problematic personality traits. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Adoption meanings cultural construction: a semiotic process
AN  - 1728662189; 201535917
AB  - We searched to understand the process of meaning making about adoption, addressing a member of the extended family of a satisfactory case of adoption, using the theoretical and methodological foundations of Semiotics Cultural Psychology from idiographic orientation. We highlighted the dynamic between the meanings that exist in the collective culture, in transformation, and the personal meaning making. The construction of the meanings of adoption, even in a family whose adoption is accepted by all, is characterized by the existence of a constant tension and by the ambivalence between the collective culture - full of myths and prejudices shared in a system of redundant messages, but also reflecting a current process in which the adoption is presented as commendable and desirable - and the gradual construction of a personal culture. Some suggestions on useful directions for the work of guidance to prospective parents and adoption support groups are suggested. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Women who refuse to marry, polygyny, extended families and other 'anomalies': Alternative gendered visions of intimacy, love, family and community in Asia and the Pacific
AN  - 1718067509; 201533284
AB  - Gilbert Herdt has recently written of the limitations of applying categories of sexual dimorphism from contemporary science and society backwards and universally in the study of human bodies and ontologies. The categorisation of gender and sexuality as based on biological function and 'the reproductive paradigm,' he argues, has been demonstrated to be inadequate for understanding the diversity of human societies and relationships.[1] This issue of Intersections: Gender and Sexuality in Asia and the Pacific contributes to broader trends in the study of relationality, families, and communities through bringing together thought-provoking new research and case studies from across time, space and multiple disciplines in order to provide insight into the diversity of different forms of relationships and family composition throughout Asia and the Pacific. In these case studies, written by a group of international scholars and based on a variety of literary and ethnographic sources, heteronormative, monogamous relationships do not form the normative centre of nuclear family structures. Instead, we meet women who refuse to marry or who seek out alternative family affiliation; cultures where polygamy and concubinage may have been normative, but have been disrupted as forms of patriarchal oppression through individual agency; children who become children not through biological ties, but ritual and affective relationships; activists who seek to break down prejudice and imperialistic vocabularies and open up new spaces for acceptance and awareness.

T1  - Food Insecurity and Body Norms among Rural Guatemalan Schoolchildren
AN  - 1559005576; 201432157
AB  - The predominant hypothesis regarding the ecology of body image suggests that contexts of food insecurity foster positive evaluations of and preferences for fat bodies as they symbolize wealth, social and reproductive success, strength, beauty, and fertility. Yet, there are few studies that empirically test this relationship or examine how experiences of food insecurity influence perceptions of thin bodies. In this study, we examine the ecology of body norms among a group of primary schoolchildren in a semirural community in the Central Highlands of Guatemala. Specifically, we test the hypotheses that food insecurity predicts fat-positive or thin-negative evaluations of children's body size or, conversely, that food security predicts thin-positive or fat-negative evaluations. Utilizing a characteristic attribution task to measure positive and negative evaluations of average, thin, and fat bodies, we measure the strength of preference and prejudice for each body size. While we find a strong preference for average bodies and prejudice against both thin and fat bodies overall, food insecurity predicts children having very negative evaluations of thin bodies. These results suggest a different interpretation of the ecology of body norms as, rather than fostering fat-positive evaluations, food insecurity exaggerates biases toward thin bodies.

T1  - Moderators of the Relationship Between Masculinity and Sexual Prejudice in Men: Friendship, Gender Self-Esteem, Same-Sex Attraction, and Religious Fundamentalism
AN  - 1680152144; 201517805
AB  - Masculinity has been found to predict the sexual prejudice of heterosexual men against gay men. The present study investigated the role of four variables as moderators of the relationships between two masculinity constructs (endorsement of traditional masculinity ideology and gender role conflict) and sexual prejudice in men. The hypothesized moderators were: direct and indirect friendships with gay men, gender self-esteem, acknowledged same-sex attraction, and religious fundamentalism. A total of 383 men completed 8 scales plus a demographic questionnaire. Direct friendship strengthened the positive relationship between masculinity ideology and sexual prejudice, contrary to hypothesis. This finding could mean that high masculinity ideology scores reduced the likelihood that a man with many gay friends would let go of his prejudice. Direct friendship did not moderate the relationship between gender role conflict and sexual prejudice nor did indirect friendship moderate either relationship; however, both forms of friendship predicted prejudice, as hypothesized. Gender self-esteem strengthened the positive relationships between both masculinity variables and sexual prejudice as hypothesized. Same-sex attraction weakened the relationship between gender role conflict and sexual prejudice as hypothesized, but contrary to hypothesis did not moderate the relationship between masculinity ideology and sexual prejudice. Religious fundamentalism predicted prejudice, but showed no significant moderation. The results were discussed in terms of limitations and suggestions for future research and application. In conclusion, this line of investigation appears promising and should be continued and the present findings can be utilized in anti-prejudice social marketing campaigns and in counseling.

T1  - Incorporating Sociology into Community Service Classes
AN  - 1542001751; 201426674
AB  - Sociologists and instructors who teach about community service share an affinity for understanding and addressing social problems. While many studies have demonstrated the benefits of incorporating community service into sociology courses, we examine the benefits of incorporating sociological content into community service classes. The authors supplemented a community service course at a large public university with sociological theories, concepts, and analyses. Our data suggest that this integration increased student understanding of the social structural factors that adversely affect the populations they served, sharpened student awareness of the various forms of prejudice and discrimination against these populations, enhanced student appreciation of their own privilege within the community service continuum, and facilitated student awareness of how understanding the plight of populations in need makes community servants more capable and humane. We argue that with the rapid growth of interest in community service across college campuses, sociologists are ideally situated to provide beneficial training outside the confines of their classrooms.

T1  - Explorations of Intercultural Communication Barriers among the Students of College of Social Sciences and Law at Jimma University, Oromiya, Ethiopia
AN  - 1703413207
AB  - The exploration of intercultural communication barriers among the students of college of social sciences and law at Jimma University was conducted from October 2009 to 2011. The study based on qualitative descriptive one. The data collection methods were focus group discussion and in-depth interview. The research found that the barriers for intercultural communications among the students from various linguistic and cultural backgrounds were ethnocentrism, prejudice, past historical back drops, linguistics and socio cultural variations. Sometimes misunderstanding occurs due to cultural completion and political and social reality existing in at the national level at this time of the study. Lack of opportunities created by university structure was also considered as the proximate barriers for intercultural communication. Thus, the promotion of tolerance for diversity and multicultural competency has been recommended to be implemented to various level of schooling. Among these, the necessity of learning Afaan Oromo as a course starting from primary school was recommended by students. Moreover, continuous awareness creation program aimed at promoting diversity and tolerance has been expected from university.

T1  - The coexistence of Swabians and Hungarians in a village in near Budapest: An International Journal of Pure Communication Inquiry
AN  - 2088834147
AB  - The study takes the contact hypothesis of social psychology as its starting point and examines a Swabian-Hungarian ethnic village as an example. The contact hypothesis suggests that contact or interaction between members of different groups under the right circumstances diminishes prejudice and hostility between those groups and mitigates stereotyping and discrimination. However, for this effect to occur, certain conditions must be met: the parties should be of equal status, have a common goal, cooperate, receive the support of authorities and maintain a personal relationship, since this is the only way long-term success can be achieved. Pursuit of mutual assimilation, physical proximity and time can also help people to accept each other and adopt coexistence. These conditions have been met in the case of the Swabian and Hungarian ethnic groups living in the village of Dunabogdány. Social and political processes, Catholicism and the fact that the German language has been added to the local school curriculum have also contributed to the successful outcome.

T1  - Narrow imaginations: How imagining ideal employees can increase racial bias
AN  - 1504423941; 201405292
AB  - When people make important decisions, such as selecting a job candidate or graduate school applicant based on how well they fit with that imagined ideal. In two experiments we provide evidence that imagining the ideal has unintended consequences. Imagining an ideal candidate for a professional job led participants to preferentially imagine a White candidate (Experiment 1) and to preferentially hire a White candidate over a Black candidate with matched qualifications (Experiment 2). These effects were independent of explicit prejudice, suggesting that even low-prejudice individuals may be affected by this bias. However, an alternative imagery strategy-imagining a variety of suitable applicants-was effective at remediating the bias. In some cases discrimination may result not from prejudiced attitudes but from failures of the imagination. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Inter-Ethnic Neighbourhood Acquaintances of Migrants and Natives in Germany: On the Brokering Roles of Inter-Ethnic Partners and Children
AN  - 2076975954
AB  - Social scientists have long emphasised the importance of personal inter-ethnic contact for overcoming prejudices and enhancing social cohesion in mixed societies. But why do some people have more contact with their neighbours of other ethnicity? Using new data from a large-scale German survey, I analyse the brokering roles of children and inter-ethnic partners in explaining inter-ethnic neighbourhood acquaintances. Even on a contextual level, my results suggest that people living in regions with larger shares of children have more inter-ethnic neighbourhood acquaintances, which expands earlier findings on the general integrating function of children. However, I also argue that we should recognise brokering to be context-specific and exemplify this by showing how the brokering role of inter-ethnic partners is evident particularly in interaction with inter-ethnic encounters at local bars and restaurants, while that of children is evident particularly given their frequent inter-ethnic encounters in public parks and playgrounds. On a theoretical level, my results demonstrate the importance of studying the interaction of mechanisms in explaining personal (inter-ethnic) contact.

T1  - 'We are not criminals, we are just victims of circumstances': An exploration of experiences of Nigerian immigrants' men that married South African women in Johannesburg
AN  - 1448992706; 201343698
AB  - The world is full of ethnic, racial and religious divisions and intermarriage between members of different groups can be seen as an indication that divisions are overcome. Marriage is a union between individuals that imply family ties and social sanctioning. Similarly, intermarriage is considered to be a major pointer of overcoming social distance among groups and cohesion of societies. In other words, intermarriage has been argued to be a channel through which members of different groups relate and interact with one another in a more positive way and see each group as being socially equal without any form of prejudice or discrimination. However, intermarriages between Nigerian men and South African women exist in South Africa amongst the institutionalised xenophobia and anti-Nigerian sentiments. It is on this note that this study examines how Nigerian-South African couples negotiate and adapt to the discriminations directed towards Nigerian husbands by their friends and families, and how this changed the perception of their friends and families over time. The study is based on data gathered from a four-month ethnographic fieldwork in Johannesburg and the data were collected through participant observations and in-depth interviews of 15 Nigerian-South African couples, friends and families. This study also uses Alba and Nee's 'intermarriage and assimilation theory' in order to show how marriages between Nigerian men and South African women led to breakdown in xenophobic attitudes of wives' families and friends.

T1  - Patrolling Your Blind Spots: Introspection and Public Catharsis in a Medical School Faculty Development Course to Reduce Unconscious Bias in Medicine
AN  - 1356434460; 23681466
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Cultural Competence in Action: Multidisciplinary Perspectives on Four Case Studies              Cultural competence education has been criticized for excessively focusing on the culture of patients while ignoring how the culture of medical institutions and individual providers contribute to health disparities. Many educators are now focusing on the role of bias in medical encounters and searching for strategies to reduce its negative impact on patients. These bias-reduction efforts have often been met with resistance from those who are offended by the notion that "they" are part of the problem. This article examines a faculty development course offered to medical school faculty that seeks to reduce bias in a way that avoids this problem. Informed by recent social-psychological research on bias, the course focuses on forms of bias that operate below the level of conscious awareness. With a pedagogical strategy promoting self-awareness and introspection, instructors encourage participants to discover their own unconscious biases in the hopes that they will become less biased in the future. By focusing on hidden forms of bias that everyone shares, they hope to create a "safe-space" where individuals can discuss shameful past experiences without fear of blame or criticism. Drawing on participant-observation in all course sessions and eight in-depth interviews, this article examines the experiences and reactions of instructors and participants to this type of approach. We "lift the hood" and closely examine the philosophy and strategy of course founders, the motivations of the participants, and the experience of and reaction to the specific pedagogical techniques employed. We find that their safe-space strategy was moderately successful, largely due to the voluntary structure of the course, which ensured ample interest among participants, and their carefully designed interactive exercises featuring intimate small group discussions. However, this success comes at the expense of considering the multidimensional sources of bias. The specific focus on introspection implies that prior ignorance, not active malice, is responsible for biased actions. In this way, the individual perpetrators of bias escape blame for their actions while the underlying causes of their behavior go unexplored or unaccounted for.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A Diversity of Voices: The McGill 'Working with Culture' Seminars
AN  - 1356434419; 23549711
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Cultural Competence in Action: Multidisciplinary Perspectives on Four Case Studies              The Working with Culture seminar is offered as a course during the month long Annual McGill Summer Program for Social and Transcultural Psychiatry, attended by local and international participants each May since 1994. The article outlines some of the premises and pedagogical approaches of this clinically oriented biweekly seminar series with discussions and didactic teaching on cultural dimensions of mental health care. The course readings, seminar topics and invited speakers focus mainly on therapist client encounters constructed by the multiple voices with dimensions of psychiatric, social, historical, legal, ethical, political, systemic and intra-psychic domains. The dual leadership emphasizes the gaps and complementarity amongst voices, and it invites and supports a destabilizing decentering process and the creation of solidarities amongst participants. Applying a bio-psychosocial case study method, each 3-h seminar engages the participants in a critical dialogue on apprehending the enmeshment of social suffering with psychiatric disorders whilst examining the usefulness and the limits of cultural formulation models. The seminar working group and teaching approach acknowledges cultural hybridity as a dynamic process marked by continuous therapist attunement to uncertainty or 'not knowing' which implies a dethroning of an expert position.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Assessing the Dimensionality of Beliefs About Children's Adjustment in Same-Sex Families Scale (BCASSFS) in Chile
AN  - 1429624003; 201338078
AB  - The main purpose of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the Beliefs about Children's Adjustment in Same-Sex Families Scale (BCASSFS) (Frias-Navarro 2009), in terms of confirmation of internal consistency and dimensionality via confirmatory factor analysis. In addition, we set out to validate this scale using the Attitudes toward Lesbians and Gay Men (ATLG) Scale Cardenas and Barrientos (The Journal of Sex Research 45(2):140-149, 2008a). Finally, we divided our sample into categories with a view to creating a typology (Egalitarian, Normative opponents, Bigots, and Individual opponents). No research to date has confirmed the hypothesized factor structure of the BCASSFS in Latin American countries. Using data from a convenience sample obtained through the application of a survey of heterosexuals at a university in northern Chile (N=283), a model of two correlated factors was used and the fit indexes obtained. The results indicate that the BCASSFS is a valid and reliable scale for measuring beliefs about children's adjustment in same-sex families in Chile. Moreover, the findings indicated that responses to BCASSFS could be explained by two factors (individual opposition and normative opposition) and that the two factors were correlated. Finally, differences between "egalitarian," "normative opponents," "bigots," and "individual opponents" in the ATLG scale were examined, statistically significant differences being found between groups in the ATL and ATG subscales.

T1  - Public duty and private prejudice: sexualities equalities and local government

AB  - Rather than critiquing social institutions and practices that have historically excluded lesbians and gay men, as did earlier social movements in the 1960s and 1970s, since the 1990s the politics of sexuality has increasingly been about demanding equal rights of citizenship. These citizenship demands have, at least to a degree, been answered via a raft of recent legislation in the UK including the Adoption and Children Act 2002, Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003, Gender Recognition Act 2004 and the Civil Partnership Act 2004, and by associated changes in policy making and practice that emphasize 'Equality and Diversity'. In this article we consider how the implementation of sexualities equalities policies is related to processes of privatization and individualization. This is illustrated by using sexualities equalities work in local government as a case study to indicate how processes of change and resistance are aided by these processes. The article draws on findings from a study of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) equalities initiatives in local government in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which examined the views of those who now have a public duty to implement recent legislative and policy shifts and are obliged to develop equalities initiatives concerning 'sexual orientation' and 'gender reassignment'.

T1  - Why are teacher recommendations at the transition from primary to secondary education socially biased? A mixed-methods research
AN  - 1551002755; 201430206
AB  - The consequences of educational differentiation have been at the centre of research in sociology of education during the past decades. Processes of educational allocation have, however, received much less attention. Despite the fact that research has shown that teacher recommendations in France and Germany are partly determined by pupils' social background, studies that inquire into the causes of this social bias seem to be virtually inexistent. This study aims to examine whether teacher recommendations at the transition from primary to secondary education in Flanders (northern, Dutch-speaking part of Belgium) are also socially biased, and if so what causes these differentials in advice, using a mixed-methods design. We found the advice given by primary school teachers to be partly determined by pupils' social background. Analysis of the qualitative data suggests that teachers tend to evaluate pupils from low socio-economic status backgrounds less positively, due to their emphasis on specific pupil characteristics.

T1  - Other People's Racism: Race, Rednecks, and Riots in a Southern High School
AN  - 1347785360; 201320642
AB  - This article uses data drawn from nine months of fieldwork and student, teacher, and administrator interviews at a southern high school to analyze school racial conflict and the construction of racism. We find that institutional inequalities that stratify students by race and class are routinely ignored by school actors who, we argue, use the presence of so-called redneck students to plausibly deny racism while furthering the standard definition of racism as blatant prejudice and an individual trait. The historical prominence of rednecks as a southern cultural identity augments these claims, leading to an implicit division of school actors into friendly/nonracist and unfriendly/racist and allowing school actors to set boundaries on the meaning of racism. Yet these rhetorical practices and the institutional structures they mask contributed to racial tensions, culminating in a race riot during our time at the school. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Deadwood and paternalism: rationalizing casual labour in an Indian company town
AN  - 1364699642; 201323962
AB  - This article is based upon ethnographic research in the Indian company town of Jamshedpur, in the Tata Motors and Telcon companies. I relate the local shift towards casual labour since the 1990s to managerial discourses that rationalize this development. I argue that whilst flexible accumulation may represent a global transformation of employment regimes, the local implementation of this process relies upon a discursive continuity with the past. Referencing a historical language of cultural poverty, predominantly Bengali managers in Jamshedpur continue to claim paternal authority over their mainly Bihari employees, despite no longer fulfilling their traditional 'parental' roles vis-a-vis the provision of permanent employment. In the latter sections of the article, I discuss the managerial spectre of inefficient permanent workers; 'deadwood' whom it is perceived that casualization can prune from the workforce. I argue that whilst permanent employees may exhibit less commitment to the work process than their casual counterparts, their presence on the shop-floor suggests continuity with the company town ideal and forestalls resistance among casual workers. Far from disembedding labour from social relations, neoliberal employment regimes in Jamshedpur exploit company town paternalism and cultural prejudices. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - How Do U.S. Students Perceive Trans Persons
AN  - 1364703922; 201327807
AB  - This study explored undergraduate students' interpersonal responses, namely general feelings toward and desire for further social interaction with trans persons in a helping context. Secondarily, this study explored the relationship between participants' intrinsic empathy, interpersonal curiosity and interest in further interaction. Two hundred fifty-one undergraduates at a moderate sized university in the southeastern United States served as participants. In order to assess baseline levels of empathy and curiosity, participants in session 1 completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Scale (Davis 1983) and the Interpersonal Curiosity Scale (Litman and Pezzo 2007). One week later, during session 2, the same students assumed the role of a peer counselor and read 1 of 4 (male, female, male-to-female, female-to-male) randomly assigned versions of an intake form completed by a fictitious peer client. Each version was identical, with the exception of the gender identity of the peer client. Participants completed various measures of affect and interest in further interaction. Male participants reported less willingness to interact with, and the strongest negative feelings toward the FTM peer client. Men reported highest willingness to interact with the MTF client and showed the lowest negative reactions towards the MTF client. Female participants' scores on willingness to interact and on negative reactions were similar across all four intake form versions. Contrary to expectations, baseline levels of empathy and curiosity did not impact responses to gender expression. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the factors associated with anti-transgender prejudice particularly in the context of helping relationships. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Nonheterosexual Binational Families: Resilient Victims of Sexual Prejudice and Discriminatory Immigration Policies
AN  - 1551001970; 201430624
AB  - An unprecedented number of American citizens are facing the challenge of being in a non-heterosexual binational relationship. Although immigration laws are based on the principle of family unification, under current federal law lesbian, gay, and bisexual Americans cannot sponsor their same-sex foreign national partners for residency in the United States. Consequently, an estimated 36,000 couples face the threat of family separation because the narrow definition of 'family' used by U.S. immigration services excludes same-sex binational couples and their children. Despite the fact that family research indicates that long periods of separation have harmful effects on the family, immigration law continues to deny binational families the basic right of family unity afforded many of their heterosexual counterparts. Bi-national couples must learn how to function in a social system while dealing with heterosexism, overt discrimination, violence, and the psychological symptoms that result from helplessness. This article will explore the ways in which nonheterosexual binational families must struggle to keep their families together as a result of the discriminatory ways in which laws are constructed in this country. We propose that discriminatory immigration policies have neglected contemporary family research that describes the family as a diverse array of intimate systems that provide mutual care.

T1  - Intergroup contact, attitudes toward homosexuality, and the role of acceptance of gender non-conformity in young adolescents
AN  - 1492601233; 201400989
AB  - This study explored how contact with gay and lesbian persons affects adolescents' attitudes toward them, and whether this association is mediated or moderated by one's acceptance of gender non-conformity. We analyzed survey responses from 456 Dutch adolescents aged 12-15 who reported having no same-sex attractions. Data were collected in 2008 at 8 schools in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Preliminary analyses showed that contact with lesbian/gay persons outside of school was positively associated with attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. Multilevel analyses showed that acceptance of gender non-conformity mediated rather than moderated the relationship between intergroup contact and sexual prejudice in males. The effect of intergroup contact on females' attitudes toward lesbian women was no longer significant in multilevel analyses. The findings suggest that attention to both intergroup contact and acceptance of gender non-conformity would enhance our understanding of attitudes toward homosexuality in adolescents.

T1  - Older women and their representations of old age: a qualitative analysis
AN  - 1283637125; 201306246
AB  - In this article we shall be analysing the representations of old age and ageing made by three generations of older women with different life stories (single, married, children and childless). Our principal findings, based on a qualitative analysis of 25 in-depth interviews conducted with three generations of older women (65-74, 75-84 and 85 and older), mainly reveal their reluctance and even refusal to define themselves as 'older or elderly women', largely due to persistent stereotypes linking old age to dependency, social isolation and fragility. Aware of the social prejudice regarding women and old age, they reject it unanimously. Older women represent a challenge to these homogenising preconceptions of old age, which they, on the contrary, experience in a multitude of ways, often enjoyable. Their conceptions of 'ageing well' are diverse and do not correspond to a clinical definition of ageing. Their representations of 'ageing well' and of ageing express positive values of autonomy, independence, consistency and integrity, maintenance of physical and intellectual health, and being socially active so they can 'stay in the swing of things', in the continuum of their lives and future projects, rather breaking with contemporary life or existing on the margins of society.

The authors demonstrate how students in a three-day campus diversity program develop a sociological imagination despite not having a formal affiliation with the sociology department. In particular, students demonstrate a move from color blindness into racial consciousness and a shift from individual prejudice into institutional privilege when understanding both diversity issues and their own personal biographies. In short, despite not knowing the phrase, they develop a sociological imagination. While the goal is not to diminish the significance of traditional sociology classrooms, the authors argue that programs like theirs may diminish resistance to learning about privilege and inequalities once students enter the classroom. Such programs may also have the benefit of attracting students to the discipline and creating a more welcoming environment for related programs and events on campus. It is one model of public sociology that other campus communities may mirror outside of the traditional classroom environment. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Prejudice Against Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Coaches: The Influence of Race, Religious Fundamentalism, Modern Sexism, and Contact with Sexual Minorities
AN  - 1266146192; 201301027
AB  - In drawing from Herek's (2007, 2009) sexual stigma and prejudice theory, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among prejudice toward sexual minority coaches, religious fundamentalism, sexism, and sexual prejudice and to determine whether race affected these relationships. The authors collected data from 238 parents. Results indicated that Asians expressed greater sexual prejudice than Latinos and Whites, while African Americans expressed more religious fundamentalism than did Whites. There were also differences in the associations among the variables. For African Americans, sexism held the strongest association with prejudice toward sexual minority coaches. While for Asians and Whites, religious fundamentalism held the strongest association, contact with lesbian and gay friends was a significant predictor of prejudice for Asians, but not for the other groups. For Latinos, both religious fundamentalism and sexism were associated with sexual prejudice. The authors discuss the results in terms of theoretical and practical implications.

T1  - A Tale Of Two Theistic Studies: Illustrations And Evaluation Of A Potential Program Of Theistic Psychological Research
AN  - 1221412142; 201245663
AB  - Two empirical research studies are described that illustrate the potential value of joining conventional social science and theistic religion in a theistic program of psychological research. The first study shows how a theistic program of psychological research tweaks the existing psychological research on the formation of God attachment to include a new assessment, experiences of God. The results of Study indicate that experiences of God are an important predictor of theists' attachment to God, even when controlling for parental attachment. The second study exemplifies how theistic ideas can lead to a new program of psychological research, in this case research on implicit attitudes toward faith and science, and can generate new scientific instruments such as the modified Implicit Association Test used in this study. The results of Study 2 suggest that education and training in psychology may lead theistic psychology students to implicitly endorse a secular stereotype that they consciously reject. Implications of the findings of both studies are discussed and the heuristic value of a theistic program of psychological research is explored. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Prejudicial Distribution of the HPV Vaccine
AN  - 1030869732; 201229848
AB  - Release of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine on the market sparked controversy: Teen girls, sex, politics, religion, and cancer intersected in the push to inject the vaccine into arms. The focus of this paper is the mythology of the vaccine, and the means in which various standpoints have created a discourse about HPV vaccine. I draw my findings from a qualitative discourse analysis of the public discussion and debate about the vaccine, including such literature as biomedical journal articles, newspaper articles and opinion pieces, blogs, internet sites devoted to the HPV or other vaccines (both pro and anti), and pharmaceutical company literature, to explore manipulation in the discursive practices of collective representation. I do not intend to argue against HPV vaccine as a protection against cervical or other cancers. Certainly the vaccine is to be credited for saving women's lives, particularly in areas where access to preventive health care is low. Rather, this work explores the collective representations surrounding the vaccine. At issue is a medical intervention, yet this intervention is laden with social meanings. The HPV vaccine is the only vaccine to be targeted toward women. This targeting has resulted in a language of manipulation and, in the case of school-based mandates, outright coercion. The discourse is filled with a variety of threats to further the aim of powerful social groups, including those interested in vaccinating women, such as pharmaceutical companies, physicians, and public health, and those in protest of the vaccine, such as some fundamentalist religious groups and vaccine safety organizations.

T1  - Effects of Intergroup Conflict and Social Contact on Prejudice: The Mediating Role of Stereotypes and Evaluations
AN  - 1545066711
AB  - This study explored the mediating role of stereotypes and evaluations in the relationships between intergroup conflict, social contact, and behavioral intentions to engage in intergroup contact. The hypotheses, derived from realistic group conflict theory and intergroup contact theory, were tested on samples of Arab and Jewish high school students in the context of an ethno-racial intergroup conflict. As hypothesized, the less participants perceived a conflict between the groups, and the greater their past contact with out-group members, the more they were willing to engage in intergroup contact. Moreover, stereotypes and evaluations mediated these effects in the Jewish sample. The implications of these findings for the study of the mechanisms underlying prejudice are discussed.

T1  - Expert Testimony Regarding Child Witnesses: Does It Sensitize Jurors to Forensic Interview Quality
AN  - 902085214; 201123391
AB  - Does expert testimony on forensic interviews with children help adults distinguish between poorly conducted and well-conducted interviews? This study evaluates the effects of social framework expert testimony regarding child witnesses in a case involving allegations of child sexual abuse. A 2 (Expert Testimony: present or absent)*3 (Child Forensic Interview Quality: poor, typical, or good)*2 (Child's Age: 4- or 10-year-old) factorial design was used to examine whether expert testimony is prejudicial or beneficial to jurors (N=463). The results revealed that, without expert testimony, mock jurors did not consider the forensic interview quality when reaching a verdict. However, with expert testimony, mock jurors were more likely to render guilty verdicts if the interview quality was good versus poor. Further expert testimony increased mock jurors' knowledge about child witnesses. These findings suggest that expert testimony related to the impact of interview techniques on the reliability of children's reports may assist fact-finders in evaluating child abuse cases.

T1  - Journal peer review in context: A qualitative study of the social and subjective dimensions of manuscript review in biomedical publishing
AN  - 864098168
AB  - Peer- and editorial review of research submitted to biomedical journals ('manuscript review') is frequently argued to be essential for ensuring scientific quality and the dissemination of important ideas, but there is also broad agreement that manuscript review is often unsuccessful in achieving its goals. Problems with manuscript review are frequently attributed to the social and subjective dimensions of the process (e.g. bias and conflict of interest). While there have been numerous efforts to improve the process, these have had limited success. This may be because these efforts do not account sufficiently for all of the social and subjective dimensions of the process. We set out, therefore, to characterise the most salient social and subjective dimensions of the manuscript review process, from the perspective of practising reviewers and editors. Open-ended interviews were carried out with 35 journal editors, and peer reviewers in the UK, USA and Australia. It emerged from these interviews that reviewers and editors were conscious of a number of social and subjective influences on the review process including: a wide variety of motivations for participation, complex relations of power, epistemic authority and moral responsibility, and unavoidable prejudice and intuition. Importantly, these social and subjective influences were often viewed positively and were seen as expressions of, rather than threats to, editors' and reviewers' epistemic authority and expertise. From this we conclude that the social and subjective dimensions of biomedical manuscript review should be made more explicit, accommodated and even encouraged, not only because these dimensions of human relationships and judgements are unavoidable, but because their explicit presence is likely to enrich, rather than threaten the manuscript review process. We suggest a 'dialectical' model which can simultaneously accommodate, and embrace, all dimensions of the manuscript review process. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Two degrees of separation: A longitudinal study of actual and perceived extended international contact
AN  - 902083838; 201122122
AB  - Extended contact theory proposes that knowledge of ingroup-outgroup friendships leads to reductions of intergroup bias by reducing ignorance about the outgroup and intergroup anxiety, and by increasing awareness of positive outgroup exemplars (e.g., observation of friendly behavior towards an ingroup member), and inclusion of other in the self. Over a one-year period we examined extended contact among home country friends of international students who had direct contact with British people through their study period in Britain. This provides a stringent test of extended contact theory, both due to the longitudinal design, and the inclusion of both actual and perceived naturally arising extended contact. As predicted by extended contact theory, increases in extended contact over time predicted all variables but intergroup anxiety. There was also some evidence for (weaker) reversed causal influence between prejudice and other variables. Importantly, the quality of contact experienced by the direct contact sample (international students) predicted all dependent measures in the matched extended contact sample in their home countries. Results are discussed in terms of the promise of extended contact theory for intergroup relations. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Son Preference in Indian Families: Absolute Versus Relative Wealth Effects
AN  - 916898649; 21302027
AB  - The desire for male children is prevalent in India, where son preference has been shown to affect fertility behavior and intrahousehold allocation of resources. Economic theory predicts less gender discrimination in wealthier households, but demographers and sociologists have argued that wealth can exacerbate bias in the Indian context. I argue that these apparently conflicting theories can be reconciled and simultaneously tested if one considers that they are based on two different notions of wealth: one related to resource constraints (absolute wealth), and the other to notions of local status (relative wealth). Using cross-sectional data from the 1998-1999 and 2005-2006 National Family and Health Surveys, I construct measures of absolute and relative wealth by using principal components analysis. A series of statistical models of son preference is estimated by using multilevel methods. Results consistently show that higher absolute wealth is strongly associated with lower son preference, and the effect is 20%-40% stronger when the household's community-specific wealth score is included in the regression. Coefficients on relative wealth are positive and significant although lower in magnitude. Results are robust to using different samples, alternative groupings of households in local areas, different estimation methods, and alternative dependent variables.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - To be 'cool' or not to be 'cool': young people's insights on consumption and social issues in Rio de Janeiro
AN  - 862597929; 201111184
AB  - Given the importance of material goods consumption to young people and the perception that to be 'cool' is fundamental to identity construction, this study investigates consumption in relation to social, economic and cultural inequalities. Qualitative individual interviews took place in November 2005, in Rio de Janeiro, with 14 high school students, age range 16-18, from public and private schools, and diverse backgrounds. In the context of global changes, Brazil is pushed towards a more advanced economic development, though basic needs of most of its population are not met. Serious contrasts continually reinforce and reproduce social and economic inequalities, through prejudice and segregation based on race, gender, residence and origin. Poor youngsters face the challenges of living in a globalised but unequal society, such as inadequate education, transition from school to labour markets, unemployment and less social participation. The data suggested that consumption is important to provide the feeling of being 'cool', 'fitting in' and experiencing inclusion though inequalities are an obstacle to consumption. In divided societies, to consume or dream of consuming create illusions of belonging to different classes, and escaping from poverty; however, respondents argued that education is the most important factor for improving social and economic conditions.

T1  - Anti-Equality Marriage Amendments and Sexual Stigma
AN  - 896180754; 201121169
AB  - This article summarizes a stigma-based analysis of anti-equality marriage laws and campaigns. Three major themes are discussed. First, being denied the legal right to marry because of one's sexual orientation is an instance of stigma. Second, being the target of stigma is stressful, and the political campaigns surrounding anti-equality marriage amendments are a source of heightened stress for lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals. Third, structural and individual manifestations of sexual stigma are interrelated; the initial enactment and continuing existence of anti-equality marriage laws depend on the opinions and actions of the voting public. Social psychological knowledge can be useful for understanding heterosexuals' attitudes toward those laws. Building on findings from studies of prejudice and intergroup contact, suggestions are offered for future research on how individuals influence the opinions of their family and friends about marriage equality.

T1  - Caught between social and market considerations: a case study of Muhammadiyah charitable health services
AN  - 856405229; 201108401
AB  - A case study of Muhammadiyah's Islamic charitable health services in the islands of Java and Sumatra, Indonesia, was undertaken in 2008, to assess the impact of privatization of health care on this socially-oriented service provider, especially in terms of access for the poor. Findings presented here relate primarily to the effects on Muhammadiyah's maternal and child health and contraceptive services. In order to survive and thrive amidst private and public competitors, Muhammadiyah's primary care units, mostly consisting of maternal and child health centres and maternity clinics, when not closed altogether, have been directed toward providing curative hospital services, and more expensive and sometimes unnecessary treatment. A shift in the patient population away from the poor has also occurred, as market pressures transform this charitable enterprise into a commercial one, prejudicing reproductive health care and reducing access for those most in need. An improved stewardship role by government is needed to regulate the private sector, along with serious thinking about the future of primary and preventive care and health promotion, including for comprehensive reproductive health care. The neglect of these core primary care elements in Indonesia may worsen as privatization proceeds and profit considerations become more pressing with increased competition.

T1  - Patient Characteristics That Impact Tattoo Removal Resource-Allocation Choices: Tattoo Content, Age, and Parental Status
AN  - 1866473413
AB  - This study assessed characteristics that affect decisions about receipt of a tattoo-removal procedure among members of stigmatized groups. Two experiments, each with different participants, assessed how changes in characteristics of hypothetical patients described as having a tattoo that reduced employment prospects affected how participants allocated access to the procedure. Patient characteristics assessed were parental status, age, and tattoo content. Participants ranked prospective patients (all described as having an undesirable tattoo, and varied with respect to the aforementioned characteristics) on the priority for receipt of removal. Young patients with children, and with specific tattoo contents, were favored. Implications for prejudice against certain groups are noted.

T1  - Experiences of Young Bisexual Women in Lesbian/Bisexual Groups on MySpace
AN  - 859361405
AB  - This exploratory study examined Topic threads in Lesbian/Bisexual Groups on MySpace to examine how young biwomen self-identify in online exchanges with other bisexuals and lesbians, as well as what attitudes and beliefs about bisexuality emerge from those exchanges. Four Topic threads from three Groups suggested that young biwomen use social networking sites to connect with others and create inclusive communities for biyouth. Although acceptance of bisexuality was strongly endorsed by many, they were sometimes met with antagonism from their lesbian peers. Together with lesbian allies, they were able to challenge such prejudice but remain keenly aware of its existence. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Constructive feedback in cross-race interactions
AN  - 758124200; 201056727
AB  - In two experiments, White college students provided a local high-school student with feedback on her substandard college admissions essay, via electronic mail. Motivation to provide appropriate feedback was manipulated by alleging comparison to experts or novices. Experiment 1 compared feedback to White versus Black recipients, with the expectation that accountability would attenuate previously observed positivity biases in cross-race feedback. Experiment 2 manipulated concern about being prejudiced by providing false scores on an Implicit Associations Task (IAT)-type task; this experiment examined whether accountability plus attenuated concern about prejudice could encourage feedback to Blacks that was objectively helpful. Feedback characteristics included evaluative connotation, communication style, subjective feedback helpfulness and objective feedback quality. Findings generally supported these hypotheses. We discuss the implications of our findings for intergroup contact situations, including the potential pitfalls that face feedback-givers responding to superior performance.

T1  - Parochial geographies: Growing up in divided Belfast
AN  - 758123729; 201057861
AB  - This article explores the ways in which teenagers occupy and manage space in one divided community in Northern Ireland. Drawing on stories, maps and focus group discussions with 80 teenagers, from an interface area in Belfast, the article reveals their perceptions and experiences of divided cities, as risky landscapes. Teenagers respond to these risks in various ways, at times reiterating traditional sectarian prejudices and at times demonstrating resilience in coping with growing up in a risky location. In the process, young people develop strategies of resistance, which at times support, and at times undermine, the wider ideologies underpinning ethnic conflict in Northern Ireland.

T1  - THE COLOR OF CHILD MORTALITY IN BRAZIL, 1950-2000: Social Progress and Persistent Racial Inequality
AN  - 746422087
AB  - Now that racism has been officially recognized in Brazil, and some universities have adopted affirmative-action admission policies, measures of the magnitude of racial inequality and analyses that identify the factors associated with changes in racial disparities over time assume particular relevance to the conduct of public debate. This study uses census data from 1950 to 2000 to estimate the probability of death in the early years of life, a robust indicator of the standard of living among the white and Afro-Brazilian populations. Associated estimates of the average number of years of life expectancy at birth show that the 6.6-year advantage that the white population enjoyed in the 1950s remained virtually unchanged throughout the second half of the twentieth century, despite the significant improvements that accrued to both racial groups. The application of multivariate techniques to samples selected from the 1960, 1980, and 2000 census enumerations further shows that, controlling for key determinants of child survival, the white mortality advantage persisted and even increased somewhat in 2000. The article discusses evidence of continued racial inequality during an era of deep transformation in social structure, with reference to the challenges of skin color classification in a multiracial society and the evolution of debates about color, class, and discrimination in Brazil.
