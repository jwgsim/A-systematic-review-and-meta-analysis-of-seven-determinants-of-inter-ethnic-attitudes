T1  - Asian Americans and multiracial politics: the contribution and limits of racial triangulation theory
AN  - 2691145849
AB  - This article places Claire Jean Kim’s racial triangulation theory in the context of Kim’s other writings from the late 1990s and early 2000s. I analyze Kim’s theory not as an analytical framework of relational racialization, but as a guide to thinking through the basis of multiracial solidarity. I contend that the power of racial triangulation theory lay in the way it demonstrated how long-term alignments of interest among racial groups could emerge from differentiated racial positions. However, I also argue that Kim’s theory was limited in assuming that racialization was the most important determinant of group interest. Through a re-examination of the 1994 lawsuit filed by Chinese American parents against the San Francisco Unified School District, Ho v. SFUSD, I suggest that comparative race scholars ought to account for class and other power relations within racial and ethnic groups, relations that produce divergent sets of interests unaccounted for by the framework of racial politics understood in terms of racialization and rearticulation.

T1  - Intimate architectures: a cultural geography of doors
TT  - Arquitecturas íntimas: una geografía cultural de puertas
AN  - 2687963236
AB  - This article seeks to contribute to geography’s continued interest in architecture through a focus on the ‘intimate architectural space’ of the door. Its aims are threefold; the first section seeks to extend knowledge of the door within geographic literature as it becomes a key site in which ‘events are gathered’ and through which politics can be encountered; the second section takes a ‘minor theory approach’, using a range of non-western, feminist, and class-based perspectives, exploring the social and political affordances of the door through the themes of ‘body’ and ‘performativity’. Whilst the conclusion uses these discussions to demonstrate how intimate architectures might further develop our knowledge of built spaces, providing an additional framework to engage with the often-overlooked aspects of architecture. In doing so, the door is presented as a site that structures how we move and relate to our bodies in physical space; most notably that the door’s capacity as a barrier maintains a distinct exclusionary politics which reinforces class and racial divisions through the built environment.

T1  - Ethnic identity concealment and disclosure: Contexts and strategies
AN  - 2683928549
AB  - Ethnic minority group members’ responses to their prejudicial treatment can take several forms. One involves identity concealment (e.g., ‘passing’). In order to understand such a response, we must explore participants’ understandings of the interactional context before them, their meta‐perceptions of the identity others ascribe to them, and the varied meanings that identity concealment/non‐disclosure may have in that context. Our analysis of interview data (N = 30) obtained with Roma in Hungary reveals diverse forms of, and motivations for, the concealment of their Roma identity. Some participants reported examples of proactive identity concealment, others reported more reactive forms (in which they went along with others’ mistaken assumptions concerning their identity). The motivations for identity concealment (whether proactive or reactive) included the desire to: secure material benefits; avoid conflict; take pleasure from seeing others’ assumptions blinding them to the reality before them; test (and expose) majority group members’ attitudes; allow themselves opportunities to experience the world in new ways. Our analysis highlights the importance of social identity researchers recognizing the diverse motivations for ethnic identity concealment: From the actors’ perspective concealment is not always assimilatory, and in some contexts can be experienced as empowering.

T1  - Multiethnic intergenerational perspectives on interethnic marriages in Peninsular Malaysia: The challenge of ethno‐religionist identity
AN  - 2675939572
AB  - Against the background of a long history of acceptance of transmigration from various parts of the world and interethnic marriages being embraced, political agendas that prevailed following the independence of Malaysia culminated in a society with increasing ethnic polarisation impacting on social cohesion and reports of aversion to interethnic marriages. This study is aimed at exploring the perspectives of people who have lived through the different socio‐political changes impacting on the social fabric. Using an exploratory cross‐sectional qualitative design, 36 participants from the three main ethnic groups, across three generations (Baby Boomers, Generation Xers, and Millennials) were interviewed to explore their views on interethnic marriages in Peninsular Malaysia. Iterative questioning was adopted to enhance reliability of data, which were processed by thematic analysis. Although each of the generational groups had different lived experiences, the findings indicate commonalities identified in terms of two main themes, i.e., challenges and facilitators. The predominant perception is the challenge of religion conversion required by non‐Muslims in relationships with Muslims. The issue of ethnicity did not arise as of concern amongst the different ethnic groups from this urban sample. Of significance is the heightened ethno‐religionist consciousness with implications on social cohesion for community relations and nation building.

T1  - Violent peace: community relations in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) in Bangladesh after the Peace Accord
AN  - 2691609339
AB  - The 1997 Peace Accord in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) promised to bring an end to decades of violence in the region. However, 25 years later, the region is still experiencing social conflict between indigenous Pahari people and Bengalis, who have migrated and settled in large numbers since the 1970s. This paper examines the reasons for the continuation of social conflict through a survey on community attitudes and relations. The survey findings show that the legacy of migration and conflict in the CHT is still evident in starkly different views on resources, conflict, and community relations. These findings support the argument that the migration of people with different ethnic backgrounds into regions inhabited by ethnic minorities causes competition for resources that may generate conflict and violence with long-lasting consequences.

T1  - Not to mislead peace: on the demise of identity politics in Iraq
AN  - 2669433770
AB  - By drawing on theories of transition to democracy, social value shifts and recent studies on Iraqi politics and society, this article offers a critical standpoint on the alleged demise/death of identity politics in Iraq. The article suggests that the sort of societal transformation that is indispensable to the demise of ‘aggressive sectarianism’, ethnic nationalism and the oppression of minority groups has not yet occurred. Any value changes favouring the consolidation of citizenship values and the formation of an Iraqi identity require, among other conditions, a stable, sustainable and steady move towards democratisation, good governance and a broader, often lengthy, process of social and economic transformations. The article therefore contends that any attempt at peace in the country necessitates addressing peace as (1) a fundamental matter of governance and (2) an everyday practice in the local terrain. Regarding state-building and governance, the article suggests that ‘rectifying’ the post-2003 trend may have adverse consequences should the process run in the direction of retreat from democracy and a rigid re-centralisation of the country. While Iraq’s ‘the local’, increasingly vibrant, its constructive impacts on formal politics and peacebuilding, remain uncertain.

T1  - Protecting America’s borders: Christian nationalism, threat, and attitudes toward immigrants in the United States: GPIR
AN  - 2638250339
AB  - Attitudes toward immigrants and immigration policies are divisive issues in American politics. These attitudes are influenced by factors such as political orientation and religiousness, with religious and conservative individuals demonstrating higher prejudice toward immigrants and refugees, and endorsing stricter immigration policies. Christian nationalism, an ideology marked by the belief that America is a Christian nation, may help explain how religious nationalist identity influences negative attitudes toward immigrants. The current research addresses this through four studies among participants in the US. Across studies, our results showed that Christian nationalism was a significant and consistent predictor of anti-immigrant stereotypes, prejudice, dehumanization, and support for anti-immigrant policies. These effects were robust to inclusion of other sources of anti-immigrant attitudes, including religious fundamentalism, nationalism, and political ideology. Further, perceived threats from immigrants mediated the relationship between Christian nationalism and dehumanization of immigrants, and attitudes toward immigration policies. These findings have implications for our understanding of the relations between religious nationalism and attitudes toward immigrants and immigration policy in the US, as well as in other contexts.

T1  - Strengthening everyday peace formation after ethnic cleansing: operationalising a framework in Myanmar’s Rohingya conflict
AN  - 2633575746
AB  - The concept of everyday peace largely draws on research that, to date, has sought more to explain observed social practices than inform peace interventions. This paper presents a case study of an attempt to operationalise the concept into local non-governmental organisation (NGO) programming, seeking to strengthen the formation of everyday peace between Rohingya and Rakhine communities in Myanmar after recent ethnic cleansing. This is believed to be the first attempt to operationalise everyday peace into NGO practice. The programme incorporates everyday peace components into an existing bottom-up development programme based around Freirian conscientisation, seeking to raise critical awareness of eight social practices seen to constitute everyday peace practice: avoidance, watching/reading, ambiguity, shielding, civility, reciprocity, solidarity and compromise. The paper presents and analyses new field data collected two years into implementation, comprising interviews with 15 local NGO staff/facilitators, and 12 focus groups (gender-segregated) with 84 participants from both Rohingya and Rakhine villages. The paper finds evidence of increased utilisation of these social practices and improved inter-village relations, even in the absence of macro-level peace efforts. While no panacea, and not as yet addressing the deep inequalities, injustices and vulnerabilities between Rohingya and Rakhine communities, this paper finds the approach has contributed to peace formation in this context.

T1  - Nursing students’ experience of learning cultural competence
AN  - 2611125163
AB  - Introduction 
European societies are rapidly becoming multicultural. Cultural diversity presents new challenges and opportunities to communities that receive immigrants and migrants, and highlights the need for culturally safe healthcare. Universities share a responsibility to build a fair and equitable society by integrating cultural content in the nursing curricula. This paper aims to analyze European student nurses´ experience of learning cultural competence and of working with patients from diverse cultural backgrounds.
 Materials and methods 
A phenomenological approach was selected through a qualitative research method. 7 semi-structured focus groups with 5–7 students took place at the participants’ respective universities in Spain, Belgium, Turkey and Portugal.
 Results 
5 themes and 16 subthemes emerged from thematic analysis. Theme 1, concept of culture/cultural diversity, describes the participants’ concept of culture; ethnocentricity emerged as a frequent element in the students’ discourse. Theme 2, personal awareness, integrates the students’ self-perception of cultural competence and their learning needs. Theme 3, impact of culture, delves on the participants’ perceived impact of cultural on both nursing care and patient outcomes. Theme 4, learning cultural competence, integrates the participants’ learning experiences as part of their nursing curricula, as part of other academic learning opportunities and as part of extra-academic activities. Theme 5, learning cultural competence during practice placements, addresses some important issues including witnessing unequal care, racism, prejudice and conflict, communication and language barriers, tools and resources and positive attitudes and behaviors witnesses or displayed during clinical practice.
 Conclusion 
The participants’ perceived level of cultural competence was variable. All the participants agreed that transcultural nursing content should be integrated in the nursing curricula, and suggested different strategies to improve their knowledge, skills and attitudes. It is important to listen to the students and take their opinion into account when designing cultural teaching and learning activities.

T1  - EVERYDAY RACISM IN SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
AN  - 2597482428
AB  - Since the 1980s, everyday racism has gained ground within the social sciences. However, the theory of everyday racism has not been properly adopted and, consequently, varies across different research fields. The main goal of this study is to improve the scientific rigor within research on everyday racism in the human and social sciences. Following a review of the ground-breaking work of Philomena Essed, three main components in everyday racism literature are theoretically distilled and conceptualized: (1) repetitiveness and familiarity, (2) racism and (3) the interdependent link between micro-interactions and macro-structures. This is followed by a critical assessment of what everyday racism means and how it is assessed in research today, by performing a systematic electronic review of qualitative-methods papers. We make three suggestions towards a more complete and sophisticated understanding of everyday racism. Firstly, the concepts of everyday racism and microaggressions need to be disconnected from each other. Secondly, research should focus more on the symbiotic relation between micro-interactions and macro-structures and should also identify relevant situational features at the spatial meso-level. Lastly, it is important to be cautious of the pitfall of cultural determinism that is still a popular perspective in today’s field of (everyday) racism.

T1  - National pride, social trust, and cultural nativism: Findings from East and Southeast Asia
AN  - 2592350518
AB  - Using the latest (fourth) wave of Asian Barometer Survey (2014–2016), this study examines how national pride and two types of trust (general and particular) are related to nativist preference (cultural nativism), independent of anti-immigration attitudes, among citizens in East and Southeast Asian countries. Findings from multilevel models show that, at the individual level, national pride and particular trust are positively related to cultural nativism, while general trust is negatively related. At the subnational-regional level, we also find significant contextual effects. Living in geographic areas with greater national pride is positively associated with nativist preference, as is residency in places with higher levels of particular trust. In contrast, residency in subnational contexts with higher levels of general trust is negatively associated. Finally, the association between national pride and cultural nativism is stronger in regions with greater contextual national pride.

T1  - Physical Conflict During Pregnancy: A Socioecological, Cross-Cultural Examination of Risk and Protective Factors for New Zealand Women
AN  - 2558388660
AB  - Participants were 5,831 women in their third trimester of pregnancy, part of a large, longitudinal, pre-birth national cohort study. Women reported on their experience of pushing and shoving, throwing or breaking objects within their relationship over the past month. Univariable regression models examined the association of a large number of potential risk and protective factors. Those significant at the univariable level were carried forward into final multivariable analyses, stratified by New Zealand’s four main ethnic groups: European, Māori, Pacific, and Asian peoples. Relationship commitment, reduced family cohesion, and perceived stress were associated with increased risk across ethnic groups.

T1  - Perspective taking in conflict settings: Can perspective taking smooth tensions between Trump and Clinton supporters in the aftermath of 2016 U.S. presidential election?
AN  - 2550671276
AB  - Can perspective taking improve intergroup attitudes in conflict contexts? How does a context of conflict shape people's responses to perspective‐taking tasks and their ultimate effectiveness? The present study addressed these questions by examining the effect of perspective taking (compared with a perspective giving and a control condition) on intergroup attitudes between Trump and Clinton supporters (N = 537) one month after the 2016 presidential election. Perspective taking had positive effects on some intergroup attitudes: It increased warmth toward the outgroup (thermometer ratings), outgroup tolerance, perceived similarities between groups, and marginally increased positive outgroup evaluation. This study also sheds light on the mechanisms that might reduce the effectiveness of perspective taking in conflict settings by assessing the content and the effects of the induced perspectives in response to perspective‐taking task. About half of the induced perspective‐taking narratives involved negative views of the other, which were associated with worse intergroup outcomes. In addition, higher perceived intensity of the conflict between Trump and Clinton supporters and more negative emotions about the election outcome predicted more induced negative perspectives as a response to the perspective‐taking task. In turn, negative perspectives were associated with more negative intergroup attitudes. To sum up, while perspective taking had an overall positive impact on intergroup attitudes in this conflict setting, its impact seems to be contingent upon the content of induced perspective‐taking narratives.

T1  - Exploring relative deprivation theory in the rice industry: Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) in northern Ghana
AN  - 2555685945
AB  - The determinants of adoption of technologies are mostly focused on socio-economic and demographic characteristics of farmers, overlooking the impact of corruption and preferential treatments (partisanship, nepotism and tribalism). We extend technology adoption predictors to include preferential treatment, and the results are explained with Relative Deprivation Theory. We used survey data collected from participants and nonparticipants of Planting for Food and Jobs (PFJ) programme in 2019. Respondents were rice farmers from three regions (Northern, Savannah and North-East regions) of Northern Ghana. We analysed the data using Systematic Probit Regression model after satisfying variables differential and correlation assumptions. The results revealed that while partisanship and tribalism are significant inverse factors, corruption is an insignificant negative determinant of participation in PFJ. We find nepotism to have a strong positive correlation with participation in PFJ. We recommend that government should plug all the loopholes facilitating corruption and preferential treatment if it intends to increase participation and rice productivity effectively.

T1  - Colour-blind attitudes of students at the North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus
AN  - 2513920539
AB  - Background: Colour-blind attitudes deny racial dynamics and can lead to resistance to transformation because there seems to be no need for it. This study investigated these attitudes amongst students at a university campus engaged with implementing its transformation agenda.
Aim: Using a survey, the research determined the prevalence of colour-blind attitudes amongst students and evaluated the social factors that may have contributed to these attitudes.
Setting: The research was conducted amongst undergraduates at the North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, South Africa, in 2017.
Methods: A literature review was conducted around the occurrence of colour-blind attitudes amongst students and the associated social factors. Race, gender, racial prejudice, just-world beliefs and social dominance orientation in particular were found to contribute to colour-blind attitudes. A quantitative survey was then conducted amongst a quota sample of 300 students. The data collected on the social factors and colour-blind attitudes were statistically analysed.
Results: The students’ colour-blind attitudes were found to be moderate. The social factor of race correlated significantly with colour-blind attitudes, but gender did not. Racial prejudice presented a medium correlation with colour-blind attitudes but just-world beliefs and social dominance orientation only a small correlation.
Conclusion: Colour-blind attitudes at the campus were related to race and racial prejudice. This demonstrates the need for students to be offered room to openly discuss and engage with race and issues concerning race. The difference between the findings in this study and extant literature indicates a necessity for further qualitative research to gain a more comprehensive understanding about racial issues amongst students at the North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus.

T1  - Perceptions of Not Equally Tolerable Discriminations: Is Personal Experience so Decisive?
AN  - 2472327776
AB  - Discrimination is nowadays more frequently perceived, whilst not always readily identifiable. This study extends previous research on perceived discrimination by examining, simultaneously, the effects of both direct and indirect personal experiences of discrimination, together with sociodemographic variables (conservatism and social status), on the perception of group‐based discriminations; in addition to the mediating role of discriminatory outgroup attitudes. All of this comparing discriminations that are not understood as equally tolerable (race–nationality vs. age–disability discriminations), in two different nationwide surveys (2013 and 2016), and applying multigroup structural equation modelling. The final models showed different patterns, depending on the type of perceived discrimination. Whilst the effects of experiences were similar in both models, those as a result of sociodemographic variables differed, coupled with the interrelation between outgroup attitudes and perceived group‐based discrimination. Discriminatory attitudes showed to be what most affected both types of perceived discrimination, although in opposite directions.

T1  - “Racism is a perfect crime”: <i>favela</i> residents’ everyday experiences of police pacification, urban militarization, and prejudice in Rio de Janeiro
AN  - 2452378730
AB  - This article examines residents’ everyday experiences and perceptions of changing urban politics and racism in a “pacified” favela, or poor informal neighbourhood, in Rio de Janeiro, drawing on longitudinal ethnographic data from 2011 to 2018. The findings suggest that despite a discourse on inclusion, human rights, and citizenship, the police pacification program and urban security interventions aimed at “civilizing” the favela’s residents as “undesirable others,” drawing on racialization. The naturalization, legitimization, and reproduction of police violence promote the operation of racial and socio-spatial inequalities and privileges through what I describe as pigmentocratic everyday practices. These processes continually shape the condition of possibilities for the dehumanization of blackness, exclusion, inclusion, and resistance in a society influenced by the myth of racial democracy and that celebrates both diversity and ideologies of whitening.

T1  - Latina dreamers, the current political era, and what educational leaders need to know
AN  - 2472171845
AB  - In this article we present thematic analyses of semistructured interviews with three Latina undergraduate students who are first-generation college and who also self-identify as "Dreamers" and as DACA recipients. The interview data used to inform this article stem from 2 larger qualitative studies in which we applied social constructivist epistemology to interpret the participants' perspectives and experiences associated with their schooling. In addition, we discuss broadly the impact of the current political climate on the 3 participants' lives, and how the intersectionality of racial oppression and social class inequality create barriers for them. We also explore the unique family and interpersonal relationships that the Latina participants face when attaining an education and how they may influence their educational aspirations. We couch the perspectives and experiences of these self-identified Latina Dreamers in the current charged political era, where anti-immigrant sentiment, and especially anti-Latinx sentiment, continues to emanate from the nation's highest office. Our findings are structured into 4 themes including Educational Goals and Aspirations, Unable to Find Targeted Assistance, Culture Shock on Campus, and Political Influence on Campus. Recommendations for educational leaders in K–12 and higher education environments are provided.

T1  - Discrimination, depression, and anxiety among college women in the Trump era
AN  - 2457235684
AB  - This research examines the association between racial/ethnic discrimination and mental health among women university students in light of the increase in racially motivated hate crimes since the 2016 United States presidential election. A cross-sectional survey design was implemented at a mid-sized public university between November, 2017 and May, 2018. The sample included 391 women university students (159 Women of Colour and 232 White women). Quantitative data were analysed with path analysis and open-ended responses were analysed with constant comparative analysis. Findings highlight the potential impact of racial/ethnic discrimination on the mental health of women university students. Women of Colour reported more racial/ethnic discrimination and more frequent symptoms of depression and anxiety than White women. Moreover, discrimination predicted worse mental health directly and indirectly via reduced resiliency, a protective factor against depression and anxiety. Open-ended responses provided further insight into the environment of discrimination experienced by students. Women students described a resurgence of racism, nativism and white supremacy and increased hate, conflict, and division since the Trump administration took office. Perceptions of increased exposure to racial/ethnic discrimination since the 2016 presidential election are associated with worse mental health among women university students, particularly Women of Colour.

T1  - The two solitudes of Canadian nativism: Explaining the absence of a competitive anti‐immigration party in Canada
AN  - 2478233339
AB  - Canada has been celebrated in popular and academic work for its relative immunity to nativist populism. No competitive nativist party has recently emerged in federal politics that challenges the mainstream consensus around mass immigration, unlike virtually every other postindustrial democracy. This paper argues that existing explanations for this “exceptionalism” are lacking. In particular, they fail to appreciate the importance of Quebec nationalism in contributing to this outcome. Quebec nationalism fractured the stronger anti‐immigration sentiment found in rural and smaller urban areas in both Quebec and Anglophone Canada and thereby prevented right‐wing parties from mobilising that sentiment in a way that could feasibly win elections. This forced such parties to moderate their message and court “ethnic voters” in suburban ridings around Toronto and Vancouver. We illustrate this argument using novel data which permit a comparison of the Canadian experience with nativist politics in Australia and New Zealand.

T1  - Games of Belonging: Football, Boundaries and Politics between Germany and Turkey
AN  - 2546607854
AB  - International football is a field for national identity performances in which narratives of national belonging are articulated. Games of belonging capture discourses on and debates over national belonging. Up-and-coming national football team diversity, and its public promotion, was expected to facilitate boundary blurring in the politics of belonging; however, it caused highly contentious debates revolving around the question of who belongs to Germany and Turkey and who does not. For this reason, we ask how (ethnoculturally) diverse national football teams challenge established narratives of national belonging and, thereby, trigger debates over national belonging across time and space. We compared the media discourse on national team diversity in Germany and Turkey with a special focus on players who disrupt conceptions of ethnic and cultural homogeneity, namely Mesut Özil and Nuri Şahin. Our study illustrates that upcoming international football events constitute games of belonging. Actors from the media, football associations, and politics largely demanded unilateral national belonging from the disrupters, Özil and Şahin. Both players’ reactions, however, draw on conceptions of (trans-)national belonging which challenge and conflict with established narratives of (ethno-)national belonging.

T1  - Ethnically Diverse Adolescents Recount Third-Party Actions That Amplify Their Anger and Calm Their Emotions After Perceived Victimization
AN  - 2409933929
AB  - Third-party adolescents (those aware of peer conflict as neither aggressors nor victims) can help shape their peers’ emotional responses to perceived victimization. Emotion regulation promotes resilience for those who have been victimized, and heightened anger can exacerbate negative outcomes. This study sought to understand how ethnically diverse victimized adolescents described third-party actions that amplified their anger and calmed their emotions—and whether there were gender, racial/ethnic, or school-level patterns. Data were drawn from 264 structured interviews using a multi-method, repeated measures design. Participants were 66 African Americans, 57 European Americans, 64 Mexican Americans, and 77 Native Americans from the Northwest United States. Open- and process-coding identified 16 themes that described third-party actions, and pattern coding provided insight into why particular actions may be perceived as anger-amplifying or calming. Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests on action frequencies revealed five actions (e.g., co-ruminating) that were associated with amplifying victims’ anger and eight actions (e.g., reassuring) that were associated with calming victims’ emotions. Group patterns were examined using chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests. Programs and interventions may draw on these qualitative accounts of victimized adolescents’ experiences to illustrate how third-party actions might differentially impact peers during or after aggressive incidents.

T1  - What children want to know about in‐ and out‐groups, and how knowledge affects their intergroup attitudes
AN  - 2388834772
AB  - One of the key factors contributing to the development of negative attitudes toward out‐groups is lack of knowledge about them. The present study investigated what type of information 3‐ to 4‐ and 5‐ to 6‐ year‐old Jewish Israeli children (N = 82) are interested in acquiring about unfamiliar in‐ and out‐group individuals, and how providing children with the requested information affects their intergroup attitudes. Children were shown pictures of individuals from three groups—an in‐group (“Jews”), a “conflict” out‐group (“Arabs”), and a “neutral” out‐group (“Scots”)—and were asked what they would like to know about them. The experimenter responded by either answering all of children's questions, half of the questions, or none. Children's attitudes toward the groups were also assessed. It was found that children asked the most questions in regard to conflict out‐group individuals. Moreover, the older age group asked more questions regarding the psychological characteristics, and fewer questions regarding the social identity, of the conflict out‐group than of the other two groups. Finally, full provision of information improved attitudes toward the groups, especially among 3‐ to 4‐year olds, and especially regarding the conflict out‐group. These findings have implications for understanding the sources of intergroup biases, and for developing interventions to reduce them.

T1  - Emotional Numbing and Lessons Learned after a Violent Conflict – Experimental Evidence from Ambon, Indonesia
AN  - 2378956024
AB  - The consequences of violent conflict remain puzzling, with some studies suggesting discrimination, others discovering increased prosociality, and others finding evidence for reduced prosociality. We solve this puzzle with results from dictator, ultimatum, and trust games run with Muslim and Christian students in post-conflict Ambon, Indonesia. We find that discrimination is only moderate and that the reaction of prosociality is context-specific. Prosociality is low if we reveal the counterpart’s religious or ethnic identity and is high if it is not revealed. Our effects are particularly strong if subjects had been victimised during the conflict. We argue that revealing the identity inhibits the lessons learned from the conflict and brings about emotional numbing because revealed identities remind subjects of the conflict. Such religious and ethnic cues can thus make conflict salient. We infer that avoiding such cues is important for peace reconciliation as well as economic and social development.

T1  - A large-scale test of the link between intergroup contact and support for social change
AN  - 2556549469
AB  - Guided by the early findings of social scientists, practitioners have long advocated for greater contact between groups to reduce prejudice and increase social cohesion. Recent work, however, suggests that intergroup contact can undermine support for social change towards greater equality, especially among disadvantaged group members. Using a large and heterogeneous dataset (12,997 individuals from 69 countries), we demonstrate that intergroup contact and support for social change towards greater equality are positively associated among members of advantaged groups (ethnic majorities and cis-heterosexuals) but negatively associated among disadvantaged groups (ethnic minorities and sexual and gender minorities). Specification-curve analysis revealed important variation in the size—and at times, direction—of correlations, depending on how contact and support for social change were measured. This allowed us to identify one type of support for change—willingness to work in solidarity— that is positively associated with intergroup contact among both advantaged and disadvantaged group members.Using data from 69 countries, Hässler et al. show that intergroup contact and support for social change towards greater equality are positively associated among members of advantaged groups, but negatively associated among disadvantaged groups.

T1  - Governing superdiversity: learning from the Aboriginal Australian case
AN  - 2407556808
AB  - Like many nations, Australia is becoming superdiverse. Influenced by international conflict, tourism, migration and other global transfers, minorities proliferate and enjoy multiple intersecting affiliations associated with ethnicity, religion, language, class, transnational ties and more. Though in the everyday this interculturality works quite well, the multicultural mode of governance is finding its limits insofar as minority groups live parallel lives and drift to a separatism that can problematise national cohesion. Indigenous Australians are a component of this, both of and not of the nation, the same as and different from other Australians, and internally diverse. In their respect, multicultural governance predicated on bloc difference and a singular categoric subject is inadequate. That approach has spawned policies, programs and practices poorly directed at the real-life diversity. Examples include ‘Aboriginal learning styles’, cultural competence, ‘Aboriginalised’ workplaces and Aboriginal Child Placement Principle. These policies are applied to a populace that is differently Aboriginal and embedded in the nation around the country. I argue that multicultural governance is having counter-productive consequences as a result of its inadequacy to superdiverse realities and that reforms predicated on Aboriginal bothness are critical for Aborigines and instructive for the nation in governing superdiversity generally.

T1  - Interfaith Marriages in Islam from a Woman’s Perspective: Turkish Women’s Interfaith Marriage Practices in the United Kingdom
AN  - 2391198877
AB  - Interfaith marriages among Muslim immigrants in the UK are under-researched, despite the increase of these marriages; and Muslim women’s exogamy is even less researched. Such a practice is controversial since it is regarded by Muslims as being both religiously and socially unacceptable. Inter-religiously married Muslim women in Britain come from different ethnic backgrounds, but the focus here is on Turkish Muslim women. Examining the stories of twenty Turkish women in the UK who are currently in interfaith unions, this article discusses the Islamic view on women’s interfaith marriages. This research assesses the impact of individual women’s decisions, the challenges they face theologically and socially, and the strategy they adopt to deal with their unique situations and their individual experiences. It reveals that Muslim women rely on two main strategies to deal with religious differences within the context of family life: pre-marriage discussion and conflict avoidance.

T1  - Making Connections? A Study of Interethnic Dialogue in a Divided Community in Bosnia and Herzegovina
AN  - 2352304414
AB  - Dialogue can have positive effects for participants, but it is not clear how it affects members of the wider community. This study examines a dialogue project in Prozor-Rama in Bosnia and Herzegovina using survey data from 2012 and 2015. Results show that there is a general positive trend in interethnic relations, however, dialogue in Prozor-Rama had the effect of lowering in-group trust and dampening the increase in civic engagement relative to a control town. This suggests that in the short-term dialogue can have negative effects. They also suggest the need for studies of the long-term effects of dialogue. This study is significant because it moves beyond looking at the effect of interethnic contact on attitudes and prejudice and also examines its effect on social ties, social interaction, and civic participation.

T1  - Diversity barometer: attitude changes in Sweden
AN  - 2573424473
AB  - The aim of this article is to elucidate and discuss the results of the 2016 Diversity Barometer (Mångfaldsbarometern) and compare these results with those obtained from ten years of the longitudinal Diversity Barometers for 2005–2014. An additional aim is to demonstrate whether and how Swedish people’s experiences of and attitudes toward people with a foreign background and ethnic diversity have changed.A random sample of the Swedish population took part in the annual study, which was carried out in the form of a nationwide postal survey. The results show that negative attitudes toward ethnic and cultural diversity in general, and migrant population in particular, have increased to some extent and with respect to certain issues. Views on diversity in relation to culture and religion – especially Islam – were more negative than views on diversity in relation to work. Those who have larger experience of contact with foreigners show a more positive attitude toward diversity compared with those with limited experience and contact. Individuals who have higher education, those who identify themselves as female, younger persons and those living in large cities are more positive than other groups. In our analysis of the empirical data, we proceeded from a social work perspective and applied contact theory and group conflict theories relating attitudes to group position.

T1  - Mapping Crisis and Solutions in the Uighur National Question
AN  - 2491199911
AB  - In July 2009, China's oil-rich and ethnically diverse far-western Chinese province of Xinjiang experienced violence between Uighurs and Han Chinese. Media reported that more than 100 people were killed and 800 injured from the violence that broke out in the provincial capital, Urumqi. The conflict occurred after a year of rising tensions between the dominant Han Chinese authorities and the Uighur ethnic minority-the historical ethnic majority in the Xinjiang region-who claim social and economic marginalization by Beijing's policies that introduce Hanification of the region. Hanification refers to the systematic settlement policies and activities by the Chinese Communist Party authorities to settle Han-Chinese from Han-Chinese dominated provinces of China to the Xinjiang region-what Uighurs would call an occupied East Turkistan. Hanification of the region, therefore, constitutes settler colonialism by its nature. On Aug. 4, 2008, four days before the start of the Beijing Olympics, two ethnic Uighurs drove a stolen dump truck into a group of some 70 Chinese border police in the town of Kashi in Xinjiang, killing at least 16 of the officers. The attackers carried knives and home-made explosive devices and had also written manifestos in which they expressed their commitment to jihad in Xinjiang.

T1  - After Identity Politics? Faith in Liberal Citizenship
AN  - 2456176835
AB  - The ambivalent role of religion in modern citizenship is hardly new, whether in terms of the "hardware" (legalpolitical institutions and processes) or "software" (public attitudes and habits). Faith narratives can vigorously contest liberal claims of civil belonging and freedom, such as on gender and secularism. Yet liberal citizenship also benefits from justice claims anchored in interpretations of religion, ranging from equality and solidarity to nonviolence and reconciliation. Identity politics is a formative part of liberal citizenship, with a dominant tribal discourse legitimated by the accommodation of minority ethno-religious claims to equity and equality. Nativist populism aggravates an already adversarial relationship between faith and liberal citizenship, notably for minority religions. This paper argues for symbiosis between liberal citizenship and diverse religious identities-a political theology that takes pluralism seriously. While liberalism purports to minimize expectations of individual virtue, civic pluralism calls for the inclusion of collective and individual ethical commitments, beyond ruptures of secular and sacred that shape a jurisprudence on the "burdens of accommodation." Evidence from Canada, among other liberal settings, suggests that the alternative is civic fragmentation that favours majoritarian tribalism.Alternate abstract:Le rôle ambivalent de la religion dans la citoyenneté moderne n'est guère nouveau, que ce soit en termes de «matériel» (institutions et processus juridico-politiques) ou de «logiciel» (attitudes et habitudes du public). Les récits de foi peuvent contester vigoureusement les revendications libérales d'appartenance civile et de liberté, telles que le genre et la laïcité. Pourtant, la citoyenneté libérale bénéficie également de revendications de justice ancrées dans les interprétations de la religion, allant de l'égalité et de la solidarité à la non-violence et à la réconciliation. La politique identitaire est une partie formatrice de la citoyenneté libérale, avec un discours tribal dominant légitimé par l'accommodement des revendications ethno-religieuses des minorités à l'équité et à l'égalité. Le populisme nativiste aggrave une relation déjà conflictuelle entre la foi et la citoyenneté libérale, notamment pour les religions minoritaires. Cet article préconise la symbiose entre la citoyenneté libérale et diverses identités religieuses - une théologie politique qui prend le pluralisme au sérieux. Alors que le libéralisme vise à minimiser les attentes de vertu individuelle, le pluralisme civique appelle à l'inclusion d'engagements éthiques collectifs et individuels, au-delà des ruptures laïques et sacrées qui façonnent une jurisprudence sur les «fardeaux de l'accommodement». Des données provenant du Canada, entre autres milieux libéraux, suggèrent que l'alternative est la fragmentation civique qui favorise le tribalisme majoritaire.

T1  - Journeying Toward Transformative Teaching in the Age of Alternative Facts and Re-Ascendant Ethnic and Racial Prejudice
AN  - 2343102289
AB  - Background: We are at a historical juncture that is punctuated by the rise of white nationalism, an exacerbation of racial divisions and tensions, an uptick in hate crimes, and bullying increasingly targeting immigrant youth, all of which, in the current political and cultural climate, have often been legitimized through a recourse to "alternative facts." However, the current historical moment in the United States is also marked by a postmodern ethos, which is often taken up by the public in a fragmentary manner, highlighted by a general sense of incredulity regarding any form of knowledge. At the same time, the fuller, ethical context of postmodernism complicates how educators may pedagogically address and respond to the tensions and conflict that filter over into the university classroom from the social strife and injustices evident in the society at large. The ethical context of postmodernism warns against changing hearts and minds with a proliferation of the "right" facts assumed to be devoid of attachments of value. It also warns us to be vigilant against the foreclosures, reductions, and exclusions that occur when one draws on metanarratives and universals to mobilize against injustice. Purpose: We explore what it means pedagogically, for teacher educators in predominantly white institutions, to be situated at a historical juncture that calls out for some form of social advocacy on their part to combat the rise in the politicization of truth and xenophobic and racist sentiment, but are simultaneously compelled to keep in mind the ethical lessons of postmodernism. Research Design: We utilize critical phenomenological analysis intertwined with a narrative accounting of both authors' classroom experiences as they attempt to engage college students at a predominantly white university with issues of racism, white privilege, and marginalization. We analyze and reflect on the mixed reactions of our students to a presentation on teaching in a diverse world, given by one of the authors to the other author's class of pre-service teachers. Conclusions/Recommendations: For teaching that may facilitate white students' ability to become reflective of their positionality as structured through whiteness and its attendant privileges, it is important to envision pedagogical work taking place within environments that can address not only students' cognitive capacities but also the white body schema, which operates at a pre-reflective level. Educators may refrain from reducing white students to reified categories of whiteness by cultivating a disposition of wonder that may allow them to understand whiteness through the lens of emergent realities rather than substantive, ontological forces.

T1  - Testing Hypersensitive Responses: Ethnic Minorities Are Not More Sensitive to Microaggressions, They Just Experience Them More Frequently
AN  - 2298742044
AB  - Racial microaggressions have attracted significant empirical attention and have been associated with profound negative effects. However, some argue against the importance of microaggressions arguing that (some) responses to microaggressions merely reflect “hypersensitivity” to trivial events among certain ethnic minority individuals. Three studies tested this hypersensitivity hypothesis. In two cross-sectional studies with dissimilar samples (N1 = 130, N2 = 264), ethnic minorities reported experiencing more microaggressions than ethnic majorities did, and microaggressions predicted less life satisfaction. However, contrary to the hypersensitivity hypothesis, minority identity did not moderate this relationship. In a randomized, controlled experiment (N3 = 114), White and ethnic minority participants reported their positive and negative affect before and after recalling either a microaggression or a control event. Recalling microaggressions reduced positive affect and increased negative affect, but this was also not moderated by minority identity. Implications for the hypersensitivity hypothesis, and microaggressions research, are discussed.

T1  - Racial Bias Increases False Identification of Black Suspects in Simultaneous Lineups
AN  - 2251680892
AB  - People are better able to correctly identify the faces of individuals who belong to their own race. Research linking the cross-race effect in face recognition to racial attitudes has been limited to explicit measures and sequential presentation formats. Using a simultaneous lineup task, our results from two studies revealed a systematic relationship between explicit racial bias and increased false identification of Black faces. We observed inconsistent evidence to suggest that individual differences in implicit attitudes impact judgments of Black faces. Nevertheless, nonconscious activation of crime-related concepts prior to encoding facial targets impaired White perceivers’ accuracy for Black faces. Nonconscious priming of crime concepts did not affect White perceivers’ judgments of White faces. Thus, among Whites, racial bias, as a function of both individual differences and contextual cues, can increase the false identification of Black faces in simultaneous lineups. Theoretical and legal implications for face recognition and eyewitness memory are discussed.

T1  - Reconceptualizing Informal Work Practices: Some Observations from an Ethnic Minority Community in Urban UK
AN  - 2222412505
AB  - Whilst paid informal work has been conceptualized as a form of paid employment imbued with solely economic motivations, this article critically argues that such a market‐­oriented reading fails to take into account alternative explanations for the existence of informal work practices. Using evidence from 50 interviews conducted within a Pakistani urban community in a northern UK city, this article, uses a mixed‐embeddedness perspective to highlight the importance of predominantly socially and culturally driven motives in the decision to engage in informal work. The findings highlight that participation in informal work, whilst a product of marginalization due to certain institutional and structural factors, is also driven by a range of non‐monetary motives—a result of certain socially embedded work relations between ethnic minority workers and their employers. It is this social embeddedness of the employer–employee relationship in the Pakistani ethnic minority community that explains the continuation of informal work practices in the face of prevailing laws and regulations. The findings add weight to the understanding of informal work as being about more than just economics and constraints, offering these ethnic minority workers opportunities, even status, and giving them agency in an otherwise disempowered situation.

T1  - Does Exposure to the Refugee Crisis Make Natives More Hostile?
AN  - 2213156781
AB  - Although Europe has experienced unprecedented numbers of refugee arrivals in recent years, there exists almost no causal evidence regarding the impact of the refugee crisis on natives’ attitudes, policy preferences, and political engagement. We exploit a natural experiment in the Aegean Sea, where Greek islands close to the Turkish coast experienced a sudden and massive increase in refugee arrivals, while similar islands slightly farther away did not. Leveraging a targeted survey of 2,070 island residents and distance to Turkey as an instrument, we find that direct exposure to refugee arrivals induces sizable and lasting increases in natives’ hostility toward refugees, immigrants, and Muslim minorities; support for restrictive asylum and immigration policies; and political engagement to effect such exclusionary policies. Since refugees only passed through these islands, our findings challenge both standard economic and cultural explanations of anti-immigrant sentiment and show that mere exposure suffices in generating lasting increases in hostility.

T1  - Integration involves a trade-off between fertility and status for World War II evacuees
AN  - 2362995064
AB  - Understanding how refugees integrate into host societies has broad implications for researchers interested in intergroup conflict and for governments concerned with promoting social cohesion. Using detailed records tracking the movements and life histories of Finnish evacuees during World War II, we find that evacuees who intermarry are more likely to be educated, work in professional occupations, marry someone higher in social status and remain in the host community. Evacuees who intermarry before the war have fewer children, whereas those who marry into their host community after the war have more children. These results indicate that life-history and assimilation outcomes depend on key differences between pre-war environments—when migrants are living in their own communities—and post-war environments—when migrants are living in the host community. Overall, this suggests that integration involves a trade-off between reproduction and status such that evacuees who integrate gain social status, whereas those who maintain stronger bonds with their natal communities have higher fertility. We discuss these results within the framework of social capital, intergroup conflict and life-history theory and suggest how they can inform our understanding of evolutionary adaptations that affect tribalism.Evacuees who intermarry and remain in the host society gain socioeconomic benefits but suffer reduced fertility. This suggests that integration involves trade-offs between within-group ‘bonding’ social networks and between-group ‘bridging’ networks

T1  - White Danish Love as Affective Intervention:
AN  - 2340246455
AB  - Through a close reading of media reporting from 2017 to 2018 on the case of the Chinese girl Liu Yiming, who was first denied then granted residency in Denmark due to public pressure, this article analyses how regulation of family reunification involving children is negotiated in the Danish public imaginary in the context of strong anti-immigration sentiments. This imaginary projects the white Danish public as eager to love Yiming and as affectively invested in reversing the injustice done to her and her family. The article suggests, however, that the outpouring of white love, which functions as an affective intervention imbued with the promises of reversing Yiming’s deportation, is deeply embedded in exceptionalist notions of the ‘integrated’ migrant and that it works to restore an idealised image of a Danish nation defined by ‘human decency’ as a core value. Thus, the analysis raises critical questions to the politics of white love and its promise of securing social change for the ‘integrated’ migrant through collective acts of white feeling.

T1  - Inequality and Ethnic Conflict in Sub-Saharan Africa
AN  - 2427333066
AB  - Theories of ethnic conflict predict that between-group inequality should be associated with a greater likelihood of violent conflict, but empirical results have been mixed. One reason might be that different types of inequalities have opposing effects on the likelihood of conflict. In this article, we posit that educational inequalities are likely to incentivize collective action by inducing grievances, while economic and demographic inequalities may actually dis-incentivize collective action by limiting opportunities for disadvantaged groups to engage in rebellion. We test these hypotheses on a new ethnic dyad database, incorporating 1,548 dyads formed by 290 ethnic groups living in 29 Sub-Saharan African countries. The analysis reveals that educational inequalities are indeed positively associated with conflict incidence, while this is not the case for economic and demographic inequalities. The association between educational inequality and conflict is stronger if the groups are wealthier. A higher joint educational level of the groups is associated with less conflict, particularly under more autocratic regimes. These findings demonstrate that to better understand the relationship between inequality and conflict, it is important to disaggregate the effects of inequalities according to the underlying mechanisms and the political context with which they are associated.

T1  - Ethnic Influence among Kenyan Catholic Church Leaders in Nairobi on Choosing News Media
AN  - 2331234788
AB  - Considering the salience of ethnicity in Africa, the potential involvement of church leaders in fanning conflict, and the role of the media in shaping attitudes of audiences, this study sought to examine the extent to which the ethnicity of colleagues and friends may influence church leaders' choice of and exposure to news media channels. The study sampled Catholic church leaders in Nairobi, Kenya and employed 16 elite interviews and three focus group discussions. The analyses of findings show mutual influence of colleagues, family members, and friends over selection of news media channels with most participants dismissing ethnicity as a factor in their own influences. There seemed to be a consensus about the influence of timeliness, objectivity, depth, and boldness in choices of and exposure to news media channels. Overall, participants expressed a cautious attitude toward ethnic influences and tended to attribute the negative effects of ethnicity to others. This was interpreted as fear to subscribe to exclusive solidarities bordering on ethnocentrism. Implications for future studies are explored.

T1  - Religion-based cultural identity and conflicts of migrant Muslim students in Northwest China
AN  - 2092769296
AB  - The Hui (10.6 million) is one of the largest ethnic minority groups in China. Almost 100% of them, along with the Dongxiang, are Islamic, and are migrating from rural to urban areas in Northwest China. After moving to the urban environment conflicts between rural-urban differences, ethnic identity, and religion beliefs and practices frequently occur. This study found that Islam has strong influences on migrant Hui and Dongxiang students' identity, and cause some notable conflicts with the urban and school cultures. These conflicts penetrate many aspects of their lives such as clothing, dietary restrictions, religious practice and literacy, and schooling. This study also examines the conflict between Islamic culture and modern secular culture, and identify some implications for schooling.

T1  - The graduate(s): the harvests of Israel's integrated multicultural bilingual education
AN  - 2014051337
AB  - Advocates of integration and cross cultural contact believe schools have a seminal role to play in perpetuating or breaking the cycle of violence and division in conflicted societies. Historically, segregated schools are the norm in such societies. An alternative educational model is provided through integrated schools-schools where children from different national, ethnic, or religious groups are deliberately educated together. Integrated schools are believed to be essential in contributing to the healing of the wounds that afflict conflicted societies, easing the path toward peace, reconciliation, and integration. The present study reports on interviews conducted with the three first cohorts of students which graduated from the only integrated school in Israel running through K12. The interviewees are shown to have been able to successfully negotiate present reigning societal believes in all that regards to the ethos of the conflict and adopt perspectives which help them overcome hatred, fear, and anger while recognizing present sociopolitical complexities and difficulties. All in all the schools? environment and educational practices seem to help counter the socio-psychological infrastructures which evolve in the context of intractable conflicts.

T1  - Learning from Land: Lerma's Guided by the Mountains
AN  - 2157627045
AB  - Let's now enter our home in order to gauge and access what is needed for a good day … a good life.2 Almost twenty years have passed since Vine Deloria and David Wilkins proposed that "(r)acial and ethnic studies can immediately link with political theory because that specialty represents the initial conceptual framework within which the respective minority groups had to be accommodated historically.

The second aspect of the text builds naturally on this foundation: it briefly brackets ontological questions to more explicitly answer political and policy questions, both retrospectively (how to understand the trauma of contact, conflict and attempts at colonialism?), and projectively (how and when might we reestablish Navajo traditions to inform common law and reform institutions?).

Here, Lerma marshals a robust arsenal of concepts drawn from the social sciences, and comparative politics more specifically: the language of state-sponsored settlers, extractive industries, local elites and path dependencies will sound familiar to scholars who have studied colonialism and the "natural resources curse" in all its forms.

Scholars familiar with language drawn from the positive social sciences and policy studies may be surprised to see such models removed from their original context (for PEM, one assumes evolutionary biology and heterodox economics), and then inserted into analyses of extraction and exploitation within the US.

T1  - Building a Culture of Peace and Collective Memory in Post‐conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina: Sarajevo's Museum of War Childhood
AN  - 2057474071
AB  - The Museum of War Childhood in Sarajevo opened its doors to the public in January 2017. I visited the Museum in the summer of 2017, during a month-long research trip to Bosnia where I was conducting interviews with women survivors of wartime sexual violence. The purpose of my stay was to collect materials on children and war, with a particular interest in children born as a result of war, that is, those whose mothers were raped by members of militias from opposing ethnic groups. During the course of my fieldwork I learned about the Museum serendipitously, while researching the profiles of local non-governmental organizations (NGOs) which provide support to war survivors. Located on a historic street in Sarajevo's Stari Grad (Old Town), the Museum would be an otherwise unassuming presence were it not for the stark black-and-white sign with its name and logo that marks its location. I had no expectations for the visit, as I had not read anything about the Museum or its permanent collection prior to my arrival in Sarajevo. Although I have been actively researching the recent war in the former Yugoslavia for almost a decade, I found myself largely unprepared for the full emotional impact of the Museum's artefacts and video testimonies by those who lived through the war as children. The unmistakeable 'thisness' of the objects and narratives, and the luminous simplicity captured in a child's perspective upon witnessing a harrowing reality, constituting in my own private response what Jan Assman in his work on collective memory calls 'the concretion of identity' as I experienced their 'capacity to reconstruct' the past in the context of a contemporary situation (Assman 1995: 130).

T1  - Norm contestation and reconciliation: evidence from a regional transitional justice process in the Balkans
AN  - 1993976017
AB  - We have limited understanding of how ethnic groups can achieve an agreement on tackling the legacy of war crimes, because transitional justice scholars have been focused primarily on challenges to post-conflict reconciliation. Addressing this gap, we investigate whether contestation over the norm of transitional justice prevents inter-ethnic reconciliation, operationalized by us as reconciliatory discourse. Empirical evidence is drawn from the study of debates conducted by a transnational advocacy network (RECOM), which proposes a regional fact-finding commission in the Balkans. Applying text analysis to identify key themes in these debates, we find reconciliatory discourse in those debates where there is norm contestation. Also, the spatial scale of a transitional justice process matters. We identify different patterns of discourse at different levels of debates. Debates containing norm contestation are associated with ethnically centred arguments at the national level, but with sustained scrutiny of proposed solutions at the regional level despite ethnic divisions.

T1  - Community-level prejudice and mortality among immigrant groups
AN  - 2070444352
AB  - This study assesses whether anti-immigrant prejudice at the community level is prospectively associated with mortality. We used 10 waves of data from the General Social Survey (GSS) that were linked to mortality data via the National Death Index (NDI) for the period between 1993 and 2014 (n = 13,242). The 2014 GSS-NDI dataset is a nationally representative sample reporting social characteristics and attitudes in the United States that was prospectively linked to mortality data. Community-level prejudice was measured with 5 questions regarding anti-immigrant sentiments across 123 communities, defined using primary sampling units. Cox proportional hazards models tested the association between anti-immigrant prejudice and mortality hazard, controlling for covariates at the individual and community levels. Findings showed that among “other race” respondents, those born in the US had higher risk of mortality in communities with greater anti-immigrant prejudice, whereas foreign-born “other race” respondents had lower risk of mortality in communities with greater anti-immigrant prejudice. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the “other race” category was comprised largely of Asians and Hispanics, and that these results were similar for both groups. In contrast, anti-immigrant prejudice was not associated with mortality for foreign-born immigrants who self-report as white or black. We provide various hypotheses for why US-born immigrant groups seem to suffer higher mortality risk, while foreign-born immigrant groups do not, when they live in communities with high levels of prejudice.

T1  - Allies or Opponents? Power-Sharing, Civil Society, and Gender
AN  - 2007391966
AB  - Feminist critics of power-sharing argue that power-sharing structures privilege ethnic/ethnonational identity and impede women's descriptive and substantive political representation. This paper extends these arguments to consider the extent to which consociational theory addresses the role of civil society and women's political voice in postconflict societies. We argue that power-sharing is overly concerned with formal representation to the detriment of understanding the role civil society can play in peace building. Whilst we acknowledge the importance of civil society retaining a critical distance from political institutions, we suggest several mechanisms for incorporating civil society into power-sharing arrangements. We argue that a consideration of civil society can highlight the gendered issues that are ignored in power-sharing settings, and we conclude that a broader understanding of both "politics" and "conflict" is required for power-sharing to be more equitable to women's descriptive and substantive representation.

T1  - Outside the net: Intersectionality and inequality in the fisheries of Trincomalee, Sri Lanka
AN  - 2014467378
AB  - Inequality and conflict in Sri Lanka have frequently been analyzed along ethnic lines. However, many scholars have stressed the importance of other dimensions of identity, such as gender, caste and class, in studying social tension. This study uses intersectionality theory to examine how a combination of the social categories of gender, race, ethnicity and location creates structural inequality. This article draws upon in-depth research on Muslim, Tamil, Sinhalese and indigenous/Veder women who catch and market fish in the conflict-affected eastern district of Trincomalee, Sri Lanka. The focus was on intra-group differences among these women and the different sources of power they use to subvert existing power structures. Although multiple inequalities affected the respondents' daily lives and participation in activities, they were not passive victims; they used their own agency to negotiate for their livelihoods. Nevertheless, the women who comprise the focus of this study appeared to be completely invisible to government fisheries management bodies. The lack of institutional representation has disadvantaged them in their negotiations for space to engage in livelihood activities. Registration of these women by the government department of fisheries among those who make a living from fishing would provide them with a first measure of recognition and empowerment, strengthening their chances of negotiating access to the fishery livelihood resources.

T1  - SPECIAL ISSUE INTRODUCTION
AN  - 2197771051
AB  - Academic interest in the study of forced migration as a specific field developed only in the late 20th century. But its conceptual tools had a much earlier incarnation in the United States. In the early 20th century historical linguistic and ethnographic research was being conducted with Native American peoples who had been subjected to massive ethnic cleansings in the preceding two centuries. Much of that early work was with tribes who had been displaced, dispossessed, and involuntarily marched into resource-poor reservations. The scientists working with them thought they were engaging in a kind of salvage operation to record ways of life before they disappeared. These researchers largely ignored or failed to recognize the impacts of displacement—destroyed settlements, land occupation, nonviable reservations, inadequate welfare, and hostile administrations and lack of legal rights—and focused instead on trying to reconstruct memory culture of “what life was like in the old days.” Nevertheless, these studies gave us many of our basic concepts to describe and analyze the experience of uprootedness and dispossession. These fundamental concepts have become important in the discipline of forced migration studies. They include understandings of: role and identity, hierarchy, social networks, conflict mechanisms, reciprocity and trust, boundary creation, rites of passage, liminality, and the role of myths.

T1  - Learning to be safe citizens: state-run boarding schools and the dynamics of Tibetan identity
AN  - 1961172161
AB  - Drawing on individual interviews with graduates of the state-run boarding program in the Chinese heartland called 'inland Tibet classes' (ITC), this paper examines how such individuals respond to state schooling aimed at minority citizen-making by interpreting their ethnicity and negotiating ethnic boundaries in the Han Chinese-dominant society. Considering citizenship as a process of being made and self-making in relation to state powers, this paper examines the complexities, internal tensions, and dilemmas in citizenship making for these young Tibetans. This paper finds that push and pull factors - their ontological insecurity in inland cities and state-guaranteed secure jobs and ontological security in Tibet respectively - together have contributed to the process of ITC graduates studied learning to be 'safe citizens'. Although the ITC policy succeeded in cultivating numerous 'safe citizens', the state's failure to establish a 'safe space' at large for Tibetans might jeopardize the larger aims of this state project in the long term.

T1  - Revitalizing the 'civic' and 'ethnic' distinction. Perceptions of nationhood across two dimensions, 44 countries and two decades
AN  - 1936016050
AB  - This article describes how contemporary publics think about the nation along Kohn's classic distinction between 'civic' and 'ethnic' nationalism. The article makes three contributes to the existing literature. Firstly, it introduces a new statistical tool, multi-classification analysis, to establish and analyse the two-dimensional structure found in this and previous studies. Secondly, it derives at an alternative interpretation, with a first dimension distinguishing the level of mobilization of nationalist attitudes and a second dimension distinguishing the relative emphasis given to civic and ethnic elements. Thirdly, it demonstrates how this set-up can be used to describe differences within countries, across countries and across time using all three rounds of International Social Survey Programme data on national identity. The descriptions demonstrate a move towards mobilized ethnic nationalism in Eastern Europe, while a stable non-mobilized civic nationalism prevails in many West European countries, despite the rise of new right-wing parties.

T1  - The suburban paradox of conviviality and racism in postcolonial Britain
AN  - 2076967933
AB  - Taking my cue from work on relations of interethnic conviviality in super-diverse cities across the globe, this paper examines the ways in which conviviality co-exists with racism as found in a suburban British town. My argument is that ethnographic attention to the proximity of interethnic relations of conviviality to racism is necessary to guard against overly celebratory accounts of conviviality that downplay everyday manifestations of racism. By situating my study of conviviality in a suburban town, my account begins to unpack the characteristics of convivial relations formed in suburban neighbourhoods as opposed to super-diverse cities often studied by ethnographers in this area of inquiry. I examine manifestations of interethnic relations between British Asian Muslims and white British residents of this town. In contrast to the mainstream images that depict British Asian Muslims as a potential threat to neighbourhood stability and national security, some white and British Asian Muslim residents formed neighbourly relationships of trust, care and mutual recognition with each other across ethnic, racial, religious, gender, class and generational differences. Yet, my analysis of these convivial relations reveals some paradoxical ways in which individuals' experiences of interethnic relations co-exist with their xenophobic, racist and Islamophobic attitudes.

T1  - Shifting Sexual Boundaries: Ethnicity and Pre-marital Sex in the Lives of South Asian American Women
AN  - 1924799207
AB  - Immigrants and their children engage in several forms of boundary making as a means of developing a sense of belonging in America. Second-generation Americans are at the crossroads between meeting their parents' cultural expectations and selecting new ethnic options that may conflict with ancestral traditions. Women's sexuality has often been a site for contesting and conforming to ethnic boundaries. This article examines a case study of second-generation South Asian American adult women's pre-marital sexual behavior to understand how cultural expectations about sex shapes the ways in which they construct ethnic boundaries. Much of the literature on women's sexuality in immigrant communities in America has focused on married women or constraints placed on women's virginity. This study highlights a nuanced perspective for understanding how migration to the U.S. creates cultural shifts in ethnic communities by examining how the American born daughters of immigrants define their ethnicity through their pre-marital sexual encounters.

T1  - Identity Management: The Creation of Resource Allocative Criteria in Botswana
AN  - 1892909852
AB  - Botswana's escape from the "resource curse" is an anomaly in the trend toward low economic growth and political instability in resource-rich developing economies. In literature on the resource curse, distributive injustices of resource wealth have traditionally been understood to occur along ethno-linguistic and sectarian lines and potentially cause weak institutions, social unrest, and, at times, violent conflict. Because of their high levels of ethnic diversity and abundant natural resource wealth, African countries are especially prone to these effects. The present article argues that part of the reason Botswana escaped the resource curse was a bid by Botswana elites to buffer the negative effects of ethnicity on resource distribution through identity management, specifically assimilation, at various points in the country's history. This was mainly achieved through the political entrepreneurship of pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial elites, and through social and colonial discourses predicated upon materialistic production and exchange, that led to the establishment of a new identity category. In doing so, Botswana elites created a new criterion for resource access based on successful assimilation that largely excluded those who failed to assimilate.

T1  - BOSNIAN IDENTITY BETWEEN NATIONALISM, (IN)TOLERANCE AND (A)THEISM/BOSANSKI IDENTITET IZMEDU NACIONALIZMA, (NE)TOLERANCIJE I (A)TEIZMA
AN  - 1896808579
AB  - This article discusses the historical changes in religious practices in Bosnia-Herzegovina from the communist era to the post-war period in line with their influence on identity and intergroup (inter-ethnic, inter-religious) relations. There is a lack of evidence on whether people did not overtly express their religious beliefs during communism even though they were covertly religious, or whether they started engaging in the religious practice during and after the 1992-1995 war in order to establish group connectedness, cohesion, and fulfill certain needs. "Bosnian identity" will be described as a puzzle formed by the "remains" of the previous regime and the "new additions" of the post-war period. The discourse of power dominates in Bosnia-Herzegovina and enables prohibitions of different types of dialogue that can lead to better understanding of differences and Other(s). The main problem that will be addressed in this article is the (non)existing Bosnian identity analyzed through "jouissance" of nationalism, intolerance and religion. The contradictions of Sigmund Freud's concept of identification, and the relation of that concept to the body and power in a post-war divided society will be discussed. We can conclude that the main discourse of power operates with religion in order to establish the "jigsaw puzzle of Bosnian identity". The presence of those who either live in a different system (yugonostalgic people, Homo Yugoslavicus), or those who do not believe (atheists) simply adds a new dimension to the currently established system which can be used to further explain if the overtly expressed beliefs will remain unchanged in case of the establishment of a new system.

T1  - Why Does Ethnicity Increase in Salience as Political Order Decays?
AN  - 1843974063
AB  - We know more about the sources of political violence than we sometimes admit. Conflict scholars now have a reasonably well-developed, if still largely informal, spiral model of ethnic mobilization, fear, and escalation that accounts for the breakdown of bargaining and the turn to violence. The key question for future research, however, is Why does ethnicity increase in salience when political order decays or is threatened? Addressing this puzzle will likely require delving into the social psychology of identity formation.

T1  - The paradox of Kenya's constitutional reform process : what future for constitutionalism?
AN  - 1868244935
AB  - Kenya's protracted reform process and periodic electoral related violence is linked to predatory politics nestled in tribalism. Kenya's politicians' quest to capture the state for extractive purposes has rendered the reform process ethnically polarising and, since dialogue cannot prevail among Kenya's fragmented political class, the resort to violence becomes a means of making claims to the control of the state. This article argues that, although the promulgation of a Constitution in 2010 has the potential to address issues at the core of Kenya's post-colonial crisis, aspects such as inequitable resource distribution, ethnic and regional inequalities, disregard for the rule of law, impunity, a political elite characterised by tribalism and kleptocracy are posing a challenge to the implementation of the Constitution; thus placing the country's long term political stability in jeopardy.

T1  - Two Rituals, a Bit of Dualism and Possibly Some Inseparability: "And so that's how we say that Chams and Khmers are one and the same"
AN  - 1851075500
AB  - Scholarship on Muslims in Cambodia often revolves around a series of cultural, religious and social contrasts between Champa and Cambodia, between Chams and Khmers. Yet such an approach depends in turn on an apprehension of ethnic boundaries as given, fixed, and permanent. Consideration of two Cham rituals suggests a more nuanced perspective. These rituals are the Imam San Mawlid, a Muslim saint's anniversary, and the Mamun, a possession ceremony to invite royal spirits. While both events are said to celebrate Cham culture and history, Khmer elements make the flexibility, the porosity and the fluidity of identities finally rendered illusive, if not inseparable.

T1  - The political consequences of contemporary immigration
AN  - 1825708916
AB  - This article synthesizes research on political outcomes associated with increasing immigration, with an emphasis on cross-national studies of European countries, where immigration is a relatively newer phenomenon compared to the United States and other traditional immigrant destinations. We begin with explanations of and research on anti-immigrant sentiment, not a political phenomenon in itself but considered an important precursor to other relevant political attitudes. Next, we review scholarship on the relationship between immigration and support for the welfare state, as well as exclusionary attitudes regarding immigrants' rights to welfare benefits. Then, we review research on immigration and political party preferences, in particular radical right parties, whose platforms often combine anti-immigration and welfare chauvinistic positions. We conclude by discussing how these processes may ultimately shape social policies, which may in turn influence immigration itself.

T1  - Marital Conflict, Ethnicity, and Legal Hybridity in Postconquest Quebec
AN  - 1818968055
AB  - This article explores the terrain of marital conflict in Quebec between 1763 and 1830, focusing on a variety of strategies employed by husbands and wives, ranging from elopement, criminal prosecution for marital violence, and separation. Based on an intensive analysis of the colonial newspapers and a large judicial archive of both criminal and civil proceedings, it seeks to discern patterns of ethnic inflection among men and women using these strategies, and seeks to postulate a growing legal hybridity, one that particularly affected the assumptions and practice of French customary law in the first six decades following the British conquest.

T1  - Human integration through Olympism education: a pragmatic engagement of youths in a war-torn society
AN  - 2015508334
AB  - This paper delineates the findings of a mixed methods study that investigated how Olympism education could strengthen competencies of human integration through delivery of physical, social, and critical literacy and conflict resolution literacy. The study introduced a curriculum model integrating Olympism values and conflict resolution strategies for the purpose of facilitating human integration. This integrated curriculum model was then tested among a group of young students who represent the two main ethnic groups Sinhalese and Tamils, in a war-torn society in Sri-Lanka. The intervention of this study provided pragmatic involvement for young students as the representatives of the next generation, in order to teach them the convergence and contradictions of perceptions of social reform ideals through sport. Results revealed that conflict resolution strategies combined with Olympism education integrated curriculum intervention significantly improved young students' conflict resolution competencies, regardless of their gender or ethnicity. This study demonstrated significant gains in the ability of young students to learn about human integration through learning about Olympism within sport and physical education lessons, in regards to effective conflict resolution.

T1  - "The Alcohol Just Pissed Me Off": Views About How Alcohol and Marijuana Influence Adolescent Dating Violence Perpetration, Results of a Qualitative Study
AN  - 1779362493
AB  - This exploratory study was designed to examine the beliefs of youth users of alcohol and marijuana about the connections between their substance use and dating violence perpetration. Eighteen youth (ages 14-20 years old), who were primarily of Black or Hispanic race/ethnicity, participated in in-depth interviews about times when they had perpetrated dating violence. They were asked to reflect on whether and how they felt that alcohol and/or marijuana may have contributed. Responses coalesced around four major themes, which were that users believed that (a) Alcohol escalates minor conflict; (b) Alcohol exacerbates feelings of irritation and anger; (c) Marijuana reduces feelings of irritation and anger; and (d) Substances are used to cope with conflict-related stress. We conclude that momentary event-level research that investigates the immediate influence of alcohol and marijuana use on dating violence perpetration is needed and that dating violence prevention interventions should consider addressing substance use and substance-aggression expectancies.

T1  - Reflections on conducting research on the 'war on terror': religious identity, subjectivity and emotions
AN  - 1784145010
AB  - In recent years there has been an increase in literature which has explored the insider/outsider position through ethnic identities. However, there remains a neglect of religious identities, even though it could be argued that religious identities have become increasingly important through being prominent in international issues such as the 'war on terror' and the Middle East conflict. Through drawing on the concept of subjectivity, I reflect on research I conducted on the impact of the 'war on terror' on British Muslims. I explore the space between the insider/outsider position demonstrating how my various subjectivities - the 'non-Islamic appearance I', the 'Muslim I', the 'personal I', the 'exploring I', the 'Kashmiri I' or the 'Pakistani I', the 'status I' and the 'outsider I' - assisted in establishing trust, openness and commonality. I conclude by demonstrating how the 'emotional I' allowed me to manage my own emotions and participants emotions.

T1  - PHOTONICS, GLOBALISM, AND TRIBALISM: A REVIEW OF GENERAL SEMANTICS
AN  - 2028131176
AB  - Marlow cites that a paradigm of the invisible effect of dominant media that posits, in part, that photonic technologies--first developed in the 1960s--have emerged as the dominant technology in the latter half of the twentieth century and the early part of the twenty-first century and are slowly but surely combining with or supplanting electronic based technologies. This emergence accelerated the advent of "globalism," and this has resulted in the reemergence of "tribalism," this time on a planetary scale with several attendant challenges. "Globalism" is defined as (1) A national geopolitical policy in which the entire world is regarded as the appropriate sphere for a state's influence. (2) The development of social, cultural, technological, or economic networks that transcend national boundaries. A tribe can be defined as a unit of sociopolitical organization consisting of a number of families, clans, or other groups who share a common ancestry and culture and among whom leadership is typically neither formalized nor permanent. "Tribalism" is defined as (1) the organization, culture, or beliefs of a tribe. (2) A strong feeling of identity with and loyally to one's tribe or group. Clearly, globalism is in sharp contrast to tribalism. The former takes on the whole world contextually, whereas the latter refers to a much smaller grouping.

T1  - Social Conflict Theory in Studying the Conflict in Northern Ireland
AN  - 1788026332
AB  - The aim of this paper is to discuss the usefulness of social conflict theory as a theoretical framework for analyzing the conflict in Northern Ireland. The social conflict theories under consideration are Lewis Coser's functionalist theory of conflict, Ralf Dahrendorf's theory, and Randall Collins' sociology of conflict. The main question is whether social conflict theories provide a useful analytical tool in understanding ethnic conflicts: their nature, bases, and the actions of the social actors involved.

T1  - Regina v John Terry: The discursive construction of an alleged racist event
AN  - 1730766632
AB  - This article explores the conformation in discourse of a verbal exchange and its subsequent mediatised and legal ramifications. The event concerns an allegedly racist insult directed by high-profile English professional footballer John Terry towards another player, Anton Ferdinand, during a televised match in October 2011. The substance of Terry's utterance, which included the noun phrase 'fucking black cunt', was found by a Chief Magistrate not to be a racist insult, although the fact that these actual words were framed within the utterance was not in dispute. The upshot of this ruling was that Terry was acquitted of a racially aggravated public order offence. A subsequent investigation by the regulatory commission of the English Football Association (FA) ruled, almost a year after the event, that Terry was guilty of racially abusing Ferdinand. Terry was banned for four matches and fined L220,000. It is our contention that this event, played out in legal rulings, social media and print and broadcast media, constitutes a complex web of linguistic structures and strategies in discourse, and as such lends itself well to analysis with a broad range of tools from pragmatics, discourse analysis and cognitive linguistics. Among other things, such an analysis can help explain the seemingly anomalous -- even contradictory -- position adopted in the legal ruling with regard to the speech act status of 'fucking black cunt'; namely, that the racist content of the utterance was not contested but that the speaker was found not to have issued a racist insult. Over its course, the article addresses this broader issue by making reference to the systemic-functional interpersonal function of language, particularly to the concepts of modality, polarity and modalisation. It also draws on models of verbal irony from linguistic pragmatics, notably from the theory of irony as echoic mention. Furthermore, the article makes use of the cognitive-linguistic framework Text World Theory to examine the discourse positions occupied by key actors and adapts, from cognitive poetics, the theory of mind-modelling to explore the conceptual means through which these actors discursively negotiate the event. It is argued that the pragmatic and cognitive strategies that frame the entire incident go a long way towards mitigating the impact of so ostensibly stark an act of racial abuse. Moreover, it is suggested here that the reconciliation of Terry's action was a result of the confluence of strategies of discourse with relations of power as embodied by the media, the law and perceptions of nationhood embraced by contemporary football culture. It is further proposed that the outcome of this episode, where the FA was put in the spotlight, and where both the conflict and its key antagonists were 'intranational', was strongly impelled by the institution of English football and its governing body both to reproduce and maintain social, cultural and ethnic cohesion and to avoid any sense that the event featured a discernible 'out-group'.

T1  - Has Opposition to Immigration Increased in the United States afterthe Economic Crisis? An Experimental Approach<sup> 1 </sup>: IMR
AN  - 2558423747
AB  - We employ two population-level experiments to accurately measure opposition toimmigration before and after the economic crisis of 2008. Our design explicitlyaddresses social desirability bias, which is the tendency to give responses thatare seen favorably by others and can lead to substantial underreporting ofopposition to immigration. We find that overt opposition to immigration,expressed as support for a closed border, increases slightly after the crisis.However, once we account for social desirability bias, no significant increaseremains. We conclude that the observed increase in anti-immigration sentiment inthe post-crisis United States is attributable to greater expression ofopposition rather than any underlying change in attitudes.

AB  - On the one hand, the topics of Appalachian women fighting for environmental justice; migrant farm-workers navigation of market forces, anti-immigrant sentiment, and racism; and Southwestern Latino youths reliance on gangs in the face of violent gang suppression tactics on the part of the state, all represent the humanist commitment to understanding and explaining varied social worlds with an eye toward the extent that it leads to creative and constructive activity.

[...]subcultures can be viewed as either escapist communities or issue-based communities who negotiate levels of autonomy.

[...]subcultures may work to construct a free space (Duncombe 2002:5) for developing ideas and practices.

T1  - "AND WHEN I BECOME A MAN": Translocal Coping with Precariousness and Uncertainty among Returnee Men in South Sudan
AN  - 1684400398
AB  - In this article, we argue that return in the aftermath of conflict-induced displacement is often undertaken in contexts of uncertainty. After years spent in war and displacement, people return to an unknown and uncertain present and future, shaped by ideal images of home and brutal memories of conflict. Based on ethnographic fieldwork among South Sudanese refugees in Kenya and Canada and returnees in South Sudan, we analyze the 'return home' strategies, motivations, and experiences of returnee men. We suggest that uncertainty often transforms the present and the future of returning populations and the societies to which they return. Our research shows that in their attempts to minimize their wartime and displacement uncertainties, returnee men transform, negotiate, and reconstruct national, ethnic, and gender identities in a variety of ways, depending on their age and experiences in exile.

T1  - The Wish to Leave Ethnically Concentrated Neighbourhoods: The Role of Perceived Social Cohesion and Interethnic Attitudes
AN  - 1667952254; 201512663
AB  - This paper aims to investigate the motives behind people's wishes to move out of ethnically concentrated neighbourhoods. We focus on the impact of perceived social cohesion and negative interethnic attitudes and hypothesise on moving wishes of ethnic majority and minority residents in the Netherlands (i.e. Turks and Moroccans). Data were derived from the first wave of the 2009 Netherlands Longitudinal Lifecourse Study, collected in 35 municipalities covering 800 neighbourhoods. Taking into account household, housing and other neighbourhood attributes, multilevel logistic regression models show that ethnic majority residents are more likely to have a wish to move when they live in neighbourhoods with a large percentage of ethnic minorities. This can be explained by a lack of perceived social cohesion, but not by their negative attitudes towards ethnic minorities. Controlling for housing and neighbourhood conditions, the percentage of ethnic minorities neither increases nor decreases minority residents' moving wishes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Understanding the insurgency in Balochistan
AN  - 2115176904
AB  - The management and incorporation of ethnic identities in Pakistan has historically been far more problematic in Balochistan than other provinces and regions. With the killing in 2006 of Akbar Bugti, a leading political figure who was the head of the Bugti tribe and served as federal minister, chief minister and Governor of Balochistan, the province became politically polarised and has descended into a new cycle of bombings, abductions and murders. The rebellion has resulted in a major security operation pitting the security forces against the Baloch people, attacks against Punjabi settlers and sectarian violence against Hazara Shias that collectively threaten to derail major development projects and increase instability in Pakistan as a whole at a critical juncture. This article examines the insurgency in Balochistan and evaluates various perspectives that have been used to explain the present crisis: external intervention, resistance to social change, resource driven conflict theory, transnationalism and diaspora, and failure to manage difference. After examining the evidence it concludes by arguing that the primary cause for the insurgency in Pakistan is due to poor management of difference.

T1  - The embodied boundaries of ethnicity
AN  - 1531933841; 201423482
AB  - Drawing on interviews and autobiographic writings by Sami, this article examines the construction of an ethnic category, the Sami as an embodied phenomenon. The article investigates what creates the ethnic difference between the Sami and the majority populations since many modern Sami are not always very different from the majority. By applying the theory of performativity, the article concludes that the ethnic boundary of the Sami is an embodied question. People who are born Sami are Sami by the expected particularity of their body, which can appear as outward appearance and/or mental characteristics. Their Saminess can also take the form of 'Sami DNA'. Being a cultural Sami is possible, natural, permitted and desirable for a person who is born Sami. One's origin is thus a performative which both enables and naturalizes an individual's Sami ethnicity. It produces a Sami body by naturalizing certain bodily qualities as well as a certain cultural identity. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications, Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - In Diversity We Trust: The Positive Effect of Ethnic Diversity on Outgroup Trust
AN  - 1680152708; 201514689
AB  - Most studies on ethnic diversity and social trust rely on the standard measure of generalized trust. This study complements existing work on this topic by examining the effect of diversity on trust toward outgroups. This innovation is motivated by two closely connected arguments: At first, most existent studies are conducted in the framework of intergroup contact and conflict theory. These theories directly allude to trust toward outgroups. Second, recent empirical studies show that the standard measure of generalized trust is much less generalized than theoretically assumed. Instead it is blurred by a great deal of particularized trust. Explicit outgroup trust therefore seems to be better suited to empirically testing the extent to which growing ethnic diversity influences trust toward people different from oneself. The cross-national analysis yields a positive relationship between diversity and outgroup trust, which is an interesting finding given the current debate dominated by conflict theoretical reasoning.

T1  - Does Immigration Undermine Public Support for Social Policy?
AN  - 1641423897; 201501415
AB  - There has been great interest in the relationship between immigration and the welfare state in recent years, and particularly since Alesina and Glaeser's (2004) influential work. Following literatures on solidarity and fractionalization, race in the U.S. welfare state, and anti-immigrant sentiments, many contend that immigration undermines public support for social policy. This study analyzes three measures of immigration and six welfare attitudes using 1996 and 2006 International Social Survey Program (ISSP) data for 17 affluent democracies. Based on multi-level and two-way fixed-effects models, our results mostly fail to support the generic hypothesis that immigration undermines public support for social policy. The percent foreign born, net migration, and the 10-year change in the percent foreign born all fail to have robust significant negative effects on welfare attitudes. There is evidence that the percent foreign born significantly undermines the welfare attitude that government 'should provide a job for everyone who wants one.' However, there is more robust evidence that net migration and change in percent foreign born have positive effects on welfare attitudes. We conclude that the compensation and chauvinism hypotheses provide greater potential for future research, and we critically consider other ways immigration could undermine the welfare state. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that factors other than immigration are far more important for public support of social policy. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Language Boundaries and the Subjective Well-Being of Immigrants in Europe
AN  - 2076975885
AB  - This study contributes to the growing literature on social and ethnic boundaries by tracing the impact of symbolic language boundaries in 20 European countries. Using data from the 2002-03 wave of the European Social Survey, we show that the language boundaries drawn in different host societies affect the subjective well-being of first- and second-generation immigrants. Confirming theoretical expectations, we find that symbolic boundaries only influence those individuals with limited proficiency in the majority language. Moreover, applying a distinction from theories of ethnic boundary-making, we show that it is primarily the contestedness of language boundaries within a society, rather than their strength, that influences subjective well-being. This finding provides indirect evidence for a major hypothesis: that disagreement over the social location of ethnic boundaries will make them politically salient; this, in turn, affects the well-being of individuals whose status is at stake.

T1  - Cognitive costs of contemporary prejudice
AN  - 1463011863; 201345662
AB  - Two studies examined the cognitive costs of blatant and subtle racial bias during interracial interactions. In Study 1, Black participants engaged in a 10-minute, face-to-face interaction with a White confederate who expressed attitudes and behaviors consistent with blatant, subtle, or no racial bias. Consistent with contemporary theories of modern racism, interacting with a subtly biased, compared with a blatantly biased, White partner impaired the cognitive functioning of Blacks. Study 2 revealed that Latino participants suffered similar cognitive impairments when exposed to a White partner who displayed subtle, compared with blatant, racial bias. The theoretical and practical implications for understanding the dynamics of interracial interactions in the context of contemporary bias are discussed.

T1  - Cosmopolitan Habits: The Capacities and Habitats of Intercultural Conviviality
AN  - 1417524307; 201332221
AB  - Public debate around cultural diversity has been dominated by a focus on 'panicked multiculturalism' -- those spaces which have been subject to social anxieties because of perceived conflicts around ethnicity. This article attempts to address the habitual ways cultural differences are transacted and reconciled in the daily conduct of people in culturally diverse settings. Although habit has been a central category for understanding racial prejudice, it has rarely impacted on an understanding of the practices and capacities which people develop for living with difference, the routinised 'civic virtues' of intercultural life. Cosmopolitanism and conviviality have become significant tools in framing this enquiry, though not without problems. The issue for this article is whether these terms are methodologically useful for the analysis of the habits of 'civic virtues'. This article, drawing on the everyday interactions in and around a school, argues that we need to conceptualise conviviality as an object of empirical research. This requires that we think about habit as a pedagogical process, and the temporal and spatial elements through which 'cosmopolitan' behaviours are habituated.

T1  - Victimization, Parenting, and Externalizing Behavior Among Latino and White Adolescents
AN  - 1429630646; 201338887
AB  - Given the large number of adolescents who have externalizing behavior problems and the increasing ethnic heterogeneity in many societies, it is important to examine whether the mechanisms underlying externalizing behavior are different among diverse groups. We specified separate models for ethnic groups and tested whether gender moderated the effect of victimization experiences and parent-child characteristics on externalizing behavior. The sample included 167 Latino and 625 White adolescents ages 10-17. For Latino adolescents, parental physical assault was related to more externalizing behavior for males and for females. More parental conflict and more criticism were related to less externalizing behavior for Latino females but not for Latino males. For White adolescents, all types of victimization (by parents, by siblings, by peers, witnessing domestic assault) and more parental conflict were related to more externalizing for males and for females. More monitoring was related to less externalizing behavior for White males but not for White females or for Latino adolescents. The intersection of ethnicity and gender may be important when examining adolescents' externalizing behavior. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Liberal Route from Homogeneity? US Policymakers and the Liberalization of Ethnic Nationalists in Bosnia's Dayton Accords
AN  - 1429639916; 201337060
AB  - This article explores how key US policymakers' understandings of nationalism contributed to core tensions in Bosnia's Dayton Peace Accords. Drawing on in-depth interviews with some of Dayton's key architects, our findings suggest that US elites drew on a cluster of entwined social knowledge claims about (ethnic) nationalism and the possibility of its liberal accommodation. US policymakers' social knowledge was anchored around two key liberal beliefs: a Millian acknowledgement that territorial homogeneity would facilitate political stability and liberal governability; and a countervailing normative desire to liberalize ethnic nationalisms through the imposition of liberal-legalist frameworks.

T1  - Social Engagement and Immigration Attitudes: Panel Survey Evidence from Germany: IMR
AN  - 2558415521
AB  - This article asks how social engagement influences individuals’ immigration concerns. Rates of volunteering, churchgoing, socializing, and helping others are used to predict anti-immigration sentiments. Panel survey data from Germany makes a dynamic “conditional change” modeling strategy possible; lagged immigration views are included in models to reveal the predictors of over time developments. The most robust findings signal that frequent church attendance reduces immigration concerns; routinely helping others enhances them. And in both instances, these relationships are conditioned by the presence of immigrants in the residential area. Overall, the results position social participation in certain activities as important factors that shape people's views on immigration.

AB  - This paper examines the conflicts and politics of heritage within communities and across the ethnic divide in Cyprus. By looking at three case studies of religious, antiquarian and modern heritage, it underscores the selective appropriations and restorations of heritage as well as problems of heritage identification and protection. Specifically it is concerned with the status of churches and building of mosques in the northern part of the island, the symbolic uses of the Kyrenia shipwreck and its replicas, and the difficulty in politically appropriating the ruined Nicosia airport that is located in the UN Buffer Zone.

T1  - Nationalism and Ethnic Conflict in Transcaucasia and its Role in the Dissolution of the Soviet Union: A Comparative Perspective
AN  - 1030936774
AB  - In 1985, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachov initiated the perestroika, which was meant to liberalize the country's centrally planned economy and strictly controlled society. However, as often happens with attempts to liberalize, there soon comes a borderline that the initiator of liberalization had not expected to meet or intended to cross, but by then it is usually too late to stop. The series of reforms introduced went out of Gorbachov's control and only gave rise to strong nationalist movements in the Soviet Republics. This essay deals with the roots of nationalism in South Caucasus (Transcaucasia) in the last years of perestroika in the Soviet Union and the role of ethnic conflicts in shaking the state shortly before its dissolution in 1991. Parallels are drawn between the Baltic and the Transcaucasian nationalist movements to examine common features as well as differences within the framework of a unified Soviet state.

T1  - Looking for 'tribals' without politics, 'warlords' without history: the drug economy, development and political power in Afghanistan
AN  - 1373427324; 201328903
AB  - The post-September 11 narrative of the drug economy attempts to isolate this 'problem' to the space of Afghanistan locally by stressing the tropes of tribalism and warlordism. In this narrative, these two phenomena are framed as obstacles in building a strong state and its institutions and ensuring development in Afghanistan. In contrast, I propose to understand tribalism and warlordism as political and historical categories, both in the sense of their discursive use as well as their function in Afghan social and political life, as Afghans organized themselves, but were also organized by others -- though not in isolation, but in continuous engagement with these others. I place this analysis within the broader discussion of understanding how the Cold War interventions affected the organizing of political power in Afghanistan. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnic Conflict and Violence in Heterogeneous Societies
AN  - 1081866414; 201237819
AB  - Ethnic groups have tended to conflict since the beginning of the known human history, and the intensity of violent conflicts does not seem to have decreased during the last centuries. Why are ethnic conflicts so common across all civilizational boundaries and over time? Researchers have explained particular ethnic conflicts as being due to various political, cultural, and other environmental factors, but they have not yet been able to produce any theoretical explanation that could be tested by global empirical evidence. It will be argued in this paper that the universality of ethnic conflict can be traced to our common human nature, to our evolved disposition to ethnic nepotism. This hypothesis is tested by empirical evidence on a scale of institutionalized ethnic interest conflict (IC) and on a scale of ethnic violence (EV), which are intended to measure the degree of ethnic conflict from two different perspectives, and by the degree of ethnic heterogeneity (EH), which is used to measure ethnic nepotism, in a group of 176 contemporary countries. The results show that EH explains approximately 70 percent of the global variation in IC and nearly half of the variation in EV. These results leads to the conclusion that ethnic nepotism provides the most powerful theoretical explanation for the persistence of ethnic conflicts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Democratic legitimacy, legal expressivism, and religious establishment
AN  - 1023030569; 201226821
AB  - I argue that some instances of constitutional religious establishment can be consistent with an expressivist interpretation of democratic legitimacy. Whether official religious endorsements disparage or exclude religious minorities depends on a number of contextual considerations, including the philosophical content of the religion in question, the attitudes of the majority, and the underlying purpose of the official status of the religious doctrine.

T1  - Semi-legal family life: Pakistani couples in the borderlands of Denmark and Sweden
AN  - 1766821180
AB  - In 2002, the Danish government introduced new legislation on family reunification to restrict the transnational arranged marriages that were occurring among some immigrant groups. Since then, thousands of people have emigrated from Denmark to Sweden where, as citizens of the European Union, they are entitled to family reunification. In this article, I introduce the concept of semi-legality to describe the situation whereby Pakistani transnational couples commute on a regular basis between their legal residences in Sweden and their places of work or networks of friends and family in Denmark. The married couples subjected to this mobile lifestyle are always in a process of becoming illegal, which is the consequence of 'overstaying' in Denmark or 'understaying' in Sweden. Besides its legal aspects, a semi-legal status also has significant moral implications that not only restructure marriage patterns and family life among Pakistani immigrants but also have long-lasting effects on the relationship between minorities and majorities in Denmark.

T1  - Globalization and Transformation in South Africa: The Hosting of the 2010 World Cup
AN  - 1417523244; 201333463
AB  - In 2010, a series of events highlighted the intersection of globalization influences with internal needs when South Africa hosted the 2010 Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup. The mega-event afforded significant potential opportunities for displaying apparent racial harmony and enjoying global visibility, generating economic and other payoffs at home, and celebrating progress in post-apartheid transformation. This paper considers the World Cup mega-event issues in the context of societal and educational realities, and of the debate over the expectations for- and legacy after the event. The case illustrates the dialectic of the global and the local in the manner that the World Cup played out at all levels from global to local, including in the ramifications for schools. Long-term qualitative research provides examples of micro-level realities in schools in relation to macro- and meso-level policies and events. A retrospective on the World Cup mega-event reveals few long-term benefits to South Africa, and much debate over the tangible and intangible benefits. The entwined nature of education and society is evident in the aftermath and the return to reality that prompted calls for South Africa to rethink susceptibility to globalization influences, and to focus instead on needs at home including preventing further losses of earlier educational transformation gains.

T1  - My Culture Made Me Do It: Lay Theories of Responsibility for Automatic Prejudice
AN  - 1221407596; 201243949
AB  - The present research examined the effects of egocentric motivations on individuals' explanations for how their automatic racial prejudices came into being. The majority of participants reported experiencing biased thoughts, feelings, and gut reactions toward minorities which they found difficult to consciously control, and they attributed such biases to cultural socialization. Of particular interest, ego-threatened participants were significantly more likely to attribute their automatic racial biases to their culture and significantly less likely to attribute such biases to themselves. Results suggest that attributing one's racial biases to cultural socialization can be a defensive, motivated process aimed at diminishing personal responsibility. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - National Seminar on Development, Conflict and Democratic Governance: India's Experience in the North-East
AN  - 1125218730; 201241529
AB  - The immediate context of the seminar, organised at the North-Eastern Hill University (NEHU) Campus, Shillong on 9-10 June 2011, was the continuing extra-judicial killings of innocents in Manipur in the name of fighting insurgency. Development of a kind is apparently going on in the state side by side with such killings. This has serious implications for democratic governance. The broader context of the seminar may be briefly spelt out. While per capita development expenditure in the region is reported to be higher than in the rest of the country, the issue of persisting conflict, hidden and explicit, indicates a disconnect between development expenditure and the improvement of human happiness. It would appear that neither economic development by itself nor ethnic mobilisation alone is adequate to address the causes of social discontent.

T1  - Perceived out-group (dis)continuity and attribution of responsibility for the Lebanese Civil War mediate effects of national and religious subgroup identification on intergroup attitudes
AN  - 1023028874; 201223691
AB  - Successful reconciliation between groups following a violent conflict requires psychological change. We test a model predicting intergroup attitudes towards Muslims in Lebanon among Maronite (Christian) Lebanese youths. Identification with both their religious subgroup and with the superordinate national group predicted attitudes towards Muslims, in opposite directions. These effects of levels of identification on intergroup attitudes were mediated by attributions of responsibility for the war (Muslim responsibility) and perception that the current generation of out-group members is different from the war generation (perceived out-group discontinuity). Identification with Lebanon fosters positive attitudes towards Muslims by lowering Muslim responsibility for the war, and by increasing perceptions of foreign responsibility and perceived out-group discontinuity. In contrast, increased identification with their own religious subgroup undermines attitude change by increasing Muslim responsibility for the war and lessening perception of out-group discontinuity. Representations of the past have implications for attitudes towards former enemies and reconciliation in the present. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Public Ethnic Regard and Academic Adjustment Among Latino Adolescents
AN  - 1037881896; 201233463
AB  - This study examined whether Latino adolescents' perceptions of personal support vis-a-vis those of ethnic regard by adults at school differentially relate to academic outcomes. Data were drawn from a sample of 156 Latino students (age M=16.17, SD=1.27; 61% girls, 39% boys) attending an urban high school. As expected, youth who perceived more positive public ethnic regard (i.e., by adults at school) were more engaged and higher achieving than their counterparts with more negative public regard. Importantly, after accounting for personal support from adults in school, public ethnic regard contributed uniquely to the variance explained by models predicting academic engagement and performance. These results suggest that public ethnic regard comprises a meaningful dimension of Latino adolescents' relationships with adults in school. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Interactions in Black and White: Racial differences and similarities in response to interracial interactions
AN  - 852897991; 201103078
AB  - The current work examined Black and White people's expectancies for interracial interactions. Across two studies, we found that Black people, compared to White people, had more positive past interracial contact, which statistically explained Black compared to White people's greater self-efficacy for interracial interactions. This self-efficacy, in turn, contributed to less of a desire to avoid future interracial interactions (Study 2) and partially accounted for race differences in actual amounts of subsequent interracial contact (Study 1). However, Black participants also had heightened concerns about being the target of bias in interracial interactions, which contributed to responses to imagined future interactions. These findings suggest that cultural experiences affect individuals' expectancies for interracial interactions and that these expectancies, in turn, have consequences for the quality and quantity of interracial contact.

T1  - Genealogy, history, nation
AN  - 2697554092
AB  - This article uses Central Asian examples to challenge theories of ethnic nationalism that locate its origins in intellectual activism (Hroch), state modernization processes (Gellner), or the rise of mass media (Anderson). Modern Uyghur cultural politics and traditional Central Asian dynastic genealogies reveal related processes used in constructing modern nationalist symbols and pre-modern ideologies of descent. Modern territorial states with ideals of social unification and bureaucratic organization rely upon nationalist discourses to elaborate and rework cultural forms into evidence for the ethnic nation. The state links citizens to institutions through nationalist content used in political discourse, schooling, and public performances. Because such content is presented as authentic but used instrumentally, its contingency and fabrication have to be concealed from view: the culturally intimate spaces of bureaucratic production of culture and narratives are separated from public performances. The creation of genealogies used to legitimate pre-modern states are similar: compositional processes and goals are kept offstage, and little is disclosed in the public historical narratives and performances.

T1  - Nation-formation and national movement(s) in Pakistan: a critical estimation of Hroch's stage theory
AN  - 2698634404
AB  - The present article critically evaluates Hroch's theory in light of the Sindhi and Baloch national movements in Pakistan. At the heart of the issue are the social preconditions and the stage theory which Hroch posits to comprehend both the formation of nations and origins of the national movement. As far as social preconditions are concerned, the article contests the overarching notion in Hroch's theory that only when a complete class structure develops that the nation comes into being and the national movement itself is successful. With respect to the stage theory, the article brings into contention the variable of “intra-ethnic conflict” or the conflicts which inheres within nations. This makes the linear progression from Stage A to B to C, as Hroch identifies, difficult to achieve because within a single nation multiple national movements exist. In such a scenario, one can depict a stage theory for each national movement within a single nation. Finally, I argue, that in order to understand nation formation and national movements, it is imperative that the ideological orientation of national movements, or in other words, nationalism should also be put in proper perspective.

T1  - System-perpetuating asymmetries between explicit and implicit intergroup attitudes among indigenous and non-indigenous Chileans
AN  - 758124405; 201056774
AB  - The present research demonstrates a dissociation between explicit and implicit intergroup evaluation in the reciprocal attitudes between indigenous (Mapuche) and non-indigenous Chileans. In both social groups, the explicit measures of attitudes towards the respective in-group and out-group were compared with the Implicit Association Test scores. The results indicate that the members of the low-status minority might explicitly express a moderate evaluative preference for their in-group but might implicitly devalue it. Conversely, the members of the high-status majority might implicitly devalue their out-group but might explicitly express no bias. These results are theoretically framed in terms of system justification, conventional stereotypes and motivated correction processes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Western Views Toward Muslims: Evidence from a 2006 Cross-National Survey
AN  - 743047117; 201032538
AB  - Concerns about Islamic extremism and ongoing debates about the integration and assimilation of Muslims into Western societies continue to attract considerable attention from the media, policymakers, and scholars, but relatively little cross-national research has been done on Western attitudes toward Muslims. This article attempts to address this question by exploring 2006 Pew Global Attitudes data among non-Muslims in Britain, France, Germany, Spain, and the U.S. Using structural equation modeling, we examine the determinants of Western views toward Muslims, and find that threat perceptions are the primary factor influencing these views. Specifically, our analysis suggests that perceptions of security threats drive attitudes regarding Muslims, and that perceived cultural threats are only indirectly related to views towards Muslims.

T1  - Conflict and Cooperation in Market Spaces: Learning from the Operation of Local Networks of Civic Engagement in African Market Trade
AN  - 201171601
AB  - This paper is concerned with conflict and the operation of local networks of civic engagement in the Nigerian market place. African markets are commonly significant meeting points-associational sites - for diverse ethnic and social groups: the economic and social exchange which takes place there in the 'everyday' is the epitome of social engagement and cooperation. But at times of tension the market place is a frequent flashpoint where conflict becomes tangible and conflagration a regular outcome. We examine the role of a range of internal and external institutions and actors in market and trader dispute regulation. Our case study analysis shows the remarkable role which is regularly played by local actors and networks of civic engagement within and in the vicinity of the Nigerian market space to diffuse tension and, where disputes emerge, to reinstate order. These components are a reflection of the value placed on traditional market trading spaces in Nigerian society: they remain essential to the livelihood and wellbeing of millions of people, rich and poor.

T1  - What is ethnic in an ethnic economy?
AN  - 2017947781
AB  - This article examines critically the relationship between ethnicity and entrepreneurship in the sociology of immigrant economies. It argues that what is ethnic in an ethnic economy has often been confusingly conceptualised and that several factors now call for re-assessing the ethnic nature of immigrants' business activities. On the basis of a review of recent research, three such factors are outlined: the porosity of ethnic boundaries to cross-group business interactions; the diversity within immigrant economies in terms of status, gender, class and generation; and the political and institutional context in which immigrant economies take place. The conclusion stresses the need for multiple explanations of how and why immigrants become entrepreneurs, which take into account not only the meso-level constituted by ethnicity and social capital, but also micro-individual factors and macro-institutional settings.
