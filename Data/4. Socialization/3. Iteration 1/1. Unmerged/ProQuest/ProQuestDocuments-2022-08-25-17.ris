T1  - Sexual orientation information and hiring: Can individualizing information lead to negative stereotyping of sexual minority group members?
AN  - 2661293152
AB  - Impression formation can be biased by group stereotypes. Experiments on impression formation in the hiring context in which applicants' sexual orientation was manipulated have yielded mixed findings: positive, negative, or no stereotyping and discrimination of lesbian or gay applicants. However, impressions of individuals depend on more than their sexual orientation. The present research targets the question of whether adding individualizing information about an applicant can lead to assimilation to group stereotypes and thus negative impressions. To present individualizing information, we drew on social‐network profiles for their practical relevance in contemporary application processes. Specifically, we tested whether private information concerning the romantic relationship of a lesbian, gay, or bisexual applicant leads to the application of negative stereotypes. In the role of a personnel manager, participants evaluated social‐network profiles and application material. Participants rated one fictitious applicant on agency, communion, and hireability. In Experiment 1 (N = 316), male and female applicants differed in sexual orientation and were additionally depicted alone or being kissed by their partner. In Experiment 2 (N = 419), focusing on male applicants, we hypothesized that negative stereotypes are activated if gay or bisexual, but not heterosexual men live in a non‐normative relationship form (polyamory vs. control: monoamory). Different from expectations, adding individualizing information did not lead to more negative impressions of gay, lesbian, or bisexual applicants. We discuss the implications of these positive impressions for social‐psychological theories.

T1  - Changing “us” and hostility towards “them”—Implicit theories of national identity determine prejudice and participation rates in an anti‐immigrant petition
AN  - 2408790823
AB  - National identity definitions determine who belongs to the national ingroup (e.g., “us Germans”) versus the “foreign” outgroup prone to hostile outgroup bias. We conducted five studies in two countries investigating if viewing the ingroup's national identity as fixed exacerbates the perceived divide between ingroup and outgroup and thus increases anti‐immigrant hostility, while a malleable view blurs the divide and reduces anti‐immigrant hostility. In a Prestudy (58 participants), an Implicit Theory of National Identity Scale was developed. In Studies 1 (154 participants) and 2 (390 participants), our scale predicted individuals’ prejudice and participation rates in a hypothetical referendum and a real petition against immigrants. In Studies 3 (225 participants) and 4 (225 participants), experimental evidence was obtained. Leading participants to believe that the definition of “a true compatriot” changes over time (rather than remaining the same) resulted in lower levels of prejudice and participation rates in an anti‐immigrant petition.

T1  - Luxury consumption as identity markers in Tallinn: A study of Russian and Estonian everyday identity construction through consumer citizenship
AN  - 2385919894
AB  - While the importance of consumption of luxury goods as a mechanism accompanying upwards movement in a social hierarchy has been well acknowledged, attention to the role and perceptions of luxury in multicultural societies has been scarce so far. It is nonetheless intriguing that ethnic groups inhabiting the same territory, and exposed to a same culture, might develop substantially different notions of luxury, which may end up affecting the integration, or isolation, of one of the groups. Our article addresses this deficiency in the literature by exploring the case of Estonia, a multi-ethnic society where Russians make up almost one-fourth of the population. Much has been written about the integration, and lack thereof, of ethnic Russians into Estonian society. We contrast these views by looking at inter-ethnic relations in the country from a different angle and by a) looking at consumption of luxury in the country through the concept of ‘conspicuous consumption'; b) endorsing Foster's concept of consumer citizenship. This allows us to shed light on an under-explored tendency and maintain here that, in a significant number of cases, ordinary citizens challenge official identity narratives by the state through counter-narratives centred around consumption of luxury at the everyday level. The identified counter-narratives end up translating into (consumer behaviour) instructions for those Russians willing to assert their Estonianness thus allowing them to seek integration into the majority group by simply consuming luxury items that they perceive as appreciated among Estonians, or associated with Estonian high status. By doing this, we make a case for expanding the parameters for academic scrutiny of social integration to include more ‘banal' forms of consumer practices through which top- down narratives and macro studies may be challenged.

T1  - Toleration and prejudice‐reduction: Two ways of improving intergroup relations
AN  - 2369759945
AB  - While a large body of social psychological research has shed light on the nature of prejudice and how to reduce it, we argue that such work does not address situations of cultural or religious outgroup beliefs and practices that are considered incompatible with one's own. The present theoretical article contrasts a prejudice‐reduction approach with a toleration‐based approach to consider the differences each have with regard to the attitude object they focus upon, the perceived reasonableness of the attitude, and the behavioral consequences each may lead to. In doing so, we consider the psychological processes involved in whether the negative attitude leads to negative actions. We conclude by arguing that a toleration‐based approach forms an important addition to the psychological thinking about cultural diversity and intergroup relations. Collectively, the present work makes a novel contribution to the social psychological literature by stimulating theory development and raising novel questions for empirical research.

T1  - I Know (What) You Are, But What Am I? The Effect of Recategorization Threat and Perceived Immutability on Prejudice
AN  - 2318587377
AB  - Learning one is similar to a stigmatized group can threaten one’s identity and prompt disassociation from the group. What are the consequences of learning of a similarity to a stigmatized group when that similarity implies possible recategorization into the group? We investigated how learning of an immutable, recategorization implying similarity with an outgroup affects implicitly and explicitly assessed prejudice. In Study 1, White participants who believed they had above average genetic overlap with African Americans showed decreased prejudice on implicit but not explicit measures. In Study 2, straight/heterosexual participants who were led to believe they exhibited some same-sex attraction showed reduced implicitly assessed prejudice, but only if they believed sexual orientation was biologically determined. Thus, learning of an identity-implying similarity with an outgroup can reduce implicit prejudice if that group membership is believed to be immutable. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - The mobilizing and protective role of national identification in normative and non‐normative collective action
AN  - 2287775379
AB  - In the context of the financial crisis in Europe and drawing on social identity and perceived disadvantage literature, this research explored national identification, perceived prejudice, perceived ostracism, and anger as predictors of intentions to engage in normative collective action and support for non‐normative and destructive action. Correlational data were collected in Greece (N = 218), Portugal (N = 312), and Italy (N = 211) during the financial crisis that affected several European countries in the early 2010s. Hierarchical regressions showed that national identification, above and beyond all other variables, positively predicted normative collective action intentions, and negatively predicted support for non‐normative action. That is, people who were identified more strong with their national identity were more likely to report that they will engage in collective action to enhance the position of their (national) in‐group, and less likely to support destructive collective action. Mediation analyses revealed that in the case of Portugal and Italy, national identification associated negatively with anger, while anger positively predicted normative collective action. The findings of this research point to the importance of national identification as a factor, that, on the one hand motivates people's mobilization toward supporting the rights of the ingroup but on the other hand impedes the more negative and destructive side of collective action. The contextual and instrumental role of national identity in contexts of threat is discussed.

T1  - Post‐Critical Belief Scale and Scripture as Predictors of Prejudice
AN  - 2246701115
AB  - Recent research has linked the strength of belief (transcendence) dimension of the Post‐Critical Belief Scale (PCBS) and exposure to violent Bible verses to greater prejudice toward value‐violating outgroups. Effects of exposure to specific Bible verses on attitudes toward outgroup members have not been measured in combination with the PCBS. The current study examined the two dimensions of the PCBS and exposure to scriptural endorsements of prejudice as predictors of prejudice toward value‐violating outgroups. The strength of belief dimension of the PCBS was a significant predictor of attitudes toward atheists, gay men, lesbians, Christians, and highly religious people. Conversely, exposure to scriptural endorsements of prejudice toward atheists and gay individuals did not have a significant effect on levels of prejudice. Implications are discussed in terms of intergroup bias and the religious values conflict model.

T1  - CONTESTED MEANINGS AND LIVED EXPERIENCES OF TWO-SPIRITNESS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE CANADIAN RESEARCH LITERATURE
AN  - 2448460557
AB  - The term "Two-Spirit" refers to Indigenous individuals embodying both male and female spirits. Two-Spirit individuals perform the social roles of medicine healers, priests, and shamans, who conduct spiritual rituals, in traditional Indigenous ceremonies and practices. While a few researchers conceptualize Two-Spirit individuals as a distinct social group with their own unique history of colonial oppression, most have considered Two-Spirit persons to constitute a trans or sexual minority subgroup. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to provide a systematic review of Canadian research conducted specifically on Two-Spirit people and their communities. The findings were categorized into themes, such as historical focus, transition to modern ideas, contemporary meanings of Two-Spiritness, discriminatory experiences of Two-Spirit people, and the Two-Spirit narratives of resistance in Canada. Two-Spirit identity emerged as a complex terminology, depending on the unique traditions of Indigenous cultures and individuals' subjective experiences of identity development, discrimination from home communities and mainstream society, and resistance. The strengths and limitations of this review as well as future research implications are outlined.Alternate abstract:Le terme "bispirituel" fait reference aux individus autochtones aux esprits et feminin et masculin. Ces individus bispirituels assument les fonetions de guérisseur, de prétre et de chamane, effectuant des rituels spirituels au cours de ceremonies et de pratiques autochtones traditionnelles. Si quelques chercheurs voient en ces individus bispirituels les membres d'un groupe social distinct ayant subí le colonialismo autrement que d'autres autochtones, la plupart voient en ces individus les membres d'un groupe minoritaire défini par une minorisation de ľidentité sexuelle. Cet article a done pour but d'offrir un coup d'oeil systématique sur la recherche canadienne portant sur les bispirituels et leurs communautés. On a categorise les conclusions en themes, teis que ľoptique historique, la transition vers les idées modernes, les sens contemporains du bispiritisme, les individus bispirituels face â la discrimination, et leurs traditions de resistance au Canada. Il en découle que ľidentité bispirituelle constitue une terminologie complexe dont la naissance depend des traditions uniques des cultures autochtones, de 1'experience et la variation identititaire variables de différents individus, de discrimation provenant des foyers ď origine de ces individus comme celle provenant de la société allochtone, et enfin de resistance. On donne un aper&ecedil;u des points forts comme des limites de eet examen de la recherche, et aussi des implications pour de futures recherches.

These findings support the intergroup anxiety model, which suggests that following an anxiety-inducing threatening experience, outgroup evaluations can amplify emotional reactions and stress. In this study, we investigated whether threatened participants who derogated would show higher cortisol levels. Canadian undergraduates (N = 169) read either a threatening or favourable passage about Canadians. They then engaged in either a linguistic intergroup bias (LIB) or control task. Salivary samples were collected prethreat, postthreat, and posttask. The results suggest that ingroup threat was associated with increases in cortisol levels. Threatened participants who displayed LIB showed higher cortisol levels than those who were threatened and did not show LIB. These findings illustrate the importance of incorporating a neuroscientific approach.

T1  - The Impact of the Great Recession on Perceived Immigrant Threat: A Cross-National Study of 22 Countries
AN  - 2124145023
AB  - In an increasingly globalized world, anti-immigrant sentiment has become more prevalent. Competitive threat theory suggests that anti-immigrant attitudes increase when adverse economic circumstances intensify competition with immigrants for scarce resources, but past studies using this approach are inconclusive. In this study, we investigate the impact of the Great Recession on perceived immigrant threat—an index of seven items measuring attitudes toward immigrants—using the 2013 International Social Survey Program survey. Using multilevel models, we analyze responses from 18,433 respondents nested within 22 countries. We create a country-level measure of the Great Recession Index comprised of four dimensions—the housing crash, the financial crisis, economic decline, and employment loss—and assess its impact on perceived immigrant threat. After controlling for a variety of individual-level and country-level covariates, we find that the Great Recession is positively associated with perceived immigrant threat. We also identify important interaction effects between the Great Recession Index and change in government expenditures, age, educational levels, citizenship, and urbanization. The study contributes to competitive threat theory by showing the effect of the Great Recession in exacerbating anti-immigrant sentiment.

T1  - Living under threat: Mutual threat perception drives anti‐Muslim and anti‐Western hostility in the age of terrorism
AN  - 2072256300
AB  - This research demonstrates a common psychology of outgroup hostility driven by perceived intergroup threat among three groups and seven cultural contexts: non‐Muslim Westerners, Muslims in Western societies, and Muslims in the Middle East. In Study 1, symbolic, but not realistic and terroristic threats, predicted non‐Muslim Norwegians' intentions to join anti‐Islamic movements. In Study 2, symbolic and realistic, but not terroristic threat, predicted non‐Muslim Americans' willingness to persecute Muslims. In Studies 3 and 4, symbolic threat predicted support and behavioral intentions against the West among Swedish and Turkish Muslims. Finally, in Study 5, a comparison demonstrated that symbolic and realistic threats had the same effects on violent intentions among non‐Muslim and Muslim Danes, and Muslims in Afghanistan. Meta‐analysis showed that symbolic threat was most strongly associated with intergroup hostility. Across studies, participants with high religious group identification experienced higher levels of threat. Implications for intergroup research and prejudice reduction are discussed.

T1  - The unique effects of blatant dehumanization on attitudes and behavior towards Muslim refugees during the European ‘refugee crisis’ across four countries
AN  - 2072252773
AB  - Blatant dehumanization has recently been demonstrated to predict negative outgroup attitudes and behaviors. Here, we examined blatant dehumanization of Muslim refugees during the ‘Refugee Crisis’ among large samples in four European countries: the Czech Republic (N = 1307), Hungary (N = 502), Spain (N = 1049), and Greece (N = 934). Our results suggest that blatant dehumanization of Muslim refugees is (a) prevalent among Europeans, and (b) uniquely associated with anti‐refugee attitudes and behavior, beyond political ideology, prejudice, and—of particular relevance to the refugee crisis—empathy. We also find that blatant dehumanization of Muslim refugees is significantly higher and more strongly associated with intergroup behavior in the Eastern European countries (especially the Czech Republic) than in Spain and Greece. Examining a range of outgroup targets beyond refugees, our results further illustrate that blatant dehumanization is not purely an ethnocentric bias: while individuals across contexts feel warmer towards their group than all others, they rate several high‐status outgroups as equally or more fully ‘evolved and civilized’ than the ingroup. Our research extends theoretical understanding of blatant dehumanization, and suggests that blatant dehumanization plays an important and independent role in the rejection of Muslim refugees throughout Europe.

T1  - Health Providers' Narratives on Intimate Partner Violence Against Roma Women in Spain
AN  - 2082950785
AB  - This qualitative study identifies health professionals' dominant, adaptive, and liberating narratives regarding inter-ethnic relations when talking about intimate partner violence (IPV) and the health system responses to the way it affects Roma women. Dominant narratives are oppressive internalized stories that shape social perceptions of members of both dominant and minority groups, adaptive narratives refer to those that acknowledge asymmetry and inequality, and liberating narratives directly challenge oppression with resistant views of stereotypes and negative interpretations. A total of 25 in-depth interviews were carried out with healthcare professionals in Spain in 2015. A discourse analysis of the interview transcriptions was conducted, showing the way in which different narratives about Roma people and IPV are combined among health providers. Dominant narratives were more salient: they were used by health providers to reflect prejudicial social perceptions in Spain that depict the Roma as a marginalized and traditional group, to construct Roma women in negative and prejudicial terms as patients, and to explain the existence of the cultural normalization of IPV among Roma women. Adaptive and liberating narratives showed a prevailing ideology in terms of the tendency to socially discriminate against Roma people. Using liberating narratives to train and raise awareness among health professionals about IPV among Roma women could facilitate a positive change in their treatment of Roma women who could be affected by IPV, helping to ameliorate the maintenance of existing prejudices.

T1  - Losing Common Ground: Social Sorting and Polarization
AN  - 2055713216
AB  - The alignment between partisan and other social identities has generated a rift between Democrats and Republicans that is deeper than any seen in recent American history. Without the cross-cutting identities that have traditionally stabilized the American two-party system, partisans in the American electorate are now seeing each other through prejudiced and intolerant eyes. In this article, partisan social divisions are examined in the 2016 electorate, with an eye to the co-occurrence between these social divisions and contemporaneous resistance to compromise and intolerance of social outgroups. In particular, as Republicans and Democrats grow more socially distinct, they like outgroups less and privilege victory over the national greater good. This effect is particularly visible among Republicans, whose social makeup is particularly homogeneous, even in comparison with Democrats. Some potential solutions are briefly addressed.

T1  - Using nostalgia to reduce prejudice toward immigrants
AN  - 2011519324
AB  - Based on research that points to nostalgia as a means of warding off stigmatization, this study suggests that nostalgia triggered by a past encounter with a close immigrant from the in‐group can improve attitudes toward out‐group immigrants. Focusing on immigration in Greece, 99 university students (M = 23.06, SD = 5.44) participated in the study. Participants who were induced with nostalgia reported higher social connectedness, inclusion of the out‐group in the self, out‐group trust, and positive out‐group attitude compared with participants in the control condition. The aforementioned findings demonstrated that the positive effects of nostalgia about a close in‐group member (in this case, a Greek person), who shares an identity with the out‐group (being an immigrant), can generalize to the out‐group as a whole (immigrants in general). Further implications and future directions on the use of nostalgia as a means of improving attitudes are addressed.

T1  - Will we be harmed, will it be severe, can we protect ourselves? Threat appraisals predict collective angst (and its consequences)
AN  - 1993909245
AB  - Across four studies, we applied the cognitive model of anxiety to explicate the appraisals that elicit collective angst (i.e., concern for the in-group's future vitality). In Study 1a, consistent with the model, Québécois experienced collective angst when they appraised the following: (1) a threat as likely to harm their group, (2) a threat as severely harming their group, and (3) Québécois as not having efficacy to protect their group. In Study 1b, results were replicated in the context of the realistic threat that Islamic extremists pose to Christian-Lebanese. In Studies 2a and 2b, we manipulated the three appraisals and found a similar pattern of results in the context of a potential terrorist attack on American soil by Islamic extremists. Importantly, collective angst mediated the threat appraisal effect on (non-Muslim) Americans' prejudice towards Muslims. The utility of the appraisal model for regulating collective angst (and thus its consequences) is discussed.

T1  - Dearborn-Detroit Michigan: Ethnography of Faith and the U.S. Domestic and Foreign Policy Axis
AN  - 2084839729
AB  - The relationship between ethnic and faith communities in the United States and domestic forces relating to a converging and diverging social contract on the one hand, and US foreign, security and military policies in national, regional and global contexts on the other hand, constitutes the key focus of this paper and the ongoing research upon which it is based. Theories related to American ethnicity provide the theoretical framework for the discussion. These include Assimilationism, Ethnic Pluralism and Ethnic Conflict Theory. These theories help explain the prevalent narratives and assumptions concerning Muslims in the US. Ethnic and faith communities and groups have at times played significant and important roles in American national security and foreign policy. The power and influence of some ethnic and faith communities living inside the United States in relation to national security and foreign policies is well documented. These groups are overtly and covertly lobbying for national and foreign policy goals, creating a nexus and axis between domestic and foreign and national security policies. In the 21 century and in the post 9-11 world, the US administration's focus, lobbying and influence in ethnic and faith communities living inside the US in the service of its foreign, military and national security policies has been overlooked. Ethnic and faith communities in this new era and environment are at the center and core of this relationship.

T1  - Racial Resentment, Hurricane Sandy, and the Spillover of Racial Attitudes into Evaluations of Government Organizations
AN  - 1980069307
AB  - This study explores the relationship between individuals' racial attitudes, exposure to information cuing them to think about President Obama, and evaluations of the government's response to Hurricane Sandy. Using a split ballot experiment embedded in a large internet panel fielded during the 2012 presidential election, we show that respondents' evaluations of President Obama's response to Hurricane Sandy were based on their racial attitudes. We next examined the possibility for racial attitudes to "spill over" into how people evaluate governmental institutions and organizations associated with President Obama. We found evidence that respondents who were cued to think about President Obama and were impacted by Hurricane Sandy were more likely to base their evaluations of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's response to the disaster on their racial attitudes. In short, linking President Obama to Hurricane Sandy led people to ground their evaluations of an organization tasked with coordinating the response to Hurricane Sandy in their racial attitudes. Our research suggests that racial attitudes are important predictors of how individuals perceive President Obama's effectiveness as well as the efficacy of related government organizations.

T1  - The Failure of the Black Greek-Letter Organization
AN  - 1925331153
AB  - Between 1906 and 1920, eight of the most prominent Black Greek-letter organizations were established. The creation of the Black fraternity had a dual purpose. First, these organizations were established for the greater purpose of pooling the resources of African Americans in the hopes of acquiring an education. Second, these organizations were formed as an attempt by Black students to gain acceptance into American society. Black Greek-letter organizations are some of the most influential organizations in the country. Collectively, these organizations claim approximately 800,000 members, with many coming from the social elite of Black culture. Despite the great influence and vast membership that these organizations possess, the activities of the Black Greek-letter organization have included secret meetings, selective membership, and a preference for lighter complexioned members. Moreover, the failure and shortcomings of the Black Greek-letter organization have allowed Black elites to create a separate privileged society based on snobbery and arrogance and have thus enabled these organizations to perpetuate the vicious cycle of racial prejudice and White supremacy.

T1  - Are British Muslims alienated from mainstream politics by Islamophobia and British foreign policy?
AN  - 1900466598
AB  - This paper uses the 2010 Ethnic Minority British Election Study to look at the political attitudes of Muslims in Britain. It tests the relationship between political alienation and political participation on the one hand, and Islamophobia and disapproval of British military involvement in Afghanistan on the other. The principal findings are that perceptions of Islamophobia are linked to greater political alienation, to a greater likelihood of non-electoral participation and to a lower likelihood of voting among Muslims. Likewise, disapproval of the war in Afghanistan is associated with greater political alienation and a greater likelihood of some types of non-electoral participation. There is strong evidence that British Muslims are more likely to interpret discrimination they experience as motivated by their religion and that they perceive more prejudice at the group level. These findings have two theoretical implications. First, they support the theory that non-electoral participation is motivated by dissatisfaction with the party political system. Second, they suggest that perceptions of sociotropic discrimination (for minorities) and a rare salient political issue in which all parties are in opposition to most voters can lead to negative affect towards the political system and stimulate non-electoral participation at the expense of voting.

T1  - "It's Almost Like They Were Happier When You Were Down": Microaggressions and Overt Hostility Against Native Americans in a Community with Gaming
AN  - 1888628528
AB  - In this article, we use qualitative data from 100 Native Americans living in mid-Michigan to document the changing nature of interactions between whites and tribal members. The community studied has seen significant changes in the economic and social position of the tribal community thanks to two decades of successful gaming operations. We find that, while Native Americans attest to positive changes in the community, many of which originate within the tribe itself, hostile and negative attitudes on the part of whites persist. Some of these contemporary attitudes are carry-overs of traditional anti-Native prejudice, while others reflect a reworking of old stereotypes to reflect new realities, while maintaining an unequal racial order. Hostile attitudes are accompanied by discriminatory behavior, often in the form of microaggressions. We suggest that, while old-fashioned racism has not disappeared, modern racism is more subtle and complex. While contemporary Native Americans react to and resist racism in a variety of ways, modern racist attitudes and the microaggressions that accompany them serve to reinforce an unequal racial status quo and the maintenance of a racial hierarchy of group positions.

T1  - Role of diasporas in homeland conflicts, conflict resolution, and post-war reconstruction: the case of Tamil diaspora and Sri Lanka
AN  - 1922922098
AB  - The case of Sri Lanka and the Tamil diaspora can be cited as a classic case of participation by a diaspora in the homeland conflict and to some extent also in conflict resolution. Influenced by lived experiences of discrimination and suffering in an ethnocentric homeland and a range of racial prejudices and economic deprivation, in the host lands, the diaspora Tamils developed a strong sense of Tamil identity and ethno-nationalism which the LTTE could successfully harvest on. However, with the devastating civil war coming to an end, and a new government in power, numerous opportunities have opened up for diaspora participation in the development and reconstruction of the war-torn regions. All that is required is a pragmatic and reconciliatory approach by both sides - by the diaspora as well as by the Sri Lankan state.

T1  - Perceptions of diversity and attitudes of tolerance in the 'fragmented' U.K.
AN  - 1869136069
AB  - Relying on a quantitative survey (n = 1497) and semi-structured interviews (n = 30) conducted in the U.K., we explore British nationals', Romanian and Turkish migrants' attitudes of tolerance and the factors influencing them in the current socio-political context in the U.K. The quantitative data reveal the role of younger age, diverse networks, higher education, attachment to city/region and supranational identifications in more open attitudes towards diversity. The qualitative findings illustrate how diverse these three groups' attitudes of tolerance can be and how they are affected by their position and status in the U.K. The British' attitudes show their tolerance can reflect diverse forms of acceptance of ethnic and cultural differences but can also draw lines in terms of civic values opposing 'those who contribute to society' versus those who 'live as parasites'. The Turks are in favour of diversity with the expectation of receiving more civic rights and facing less prejudice. The Romanians tend to have a more ambiguous relation to diversity given their position of stigmatised migrants in the U.K. Our analysis reveal how inclusive or exclusive people's (sub- and supra-)national identities can be and how these frame their attitudes of tolerance.

T1  - When school meets the Other: intercultural policies in the Basque inclusive school
AN  - 1862143788
AB  - Gatti, Irazuzta and Martinez address the intercultural public policies implemented in the education system of the Autonomous Region of the Basque Country (Spain). Focusing on the education system allows them to reconstruct the historicity of identity-alterity production in a region in which language has been central for the establishment of ethnic frontiers. More specifically, they examine the implementation of these policies in three pre-school and primary educational institutions in a multicultural neighbourhood of the city of Bilbao. They look at Euskara-the Basque language-as a key element of the us-them distinction. The various education models regarding language and the teaching in/of Euskara or Spanish pave the way for the specialization and spatialization of the schools analysed. 'Integration' policies are implemented in ethnically marked schools only, based on a rhetoric of interculturality that assumes that any 'racial or ethnic discrimination' can be overcome through knowledge of the Other. Moreover, the assessment of public policies through 'interculturality figures and best practice' developed to address the so-called 'immigration issue' promotes a protectionist intervention on behalf of the assumed social vulnerabilities of immigrant schoolchildren and their families, which are read as 'problematic characteristics'. The article argues that, as a result of the approach based on the social conditions of immigrant children and their families in the Basque Country, the race issue evaporates.

T1  - Social Consequences of Securitizing Citizenship: Two-Tiered Citizenry and Anti-Immigrant Attitudes
AN  - 1963074448
AB  - In response to the rise in terrorism after the turn of the millennium, multiculturalist countries such as Australia, Britain and Canada introduced policies that make it easier to revoke the citizenships of dual nationals. These policies primarily target naturalized immigrants and their descendants. Ongoing debates indicate that more countries plan to follow suit. Some scholars argue that easy revocation policies create two-tiered political communities, where one group of citizens have a stronger status security than the other. This study builds on their perspectives, and argues that majority members should be more likely to hold anti-immigrant attitudes in countries where state policies discriminate against citizens in terms of status security. To test this hypothesis, this study employs multilevel regression analysis. Data come from European Values Study (2008), European Social Survey (2014), and Eurobarometer (2015), and cover thirty European countries. Findings offer support for the proposed hypothesis. In countries where immigrants have low status security, majority members are more likely to have negative attitudes toward immigrants. The results hold not only for immigrants in general but also for Muslim immigrants in particular.Alternate abstract:En réponse â la montée du terrorisme apres le tournant du millénaire, des pays multiculturalistes tels que l'Australie, la Grande-Bretagne et le Canada ont mis sur pied des politiques qui rendent plus facile la révocation de la citoyenneté des doubles nationalités. Ces politiques visent prioritairement les immigrants naturalisés et leurs descendants. Les débats en cours soutiennent que plus de pays prévoient d'appliquer la méme politique. Certains chercheurs affirment que les politiques de révocation faciles créent des communautés politiques â deux niveaux, oû un groupe de citoyens a un statut de sécurité plus rigide que l'autre. Cette étude s'appuie sur leur point de vue et postule que la majorité des membres serait plus susceptible d'avoir des attitudes anti-immigrantes dans les pays oû les politiques de l'État discriminent les citoyens en termes de statut de sécurité. Pour vérifier cette hypothese, cette étude se sert d'une analyse de régression â plusieurs niveaux. Les données proviennent de European Values Study (2008), European Social Survey (2014) et Eurobarometer (2015), et couvrent trente pays européens. Les résultats corroborent l'hypothese proposée. Dans les pays oû les immigrants ont un faible statut de sécurité, la majorité des membres est plus susceptible d'avoir des attitudes négatives â l'égard des immigrants. Les résultats concernent non seulement les immigrants en général, mais aussi les immigrants musulmans en particulier.

T1  - The language of threat: Linguistic perceptions and intergroup relations
AN  - 1867932097
AB  - Inspired by sociolinguistic scholarship, this study examines the influence of linguistic vitality, the social health of a language, on perceived in-group threat and out-group attitudes. Using an experimental design that manipulated perceptions of the linguistic vitality of French in Quebec, this study sought to ascertain the causal role of linguistic vitality on intergroup attitudes. The results demonstrate that the type of information, positive or negative, about linguistic vitality influences perceptions of threat towards a language. However, results about linguistic vitality information’s impact on out-group attitudes, support for independence and subjective identity revealed inter-individual heterogeneity.

T1  - Spanish Validation of the Polymorphous Prejudice Scale in a Sample of University Students
AN  - 1829808737
AB  - The shortened version of the Polymorphous Prejudice Scale (PPS) analyzes new manifestations of prejudice toward gay men and lesbian women. Specifically, this instrument consists of 16 items distributed in four subscales: values gay progress, positive beliefs about gay men, positive beliefs about lesbian women, and resistance to heteronormative expectations. The aim of the current study is to add new evidence about the reliability and validity of the scale. The scale is administrated to 348 heterosexual university students from Spain with a mean age of 22.62 years (SD = 7.63). Reliability and factorial validity estimates are presented. A four-factor structure is supported using confirmatory factor analysis (short version). Our results can be useful in planning variables for intervention programs designed to foster the tolerance and normality of sexual diversity.

T1  - 'You've got autism because you like order and you do not look into my eyes': some reflections on understanding the label of 'autism spectrum disorder' from a dishuman perspective
AN  - 1848149301
AB  - The psychiatrists and health professionals who 'updated' the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 2013 changed how 'autism' is meant to be interpreted. For example, Asperger's disorder merged into an overall collective of 'autism spectrum disorders', rendering Asperger's non-existent as a separate disorder. Yet the terms 'Asperger's', 'autistic' and 'autism', in general, are used on a daily basis by people who have been diagnosed/labelled in this way over the course of their lives, or indeed are used by people to label others in stereotypical and prejudicial ways that leads to their marginalisation. With this thought in mind, the author briefly reflects on his own experiences of being labelled with 'Asperger's' or as being 'autistic' (a label he rejects), whilst thinking from a 'dis/human' perspective, a viewpoint that seeks to unpack and challenge the dominant concepts of what it means to be human in the twenty-first century. While it is difficult to avoid being labelled in ways that lead to discrimination and rejection, a dishuman perspective offers a viewpoint against the narrow versions of what it means to be human, relating to how disability can trouble the notion of what it means to be human and indeed inform the very meaning of what it means to be human.

T1  - The Invisible Work of Closeting: A Qualitative Study About Strategies Used by Lesbian and Gay Persons to Conceal Their Sexual Orientation
AN  - 1818355230
AB  - The last decades have offered substantial improvement regarding human rights for lesbian and gay (LG) persons. Yet LG persons are often in the closet, concealing their sexual orientation. We present a qualitative study based on 182 histories submitted from 161 LG individuals to a Web site. The aim was to explore experiences of closeting among LG persons in Norway. A broad range of strategies was used for closeting, even among individuals who generally considered themselves to be out of the closet. Concealment was enacted by blunt denial, clever avoidance, or subtle vagueness. Other strategies included changing or eliminating the pronoun or name of the partner in ongoing conversations. Context-dependent concealment, differentiating between persons, situations, or arenas, was repeatedly applied for security or convenience. We propose a shift from "being in the closet" to "situated concealment of sexual orientation."

T1  - The Psychological Study of Positive Behavior Across Group Boundaries: An Overview
AN  - 1817460869
AB  - Negative intergroup processes such as prejudice and conflict have been a traditional focus of social psychological research, while work that explicitly focuses on the determinants of positive intergroup processes is still in its infancy. Reflecting these relatively recent developments in the social and behavioral sciences, this volume's contributions represent current directions in psychological theorizing and research on positive and proactive behavior across group boundaries. One intriguing feature of positive cross-group behaviors is that they can be conceived, at one and the same time, as individual, interpersonal, and collective phenomena. Accordingly, this volume is organized into three sections that represent these different levels of analysis. This multilevel approach represents a distinctive perspective that extends contemporary work on positive intergroup behavior. At a more general level, then, one important future outcome of this work could be a more nuanced picture of human social behavior in the context of groups.

T1  - 'I know it exists ... but I haven't experienced it personally': older Canadian men's perceptions of ageism as a distant social problem
AN  - 1808218202
AB  - This paper examines how older men perceive, experience and internalise ageist prejudice in the context of their everyday lives. We draw on in-depth interviews with 29 community-dwelling Canadian men aged 65-89. Although one-third of our participants were unfamiliar with the term ageism, the majority felt that age-based discrimination was prevalent in Canadian society. Indicating that they themselves had not been personally subjected to ageism, the men considered age-based discrimination to be a socially distant problem. The men explained their perceived immunity to ageism in terms of their youthful attitudes and active lifestyles. The men identified three groups who they considered to be particularly vulnerable to age-based discrimination, namely women, older workers and frail elders residing in institutions. At the same time, the majority of our participants had internalised a variety of ageist and sexist stereotypes. Indeed, the men assumed that later life was inevitably a time of physical decline and dependence, and accepted as fact that older adults were grumpy, poor drivers, unable to learn new technologies and, in the case of older women, sexually unattractive. In this way, a tension existed between the men's assertion that ageism did not affect their lives and their own internalisation of ageist stereotypes. We consider our findings in relation to the theorising about ageism and hegemonic masculinity.

T1  - 'The closet': A dangerous heteronormative space
AN  - 1834955033
AB  - Within the context of debates about the controversial issue of 'coming out of the closet', some theoreticians and gays argue that revealing individuals' gayness may reinforce a heterosexual order and may lead to homophobic abuse. On the other hand, liberal gays argue that revealing individuals' gayness may liberate them from the constraints of heterosexism. However, this decision may also lead to the danger of homophobic attacks. In order to transcend this dualism, I propose that a phenomenological/agentic approach to 'the closet' may contribute to a better understanding of gayness or 'coming out' as lived and experienced. Such a phenomenological/agentic perspective recognises that gayness as lived is to be understood in terms of, and within the limits of, what it reveals about itself in experience, and not what it pretends to disclose or hide about itself according to arbitrary and preconceived hegemonic criteria and prescriptions. To this end, I maintain that an interrogation of 'the closet' transcends the debate between assimilationists and liberalists. In addition, I argue that a phenomenological reflection on 'the closet' as a social, political and sexual heteronormative construct can help us to question and resist prejudicial assumptions and constructed beliefs that block our understanding of gayness as lived and experienced. Indeed, it is by becoming critically and reflectively conscious of belonging to the 'stigmatised collective' - which, as I will argue, is a product of a heterosexual social and sexual order - that people can liberate themselves from it.

T1  - Targets of Out-Group Hostility in the Contemporary United States: Individual- and Community-Level Factors Associated with the Experience of Anti-Semitism Among American Jews
AN  - 1828254511
AB  - While anti-Semitism has plagued American society, as well as many others, for centuries, anti-Semitism tends to be overshadowed in the social sciences by what are seen as more common forms of prejudice, discrimination, and racism. This tends to reinforce the erroneous view that anti-Semitism is not a significant social problem in the US today. The study of anti-Semitism must incorporate its uniqueness as a social problem and as a form of racism, prejudice, and discrimination, most vividly demonstrated in the Holocaust, and must take into consideration its history as well as its particular characteristics. This study seeks to answer the following primary research question: How do individual- and community-level factors relate to the perception or experience of anti-Semitism by Jews? This study focuses upon the prevalence and nature of anti-Semitism as it exists in the contemporary United States. Specifically, this research consists of regression analysis and a hierarchical linear model of the predictors of the experience of anti-Semitism on the individual as well as the community level. Data sources for this research consist of the 2000-2001 administration of the National Jewish Population Survey and a number of community studies on the Jewish population. These findings indicated that a number of individual- and community-level predictors significantly influence the experience of anti-Semitism.

T1  - Minority Identity Strategies Bound by Prejudice: Restricted Perspectives of People Categorized as Gypsies in Hungary
AN  - 1784567758
AB  - In this study, we explored the identity strategies of Hungarian Gypsies with different socialization backgrounds, including the degree of majority and minority identifications, the contents of Gypsy identity as well as coping with threatening social situations. Sampling was based on external social categorization: majority members were asked for contacts to Gypsy acquaintances. Questionnaire data were used to assess socialization background, group identification and preferred coping strategies at different levels, while contents of Gypsy identity were explored in an associative network. Results suggest that subjects make an exclusive choice between national and ethnic identities. While all subjects prefer ethnic identity, subjects with different socialization backgrounds follow different identity strategies. In sum, large-family subjects are emotionally attached to their ethnic group, avoid interaction with the majority and prefer the idea of a multicultural society. Small-family subjects are emotionally detached from their ethnic group and vote for a homogeneous society. Results are interpreted in terms of integration-related social policies. While these are aimed at the foundation of a recognized active minority, members of these new generations find the way of recognition in individual assimilation due to the threat of prejudice.

T1  - THE "SICK" RACIST
AN  - 1801833381
AB  - Since the early 1960s, there has been a movement among activists, scholars, and policymakers to redefine racism as a psychopathological condition, identifiable and treatable through psychotherapeutic and pharmacological interventions. This development reflects, and is reflected by, the popular framing among mass media and ordinary social actors of racism and racist events as individual pathology rather than as a social problem. This shifting perspective on racism, from a social problem and a system to an individual pathology, has increasingly become a part of academic and psychiatric discourse since Jim Crow. In this article, we have two aims: first, to trace the emergence of "psychopathological racism"; second, to illustrate the relationship between "psychopathological racism" and "colorblind racism" in the post-Civil Rights era. We argue that the psychopathological view of racism compliments colorblindness in that larger structural issues are dismissed in favor of individual pathos. Furthermore, psychopathological explanations for racism dismiss socio-political contexts, eschewing the contributions of well over fifty years of social scientific research in the process.

T1  - Introduction: The Civil Rights Movement, a retrospective
AN  - 1784145699
AB  - The vitality of the historiography of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States is obvious in the pieces featured in this issue of Patterns of Prejudice. 2015 is of course the fiftieth anniversary of the Martin Luther King-led Selma to Montgomery march in April 1965, followed by the signing into law of the Voting Rights Act in August by President Lyndon B. Johnson. We now also have a feature film about this whole process, Ava DuVernay's Selma, not to mention the televised visit by Congressman John Lewis and President Barack Obama to Selma on 7 April 2015 to commemorate Bloody Sunday fifty years earlier, 7 April 1965. It was on that day that civil rights marchers were set upon by Alabama state troopers on Edward Pettus Bridge and forcibly driven back into the black section of Selma. Furthermore, 9 April 2015 also marked the 150th anniversary of the end of the American Civil War, the bloodiest conflict of the nineteenth century in Europe or the Western Hemisphere. Thus, we are at a juncture where we might look backwards at just what the trends in writing about civil rights in the United States have been.

T1  - 'How long? Not long': Selma, Martin Luther King and civil rights narratives
AN  - 1784145400
AB  - Richard H. King's article begins by examining the way Ava DuVernay's recent film Selma deals with the relationship between Martin Luther King and previous accounts/representations of the Civil Rights Movement, and how other feature films such as Mississippi Burning and documentaries such as Stanley Nelson's Freedom Summer depict the movement. This in turn raises the question of what the dominant narrative of the Civil Rights Movement actually has been, and still is. King concludes that it is the King-centred 'From Montgomery to Memphis' narrative. He goes on to explore the ways in which this dominant narrative has been challenged by, for instance, the SNCC-related narrative found, most accessibly, in Nelson's documentary and, more broadly conceived, in Jacqueline Dowd Hall's influential 2005 article 'The Long Civil Rights Movement and the Political Uses of the Past'. Also, along the way, King discusses the relative strengths of feature films v. documentaries in illuminating the past. When comparing this with the written historiography of the Civil Rights Movement, he also explores the importance of the public v. private and the history v. memory debates for understanding the past. King's article concludes by examining the persistence of the Martin Luther King tradition in American politics and of Reverend King's reputation, as suggested by recent works such as David Chappell's Waking from the Dream.

T1  - Northern intellectuals and the ordeal of race: the first decade of Dissent, 1954-64
AN  - 1784144952
AB  - Founded in 1953-4, Dissent assigned itself the task of reviving the political criticism that socialism had been articulating for roughly the previous century and a half. Though the magazine largely abandoned Marxism by the end of the decade, Dissent would remain the most durable journal of democratic socialism in the English-speaking world. The first decade of its history coincided with the intensified momentum of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, and the quarterly certainly expressed its sympathy and support for the struggle for racial justice. But, in retrospect, the infrequency of that endorsement in the articles that were published in Dissent is noteworthy. Perhaps the two most famous articles ever to appear in the magazine nevertheless addressed the issue of race, and yet they did so with an eccentricity that made 'The White Negro' and 'Reflections on Little Rock' uncharacteristic of the stance of co-founders and co-editors Irving Howe and Lewis Coser. In 1957 Norman Mailer ignored the Civil Rights Movement itself to locate the emergence of a new kind of underground man, a hipster, who drew from the extreme and even violent alienation of the black sensibility to valorize the sensual and emotional at the expense of the rational and the civic. In 1959 Hannah Arendt repudiated the effort of civil rights organizations like the NAACP to desegregate public schools in the South, arguing that the psyches of black children were damaged by seeking to join hostile white children. Public schools, she argued, ought to be regarded as social institutions that permit discrimination. Instead the champions of racial equality ought to concentrate their efforts at eliminating the prohibitions against intermarriage. By the mid-1960s Dissent added its voice to the mainstream of the movement against Jim Crow, even as Howe celebrated black writers who managed to reconcile literary art with the imperatives of political protest.

T1  - What Is Race? UNESCO, mass communication and human genetics in the early 1950s
AN  - 1752183480
AB  - What Is Race? Evidence from Scientists (1952) is a picture book for schoolchildren published by UNESCO as part of its high-profile campaign on race. The 87-page, oblong, soft-cover booklet contains bold, semi-abstract, pared-down images accompanied by text, devised (so it declared) to make scientific concepts 'more easily intelligible to the layman'. Produced by UNESCO's Department of Mass Communication, the picture book represents the organization's early-postwar confidence in the power of scientific knowledge as a social remedy and diplomatic tool. In keeping with a significant component of the race campaign, What Is Race? presented genetics as the route to an enlightened, scientific, non-prejudiced understanding of race. This article seeks to explain the book's management, aesthetics and framing in the context of postwar disciplinary and international politics. Viewing UNESCO's race campaign as a high point for an internationalist ideology of mass education, this article also analyses the visual and literary arguments of What Is Race? and proposes that the enduring image of genetics as technical and neutral knowledge was in part shaped by UNESCO's efforts to communicate scientific authority to an apparently 'popular' audience.

T1  - Prejudice Toward Gender and Sexual Diversity in a Brazilian Public University: Prevalence, Awareness, and the Effects of Education
AN  - 1722098489
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate how gender and sexual diversity prejudice (GenSex) expresses itself in a university, how prejudice varies in relation to socio-demographic characteristics, the effects of religious status, and how exposure to GenSex education affects levels of prejudice. Eight thousand one hundred eighty-four undergraduate students from Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), in southern Brazil, completed the revised version of the Prejudice Against Sexual and Gender Diversity scale. Data reflect a concentration of 'extreme' and 'high' prejudice in students enrolled in Engineering, Agricultural Sciences, and the Exact and Geological Sciences. 'Moderate' and 'low' prejudice was over-represented in these disciplines as well as in Health, Applied Social Science, and Biological Sciences student samples. Conversely, those who have 'very low' or 'minimal' prejudice tended to cluster in Humanities and Linguistics and Arts. Most students were unaware of ongoing discrimination, reporting to have neither seen nor heard of discrimination towards LGBT students at the university. Time spent at the university had a negligible effect in prejudice mean reduction. Although a large effect was found for previous GenSex training, overall there was substantial variation across disciplines. We recommend raising student awareness of prejudice on campus, in addition to better GenSex education policy for all students, regardless of discipline.

T1  - The French secular hypocrisy: the extreme right, the Republic and the battle for hegemony
AN  - 1784145163
AB  - The success of the extreme right in France in the past two decades has not been limited to its electoral rise. A more long-lasting victory has taken place in the ideological field, where the discourse of the extreme right now occupies a prominent place in the mainstream liberal democratic agenda. Increasingly, its ideas are seen in the media and in the platforms of mainstream parties as 'common sense' or at least acceptable. The growing acceptance of this 'common sense' is the result of very carefully crafted strategies put in place by extreme-right thinkers since the 1980s. For over three decades now, in order to change perceptions and renew extreme right-wing ideology, New Right think tanks such as the French GRECE believed it was necessary to borrow the tactics of the left and, more specifically, the Gramscian concept of hegemony: cultural power must precede political power. With the use of contemporary examples, Mondon's article demonstrates the continuing impact these ideas have had on the Front national and French politics and society, and how this change originated in the association of populist rhetoric with the neo-racist stigmatization of the Other.

T1  - Mexico through a superdiversity lens: already-existing diversity meets new immigration
AN  - 1680151409; 201513879
AB  - New migration flows to Mexico are challenging long-established sociocultural configurations. So far, most studies on immigrants in Mexico have focused on singular ethno-national groups rather than paying attention to the intermingling of people. This paper presents an examination of diversification processes occurring in Guadalajara, Mexico. We contend that these are particularly strained because of the continuing frictions with which the country has to deal due to its already-existing diversity. The many forms of discrimination and racism that many Mexicans are subjected to by their co-nationals are often extended to new arrivals. The increasing complexity of migrant inflows challenges established forms of prejudice in everyday interactions. We argue in this paper that the use of superdiversity as a lens to study diversification processes allows us to better understand the changing dynamics currently taking place in Mexico.

T1  - Schools, Peers, and Prejudice in Adolescence
AN  - 1700674991; 201526988
AB  - Adolescents' perceptions of the prejudice in their social environments can factor into their developmental outcomes. The degree to which others in the environment perceive such prejudice-regardless of adolescents' own perceptions-also matters by shedding light on the contextual climate in which adolescents spend their daily lives. Drawing on the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study revealed that school-wide perceptions of peer prejudice, which tap into the interpersonal climate of schools, appeared to be particularly risky for adolescents' academic achievement. In contrast, adolescents' own perceptions of peer prejudice at schools were associated with their feelings of alienation in school. Importantly, these patterns did not vary substantially by several markers of vulnerability to social stigmatization. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Imagined Contact Works in High-Prejudice Contexts: Investigating Imagined Contact's Effects on Anti-Gay Prejudice in Cyprus and Jamaica
AN  - 1648864932
AB  - A growing body of evidence demonstrates that imagined contact can reduce prejudice in a variety of ways, against numerous groups, and in varied social contexts. Imagined contact has thus been suggested as an option for prejudice reduction where direct contact strategies may not be easy or practical. However, no research to date has tested imagined contact in high-prejudice contexts where direct contact is not a feasible option. In two experiments (N=42, N=100), we investigated whether imagined contact could be successfully applied as an intervention to reduce prejudice against gay men in two societies where direct contact would be particularly difficult or rare--Cyprus and Jamaica. Despite the relatively high prejudice against gay men reported in both societies, we found that imagined contact successfully improved attitudes, behavioral intentions, and social acceptance. We discuss the implications for imagined contact's use as a real-world intervention when direct contact strategies might not be plausible.

T1  - Anti-Islam or Anti-religion? Understanding Objection against Islamic Education
AN  - 1667948923; 201509651
AB  - Opposition against the accommodation of Islam in Western societies is often attributed to a prejudice against Muslims. This overlooks the possibility that opposition against Islam could also be caused by a more general aversion towards religion and a desire for a stricter separation between the state and religion in general. Based on the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS) of 2012, the current study investigated the non-Muslim majority's attitude towards religious education preferences in German public schools. By applying a multinomial logit model, we examined to what extent Islamophobic, xenophobic and religious attitudes predict whether people (i) support the provision of Islamic education, (ii) prefer only Christian education or (iii) opt for no religious education at all. Results show that Islamophobic and xenophobic attitudes are relevant indicators of objection against the provision of Islamic education in particular, while religiosity and religious style determine whether people support having religious education in general. Furthermore, the effect of Islamophobia and xenophobia depends on religious style. With these results the current study provides a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying resistance towards accommodating Islam in the public sphere. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Trans-national migration and the issue of 'ethnic' solidarity: Finnish Roma elite and Eastern European Roma migrants in Finland
AN  - 1933467257
AB  - From 2007 to 2008, the presence of migrant-beggars from Eastern European countries in Finland has brought about much discussion regarding the status of this group in what is perceived as a model welfare state. The beggars, identified mainly Roma from Romanian and Bulgaria, were not easily fitting within the ideals of work culture within a Nordic welfare society. Moreover, no clear demarcation was made between the groups of migrant Roma and the national, Finnish Roma community. This paper focuses on the views of some of the Finnish Roma 'elite' regarding the presence of Roma beggars in the Helsinki area, dealing with the interactions between national and migrant Roma in the city of Helsinki as a consequence of Eastern European Roma migration to this area and bringing into question the limitations of an ethnic approach to Roma migration. The focus is on analysing the contradictions and ambiguities in what could easily (yet problematically) be understood as 'intra-ethnic' relations.

T1  - Experiences of Racism, Racial/Ethnic Attitudes, Motivated Fairness and Mental Health Outcomes Among Primary and Secondary School Students
AN  - 1680154953; 201515919
AB  - While studies investigating the health effects of racial discrimination for children and youth have examined a range of effect modifiers, to date, relationships between experiences of racial discrimination, student attitudes, and health outcomes remain unexplored. This study uniquely demonstrates the moderating effects of vicarious racism and motivated fairness on the association between direct experiences of racism and mental health outcomes, specifically depressive symptoms and loneliness, among primary and secondary school students. Across seven schools, 263 students (54.4 % female), ranging from 8 to 17 years old (M = 11.2, SD = 2.2) reported attitudes about other racial/ethnic groups and experiences of racism. Students from minority ethnic groups (determined by country of birth) reported higher levels of loneliness and more racist experiences relative to the majority group students. Students from the majority racial/ethnic group reported higher levels of loneliness and depressive symptoms if they had more friends from different racial/ethnic groups, whereas the number of friends from different groups had no effect on minority students' loneliness or depressive symptoms. Direct experiences of racism were robustly related to higher loneliness and depressive symptoms in multivariate regression models. However, the association with depressive symptoms was reduced to marginal significance when students reported low motivated fairness. Elaborating on the negative health effects of racism in primary and secondary school students provides an impetus for future research and the development of appropriate interventions.

T1  - Marital Assimilation between the Muslim Hui and the Han Majority in Contemporary Chinese Cities in the People's Republic of China
AN  - 1558809894
AB  - This study discusses the marital assimilation of the ethnic Hui, the biggest Muslim minority group in China, with the Han majority in contemporary Chinese cities, using the 1% sample data of the 1990 Chinese Census. Unlike previous research which focus on demographical, social, and cultural characteristics of ethnic minority individuals on their marital choices, this study provides a community-level analysis scrutinizing local marriage market conditions on ethnic intermarriage rate in different geographical locations. Evidently, the Hui-Han intermarriage rate in different city units varies greatly, as high as over 80% while as low as less than 30%. Furthermore, the great variation in Hui-Han intermarriage rate has been found to be highly related to three aspects of local ethnically related structures, which are ethnic demographic compositions, ethnic stratification, and interethnic contact structure.

T1  - Shifting From Structural to Individual Attributions of Black Disadvantage: Age, Period, and Cohort Effects on Black Explanations of Racial Disparities
AN  - 1700676598; 201525311
AB  - Despite significant changes in American society, Blacks still lag behind Whites on several important socioeconomic indicators. Attributing this gap to structural reasons (e.g., racial discrimination) or to person-centered reasons (e.g., individual willpower) is highly correlated with the extent to which individuals feel that the government should implement policies to ameliorate racial disparities. Scholars have shown that Blacks have shifted their explanations of Black disadvantage from structural attributions to person-centered over the past three decades. Some suggest that this change is because all Blacks are becoming more conservative while others suggest that cohort replacement is undergirding the shift. I used a newly developed method, the intrinsic estimator, to determine whether period, age, and/or cohort effects are responsible for the shift. I find that, generally, Blacks are less inclined to suggest that discrimination is a credible explanation due to period effects, but the increase in person-centered attributions is primarily due to cohort variation.

T1  - The theme of indivisibility in the post-war struggle against prejudice in the United States
AN  - 1660024003; 201505829
AB  - Whitfield's essay seeks to identify and explain a tendency that emerged in the United States in the 1940s and extended through the 1950s. It was then that a notion became commonplace, especially among liberals, that the victims of prejudice were interchangeable and that bigotry was undifferentiated. Before the 1940s, the problem of prejudice was not widely believed to be urgent; but the war against the Third Reich heightened awareness of the price of an irrational hostility to minorities. American liberals in particular came to the understanding that bigotry was indivisible; and, for its objects, the cards of identity could easily be shuffled. Whether the victims were Jews or Negroes or homosexuals, the hatred that they elicited appeared to be formed without making any distinctions among them. Evidence can be found in the culture of those two decades, in novels, plays and films. The unitary view of the character of prejudice had some support in social science, including in the authoritative volume The Authoritarian Personality. The theory would also be reflected in a major shift in the agenda of Jewish civil rights organizations, which redefined their mission as promoting the democratic rights of all minorities rather than the particular interests of American Jews. This distinctive tendency vanished in the 1960s, however. One reason for the change was a fuller appreciation of the hostility that minorities could harbour towards other minorities. The realization also deepened of the singular vulnerability of black Americans under the pressure of racism, which demonstrated a tenacity as well as a proclivity for violence that had been largely absent from other forms of bigotry. Finally, a broader legitimation of difference itself emerged in the 1960s to bury the notion that minorities were fungible. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - How 'It Gets Better': Effectively Communicating Support to Targets of Prejudice
AN  - 1531933293; 201423354
AB  - What is said when communicating intergroup support to targets of prejudice, and how do targets react? We hypothesized that people not targeted by prejudice reference social connection (e.g., social support) more than social change (e.g., calling for a reduction in prejudice) in their supportive messages. However, we hypothesized that targets of prejudice would be more comforted by social change messages. We content coded naturalistic messages of support for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and questioning teenagers from youtube.com (Study 1) and college undergraduates' statements (Study 2a) and found social connection messages more frequent than social change messages. Next, we explored targets' responses (Studies 2b-4b). Lesbian and gay participants rated social connection messages less comforting than social change messages (Study 3). Study 4 showed that only targets of prejudice distinguish social connection from social change messages in this way, versus non-targets. These results highlight the importance of studying the communication, content, and consequences of positive intergroup attitudes.

T1  - Lost in commemoration: the Armenian genocide in memory and identity
AN  - 1559007142; 201432031
AB  - It is a commonplace in Genocide Studies to say that 'Turkey denies the Armenian genocide'. The Turkish state's official policy towards the Armenian genocide was and is indeed characterized by misrepresentation, mystification and manipulation. But when one gauges what place the Armenian genocide occupies in the social memory of Turkish society, even after nearly a century, a different picture emerges. Even though most direct eyewitnesses to the crime have passed away, oral history interviews yield important insights. Elderly Turks and Kurds in Eastern Turkey often hold vivid memories from family members or fellow villagers who witnessed or participated in the genocide. This article is based on interviews conducted with (grand)children of eyewitnesses to the Armenian genocide. The research suggests there is a clash between official state memory and popular social memory: the Turkish government is denying a genocide that its own population remembers.

T1  - A pilgrim's progress: Armenian and Kurdish literatures in Turkish and the rewriting of literary history
AN  - 1559005623; 201431992
AB  - John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress is a narrative that has been translated into Turkish several times. Strangely, histories of Turkish literature and of literary translations into Turkish rarely make any reference to it. The fact that the early translations were in Armeno-Turkish and that they were promoted by Protestant missionary organizations might explain why they were ignored in the historiography of a field in which the contributions of non-Muslims are hardly acknowledged. In recent years, however, Armeno-Turkish literature has become a new area of study in Turkey. Young scholars, mostly in Turkey's leading private universities, have started to explore Armeno-Turkish literature and the exchanges between western Armenian and Turkish literatures in the Ottoman Empire, and have challenged the nationalist discourse underpinning traditional Turkish literary historiography. Mignon's paper gives an overview of Armeno-Turkish literary studies from the rare early republican scholarly publications on the topic to the latest postgraduate research projects on the Armeno-Turkish novel and on nineteenth-century Turkish and western Armenian dramatic traditions. His paper also discusses recent debates on Kurdish poets writing in Turkish and 'literature in Turkish', in contra-distinction to Turkish literature, which have opened new spaces of freedom that should facilitate an integration of Armeno-Turkish literature into mainstream Turkish literary history. Beyond academic debates on the challenges to cultural historiography and literary theory, the rediscovery of Armeno-Turkish literature and the acknowledgment of Armenian contributions to Turkish literature represent a major opportunity in the Turkish context to reassess the place of non-Muslim ethnoreligious communities in late Ottoman political and cultural history.

T1  - Do Adolescents' Evaluations of Exclusion Differ Based on Gender Expression and Sexual Orientation?
AN  - 1543801940
AB  - Previous research focused on sexual prejudice has shown that lesbian and gay adolescents are at greater risk of peer harassment and victimization than their straight counterparts. Peer victimization such as exclusion, however, may also be related to conventional expectations adolescents hold about their social environment. This study examined adolescents' (N = 1069) attitudes and reasoning about the exclusion of peers based on sexual orientation and gender nonconformity. Results indicate that although participants reported it was more acceptable to exclude their gay or lesbian, as opposed to straight, peers, gender nonconformity was also a distinguishing factor. Whereas mannerism and activity nonconforming gay targets were rated less positively than similarly nonconforming straight targets, straight appearance nonconforming targets were not evaluated differently than gay appearance nonconforming targets. Further, the types of reasoning adolescents used to justify their exclusion judgments varied by sexual orientation and gender nonconformity of the target.              [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Warmth of the Welcome: Attitudes Toward Immigrants and Immigration Policy in the United States
AN  - 1622296280; 201438381
AB  - Natives' attitudes toward immigrants and immigration policy are important factors in the context of reception of immigrants because they contribute to a warm or chilly welcome, which potentially shapes immigrant and ethnic identities and intergroup relations. Public opinion polls show a recent 'warming' of Americans' traditional ambivalence about immigration. Empirical research on attitudes toward immigrants and racial groups formed by recent waves of immigrants resonates with the dynamic nature of Blumer's (1958) theory of prejudice as a sense of relative group position. To better understand this dynamism, research that intentionally contrasts study sites on conflict and contact conditions and the presence or absence of symbolic politics, as well as research on different native-born racial and ethnic groups, would reveal a broader range of natives' attitude formation processes and the role they play in immigrant reception.

T1  - Normalization of antisemitism, 1880-1900: the case of a Jesuit community in Rome
AN  - 1520331074; 201413236
AB  - The significance of the political antisemitism of the 1880s and 1890s for developments in the twentieth century remains controversial. Researchers have been divided as to whether the antisemitism of the nineteenth century, or even earlier, was one of the factors that made the Holocaust possible, or whether it was a phenomenon with little or no relevance for subsequent events. The decline of most antisemitic political parties at the beginning of the twentieth century appears to support the latter point of view. Yet some commentators, such as Shulamit Volkov and Peter Pulzer, have convincingly suggested that the importance of nineteenth-century antisemitism lies less in the political fortunes of antisemitic parties than in the way antisemitism came to penetrate civil society. Thus, they have argued, antisemitism came to form a component of a widespread conservative and anti-liberal world-view. Following Pulzer and Volkov, it might be desirable to investigate the processes by which antisemitism could have been transformed from an extremist political position into a common element in the outlook of broad portions of European society: mechanisms that have remained largely unexplored. Dahl's article studies the normalization of antisemitism in the two last decades of the nineteenth century through a scrutiny of shifts in the attitudes to Jews of a restricted group of Italian Jesuits. The analysis is based on a detailed study of La Civilta Cattolica, a Jesuit community in Rome that published a journal of the same name. Since its foundation in 1850 this institution has been an authoritative exponent of Catholic policy and is generally perceived as having been a protagonist in the formulation of a Catholic stance towards the 'Jewish question' in the later nineteenth century. Dahl shows that, while in the early 1880s, most members resisted or opposed the use of antisemitic propaganda, through the following two decades the attitudes of virtually all of them became tinged with antisemitism, supporting the hypothesis that antisemitism became part of a widespread 'culture'. In his analysis, Dahl does not focus on the wider circulation of ideas that influenced the Roman Jesuits, but on the dynamics within the institution that made possible the gradual acceptance of antisemitism, arguing that a debate over antisemitism among the Jesuits in the early 1880s was a crucial moment in this development. As they failed at this early stage to formulate an anti-antisemitic response, they allowed antisemitism to become part of the culture of their institution, and rendered its later rejection practically impossible.

T1  - The ironic impact of activists: Negative stereotypes reduce social change influence
AN  - 1512219686; 201408618
AB  - Despite recognizing the need for social change in areas such as social equality and environmental protection, individuals often avoid supporting such change. Researchers have previously attempted to understand this resistance to social change by examining individuals' perceptions of social issues and social change. We instead examined the possibility that individuals resist social change because they have negative stereotypes of activists, the agents of social change. Participants had negative stereotypes of activists (feminists and environmentalists), regardless of the domain of activism, viewing them as eccentric and militant. Furthermore, these stereotypes reduced participants' willingness to affiliate with 'typical' activists and, ultimately, to adopt the behaviours that these activists promoted. These results indicate that stereotypes and person perception processes more generally play a key role in creating resistance to social change. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Favorable Contact During Volunteer Service: Reducing Prejudice Toward Mexicans in the American Southwest
AN  - 1443861161
AB  - We assessed religious volunteers' intergroup contact, realistic threat perceptions, symbolic threat perceptions, intergroup anxiety, negative stereotypes and prejudice toward Mexicans before and approximately 4-6 months into their volunteer service. Whether assigned to serve Mexicans or European-Americans, all volunteers experienced reduced prejudice toward Mexicans. A multiple mediator model suggests that changes in prejudice resulted from a mediated relationship between quality contact and prejudice. Specifically, intergroup anxiety and negative stereotypes mediated the relationship. The benefits of volunteerism as a means of fostering favorable intergroup contact and reducing threat perceptions and prejudice are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Reading Narrative Fiction Reduces Arab-Muslim Prejudice And Offers A Safe Haven From Intergroup Anxiety
AN  - 1463007880; 201345810
AB  - Inquiry into the written narrative's effect on social cognition is normally left to literary scholars and philosophers. Two experiments demonstrated narrative fiction's power to elicit empathy and reduce implicit and explicit prejudice against Arab-Muslims. Participants were randomly assigned to read a full narrative, condensed narrative, or a non-narrative. Critically, the full and condensed narratives were matched on counterstereotypical exemplars and exposure to Arab-Muslim culture so that the additional reduction in prejudice in the full narrative condition represented the unique power of the narrative. The narrative was particularly effective at reducing implicit prejudice in low dispositional perspective-takers. Partially explaining this effect, the narrative appeared to provide a safe haven from intergroup anxiety so that they could use perspective-taking to reduce prejudice. These findings demonstrate the narrative's power to induce spontaneous empathy and perspective-taking and consequently reduce implicit and explicit prejudice. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The soundtrack of neo-fascism: youth and music in the National Front
AN  - 1494748634; 201402145
AB  - Shaffer examines youth involvement in the National Front and the development of neo-fascist music as a conduit for its ideas. Using rare publications and interviews with National Front members, he argues that youth had a profound impact on post-war British fascism by influencing fascist ideology and tactics. Following challenges from the Anti-Nazi League and Rock Against Racism, the National Front started its own youth outreach programmes that reshaped neo-fascism and how neo-fascists distributed their message. In adopting skinhead style and music, the organization spread 'nativist' culture not only to gain supporters, but to counter multiculturalism in popular music and politics. Shaffer's article explains how neo-fascist youth created their own publications, clubs, concerts and even a record company to provide entertainment, spread ideas, raise money, recruit and build associations with like-minded neo-fascists in other countries. With these new tactics, the young National Front members redefined British fascism, which had lasting impact on radical groups in Europe and North America. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cohesion without participation: immigration and migrants' associations in Italy
AN  - 1448995994; 201342879
AB  - Italian migration and citizenship policies tend to deny the fact that immigration in Italy is now a structural phenomenon embedded in the labour market and Italian society. The first part of Mantovan's article examines this denial in terms of the apparent difficulty many in Italian society have in accepting the social changes caused by Italy's rapid transition from a country of emigration to one of immigration. She argues that this reluctance to accept the fact of immigration is exacerbated by Italy's fragile national social cohesion, which has led to policy attempts to buttress social cohesion with respect to immigrants' relationship to Italian society. The Italian version of social cohesion is based on an 'implicit model' of immigrant integration and a citizenship regime defined by jus sanguinis. The second part of her paper evaluates Italian social cohesion as to how it manages the social changes caused by immigration, and looks at the evolution and characteristics of immigrants' participation in migrant associations. The principal measure adopted, that is, to include selected, co-opted migrant representatives from immigrant groups in consultative and advisory bodies, remained too dependent on the Italian authorities and voluntary organizations. These political migrants' associations ultimately failed, and led immigrants to withdraw and form their own cultural associations that better met their needs. Accordingly, the measures taken to promote migrants' participation through immigrants' associations functioned more as a mechanism to reduce ethnic complexity and the Otherness represented by migrants rather than as a viable, long-term means of facilitating their access to Italian citizenship. Overall, Italian policies have weakened social cohesion by reproducing and reinforcing structural inequalities among immigrants. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The social geography of ethnic minorities in metropolitan Paris: a challenge to the French model of social cohesion?
AN  - 1448992881; 201342789
AB  - In order to address the specific social challenges of immigrants and ethnic minorities in the poorest urban neighbourhoods in Paris, new policies of social cohesion have been implemented over the past three decades that focus on place of residence rather than on ethnicity or national origin. The design of a social cohesion policy that deals with socio-geographic inequality rather than with ethnicized populations as such has been a subtle way of addressing the ethnic issue without directly calling into question the postulate of republican universalism. From this perspective, Audebert attempts to understand the role of place and social geography in the formalization of collective identities that have emerged in response to decades of public policies that have been unable to respond to the social, economic and political demands of ethnic minorities. He also attempts to analyse how the French state has relied on social geography as a way to address racial and ethnic issues without directly endowing them with an institutionalized dimension. His hypothesis is that the issue of social cohesion in contemporary France and the way it is dealt with by republican institutions is above all a matter of social geography. The French approach that gives prominence to the urban territorialization of social inequalities over the ethnic categorization approach remains firmly based on republican ideals. Nonetheless, such a policy is innovative in the French context, as it differs from the French traditional assimilationist model and takes into account social and cultural diversity in large metropolitan areas. Audebert's article provides a better understanding of the influence of this integration model on the construction of Otherness. It puts into relief the role of urban geography in the emergence of ethnicity and the design of innovative policy that addresses the issue of cultural diversity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Do All Associations Lead to Lower Levels of Ethnocentrism? A Two-Year Longitudinal Test of the Selection and Adaptation Model
AN  - 1429641905; 201335740
AB  - Within the literature on the relation between membership in voluntary associations and tolerance, three theoretical perspectives can be distinguished. The socialization perspective assumes that the interaction within association leads to higher levels of tolerance; the self-selection perspective suggests that tolerant actors are more likely to join associations; while the selection and adaption model predicts that the group culture within an association will have a specific effect on members' attitudes. We use a two-year panel study among Belgian adolescents to ascertain the empirical merits of these three approaches. Results show that not all associations have an effect on the reduction of prejudice, but that this effect is limited to specific associations. A structural equation model furthermore suggests that socialization effects are significantly stronger than self-selection effects. As such, this analysis of panel data lends support to the selection and adaptation model. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - PERCEPTIONS OF RACE AND REGION IN THE BLACK REVERSE MIGRATION TO THE SOUTH
AN  - 1429641700; 201335815
AB  - This study examines how African Americans perceive and manage race and region as they migrate to the U.S. South-a region with a tenuous image of racial prejudice. The analysis is juxtaposed to literature that provides an inconsistent view of regional differences in prejudice. Some researchers argue that regional differences in levels of prejudice are now small, while other researchers argue that the South continues to be a place of much greater racial hostility. Guided by a spatial boundaries approach and using 127 narrative interviews with Black interregional migrants to Charlotte, North Carolina, results indicate that Black migrants focus less on levels of racial prejudice across regions and focus more on six dimensions of everyday racism they consider during migration. These dimensions include-the overtness/subtlety of prejudice, verbal and physical harassment, group economic opportunity, physical distance, racial symbols, and paternalism. Among these migrants, there is no consensus that the South is more or less racially hostile than other regions. They perceive most saliently that they are trading more subtle prejudice, higher levels of racial residential segregation, and greater constraints on Black economic opportunity in the North, for more overt prejudice, greater paternalism, and exposure to Confederate symbols in the South. Patterns also emerged in perceptions of regional boundaries based on class, motivation for moving, gender, and generation. Implications for theories of race and regionalism are discussed.

T1  - 'A veritable Janus at the gates of Jewry': British Jews and Mr Arnold White
AN  - 1322723527; 201310775
AB  - Historians of British antisemitism consider Arnold White (publicist, author, journalist, campaigner) a key exponent of racially orientated anti-Jewish sentiment in the United Kingdom in the period before the First World War. These attitudes were repeatedly demonstrated by his vehement opposition to East European Jewish immigration and underscored by a large literary output on the topic. In the late 1880s, White frequently clashed with leading Anglo-Jewish figures on immigration yet, in general terms, there was often difficulty in assigning him definitively to the antisemitic camp. This was the result of his work for Baron Maurice de Hirsch and the Jewish Colonization Association, which led to a more flattering interpretation of White's contribution to solving the so-called 'Jewish question'. Indeed, at times, he was actually regarded as a 'friend of the Jews'. Johnson's study examines the problems Anglo-Jewish society had in analysing and negotiating the White world-view. For instance, an appreciation in the Jewish Chronicle described him as a 'veritable Janus at the gates of Jewry', essentially a two-faced troublemaker whose true attitude was not easy to determine. For almost three decades, the question of whether White was friend or foe was asked by various individuals and publications. Ultimately, Johnson considers what White and his Anglo-Jewish encounters reveal about the nature of the Jewish-Gentile relationship and how antisemitic ideology was confronted in Britain in the period before the outbreak of the First World War.

T1  - Foreigners and Outsiders: Exclusionist Attitudes towards Labour Migrants in Israel
AN  - 1315601669; 201307677
AB  - This paper examines theoretical propositions regarding the social mechanisms that produce hostility and discriminatory attitudes towards out-group populations. Specifically, we compare the effect of perceptions of socio-economic and national threats, social contact and prejudice on social distance expressed towards labour migrants. To do so, we examine exclusionary views held by majority and minority groups (Jews and Arabs) towards non-Jewish labour migrants in Israel. Data analysis is based on a survey of the adult Israeli population based on a stratified sample of 1,342 respondents, conducted in Israel in 2007. Altogether, our results show that Israelis (both Jews and Arabs) are resistant to accepting and integrating foreigners into Israeli society. Among Jews, this is because the incorporation of non-Jews challenges the definition of Israel as a Jewish state and poses a threat to the homogeneity of the nation. Among Arabs, this is probably due to threat and competition over resources. The meanings of the findings are discussed within the unique ethno-national context of Israeli society and in light of sociological theories on ethnic exclusionism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Reframing craniometry: human exceptionalism and the production of racial knowledge
AN  - 1792349460
AB  - Focusing on the nineteenth century practice of craniometry, this paper considers how strategies of producing racial 'knowledge' played a key role in the development of ideas about the human. Supplementing the familiar claim that nineteenth century racial craniometry was designed to biologise longstanding aesthetic prejudices about variations in human physical appearance, the paper offers a more specific understanding of the role of this practice in biologising race. Taking up the post-Linnaean context in which a biological conception of race was elaborated, it considers how early nineteenth century debates about the unique and exceptional status of the human - classically identified with the soul or mind - centred upon the head. The practice of craniometry, it is suggested, can be understood in this context, as its centrality in the emergence of a biological conception of race is traced to an effort to demonstrate the material existence of the mind. The possibility proposed in this paper, therefore, is that particular physical differences between various peoples came to be regarded as racially significant in the nineteenth century attempt to determine the exceptional status of the human.

T1  - Race, ethnicity and religion: emerging policies in Britain
AN  - 1551002823; 201429003
AB  - Britain's integration model is recurrently held up as the epitome of the multiculturalist model in Europe. Moreover, it tends to be presented as though it was intrinsic to British society and had always existed. This is not the case. In reality the model has passed through successive phases of an ongoing evolution and was constructed through the interaction between British society and the ethnic minorities of immigrant origin who settled in Britain after the Second World War. After a brief period of assimilationism, a race relations paradigm was formulated, followed by the establishment of a multicultural policy. It is often assumed that multicultural policy is a simple continuation of a race relations approach under another name. But Joly argues that this is inaccurate and that each corresponds to distinct policy parameters and to different stages. Moreover, this was not the end of the line. The multiculturalist model has come under a barrage of criticism emanating from various sources and different viewpoints. Nevertheless, Joly maintains that it has not been eliminated but has metamorphosed into a Muslim paradigm. Her paper explores the different stages of integration policies directed at immigrants and how those were constructed. The paradigms were developed through the categorization of immigrants by the majority and the mobilization of immigrants as a result of their interaction with British society. The paper draws the contours of each of these stages, examines the fault lines and areas of tension, and explores the underpinnings of the evolution. It argues that policies were forged through and beyond discourses largely by the immigrants themselves. In the main it can be posited that the process started with action that began at local level at the initiative of the immigrants and subsequently progressed to the national level. This prompted responses and funding programmes from central government. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The distinctiveness of Canadian immigration experience
AN  - 1551002383; 201429088
AB  - Canada's experience with immigration has been comparatively positive and mass immigration has considerable popular support within the country. The distinctive Canadian policy model-including large numbers with skill-based selection, multiculturalism and other policies aimed at promoting integration, and provincial autonomy-deserves international attention. However, Canada's success with immigration is only partly related to its policies and these may not be easily transferable to other contexts. Skill-based immigrant selection may be the most important feature of the Canadian model contributing to its success, and the effectiveness of this policy is clearly contingent on border control, which in the case of Canada is facilitated by geographical isolation. Canada's symbolic commitment to multiculturalism emphasizes the social integration of immigrants and this goal is also served by significant social services supporting settlement and language acquisition. The most significant distinctive feature of the Canadian approach to immigration may be the belief that immigration represents a positive opportunity to build the economy and develop the country. This belief represents a resource helping the country address some of the current problems confronting immigration, including reduced employment success of immigrants and evidence that racial divisions have significance particularly for certain groups. The belief in mass immigration as a positive resource and development opportunity underlies much of the positive discourse on immigration in Canada. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Beyond prejudice: Relational inequality, collective action, and social change revisited
AN  - 1417523648; 201331883
AB  - This response clarifies, qualifies, and develops our critique of the limits of intergroup liking as a means of challenging intergroup inequality. It does not dispute that dominant groups may espouse negative attitudes towards subordinate groups. Nor does it dispute that prejudice reduction can be an effective way of tackling resulting forms of intergroup hostility. What it does dispute is the assumption that getting dominant group members and subordinate group members to like each other more is the best way of improving intergroup relations that are characterized by relatively stable, institutionally embedded, relations of inequality. In other words, the main target of our critique is the model of change that underlies prejudice reduction interventions and the mainstream concept of "prejudice" on which they are based.

T1  - Immigrant and Native Romani Women in Spain: Building Alliances and Developing Shared Strategies
AN  - 1347780976; 201318910
AB  - Romani women, both immigrant and native, face a greater risk of social exclusion because of the prejudices that mainstream society has about the Roma, and especially because they are women and some of them immigrants as well. This paper analyses how Romani immigrant and native women are building pan-ethnic identities, sharing alliances and developing common strategies in Spain. Previous studies on Romani women have tended to see them as passive and not active agents. Thus, very few have focused on the specific case of Romani immigrant women and on their modes of incorporation in their new contexts of reception. Drawing on data from two qualitative studies of Roma immigrant women and Gitanas in Spain, the authors demonstrate how everyday-life interactions and shared interests at informal and formal encounters lead to building solidarity alliances and sharing transnational narratives, thus overcoming subgroup ethnic boundaries and stereotypes. The analysis is carried out from the 'other women' approach, taking into account the voices of all types of Romani women, illiterate and literate, in the whole research process.

T1  - Reconstruing Intolerance: Abstract Thinking Reduces Conservatives' Prejudice Against Nonnormative Groups
AN  - 1322720645; 201310793
AB  - Myrdal (1944) described the "American dilemma" as the conflict between abstract national values ("liberty and justice for all") and more concrete, everyday prejudices. We leveraged construal-level theory to empirically test Myrdal's proposition that construal level (abstract vs. concrete) can influence prejudice. We measured individual differences in construal level (Study I) and manipulated construal level (Studies 2 and 3); across these three studies, we found that adopting an abstract mind-set heightened conservatives' tolerance for groups that are perceived as deviating from judeo-Christian values (gay men, lesbians, Muslims, and atheists). Among participants who adopted a concrete mind-set, conservatives were less tolerant of these nonnormative groups than liberals were, but political orientation did not have a reliable effect on tolerance among participants who adopted an abstract mind-set. Attitudes toward racial out-groups and dominant groups (e.g., Whites, Christians) were unaffected by construal level. In Study 3, we found that the effect of abstract thinking on prejudice was mediated by an increase in concerns about fairness. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Honeymoon Vacation: Sexual-Orientation Prejudice and Inconsistent Behavioral Responses
AN  - 1650147852; 201502206
AB  - Majority group members often hold inconsistent attitudes and behave inconsistently toward minority group members (LaPiere, 1934). We conceptually replicated LaPiere (1934) to examine discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in two studies. As predicted, randomly selected bed-and-breakfasts were more likely to discriminate against gay male individuals when impersonally contacted (Study 1) than when personally contacted (Study 2), suggesting an attitude-behavior discrepancy. We reason that establishments were more likely to discriminate when they did not have the motivation to appear nonprejudicial, and we discuss the results in terms of the MODE model of attitude-behavioral processes.

T1  - African and Black Caribbean origin cancer survivors: a qualitative study of the narratives of causes, coping and care experiences
AN  - 1520336209; 201419621
AB  - Objectives. Although there is evidence in the USA and UK to suggest that ethnic minority groups have an inferior experience of cancer care, few studies investigate ethnic disparities in satisfaction and care experiences among survivors. Patients' illness perceptions (lay explanations for illness) and coping styles (emotional and behavioural) are influenced by ethnicity-related cultural beliefs and expectations. Depressive illness or fears of recurrence of cancer may also lead to poorer recovery and function. This paper investigates whether ethnic influences explain different coping behaviours, care experiences and help-seeking behaviours. Design. Eight participants of African or Black Caribbean origin were recruited from a London support group for a series of qualitative in-depth interviews. The interviews were recorded and transcribed, and the transcripts analysed using a framework method of qualitative data analysis. The emergent themes were tested and documented to reflect the issues of importance to patients. Results. Lay explanations of causes of cancer were complex and diverse reflecting cultural influences and the impact of contact with health professionals. Generally, positive views about cancer care were found, especially at the secondary care level. Primary care attracted mixed views. In contrast to American studies, no acknowledgement of discrimination on the basis of ethnicity was reported. The need to be resilient and think positively were widely acknowledged as coping strategies. Some coped by avoiding contemplation of their condition or diagnosis. Religious beliefs and practices provided coping mechanisms for some, and a means to improve confidence and avoid distressing contemplation about their condition. Family, friends and charitable groups also provided emotional and practical support. Conclusions. Subjects were generally satisfied with their care; different coping styles included positive attitudes, minimisation of difficulties or more realistic consideration of the impact of cancer.

T1  - Reflective Paper: GL Versus BT: The Archaeology of Biphobia and Transphobia Within the U.S. Gay and Lesbian Community
AN  - 1125224561; 201240529
AB  - Heterosexism against bisexuals and transgenders exists not only in the straight community but in the gay and lesbian community as well. Are 'biphobia' and 'transphobia' examples of 'phobias'-irrational fears? No, such heterosexist attitudes are all too rational, mirroring social tensions, which only appear to be an ahistorical psychological phenomenon. Rather, as the gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender (GLBT) community developed, power relations arose which resulted in the four different groups (G/L/B/T), assigning them different social locations. Prejudice in gay and lesbian communities against bisexuals and transgenders is heterosexism because it is, among other things, an accommodationist attempt to discover these more 'radical' forms of sexuality.

T1  - Revitalizing and de-territorializing fascism in the 1950s: the extreme right in France and Italy, and the pan-national ("European") imaginary
AN  - 964197845; 201207456
AB  - In this article Mammone explores a still relatively neglected story in the history of post-war neo-fascism, notably the attempts by some French and Italian right-wing extremists to revitalize fascist ideology after the war by means of two interconnected strategies, namely, radicalization (rejection of the democratic system) and "de-territorialization" (in the sense of converting narrow fascist nationalism into pan-European nationalism). Mammone describes these project(s), as well as the influence of thinkers such as Julius Evola and Maurice Bardeche, and their location in the wider ideological context of the extreme right in the 1950s. The immediate outcome of this "de-territorialized fascism" was the creation of an extreme-right international association, the Mouvement Social Europeen, in which French and Italian activists played a central role. Mammone breaks new ground regarding the non-national dimension of extreme-right thought, a topic too often studied within the boundaries of a given geographical territory and nationalist ideological landscape. By utilizing a transnational framework, he also shows the continuous connections and interactions between the Italian and the French extreme rights. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Categorization and Communication in the Face of Prejudice: When Describing Perceptions Changes What Is Perceived
AN  - 925714254; 201204087
AB  - In the face of prejudice against an ingroup, common ground for communication exists when people use similar social categories to understand the situation. Three studies tested the hypothesis that describing perceptions of prejudice can fundamentally change those perceptions because communicators account for the common ground in line with conversational norms. When women (Study 1), African Americans (Study 2), and Americans (Study 3) simply thought about suspected prejudice against their ingroup, categorization guided their perceptions: Participants assimilated their views of the prejudiced event toward the perceptions of ingroup members but contrasted away from the perceptions of outgroup members. Conversely, when participants described their perceptions, they contrasted away from the given category information and actually arrived at the opposite perceptions as those who merely thought about the prejudiced event. Study 3 identified an important qualification of these effects by showing that they were obtained only when participants could assume their audience was familiar with the common ground. Implications are discussed for understanding the role of communication in facilitating and inhibiting collective action about prejudice. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Making Women's Suffrage Support an Ethnic Duty: Norwegian American Identity Constructions and the Women's Suffrage Movement, 1880-1925
AN  - 907928737; 201124757
AB  - Between 1901 and 1913, Norwegian women won a series of legislative victories, including the universal right to vote. To Norwegian Americans, these events held special meaning. They represented verifiable and contemporary proof of what Norwegian Americans had been arguing for some time: namely, that their homeland was a bastion of progress and democracy and that they had carried this particular legacy to the New World. Many argued that as Norwegian Americans, they were committed to modern, forward-looking ideas and democratic principles, thereby making them model citizens in their adopted home. Women's suffrage advocates also used this particular rhetorical emphasis to substantiate their claims that Norwegian Americans had a duty to support women's suffrage based on their cultural connection to progress and equality. A rich literature has documented how immigrants and their offspring encountered racial and ethnic hierarchies in the United States that influenced their own efforts at constructing an American ethnicity. Some European ethnic groups, including the Irish and the Italians, struggled to achieve a status of "whiteness" in the United States. Others, such as immigrants from the Nordic countries, encountered less racial prejudice, but as an ethnic group they were -- as all others -- keen to establish an identity that supported and justified their claims to inclusion. An investigation into the particular case of Norwegian Americans living in Minnesota and North Dakota reveals an intriguing relationship between Norwegian American cultural arguments that asserted a common ethnic past and women's suffrage debates. This article seeks to understand how Norwegian immigrant claims to American inclusion became a foundation upon which ethnic suffragists were able to build a strategic argument in their call for women's suffrage supporters. Suffragists translated an established rhetoric of Norwegian American progressiveness into assertions that Norwegians were culturally obligated to support women's political equality in the United States.

T1  - Exploring citizenship spheres of inclusion/exclusion: rights as 'potential for power'
AN  - 907925917; 201124621
AB  - Ariely examines the logic of inclusion/exclusion involved in the allocation of social, political and cultural rights to minorities. He argues that the unequal allocation of rights is determined by the degree of potential power inherent in the various types of rights, and that rights with more potential power, such as political and cultural representation rights, challenge the dominant group's position more strongly than rights to social welfare and cultural autonomy. Minorities are included at a higher level in spheres of rights with low potential power, and at a lower level in spheres of rights with higher potential power. He uses the case of the Arab citizens of Israel to illustrate the thesis, reviewing institutional practices of inclusion/exclusion as well as the attitudes of Israeli Jews towards the allocation of different rights as reflected in three attitudinal surveys.

T1  - Severe maternal morbidity among immigrant women in the Netherlands: patients' perspectives
AN  - 1492600124; 201401107
AB  - This 2006 study investigated ethnicity-related factors contributing to sub-standard maternity care and the effects on severe maternal morbidity among immigrant women in the Netherlands. In-depth interviews were carried out with 40 immigrant and 10 native Dutch women. The immigrant women reported that health care providers often paid insufficient attention to their pregnancy-related complaints, especially in cases of pre-eclampsia. They also reported delays in receiving information about diagnosis and treatment. Obstetricians who reviewed 20 of these cases judged sub-standard care to have played a role in the development of complications in 16 of them. The women themselves had problems identifying medically significant complications, presenting their complaints to health care providers effectively, and taking an active role as patients. Even highly educated migrant women showed low health literacy skills in their interaction with doctors. Patients' perspectives are valuable as one of the tools to evaluate the quality of maternity care. Communication by maternal health professionals can be improved through more sensitivity to social factors that affect immigrant women's health problems. Women with limited health literacy should be empowered through education about danger signs in pregnancy and information about preferences and policies in obstetrics in the Netherlands. They should also be invited to participate in medical decision-making. [Copyright Reproductive Health Matters; published by Elsevier B.V.]

T1  - Ethnographic investigations of issues of race in Scandinavian education research
AN  - 914766493; 201200740
AB  - In this article we aim to present an overview of some of the ways in which issues of race and ethnicity are represented and researched in educational ethnography in Scandinavia. Several things are suggested. Amongst them is that educational ethnographers in Scandinavia rarely use the concept of race. The term (im)migrant(s) is used instead and the relationships in education between Scandinavians and (im)migrants and between educational results and (im)migrant culture and/or languages are often in focus. Integration has also been an issue. History may give an indication as to how this may have become so. Research on immigrants, immigration and integration has been promoted in national policies and these policies highlight language, culture and diversity but for historical and political reasons they often avoid ethnicity and ignore race and colour altogether. Moreover, when ethnicity is used it seems to be used more as an ontological marker than as an epistemological concept. This has repercussions we suggest for understanding the politics of race and ethnicity relations in relation to education. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Don't Ask Me Where I'm From: Thoughts of Immigrants to Catalonia on Social Integration and Cultural Capital
AN  - 862596057; 201109728
AB  - 'Once you get here, you realize that thinking Foucault was writing for you was terribly naive, since in reality I did not exist as a subject for anyone like Foucault, or if I did it was only as an object of study', recalls one of the protagonists in this essay, a collage of fragments of interviews with foreign immigrants from impoverished countries who have settled in Barcelona and other Catalan towns in recent years. Widespread prejudice in the host society dictates that these people are generalized as being on a lower cultural level, anonymous members of the growing mass of immigrants prepared to work at any price. The prejudice seems to be confirmed by the fact that the great majority of them do low-skilled or unskilled work in sectors such as the building trade, hotels and restaurants and domestic service. The reality, however, is very different. The average level of formal education of these immigrants is similar to that of the host population. It is the precariousness of their legal status or the often insurmountable barriers preventing recognition of their academic and/or professional qualifications, or simply cultural prejudice, that condemn them to accept jobs well below their personal potential. Thus, the host society wastes social and cultural capital of the first order, and lays foundations for a permanent division between 'us' and 'them'. This essay offers a modest but revealing sample of the quality and diversity of the ideas and viewpoints of the immigrants themselves, an asset we continue to at best underestimate or more often ignore altogether.

T1  - Prologue: the riddle of race
AN  - 902082820; 201122214
AB  - Bernard explores the myth of racelessness as it is currently circulating in American social discourse. The election of the first black American president has unleashed the term across the cultural landscape, from the mainstream media to the classrooms in which she teaches African American literature. Students use the term as a twenty-first-century incarnation of the civil rights-era concept of colour blindness. But racelessness does not represent an aspiration for equality as much as it represents an ambition to turn away from the realities of difference. It is code for a common ambition to avoid the realities of institutional racial inequalities, as well as personal experiences of cultural difference. The myth of racelessness intersects uncomfortably with current academic discourse that promotes the view of race as a social construction. Scientifically proven and irrefutably true, this discourse does not allow any room for the social experience of race and racial difference as it is lived by everyone every day, whether we like it or not. The election of President Barack Obama is a portal on to this current confusion about the concept of race, specifically, and blackness, in particular. Many pundits have speculated that Obama would not have been electable if he had had dark skin, if he were irrefutably black, in colour and culture. The fact that he himself has elected to call himself 'black' serves as the platform of Bernard's essay on the case of race in the United States. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The composition of the minority population as a threat: Can real economic and cultural threats explain xenophobia
AN  - 1018362276; 201212859
AB  - This article sets out to develop a classical theme of empirical research within group threat theory, namely the argument that the size of the minority population threatens the majority population. To be able to clarify the mixed empirical results within this version of group threat theory, the article focuses on the composition of the immigrant population. The article tests both objective sources of cultural threats (linguistic composition and the Muslim population) and economic threats (the proportion of working-class individuals and the unemployed among the immigrant population). The study concludes that, first, the composition of the immigrant population is of utter importance for the size argument to be valid for cultural threats (proportion of Muslim population), whereas for economic threats it does not matter. Second, compositional economic threats matter strongly to the group that genuinely competes for scarce resources -- the working class is more xenophobic when the immigrant working class is large. Third, the study brings some clarity with regard to the cultural composition of the immigrant population: it is shown that the relationship between Muslims and European majority populations mirrors the relationship between whites and African-Americans in the US.

T1  - Constructing identities of "difference" and "resistance": the politics of being Muslim and British
AN  - 835111695; 201100553
AB  - A number of existing academic researches exploring experiences and attitudes amongst the UK's Muslim population have highlighted the varied forms of discrimination encountered as a "fact of life" of minorities in contemporary Britain. The combination of prejudice, discrimination and exclusion appears to have heightened emphatic self-definitions of religious identity, often ruling out any proximity to being British. An "identity of difference" through asserted religio-cultural distinctiveness is usually interpreted as a response to compound racism; the combined effects of colour and cultural racism. Further, whilst colour racism is generally declining, there is an empirical reality of pervading anti-Asian cultural attitudes resulting in an increasing "identity of unbelongingness". The assertion of "Muslimness" in opposition to a discriminatory hegemonic British identity provides a universal "belongingness" which further undermines the national identity. This paper will explore the construction of identities of difference and resistance amongst British Yemeni Muslims based on findings from research recently undertaken.

She uses data sets from ten surveys of Romanian Roma between 2000 and 2008 as well as the 2002 Romanian Census to compare two types of samples, and to explore the consequences of several research choices for the quality of the data. In addition to specific methodological issues, Rughinis addresses the relevance to such surveys of qualitative research in Romani communities. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'What did You Say, and Who do You Think You Are?' How Power Differences Affect Emotional Reactions to Prejudice
AN  - 758124347; 201056866
AB  - Three studies examine how power differences between targets and sources of prejudice affect targets' emotional reactions to prejudice. Study 1 first demonstrates that people do not expect powerful others to be prejudiced. Studies 2 and 3 then examine what happens when targets encounter prejudice, as a function of the source's power. Targets notice and recall prejudiced statements from powerful sources, irrespective of whether they are personally dependent on the source. However, results also demonstrate that personal dependency on the source determines how much targets attend to and are emotionally affected by prejudice. Emotional reactions to prejudice as a function of source power were mediated by negative expectations about future interactions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Heterosexual Men's Anger in Response to Male Homosexuality: Effects of Erotic and Non-Erotic Depictions of Male-Male Intimacy and Sexual Prejudice
AN  - 758121435; 201056968
AB  - The present study compared effects of erotic and non-erotic depictions of male-male intimacy on the experience of anger in heterosexual men. Data came from three independent laboratory studies designed to elicit anger in response to erotic or non-erotic depictions of male-male and male-female intimacy. All participants completed a measure of sexual prejudice and anger was assessed before and after viewing the erotic or non-erotic video. Among high-prejudiced men, viewing erotic and non-erotic intimate behavior between two men elicited significant increases in anger relative to viewing comparable behavior between a male-female dyad. In contrast, among low-prejudiced men, viewing erotic, but not non-erotic, intimate behavior between two men elicited significant increases in anger relative to viewing comparable behavior between a male-female dyad. Implications for understanding heterosexual men's anger, and aggression, toward gay men were discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The effectiveness of intergroup contact at work: Mediators and moderators of hospital workers' prejudice towards immigrants
AN  - 743066506; 201043329
AB  - The present research examines the effectiveness of intergroup contact between 167 Italian hospital workers and foreign patients in reducing prejudice towards immigrants in general. The outcomes of contact at work were analysed controlling for the influence of contact outside the workplace and through mass media, and taking into account the role of empathy, anxiety and group membership salience. Results indicate that the beneficial effects of contact at work were partially mediated by increased empathy and reduced anxiety, experienced both in the work environment and towards immigrants in general. Finally, high levels of group membership salience facilitated the influence of contact on intergroup emotions. These findings show that contact at work can be a powerful means to reduce prejudice, thanks to its capacity to evoke changes in affective responses. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - 'Nibbling on the margins of patriarchy': Latina immigrants in northern Utah
AN  - 743065881; 201043362
AB  - Although many scholars point to the importance of gender in structuring the immigrant experience, many immigrant women themselves do not attribute much importance to the role that gender plays in their lives. To explore this issue further, we investigate how thirty-two foreign-born Latinas define their experiences in Utah, a new immigrant destination that has received little empirical attention. The women in our sample indicated five major challenges they faced in their everyday lives: social isolation, language difficulty, racial-ethnic prejudice, poverty and lack of documentation. Most of the women described these challenges in terms of social class, race-ethnicity and immigrant status, rather than gender. We argue that migration research needs to be more attuned to axes of oppression other than gender and more attentive to how immigrant women, themselves, interpret their everyday lives.

T1  - Prejudice at the Nexus of Race and Gender: An Outgroup Male Target Hypothesis
AN  - 743065728; 201043324
AB  - Adopting an evolutionary approach to the psychology of race bias, we posit that intergroup conflict perpetrated by male aggressors throughout human evolutionary history has shaped the psychology of modern forms of intergroup bias and that this psychology reflects the unique adaptive problems that differ between men and women in coping with male aggressors from groups other than one's own. Here we report results across 4 studies consistent with this perspective, showing that race bias is moderated by gender differences in traits relevant to threat responses that differ in their adaptive utility between the sexes-namely, aggression and dominance motives for men and fear of sexual coercion for women. These results are consistent with the notion that the psychology of intergroup bias is generated by different psychological systems for men and women, and the results underscore the importance of considering the gender of the outgroup target as well as the gender of the agent in psychological studies on prejudice and discrimination.

T1  - The Riddle of the Alien-Citizen: Filipino Migrants as US Nationals and the Anomalies of Citizenship, 1900s-1930s
AN  - 1907161987
AB  - This article interrogates the classification of Filipino migrants in the United States as US nationals, during the period of American sovereignty in the Philippines. It reveals the history behind this legal status by looking at two broad aspects. Firstly, this article narrates the circumstances that led to the creation of Philippine citizenship even if the Philippines was not a sovereign state. This citizenship had legal force only because Filipinos owed allegiance to the US, and because of this allegiance Filipinos could not be classed as aliens and denied entry to the US at a time of stiff racial barriers. Secondly, this article examines how the range of Filipino migrant responses to racial prejudice and violence in the US, especially in the late 1920s and the 1930s, pushed the limits to reveal the contradictions of both Philippine and US citizenships. Because Filipinos asserted their entitlement as US nationals, US government officials eventually admitted the anomalous exclusion of Filipinos from US citizenship. An illuminating case is the successful claim of Filipino fishers in Alaska for their traditional fishing rights not to be curtailed as a local territorial law had intended.

T1  - Circumventions and confrontations: Georg Simmel, Franz Boas and Arthur Ruppin and their responses to antisemitism
AN  - 743065997; 201043320
AB  - Focusing on Georg Simmel, Franz Boas and Arthur Ruppin, three prominent sociologists or anthropologists of German Jewish descent, Morris-Reich analyses their professional responses to antisemitism. He argues that there is a close relationship between their respective epistemic definitions of society and their suggested methods for the study of social phenomena, and the respective forms and registers of their responses to antisemitism. The three cases demonstrate a range of responses, from a strategy of circumventing antisemitism as a distinct phenomenon (Simmel), to one aimed at the transformation of antisemitism into a subset of a general category of prejudice (Boas), to a direct confrontation with antisemitism as a multifaceted phenomenon that possesses universal as well as particularistic aspects (Ruppin). The analysis implies that there is a negative correspondence between the respective responses and antisemitic discourses: Simmel's social theory did not engage with antisemitic writers directly; Boas attempted to undermine antisemitic writers by addressing the shortcomings of racist methodology; and Ruppin attacked antisemitic writers on what he viewed as empirical grounds, while sharing several of their epistemic assumptions.

T1  - The Moderating Roles of Gender and Anti-Gay Prejudice in Explaining Stigma by Association in Male Dyads
AN  - 964192147; 201207441
AB  - Using a convenience sample of 157 undergraduates, this study explored the likeability ratings of target characters from selected film clips who were described as gay or heterosexual as they associated with a gay-described foil character (i.e., a character against which the target is compared). As predicted, male respondents who strongly endorsed anti-gay prejudice viewed gay-described targets more favorably than heterosexual-described targets when each target was paired with a gay foil. Further, this pattern of biased ratings by high-prejudice male participants against our heterosexual target differentiated these participants from both low-prejudice male and high-prejudice female respondents. In contrast, but as hypothesized, high-prejudice female respondents compared to high-prejudice males rated heterosexual-described targets more favorably than they rated gay-described targets.
