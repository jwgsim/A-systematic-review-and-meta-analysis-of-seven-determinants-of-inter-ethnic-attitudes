T1  - Effects of intergroup contact and relative gratification vs. deprivation on prejudice on both sides of the U.S./Mexico status divide
AN  - 2419853656
AB  - A study in the U.S.–Mexican intergroup context examined how collective relative gratification (RG) versus deprivation affects the relationship between intergroup contact and interpersonal closeness and subtle prejudice towards an out‐group. Participants were Mexican university students in Mexico (N = 239) and non‐Mexican students in California (N = 90). As predicted, Mexicans experienced less gratification/higher relative deprivation (RD), and low quality intergroup contact and expressed lower interpersonal closeness and higher subtle prejudice than U.S. Americans. Differences between countries were larger amongst participants reporting higher RD. Second‐stage moderated mediation analysis showed that the mediating effects of contact between country and interpersonal closeness and subtle prejudice, respectively, were larger amongst participants who felt relatively gratified than those who felt relatively deprived. These findings underline the importance of recognizing the moderating effect of differences in the RG versus RD levels of minority and majority groups when anticipating the potential benefits of intergroup contact for prejudice reduction.

T1  - Ambivalent Homoprejudice towards Gay Men: Theory Development and Validation
AN  - 2410668403
AB  - Myriad social groups are targets of hostile and benevolent (i.e., ambivalent) prejudice. However, prejudice toward gay men is typically conceptualized as hostile, despite the prevalence of benevolence toward gay men in popular media. This article aims to compare gay men with other targets of ambivalent prejudice (i.e., women and elderly people) and draw on the stereotype content and microaggressions literatures in order to develop a theory of ambivalent homoprejudice. The resultant framework, comprising repellent, adversarial, romanticized, and paternalistic homoprejudice was investigated using seven focus groups of heterosexuals and gay men (N = 22), and the findings were consistent with stereotype content theory. Directions for future research into the deleterious effects of ambivalent homoprejudice and possible empowering interventions are discussed.

T1  - The Emergence of a Transgender Community in Manipur: The Case of the <i>Nupi Maanbis</i>
AN  - 2413904625
AB  - Transgender subjects in Manipuri society have experienced cultural legitimacy as well as prejudice and therefore have had an ambiguous status from early to modern times. From their early prototypes, pheitas, to their modern counterparts, nupi sabis, transgender subjects have played vital roles in the administrative, cultural and artistic life of Manipuri society. Legitimacy as well as stigma marked their participation in social and economic life. This article traces the emergence of the nupi maanbi community, a community of man-to-woman transgender subjects and argues that the current nupi maanbi identity, embedded in this distinct community, is firmly located in the economic niche that the subjects inhabit as professionals in the increasingly popular fashion and beauty parlours in contemporary Manipur.

T1  - Sites of Resistance: LGBTQI+ Experiences at Trinity Western University
AN  - 2407224631
AB  - Trinity Western University’s Community Covenant has been the subject of public and legal attention with specific reference to a proposed law school. At the heart of much of the contention about the law school, opponents have expressed concern about the provisions in the Covenant that restrict the rights of LGBTQI+ students—their identities and relationships. While much of the focus has been on the potential harm for LGBTQI+ students, and the expectation that law schools uphold Charter values—the voices of queer students and allies have largely been sidelined. This article offers space for LGBTQI+ students, staff and allies to discuss their lived experiences of sexual diversity and the harm facing the queer community at Trinity Western University. As they state, the Covenant is only a part of the issue; the culture it supports is what needs to change.Alternate abstract:L’Université Trinity Western a fait l’objet d’une attention publique et juridique pour son convenant obligatoire. Au cœur d’une grande partie de la controverse entourant la faculté de droit se retrouvaient les préoccupations relatives aux dispositions de ce covenant, qui restreignent les droits des étudiants LGBTQI+ ainsi que leur identité et leurs relations. Les opposants ont majoritairement mis l’accent sur les préjudices potentiels pour les étudiants LGBTQI+ et sur l’exigence que les facultés de droit respectent les valeurs promues par la Charte. Les voix des étudiants queers et de leurs alliés furent, quant à elles, largement mises de côté. Cet article offre donc un espace pour les étudiants, le personnel et les alliés LGBTQI+ afin de discuter de leurs expériences vécues en matière de diversité sexuelle et les préjudices auxquels fait face la communauté queer au sein de l’Université Trinity Western. Comme ils l’affirment, le covenant n’est qu’une partie du problème; la culture qu’il soutient est ce qui doit changer.

T1  - Stigma towards psychosis: Cross‐cultural differences in prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination in White British and South Asians
AN  - 2381929623
AB  - Public stigma towards people with mental health problems has been demonstrated in Western societies. Little is known about non‐Western cultures and whether cultures differ in their perceptions of people with mental health problems. Aim of this study was to examine cultural differences in prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination towards people with psychosis. Participants were from White British and South Asian backgrounds (N = 128, aged 16–20 years) recruited from two schools and colleges in the United Kingdom. They completed a cross‐sectional survey on affective, cognitive, and behavioural dimensions of stigma. Results revealed significant cultural differences on all three stigma dimensions. South Asians attributed higher anger (prejudice) and dangerousness (stereotypes) to people with psychosis than White British. They also reported lower willingness to help, greater avoidance, and higher endorsement of segregation (discrimination). The effects of ethnic group on helping intentions, avoidance, and segregation endorsement were mediated by anger and by dangerousness. Understanding cultural differences in stigma towards psychosis will be important for designing stigma interventions as well as treatments for people with different cultural backgrounds.

T1  - Gangs, gangsters, and the impact of settler colonialism on the Latina/o experience
AN  - 2369205267
AB  - As the largest minority group in the United States, Latinas/os have experienced a long history of discrimination, prejudice, and stigmatization as gang members. A contemporary survey of law enforcement agencies reported that Latinos continue to be the largest proportion of any racial or ethnic group involved in gangs. To describe such a pattern, the framework of settler colonialism will be utilized to describe differential experiences based on race, gender, and how structural inequalities vary by region and time. Latinas/os have been particularly impacted by segregation, second‐class treatment, and policies considered racially neutral. Gangs provide a topical area for examining patterns of racialization and social control. The authors of this article will outline the research literature on gangs and how settler colonialism has impacted the Latina/o population regarding the origination of gangs, reasons for joining, behaviors and activities, and the process for leaving these groups. The authors emphasize decolonization strategies including reducing structural inequalities and thereby reducing gang membership and risky behaviors. Until this can be accomplished, the authors hope for human rights, labor equity, and religious organizing efforts that can form into social movements of collective empowerment and justice.

T1  - Introduction
AN  - 2352555107
AB  - Five studies focus on immigrants themselves, exploring questions of what drives migration from Central America today, what explains the gap in political participation between citizens and immigrants, what are the likely political effects of Latino migration, how does diversity in immigration status and race influence the internal dynamics of the undocumented student movement, and how do social institutions, and specifically the Catholic Church, respond to the increased demand placed on them by the influx of migrants.

Assessing the Vote Choice of Latino Interstate Migrants,” Robert Preuhs takes on the folk assumption that demographics are destiny and an increase in the immigrant population from Latin American countries will inevitably lead to states becoming more liberal and dominated by the Democratic party.

Rita Nassar, in a study entitled “Threat, Prejudice, and White Americans’ Attitudes toward Immigration and Syrian Refugee Resettlement,” shifts our attention to the pressing issue of how the American public responds to the plight of Syrian refugees.

T1  - Is negative the new positive? Secondary transfer effect of exposure to LGBT portrayals in TV entertainment programs
AN  - 2354725994
AB  - This study investigates the primary effect of positive, neutral, and negative exposure to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) TV portrayals in entertainment programs on attitudes toward the LGBT community and the Secondary Transfer Effect (STE) of such exposure on attitudes toward people with Asperger's Disorder (the secondary out‐group), controlling for face‐to‐face and online contacts with both out‐groups. Research was conducted using a mixed methods approach. Quantitative Study 1 used an online survey of 716 Israeli Jews, to investigate primary and secondary effects of TV exposure to LGBT portrayals. The positive primary effect of TV exposure was shown—regardless of LGBT portrayals perceived as positive, neutral, or negative. STE of TV exposure to neutral and negative LGBT portrayals is likely to diminish social distance to people with Asperger's Disorder, while no STE was found with positive LGBT portrayals. Full mediation effect of attitudes toward the LGBT community was found. Qualitative Study 2, based on 52 in‐depth interviews, was conducted in order to reveal the hidden mechanisms of these effects, examining the parasocial experience and its interpretations by the viewers. According to qualitative findings, the positive primary and secondary effects of negative exposure may be explained by varied interpretations of gay portrayals on TV by different people depending on social background and life experience, opposite reaction on stereotypical gay portrayals on TV, and asymmetrical negative‐positive heuristic. Given the important role of TV in fostering more positive intergroup relations, this research revealed sources of prejudice reduction and increase in tolerance toward “others” for society at large.

T1  - MATERNAL TRANSFERABILITY OF TRAUMA AND PSYCHOSOMATIC NATION IN SORAYYA KHAN'S NOOR
AN  - 2425868095
AB  - Ignored or less voiced representation of victimized mothers may appear in the form of certain explicit psychological reactions within generations. Maternal trauma may seep through generations resulting in a psychologically paralyzed nation. The main concern of this paper is to study Sorayya Khan's novel Noor to unearth treachery and to unfold unspoken traumas (PTSD) inflicted specifically upon mothers during violent incidents. Mothers have always been the carriers of distortion, loss, violence, abuse and acute callousness, transmitting confused and anxious situations to the next generation. Sorayya Khan's first novel, Noor, addresses such violence and prejudice, thereby reflecting how such intense traumatic experiences actuate the suffering of mothers. This epic piece of art brings forth the hushed voices of both mothers and children who are marginalized, forgotten, oppressed, traumatized, subjected to dislocation and exposed to violence and sexual assault against the backdrop of war. This research tends to unveil the ways in which mothers have been subjected to trauma to cripple the sound psychological foundations of the community/nation. The main purpose of this essay is to address certain essential questions such as: what in fact trauma is, how war affects the life patterns of society, how the trauma inflicted upon women (Mothers) becomes an irresolvable disorder, how trauma can act as a catalyst for the disruption of all sectors of the society, and finally how inherited trauma gives birth to a traumatized nation. The focal point of this research is to examine and explore the issues faced by the fallen ones (Mothers) during times of war and how these issues become precursors for the future lives of the characters, thereby resulting in a hollow nation.

T1  - Does Contact Matter?: The Relative Importance of Contact in Predicting Anti-Gay Prejudice in Jamaica
AN  - 2352303962
AB  - Jamaica has been called one of the world's most anti-gay countries. However, little empirical research has investigated methods of reducing this prejudice. Intergroup contact-(positive) interaction with someone from a different social group-is one of the most widely tested and strongly favored methods of reducing prejudice. However, the role of contact in this specific context is not clear, particularly the relative importance of contact compared to other variables that predict (less) prejudice. This current cross-sectional research investigated that question using a large, representative sample of Jamaican participants (N = 942). As in prior research, contact predicted less anti-gay prejudice, and the (negative) relationship between contact and anti-gay behaviors was mediated by intergroup anxiety and attitudes, even when other important predictors were taken into account. However, contact was a less important predictor than gender, education, or religiosity. Implications for intergroup contact and prejudice-reduction strategies in Jamaica are discussed.

T1  - Strangers and States: Situating Accentism in a World of Nations
AN  - 2325825938
AB  - This afterword to the Special Issue “Sounding Strange(r): Origins, Consequences, and Boundary Conditions of Sociophonetic Discrimination.” engages the editors’ enthusiasm to consider how to scale things up from smaller experimental studies of accentism to larger social dynamics. In so doing, I highlight some different epistemologies that might engage when conversations are studied for instances of accentism, and nation formation creates the conditions for accentism. I suggest that more explicit attention to contexts in which some ways of speaking are made normative and others are marked will facilitate this development. Some of the historical impact of nation formation on accentism are evident in the results and the methods of the social psychological research included in the Special Issue. Nation formation creates different norms for language use in similar ways. Situating accentism research this way allows us to reconsider the question raised by several of the authors that accentism may be a more profound form of social bias than racism.

T1  - The Mexican European diaspora: class, race and distinctions on social networking sites
AN  - 2311910643
AB  - This article presents original user-based research concerning a Mexican European Diaspora's use of Social Networking Sites (SNSs) for making racial and classed distinctions through the course of sharing and viewing content on their networked profiles. Bourdieu's theoretical framework is used to address the ways in which SNSs usage fosters social capital, exclusion and displays of prejudice and discrimination. We also found useful the analysis of racial distinctions based on participants' references to physical attributes. To illustrate the use of racial and classed distinctions, we specifically consider the use of Facebook and also of A Small World (ASW), an exclusive SNS, regarded as one of few designed for use by 'the wealthy' [Ruiz, 2008. "Five Social Networking Sites for the Wealthy." Forbes. Accessed June 11, 2010. http://www.forbes.com/2008/05/02/social-networks-vip-tech-personal-cx_nr_0502style.html]. We analyse the term 'naco', a pejorative Mexican term commonly used to refer to vulgarity or inferiority amongst Mexican European and privileged diaspora with strong racial, classed and gendered connotations. The empirical material for this study is based on ethnographic research. Through the analysis of displayed images and text as well as well questionnaires and interviews we found tacit or explicit exclusion, discrimination and segregation through close-knit SNS networks engaged in by our participants, a Mexican privileged European diaspora.

T1  - Defying racial prejudice: Second World War relationships between British women and black GIs and the raising of their offspring
AN  - 2299329461
AB  - When American troops started to arrive in Britain in 1942 there was concern about British women's potential intimacy with black GIs. To discourage such relationships, British troops, including the women in the ATS, were lectured on the need to keep contact with black GIs to a minimum; soldiers found with black GIs were reported; a whispering campaign hinted at the high rate of VD amongst black Americans; women were prosecuted under DORA for trespass if found with black GIs on military premises.Despite all warnings, many women had relationships with black GIs. Americans generally were attractive due to their relatively high pay. Black GIs were thought to have better manners and may have had particular appeal because black American culture was so focused on dance and music; dancing was British women's main leisure pursuit.British women went on to have approx 1,700 mixed race babies, despite being called 'nigger lover' and their children labelled 'bastard' and 'half-caste'. Drawing on interviews with these mixed-race offspring I explore the lives of women who bravely keep their children against all odds. Their agency lay in their decision to have relationships and children in the face of racial prejudice and the stigma of illegitimacy.

T1  - Ableism Special Issue Introduction
AN  - 2295332265
AB  - In this special issue, we define ableism as stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination, and social oppression toward people with disabilities—the largest minority group in the United States. People with disabilities are broadly defined as those who have conditions that are commonly perceived to be disabilities by the general public, including physical, sensory, and intellectual disabilities, in addition to invisible disabilities, chronic health conditions, psychiatric conditions, and others. Foundational work on language, stigma, models of disability, and social and rehabilitation psychology is reviewed. The issue has three areas of focus: social and individual‐level predictors of ableism, experiences and consequences of ableism, and navigating and resisting ableism.

T1  - The social‐psychological bases of far‐right support in Europe and the United States
AN  - 2283187210
AB  - The roles of authoritarianism, social dominance orientation (SDO), and prejudice in the prediction of far‐right support were examined in Europe and the United States. A meta‐analysis shows remarkably similar, positive, and strong associations of far‐right support with these three variables in previous studies conducted in Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Results from two cross‐sectional studies in the United States further indicated that higher levels of authoritarianism and SDO related to higher voting intentions and support for Trump, via increased prejudice. In a three‐wave longitudinal study in the United Kingdom, authoritarianism and SDO predicted pro‐Brexit attitudes and support for the U.K. Independence Party, again via prejudice. These results shed a new light on the widely held beliefs in “American and British exceptionalism,” as Trump and Brexit adherents share the same social‐psychological underpinnings as far‐right supporters observed in several European countries.

T1  - The two sides of Islamophobia and the perception of threat from Islamic terrorists
AN  - 2275238691
AB  - There is a heightened interest concerning the understanding of prejudice toward Muslims in Europe, steadily increasing since 2001. This study aimed at investigating whether the phenomenon of Islamophobia could have two different manifestations (i.e., Islamoprejudice and Secular Critique of Islam). In particular, we assessed whether two social attitudes, Right‐Wing Authoritarianism (RWA, i.e., authoritarian aggression, and conservatism) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), could predict differently the two dimensions. Moreover, we wanted to investigate the different influence of the two dimensions in relation to the perceived threat from terrorism. A sample of 366 Italian adults participated in the study completing a self‐report questionnaire. Data were analyzed by means of a structural equation model. Results showed that RWA and SDO were differently related to Islamoprejudice and Secular Critique of Islam, suggesting that certain forms of critique of Islam should not be associated with individual prejudice, because motivated only by secular, democratic, and universalistic convictions, denoting the traces of cultural biases. However, the nonprejudicial and apparently less problematic dimension of Islamophobia, that is, Secular Critique, does not preserve people from perceiving the threat from terrorism, in the same way as Islamoprejudice. Implications are discussed.

T1  - Price and Prejudice: An Empirical Test of Financial Incentives, Altruism, and Racial Bias
AN  - 2330929062
AB  - Many argue that paying people for good behavior can crowd out beneficial motivations like altruism. But little is known about how financial incentives interact with harmful motivations like racial bias. Two randomized vignette studies test how financial incentives affect bias. The first experiment varies the race of a hypothetical patient in need of a kidney transplant (black or white), an incentive ($18,500 or none), and addition of a message appealing to altruism. Incentives encouraged donation but introduced a significant bias favoring white patients. The second experiment assesses willingness to donate to a patient (black or white) without an incentive and then introduces incentives varying in size ($3,000, $18,800, or $50,000) and source (charity, government, or patient’s own funds). Incentives encouraged donation but were significantly more effective in encouraging donation to white patients. Biasing effects are most pronounced for medium-sized incentives. Incentives may have an inadvertent biasing effect for altruistic behavior.

T1  - 'Legitimate Knowledge': An Auto-Ethnographical Account of an African Writing Past the White Gaze in Academia
AN  - 2248222332
AB  - This article explores how issues of race and prejudice permeate knowledge production. By way of theory-driven processing, this article examines how traditional positivist practices, entrenched more than half a century ago, continue to dominate and have set the foundations by which knowledge is acquired, disseminated, understood and naturalized in two aspects: academia (tenure) and the publication process. This article further discusses how social justice and activism figure into productivity and concludes with some practical steps and suggestions to advance a more inclusive critical pedagogy in research, teaching and service.

T1  - Exclusión social de los vecinos en una perspectiva comparada mundial
TT  - Social Exclusion of Neighbours in Comparative World Perspective
AN  - 2237858944
AB  - El objetivo de esta investigación es describir la exclusión social en una perspectiva comparada internacional. Grupos no deseables como vecinos se utilizan frecuentemente como aproximación para responder a tres preguntas: quiénes son los grupos sociales más excluidos, quiénes son los excluyentes y cuáles son las principales variables explicativas de la exclusión social. La exclusión social, como fenómeno multidimensional, se define en relación a conceptos como estigma, discriminación y prejuicio. Se han construido tres índices para medir la exclusión social y analizado cuatro variables para explicar la exclusión social: posición social, exposición a la información, valores postmaterialistas y percepción de seguridad. Asimismo se han añadido otras variables al análisis. Las bases de datos utilizadas han sido EVS y WVS (de 1981 a 2014).Alternate abstract:The object of this research is to describe social exclusion in a comparative world perspective. Non-desirable social groups as neighbours are frequently used as a proxy measure to answer three questions: who are the most excluded social groups, who are the excluders, and what are the main explanatory variables of social exclusion. Social exclusion, as a multidimensional phenomenon, is defined in relation to concepts such as stigma, discrimination and prejudice. In this study, social exclusion is measured through three indices. Four main variables have been tested to explain social exclusion: social position, exposure to information, post-materialist values and perception of security. Other explanatory variables were also added to the analysis. EVS and WVS data-bases (from 1981 to 2014) have been used.

T1  - What’s the Deal? Women’s Evidence and Gendered Negotiations
AN  - 2132132369
AB  - South African law has traditionally denied property sharing rights to people in non-marital intimate partnerships, but a series of new cases has created the possibility of enforcing universal partnership contracts to claim a share in partnership property. However, evidential biases within these progressive cases reflect a historical disdain for women’s contributions to relationships and a widespread reluctance to believe women’s testimony about the existence of agreements to share. These biases bear strong resemblances to the gender stereotypes which have been the subject of feminist critique in rape law. Central to both rape and universal partnerships is the issue of consent or agreement between men and women. This, in turn, depends on social beliefs about male and female entitlements in the realms of sex and intimate relationships. The paper highlights the commonalities and parallels between the legal treatment of women’s evidence about the existence of contracts on the one hand, and the prejudice faced by complainants in rape cases.

T1  - Operationalizing a Conceptual Model of Colorism in Local Policing
AN  - 2136318880
AB  - This thought experiment uses agent-based modeling (computational simulation) to demonstrate how colorism might operate within a local policing context. Colorism is the allocation of privilege and disadvantage based on skin color, with a prejudice for lighter skin. Colorism might help to explain some of the racial disparities in the US’ criminal justice system. I use simulated scenarios to explore the plausibility of this notion in the form of two questions: (1) How might colorism function within an organization, and (2) What might occur when managers apply the typical dilemmatic responses to detected colorism? The simulated world consists of three citizen-groups (lights, mediums, and darks), five policy responses to detected colorism, and two policing behaviors (fair and biased). Using NetLogo, one hundred simulations were conducted for each policy response and analyzed using one-way ANOVA and pairwise comparison of means. When the tenets of colorism were applied to a simulated organizational setting, only some of the tenets held true. For instance, those in the middle of the skin color spectrum experienced higher rates of incarceration when aggressive steps were taken to counter colorism, which ran counter to the expectations of the thought experiment. The study identified an opportunity to expand the description of colorism to help describe the plight of those in the middle of the skin color spectrum. The major contributions from this work include a conceptual model that describes the relationship between the distinct levels of colorism, and it progresses the notion of interactive colorism. The study also explored conditional statements that can be converted into hypotheses for future experiments.

T1  - Making Blanket Statements: Rethinking the History and Politics of American Social Class
AN  - 2196296205
AB  - In Joan C. Williams's White Working Class: Overcoming Class Cluelessness in America and Nancy Isenberg's White Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America, the reader will find a nation riven by abiding class prejudice. Both have written explicitly with the goal of forcing readers to confront the deep, ugly, and ultimately destructive effects of elite snobbery towards working-class or impoverished white people. They both believe that educated readers tend to minimize or ignore how much class matters and has mattered in American history and to deny their own class biases; these books are meant to make that denial harder to sustain.

T1  - Cross-Ethnic Self-Disclosure Buffering Negative Impacts of Prejudice on International Students' Psychological and Social Well-Being
AN  - 2188843694
AB  - Intergroup contact theory suggests that developing a close relationship with outgroup members ameliorates the negative impact of prejudice that individuals perceive from outgroup members. This article specifically investigates the moderating role of cross-ethnic self-disclosure in the link between international students' perceived ethnic/racial prejudice and depression as well as loneliness. One hundred and forty-three international students in Japan were asked to rate their perceived prejudice, depression, and loneliness as well as their self-disclosure to host nationals. The results showed that self-disclosure buffers the negative effects of prejudice on depression and loneliness such that international students who were more likely to disclose themselves to host nationals were less likely to be influenced by prejudice. Theoretical and practical contributions are considered.

T1  - Social psychological research on prejudice as collective action supporting emergent ingroup members
AN  - 2162391435
AB  - Why does social psychological research on prejudice change across time? We argue that scientific change is not simply a result of empirical evidence, technological developments, or social controversies, but rather emerges out of social change‐driven shifts in how researchers categorize themselves and others within their larger societies. As mainstream researchers increasingly recategorize former outgroup members as part of a novel ingroup, prejudice research shifts in support of emergent ingroup members against their emergent outgroup opponents. Although social change‐driven science results in valuable opportunities for researchers, it also results in significant risks for research – collective, scientific biases in the inclusion and exclusion of social groups in prejudice research that are not readily detected or managed by traditional controls. We present the Emergent Ingroup Model (EIM) to encourage reflection on shared biases, as well as to spark a broader conversation on how to strengthen our field for a rapidly changing and increasingly global world.

T1  - Colonial toxicities in a recursive mode
AN  - 2177041723
AB  - It is a privilege and pleasure to engage the close readings and thoughtful queries of the five commentators who contributed to this forum on Duress. They provide an opportunity to reflect on - and beyond - my own preoccupations, and thus offer a welcome challenge. Since Duress went to press Israel has proudly declared itself an apartheid state; the French press and public have once again, as both did 20 years ago, pronounced France increasingly free of prejudice and in multiracial harmony in light of its World Cup victory. In the small city of Nantes, 450 refugees from North Africa squatting with minimal access to sanitary facilities in the city's rat-infested central park are rounded up by riot police. Europe has rescinded whatever partial welcome it once granted to refugees, and heightened its ever more aggressive security apparatus. And with insidious petulance Donald Trump promises to shut down the government if he doesn't get funding for "his" wall. The United States continues to descend into Philip Roth's fascist nightmare (as fantasised in his novel The Plot Against America), resuscitating a policy of "child removal' - once a staple of imperial governance widely practised and now condemned across the world. One might argue that colonial conditions and imperial formations have little to do with these developments, but as both Duress and the commentators here attest, there is strong reason to disagree.

T1  - Asian Americans: Eurogamy by Asian Women: PROD
AN  - 2158088509
AB  - In the diverse American population, racial prejudice still remains a disturbing actuality. With the ever-increasing rate of Asians in the United States having better jobs, better income, and better education, Asian American women have never been at a better bargaining point to move their social standing in the society at a higher rank and aspire toward true assimilation. Intermarriage via selective desired traits that can help the Asian American woman trump their racial limitations, hence disadvantages. Okamoto’s theoretical perspective to develop a boundary approach to the conventional winnowing hypothesis, intermarriage becomes an indicator of integration. Hall’s eurogamy premise posits that most important of such desirable traits of prospective men being Euro-American can help Asian women blur the racial differences, hence bring them to the mainstream. This study suggests that in United States, there exists still substantial homogamy and in the absence of homogamy there is a similar pattern of exogamy, or more specifically eurogamy among Asian American women depicting and showing a clear tendency to marry up. It suggested that eurogamy is likely to continue as a means to marry up. Thus, there will be a continuation of said increase as the population of younger, better educated, independent Asian American women expands, hence resulting in the perfect marital assimilation.

T1  - Systematic Development of a Dutch School-Based Sexual Prejudice Reduction Program: an Intervention Mapping Approach
AN  - 2126770953
AB  - Experiences of sexual prejudice threaten the quality of life and psychological well-being of sexual minority youth. The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of how we developed a theory- and evidence-based sexual prejudice reduction program suitable for the Dutch high school context, guided by the intervention mapping approach (IM). In line with IM, six steps were followed: an initial needs assessment in which empirical, theoretical, and new data were gathered to acquire a thorough understanding of the problem (step 1); the formulation of program objectives for both students and teachers (step 2); the selection of theory-based methods and applications (step 3); program development (step 4); the provision of an adoption and implementation plan (step 5); and the development of an evaluation plan (step 6). In conclusion, developing a sexual prejudice reduction program for schools is a challenging but feasible process. IM is an effective tool for the systematic (theory- and evidence-driven) development of such a program.

T1  - The Observer Observed: Narrating Surveillance in Gertrud Kolmar's Susanna
AN  - 2631696581
AB  - This article is an exploratory reading of Gertrud Kolmar's novella Susanna, which the poet wrote under extreme circumstances between 1939 and 1940 in a Judenhaus in Berlin. Kolmar's novella offers unique and invaluable insight into acts of surveillance at the end of the Weimar Republic. The novella demonstrates how German-Jewish women experienced the damaging effects of small-town gossip, neighborhood spying, and daily instances of social ostracism. On the narrative level, Nazi oppression does not come into play, although racist and antisemitic ideologies are shown to have entered the surrounding Jewish world. Embedded within the story of Susanna is a critical commentary on prejudice within the Jewish community directed against more traditional Jews. My analysis of the first-person narrator and her ward illuminates how both female characters use the act of storytelling as an important strategy of negotiation, which is otherwise impossible.

T1  - Gay-Friendly Psychoanalysis and the Abiding Pleasures of Prejudice
AN  - 2135264828
AB  - Psychoanalysts in North America have mostly rejected the theory that homosexuality in men is "caused" by developmental arrest. Most have also rejected the belief that the Oedipus Complex is the main determinant of adult sexuality (a belief that used to be the very foundation of psychoanalytic thinking). Today's "gay-friendly" psychoanalysts deplore the mid-20th-century analysts who, in the name of bedrock Freudian principles, pathologized homosexuality and believed they could "cure" it. However, the author argues, this wholesale expulsion of a giant body of mainstream theory has two downsides: It pressures us to fudge our clinical perception when we encounter that rare patient who actually does fit the profile of the "sick" homosexual of the past. And it lets us elide the likelihood that fashionable moralism and self-interest may still be distorting our clinical judgment today.

T1  - Admissions of racism in discourse on migration in Greece: Beyond the norm against prejudice?
AN  - 2110286337
AB  - The turn to language in social psychology is closely related to the study of prejudice as racist discourse has been the subject matter of some of the ground‐breaking discourse analytic work. A widely accepted argument was that there seems to be a norm against prejudice informing Western societies: people commonly engage in denials of prejudice when they make negative comments about minorities. Recent work has argued that, due to ideological shifts in the wider societal context or because denying prejudice may not be people's only rhetorical concern, it is possible to find people admitting prejudice. We examine how people in Greece, Greek majority and immigrants, formulate admissions of racism in interviews on migration and citizenship in Greece. Drawing on Ideological Dilemmas and Critical Discursive Social Psychology, we argue that these admissions ironically operate within the norm against prejudice and discuss our findings in relation to the wider socio‐political Greek context.

T1  - Radical Hate Speech: The Fascination with Hitler and Fascism on the Slovenian Webosphere
TT  - RADIKALNI SOVRAŽNI GOVOR IN ISLAMOFOBIJA: FASCINACIJA NAD HITLERJEM IN FAŠIZMOM NA SLOVENSKEM SPLETU
AN  - 2188094986
AB  - This paper examines cases of radical hate speech posted on Slovenian social networks during the development of the refugee crisis in Europe and Slovenia beginning in 2015, The onset of this radical behaviour is subject to particular scrutiny - the manner and the causes underpinning the transition of a discourse of hatred, racism, xenophobia and intolerance to one of open approval of Hitler, fascism, Nazism, the Third Reich; and the fascination with the horrendous events of the holocaust, genocide, extermination, systematic starvation, torture, mass killing or gasification as methods that should be used against the refugees, in a manner not unlike that against the European Jews, arguing that Hitler reawaken might solve the problem of the refugees coming to Europe and Slovenia in the first place. Strangely, this discourse is not championed by extreme, far right groups, such as neo-Nazis, skinheads, or nationalists. On the contrary, it is the ordinary social networks users that have, in their fascination with the Nazi leader and the final solution method (die Endlösung), replaced the stereotype of the Jew with the Refugee. The rise of hate speech in a part of the population is evidence of the fact that fear, the feeling of threat and the encouragement of hatred have, at least in social networks, occasionally morphed to the norm; in Facebook users this is termed casual epistemic fascism, representing a system of beliefs that undoubtedly indirectly sympathises with the holocaust, genocide and the mass killings - in the present case based on anti-Muslim prejudice against the refugees.Alternate abstract:Článek obravnava primere radikalnega sovražnega govora na slovenskih socialnih omrežjih ob razvoju begunske krize v Evropi in Sloveniji z začetkom v letu 2015. Posebno pozornost posveča vprašanju vzniká te radikálnosti - v čem in zakaj se je diskurz sovraštva, rasizma, ksenofobije in nestrpnosti spremenil v odkrito odobravanje Hitlerja, fašizma, nacizma, tretjega rajha in fascinacijo nad grozljivimi dejanji holokavsta, genocida, iztrebljanja, sistematičnega stradanja, mučenja, pobijanja ali zaplinjanja kot metod, ki bi jih, tako kot na primeru evropskih Judov, morali uporabiti na primeru beguncev in na ta način, s pomočjo na novo prebujenega Hitlerja, rešiti problem njihovega prihoda v Evropo in Slovenijo. Nosilci takšnega diskurza niso ekstremne, desno usmerjene ekstremistične skupine, neonacisti, skinheadi, nacionalisti, temveč preprosto uporabniki socialnih omrežij, ki so v fascinaciji nad nacističnim vodjem in metodo dokončne rešitve (die Endlösung) zamenjali figuro Juda in jo nadomestili s figuro begunca. Vzpon sovražnega govora v delu prebivalstva dokazuje, da so strah, občutki ogroženosti in spodbude sovraštvu najmanj na socialnih omrežjih občasno prešli v normalizirane oblike, pri uporabniki Facebooka pa to označujem z izrazom priložnosti epistemski fašizem in ga razumem kot sistem prepričanj, ki nedvoumno posredno goji simpatije do holokavsta, genocida in ubijanja - v tem primem na podlagi antiislamističnih predsodkov do beguncev.

T1  - Experience of stigma and discrimination in families of persons with schizophrenia in the Czech Republic
AN  - 2117578260
AB  - Rationale: Mental health-related stigma and discrimination not only affect persons living with schizophrenia but also their whole families. Stigma and discrimination reduction is key to respond to the unmet needs of persons with mental illness. The local context is of particular importance in this endeavor, as stigma and its manifestations depend on the specific conditions of the target population and across cultures and settings. Evidence on effective approaches to reduce stigma is sparse and lacking from Central and Eastern Europe, including from the Czech Republic. Objective: Our aim was to inform an anti-stigma campaign undertaken in the framework of the national mental health reform in the Czech Republic. Methods: We conducted a qualitative study based on semi-structured in-depth interviews with relatives of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia in the Czech Republic. Initial respondents were identified through local mental health services and users' organizations with a consecutive chain-referral sampling. Transcribed narratives were thematically analyzed within a pre-developed four-level thematic framework to comprehensively identify experiences of stigma and discrimination in all areas of the respondents' lives. Results: Stigma experiences of 25 diverse family members of persons living with schizophrenia spanned four levels of respondents' lives (macro-, meso-, micro-, and intro-level). The overarching issues were: (1) general lack of understanding and misconceptions about mental illness; (2) structural discrimination and paucity of governmental and public support system; (3) burden of “pervasive and unlimited” care and inability of independent living. Conclusions: We identified several features of mental health related stigma and the ensuing discrimination in Czech Republic experienced by persons with severe mental illness and their relatives. We developed a set of recommendations for policy-makers aimed at reducing ignorance and prejudice amongst the public and professionals, improving health and social services-including employment, housing and community integration-and the provision of family support.

T1  - Do Stereotypical Media Representations Influence White Individuals’ Perceptions of American Indians?
AN  - 2081904087
AB  - In this study, we examined exposure to stereotypical movie portrayals of American Indians, motivations to respond without prejudice, and awareness of White privilege on racist attitudes. European American participants (N = 232) were randomly assigned to watch stereotypical representations of American Indians or control videos. Hierarchical regression results revealed that higher internal motivations to respond without prejudice and awareness were associated with lower levels of racist attitudes. Higher external motivations to respond without prejudice were associated with higher levels of modern racist attitudes. For participants high in awareness, there was no significant difference in modern racist attitudes between the control and stereotype conditions. For participants low in awareness, those in the control condition reported lower modern racist attitudes than those in the stereotype condition. Results suggest awareness is an important predictor of lower racist attitudes but needs to be reconceptualized within the counseling literature. Social justice implications and limitations are discussed.

T1  - A critical participatory pedagogical approach to enabling life orientation students to develop social literacy through HIV education
AN  - 2068965793
AB  - HIV education is an important component of the life orientation curriculum, since an intersectional understanding of HIV provides an entry point to appreciate the interrelatedness of various social injustices. Yet, our interaction with predominantly white and privileged pre-service life orientation students led us to believe that they did not perceive HIV education as something that was relevant to their personal or professional lives. Their rigid, stigmatising belief systems and "othering" attitudes prevented them from embodying the inclusive and life-enhancing values that life orientation is supposed to develop. This paper explains how we used iterative cycles of reflection and action to enable 86 student teachers of life orientation to interrogate their misconceptions about HIV education and its applicability for their professional and personal contexts. Students were able to acknowledge their prejudices and privileges, which in turn created a willingness to engage with HIV education and to embody their learning to bring about change in their daily interactions. The knowledge generated from this study indicates how a critical, participatory pedagogical approach to HIV education can develop the social literacy of students to enable them to live out the life-enhancing values that underpin the life orientation curriculum.

T1  - Seeing Like a City‐State: Behavioural Planning and Governance in Egypt's First Affordable Gated Community
AN  - 2038163925
AB  - Haram City is Egypt's first ‘affordable’ gated community, hosting both aspirational middle‐class homeowners and resettled poor urban residents. Amidst legal ambiguity during Egypt's 2011–2013 revolutionary period, the management team of this public–private partnership was tasked with creating a ‘fully self‐sufficient’ city. While Haram City is the product of top‐down ‘seeing like a state’ master planning (Scott, ), the day‐to‐day resolution of class vulnerabilities and disputes over ‘reasonableness’ in city life requires forms of interpersonal adjudication otherwise addressed through local urban law—‘seeing like a city’ (Valverde, ). This article uses ethnography of management techniques aiming to ‘upgrade behaviour’ to theorize that a private entity, in a strategically indeterminate relationship with the state, reconciles future‐oriented planning and storied prejudices by merging two visions of governance. Imitating the repertoire of urban law, managers plan the very realm of bottom‐up decision making. They then adapt top‐down urban planning to bottom‐up dispute resolution to spatially consolidate the ‘consensual’ outcomes of a rigged game. Evoking both colonial Egyptian vagrancy laws and neoliberal paternalist welfare, ‘seeing like a city‐state’ governance amounts to authoritarianism that conceals itself within custom, appearing neutral so as to plan streets, codes and inner lives at once.

T1  - Social Transformation and Human Mobility: Reflections on the Past, Present and Future of Migration
AN  - 2024042324
AB  - This article examines the development of international migration in the context of broader changes in global economic and political formations since the late 1940s. It also reflects on changing official policies and public attitudes to migration, as well as on the emergence of migration studies as a special interdisciplinary area of the social sciences. Four phases are discussed: 1. The period of concentration of investment in the old industrial areas of Western Europe up to the mid- 1960s , which led to attraction of mainly lower-skilled labour as 'guestworkers' or post-colonial migrants. Prejudice against newcomers was interpreted mainly in social-psychological terms as a 'natural reaction' against newcomers. 2. The beginnings of a new wave of globalisation in the 1970s and 1980s. Manufacturing employment in old core industrial areas fell, while new industrial economies (based largely on low pay and anti-union policies) burgeoned. Western European governments tried to send home the 'guestworkers'. The failure of such policies led to the emergence of multicultural societies. At the same time, the growing economies of the Gulf oil states and some Asian 'tigers' pulled in millions of workers, bound by very strict and often discriminatory contracts. 3. From the late 1980s to the recession of 2008 the globalisation of investment and production reached new heights. Cheaper transport and the growth of new media supported the growth of international migration at all skill levels. Developed countries cut back on education costs by importing human capital from countries like India and China, while denying the need for low-skilled workers. Yet the lack of nationals willing to take such jobs fuels the growth of temporary contract migration and irregular movement. Increasingly, migrants have come to be seen as a threat to jobs for low-skilled nationals and as a danger to national security. 4. The article argues that a new phase in global change is emerging following the 2008 crisis, and examines possible trends and their meaning for human mobility in the 21st century.

T1  - Free Food, Free Space: People's Stews and the Spatial Identity Politics of People's Parks
AN  - 2220140911
AB  - While alcohol and drugs were essential to the beat movement in the early Cold War era, the popularization of weed and LSD helped catapult the idea that consumption could be a mindfully liberating experience.10 While scholars have cited the significance of Berkeley's People's Park in helping to ignite an ecologically driven countercuisine movement critiquing the capitalist-driven American food system, the significance of food performances within these politicized happenings as spatial protests has been ignored.11 As Michael Wise and Jennifer Jensen Wallach have argued, examining food culture opens an interdisciplinary window onto the past in ways that traditional historical sources and methods cannot: "Food crosses the abstract boundaries of culture due to the corporeal certainty associated with the act of consumption, grounding our communities in the material worlds around us, revealing the limitations of traditional modes of historical research focused narrowly on the archival exegesis of manuscript sources.

While writing to their white hippie audience in their newsletters called feeds, the group continued to use their platform to shed light on the connections between institutionalized racism and anticapitalism-even calling out patterns of racial prejudice within their hippie community that took advantage of the exoticism and affordability of San Francisco's working-class black neighborhoods despite their white privilege of not needing to escape segregation.26 The Diggers argued that the best coalitional defense against structural inequality was an anticapitalist revolution in which food, housing, farms, and tools would be available for free.27 Meals offered at no cost were part of the group's larger liberation ideology, including setting up free stores and free kitchens as a tool to critique and ultimately "drop out" of the normalization of capitalism.

In her memoir, Wendy Schlesinger described the first people's stew held at Berkeley's People's Park as a fundraising challenge for the park's organizers who solicited stores for donations of soup bones, vegetables, and bits of leftover meat.41 Video footage of a potluck preparation at People's Park No. 6 in Berkeley panned across cardboard boxes of corn, string beans, onions, and celery, among other vegetables, in prep for that day's people's stew.42 In his documentary on Berkeley's People's Park, titled Let a Thousand Parks Bloom, filmmaker Leonard Lipton captured a man stirring a waist-high trash can full of rice and tomato-based stew, while another man off to the side tossed a handful of basil leaves into the mixture.43 Callouts for one people's stew in the Berkeley Barb encouraged everyone to "bring vegetables, spices, whatever's your thing," while more expensive proteins were specifically requested: "Chefs say meat is hardest to get.

Eating with your fingers and tasting how your donations complemented your neighbor's ingredients created intimacy that personalized the project.

Because a variety of racial and ethnic groups created people's parks during this era, the racial, gender, class, and immigrant identities of park creators shaped the cultural meanings of the food constructed within.

T1  - Attitudes Toward and Beliefs about Transgender Youth: A Cross-Cultural Comparison Between the United States and India
AN  - 1985282116
AB  - Using an internet-based survey, we examined attitudes toward transgender youth in the United States and India, two cultures with differences in conceptualizations of gender and treatment of transgender individuals in society, law, and religion. We found generally positive attitudes toward transgender youth in our U.S. (n = 218), but moderately negative ones in our Indian (n = 217), sample. Consistent with the literature on prejudice against transgender adults in many Western societies, general social conservatism in the form of religious beliefs and political ideology, gender-specific conservatism in the form of gender binary belief, and endorsement of environmental rather than biological causes of transgender identity were the best predictors of U.S. participants’ attitudes, although personal contact with gender and sexual minorities also played a role at the bivariate level. These findings suggest that the processes underlying prejudice against transgender youth are similar to those that foster adult-directed transphobia in that cultural context. In contrast, religion-based disapproval and environmental causal attributions were the best predictors of Indian respondents’ attitudes, whereas gender binary belief played only a minor role, and political conservatism and personal contact no role at all. Our regression analyses accounted for considerably more of the variability in U.S. than in Indian participants’ attitudes, highlighting the need for additional (qualitative) work to identify the factors that promote transprejudice in India. We discuss these findings in light of cross-cultural differences between the two countries in terms of our predictors and consider implications for efforts to reduce prejudice against transgender youth.

T1  - Media Representation of Tongxinglian in China: A Case Study of the People's Daily
AN  - 1977678354
AB  - Over the past few decades, the worldwide lesbian and gay movements have diversified and increased their rights claims. The achievement of gay rights claims in society is the result of an interplay among various social factors and forces. Media is one of most influential players in building homosexual images and promoting mutual understanding. Chinese homosexuals were not treated as criminals or mental illness patients anymore in 1997 and 2001, respectively, after decriminalization and depathologization. Thus this article aims to explore how homosexuals were portrayed in the official media of China, particularly the People's Daily, to illustrate the changing perception of homosexuals in China's political and social spheres. It argues that representation of homosexuals in the People's Daily changed gradually from a negative perception to a more positive one with less discrimination and prejudice as shown by the article's quantitative and qualitative results.

T1  - Predicting support for marriage equality in Australia
AN  - 1966005146
AB  - Objective
The marriage equality debate is becoming increasingly prominent in Australian political and media discourse. Moreover, as policy that would legislate marriage equality continues to be debated in political circles, public opinion on the topic appears to be becoming increasingly divided. This article presents a cross-sectional study exploring predictors of support for marriage equality.
Method
A sample of 137 Australians (66% females) responded to a series of demographic items, a measure of attitudes towards gay men and lesbian women, and a forced-choice question asking whether or not they would support marriage between two people--regardless of their gender.
Results
The results revealed that support for marriage equality in this sample was predicted by religious affiliation, political orientation, and sexual prejudice. More specifically, individuals in support of marriage equality were more likely to be non-religious, politically liberal, and have more positive attitudes towards gay men (attitudes towards lesbian women were unrelated to support for marriage equality). Age and gender did not predict support for marriage equality.
Conclusions
Support for marriage equality in Australia can be predicted by social attitudes and demographic variables. These findings are discussed in terms of the implications of maintaining the legal status quo, which mandates marriage inequality.

T1  - A Test of Interactive Narrative as a Tool Against Prejudice
AN  - 1952106468
AB  - Interactive narratives allow audience members control over characters and unfolding plots. The present study tested exposure effects of an interactive narrative in which audience members adopt the perspective of an immigrant illegally crossing into the United States from Mexico. Results suggested that exposure to the interactive narrative engendered positive affect toward Mexicans in the U.S., which predicted support for social services that would benefit Mexican immigrants. Participants' enjoyment also positively predicted affect and support for social services benefiting Mexican immigrants. Results suggest interactive narratives may be effective tools in helping reduce prejudice toward marginalized social groups.

T1  - TAIWAN CITIZENS' VIEWS OF CHINA: WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF CROSS-STRAIT CONTACTS?
AN  - 2010884093
AB  - Segregation has long been recognized as a source of ignorance which breeds negative feelings and hostility. This view maintains that interactions between members of different groups can foster social bonds and promote positive group relationship. Employing recently collected survey data, this study examines the effect of cross-Strait contacts on Taiwan citizens' negative views toward Chinese citizens and the Beijing government. The empirical results show that casual encounters have no effect on the island residents' general perception of China. Serious interactions in the form of friendship moderate their unfavorable feelings of Chinese citizens but have no effects on the perception of a hostile Beijing. Unless contacts can invoke true social bonds, frequent interactions do not have transformative effects on individuals' political views. The moderating effect of contacts at the personal level is not transferable to a political entity when the latter is perceived as a suppressing agent.

T1  - Modern prejudice and strength of conjunction error
AN  - 1938113464
AB  - PurposeModern prejudice was examined as a potential predictor of overestimating proportions of minority employees in gender-typed occupations. Strength of conjunction error was considered as an indicator of distorted perceptions of these proportions. Furthermore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the association between modern prejudice and strength of conjunction error was weaker for gender-untypical than for gender-typical targets.Design/methodology/approachModern prejudice was considered as a predictor of overestimations of black female employees in Study 1 (n=183) and black female older employees in Study 2 (n=409). Data were collected using internet-mediated questionnaires.FindingsIn Study 1, modern racism, but not modern sexism, was associated with greater strength of conjunction error when respondents were presented with gender-typical targets. In Study 2, using a sample scoring higher on modern prejudice than in Study 1, modern racism, but not modern sexism and modern ageism, was associated with greater strength of conjunction error, irrespective of target occupation. Furthermore, there was an unexpected association between lower sexism and greater strength of conjunction error for gender-typical targets, but not for gender-untypical targets.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings lend support to the ethnic-prominence hypothesis in that modern racism, but not modern sexism or modern ageism, was associated with greater strength of conjunction error. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that target non-prototypicality can dilute the effect of modern prejudice on strength of conjunction error.Originality/valueThis is one of the rare studies examining attitudes and conjunction error in a work-relevant context, thereby bridging the gap between social cognition and applied psychology.

T1  - Global Cities, Public Transportation, and Social Exclusion: A Study of the Bus System in Abu Dhabi
AN  - 1911630953
AB  - As cities of the Gulf Cooperation Council grow and integrate with global markets, questions relating to their unique social compositions continue to emerge. Abu Dhabi has been competing with other cities in the region through massive investments in infrastructure and megaprojects, including the provision of public transportation. The paper examines the issues of bus ridership in Abu Dhabi and relates it to the broader debates on social exclusion and transportation. As a globalizing city with a majority expatriate population, and with a large presence of blue-collar workers, unique rifts in the society are further complicating the 'usual' prejudice against buses. The paper reports on results from fieldwork including surveys and observations. It concludes that the bus system could be more effective in fostering social inclusion if a broader accessibility planning approach is used.

T1  - Issue Introduction: Identity Concealment: Multilevel Predictors, Moderators, and Consequences
AN  - 1910720929
AB  - Over the past 20 years, research on the experiences of people who are targeted by prejudice and discrimination has grown dramatically (for reviews see Major & O’Brien, 2005; Puhl & Heuer, 2009; Pascoe & Smart Richman, 2009). This research has shown the power of stigma to affect many life outcomes including psychological distress, physical health, and academic achievement (e.g., Hatzenbuehler, Phelan, & Link, 2013; Steele, Spencer, & Aronson, 2002). The bulk of the research, however, has focused on visible stigmatized identities, primarily race and gender. In the current issue, we focus on stigmatized identities that can be concealed. Concealable stigmatized identities are socially stigmatized identities that have the potential to be hidden from others. Some examples include minority sexual orientation, history of mental illness, chronic illness, substance abuse, and a criminal record. Previous work has shown that people with concealable stigmatized identities experience many of the same negative outcomes as people with visible identities, despite the fact that the stigmatized identity can be kept secret. For example, adolescents with minority sexual orientation have higher rates of suicidality and depression compared to their heterosexual peers (Marshal et al., 2011); people with a history of depression have higher incidence of cardiovascular disease than those without depression (Bradley & Rumfeld, 2015); students with a history of mental illness who attend college are less likely to graduate than those without a mental illness history (Kessler, Foster, Saunders, & Stang, 1995).

T1  - "Date someone your own size": Prejudice and discrimination toward mixed-weight relationships
AN  - 1907597225
AB  - We assessed whether people express more prejudice and discrimination toward mixed-weight couples (i.e., romantic partners with dissimilar body mass indexes [BMIs]) than matched-weight couples. In Study 1, people rated mixed-weight couples less favorably than matched-weight couples. In Study 2, people acted as matchmakers; they chose to pair potential relationship partners on the basis of similar BMI and body size. Mixed-weight couples were perceived as poorer matches than matched-weight couples. In Study 3, people offered advice to a person dating a mixed-weight or matched-weight partner. Men and women dating a mixed-weight, rather than matched-weight, partner were advised to go on less active, public, and expensive dates, display less physical affection, and delay introductions to close others. In Study 4, perceived relational inequity, prejudice toward mixed-status relationships, in general, and system justification motives moderated mixed-weight prejudice. Implications for couples are discussed.

T1  - The Patriotism of Gentlemen with Red Hair: European Jews and the Liberal State, 1789-1939
AN  - 1899810399
AB  - European Jewish history from 1789-1939 supports the view that construction of national identities even in secular liberal states was determined not only by modern considerations alone but also by ancient patterns of thought, behaviour and prejudice. Emancipation stimulated unprecedented patriotism, especially in wartime, as Jews strove to prove loyalty to their countries of citizenship. During World War I, even Zionists split along national lines, as did families and friends. Jewish patriotism was interchangeable with nationalism inasmuch as Jews identified themselves with national cultures. Although emancipation implied acceptance and an end to anti-Jewish prejudice in the modern liberal state, the kaleidoscopic variety of Jewish patriotism throughout Europe inadvertently undermined the idea of national identity and often provoked anti-Semitism. Even as loyal citizens of separate states, the Jews, however scattered, disunited and diverse, were made to feel, often unwillingly, that they were one people in exile.

T1  - How positive and negative contact relate to attitudes towards Roma: Comparing majority and high-status minority perspectives
AN  - 1945135051
AB  - Intergroup contact scholars have recently called for analyzing the effects of negative intergroup contact. In response to this call, we examined the correlates of positive and negative contact with one of the most stigmatized ethnic minorities, that is, Roma. We conducted a study in Bulgaria considering the point of view of the ethnic Bulgarian majority (n = 516) and of Bulgarian Turks (n = 274), an ethnic minority with higher status compared to Roma. Regression analyses showed that positive contact was associated with reduced prejudice and more support for pro-Roma policies, while negative contact revealed the opposite pattern. These associations did not differ between ethnic Bulgarians and Bulgarian Turks. Moreover, positive and negative intergroup emotions mediated the relationships between positive and negative contact on the one hand and prejudice and policy support on the other. Our study highlights the importance of emotional processes involved in positive and negative intergroup contact experiences and encourages future research to analyze how absolute versus relative status differences shape the effects of positive and negative contact in complex hierarchical societies.

T1  - Contact with Counter-Stereotypical Women Predicts Less Sexism, Less Rape Myth Acceptance, Less Intention to Rape (in Men) and Less Projected Enjoyment of Rape (in Women)
AN  - 1877731688
AB  - Intergroup contact--(positive) interactions with people from different social groups--is a widely researched and strongly supported prejudice-reducing mechanism shown to reduce prejudice against a wide variety of outgroups. However, no known previous research has investigated whether intergroup contact can also reduce sexism against women. Sexism has an array of negative outcomes. One of the most detrimental and violent ones is rape, which is both justified and downplayed by rape myth acceptance. We hypothesised that more frequent, higher quality contact with counter-stereotypical women would predict lower levels of sexism and thus less rape myth acceptance (in men) and less sexualised projected responses to rape (in women). Two studies using online surveys with community samples supported these hypotheses. In Study 1, 170 male participants who experienced more positive contact with counter-stereotypical women reported less intention to rape. Similarly, in Study 2, 280 female participants who experienced more positive contact with counter-stereotypical women reported less projected sexual arousal at the thought of being raped. Thus, the present research is the first known to show that contact could be a potential tool to combat sexism, rape myth acceptance, intentions to rape in men, and sexualisation of rape by women.

T1  - Examining Social Desirability in Measures of Religion and Spirituality Using the Bogus Pipeline
AN  - 1925884793
AB  - A primary concern in the psychology of religion is the distinct possibility that responses to empirical assessments of individuals' degree and type of religiosity and spirituality are exaggerated owing to social desirability bias. In spite of increased secularization in American culture and a growing distrust of organized religion, religious involvement, personal religiosity, and spirituality are still viewed as highly desirable characteristics. This study estimates the extent of social desirability biases that affect self-reports of religion and spirituality by utilizing a bogus pipeline procedure. In this procedure, participants are convinced that experimenters can detect disingenuous responses to individual items on questionnaires through the use of physiological measures, although no physiological data are actually collected. If the self-reports of participants in the bogus pipeline condition indicate greater religiosity or spirituality than those in the control condition, self-report bias is indicated. The bogus pipeline procedure has been used in other areas of study to increase veracity of self-reports when social desirability effects are present (such as reporting sexual behaviors or prejudice). The results indicate that social desirability biases influence multiple constructs including religious orientations, religious coping, and daily spiritual experiences. Implications for future research relying on self-reports of religion and spirituality are discussed.

T1  - Comparing the Experiences of Highly Skilled Labor Migrants in Sweden and Japan: Barriers and Doors to Long-term Settlement
AN  - 1881644664
AB  - As labor markets become increasingly global, competition among industrialized nations to attract highly skilled workers from abroad has intensified. Spurred by concerns over future economic needs caused by the demographic challenges of an aging population, both Japan and Sweden have joined this global competition. This article examines Japanese and Swedish immigration policies for highly skilled migrants and compares the highly skilled migrants' experiences in the two countries through interviews with these migrants. Despite Japan and Sweden's completely different approaches to immigration itself, both countries' policies, as well as the experiences of the skilled migrants, are strikingly similar. Highly skilled migrants experience language barriers and prejudice in both countries, making it difficult to build social networks with natives. Career development seems to be perceived as a common problem, although less so in Sweden, where labor markets are more flexible. Overall, these issues reduce both Japan's and Sweden's ability to retain skilled migrants. While they share similarities, Sweden's famed work-life balance and gender equality give it an edge in the competition for skilled migrants, which Japan does not share. This comparison identifies which social conditions facilitate or impede skilled migrant settlement.

T1  - 'Thinking ill of others without sufficient warrant?' Transcending the accuracy-inaccuracy dualism in prejudice and stereotyping research
AN  - 1877774268
AB  - Research on prejudice seeks to understand and transform inaccurate beliefs about others. Indeed, historically such research has offered a cautionary tale of the biased nature of human cognition. Recently, however, this view has been challenged by work defending the essential rationality of intergroup perception, a theme captured controversially in Jussim and colleagues' (2009) research on the 'unbearable accuracy of stereotyping'. The present paper argues that in its own terms the 'rationalist turn' in socio-cognitive research on stereotyping presents an important challenge to the prejudice tradition, raising troubling questions about its conceptual and empirical foundations. However, it also argues for the necessity of transcending those terms. By focusing on the correspondence between individual beliefs and the supposedly 'objective' characteristics of others, we neglect the historical and discursive practices through which the social realities that we 'perceive' are actively constructed and institutionalized. We mask their social origins, contested and perspectival nature, relativity, and relationship to wider structures of power. By implication, moving beyond the Allportian perspective that has dominated both the prejudice tradition and the emerging stereotype accuracy paradigm, we may now need to prioritize other kinds of questions. Reversing Allport's famous definition of prejudice, it may now be time to ask: How, and with what consequences, does 'thinking ill of others' become sufficiently warranted? How does such thinking become part of institutionalized relations of power and an accepted way of perceiving, evaluating and treating others? What should social psychologists be doing to challenge this state of affairs?

T1  - Religious anti-gay prejudice as a predictor of mental health, abuse, and substance use
AN  - 1982177026
AB  - Anti-gay, or homonegative, prejudice is generally considered harmful to the wellbeing of sexual minority individuals. However, the origins or nature of such prejudice may vary. Despite a sizable body of literature suggesting homonegative prejudice is frequently religious-based, the psychological impact of exposure to religious anti-gay prejudice remains largely undetermined. Addressing this research gap, the authors examined whether opposition to same-sex sexuality on religious grounds predicted detrimental outcomes among same- and both-sex attracted individuals, as well as their heterosexual counterparts. A nationwide U.S. sample of 1600 individuals -- recruited using contemporary online crowd-sourcing techniques designed to limit selection bias -- completed a novel inventory assessing interpersonal exposure to religious (as well as nonreligious) homonegative disapproval. Outcome variables assessed included a number of clinically relevant measures spanning general mental health, social support, suicidality, abuse, and substance use. Analyses revealed that greater exposure to religious anti-gay prejudice predicted higher levels of anxiety, stress, and shame; more instances of physical and verbal abuse; and more problematic alcohol use. Furthermore, while sexual minority individuals tended to fare more poorly than their heterosexual counterparts on almost every outcome measure assessed, homonegative prejudice predicted poorer outcomes among all respondents regardless of their sexual orientation or religious identification. Hence, results are among the first to demonstrate that anti-gay religious exposure is associated with substantial threats to wellbeing, and that such effects may be observed beyond religious sexual minorities. Overall, findings imply that homonegative religious social conditions may be of broader health and mental health concern than is conventionally recognized.

T1  - Can Caring Create Prejudice? An Investigation of Positive and Negative Intergenerational Contact in Care Settings and the Generalisation of Blatant and Subtle Age Prejudice to Other Older People
AN  - 1855255674
AB  - Caring is a positive social act, but can it result in negative attitudes towards those cared for, and towards others from their wider social group? Based on intergroup contact theory, we tested whether care workers' (CWs) positive and negative contact with old-age care home residents (CHRs) predicts prejudiced attitudes towards that group, and whether this generalises to other older people. Fifty-six CWs were surveyed about their positive and negative contact with CHRs and their blatant and subtle attitudes (humanness attributions) towards CHRs and older adults. We tested indirect paths from contact with CHRs to attitudes towards older adults via attitudes towards CHRs. Results showed that neither positive nor negative contact generalised blatant ageism. However, the effect of negative, but not positive, contact on the denial of humanness to CHRs generalised to subtle ageism towards older adults. This evidence has practical implications for management of CWs' work experiences and theoretical implications, suggesting that negative contact with a subgroup generalises the attribution of humanness to superordinate groups. Because it is difficult to identify and challenge subtle prejudices such as dehumanisation, it may be especially important to reduce negative contact. © 2016 The Authors.

T1  - Templates and exclusions: victim centrism in Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Indian residential schools
AN  - 1842817113
AB  - In this article I use an ethnographic approach to consider the causes and consequences of a focus on 'survivor' experience in Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) on Indian residential schools. In this Truth Commission, the interconnected concepts of 'survivor', 'cultural genocide', 'trauma', and 'healing' became reference points for much of the testimony that was presented and the ways the schools were represented. Canada's Truth Commission thus offers an example of the consequences of 'victim centrism', including the ways that 'truth-telling' can be influenced by the affirmation of particular survivor experiences and the wider goal of reforming the dominant historical narrative of the state through public education. Canada's TRC was limited by its mandate to a particular kind of institution and scope of collective harm. It was at the same time active in its creation of narrative templates, which guided the expression of traumatic personal experience and affirmed the category of residential school 'survivor' as the focal point for understanding policy-driven loss of language, tradition, and political integrity. [web URL: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9655.12497/full]Alternate abstract:L'auteur utilise ici une approche ethnographique pour examiner les causes et conséquences de l'accent placé sur le vécu des « survivants » au sein de la Commission de vérité et réconciliation canadienne sur les pensionnats autochtones. Dans cette commission, les concepts interconnectés de « survivant », de « génocide culturel », de « traumatisme » et de « guérison » sont devenus des points de référence pour une grande partie des témoignages présentés et pour la manière dont ces écoles ont été représentées. La commission constitue ainsi un exemple des conséquences du « victimo-centrisme », notamment dans la manière dont le fait de « dire la vérité » peut être influencé par l'affirmation d'expériences particulières de survivants et par le but plus large de réformer le récit historique dominant de l’État par l’éducation publique. Le mandat de la commission de vérité et réconciliation était limité à un type particulier d'institution et au préjudice collectif. Dans le même temps, elle a activement créé des modèles narratifs qui ont guidé l'expression des expériences traumatisantes personnelles et assis la catégorie de « survivant » des pensionnats comme point focal de la compréhension de la perte de la langue, de la tradition et de l'intégrité politique à la suite des politiques menées.

T1  - Shaping the Development of Prejudice
AN  - 1840909693
AB  - Social dominance orientation (SDO) has been theorized as a stable, early-emerging trait influencing outgroup evaluations, a view supported by evidence from cross-sectional and two-wave longitudinal research. Yet, the limitations of identifying causal paths with cross-sectional and two-wave designs are increasingly being acknowledged. This article presents the first use of multi-wave data to test the over-time relationship between SDO and outgroup affect among young people. We use cross-lagged and latent growth modeling (LGM) of a three-wave data set employing Norwegian adolescents (over 2 years, N = 453) and a five-wave data set with American university students (over 4 years, N = 748). Overall, SDO exhibits high temporal rank-order stability and predicts changes in outgroup affect. This research represents the strongest test to date of SDO's role as a stable trait that influences the development of prejudice, while highlighting LGM as a valuable tool for social and political psychology.

T1  - The Issue of Identity in Pauline Hopkins's Fiction
AN  - 1896340867
AB  - In this essay, I examine both novels using critical approaches developed from phenomenological and postmodern theories that can, I believe, not only elucidate seemingly problematic aspects of the issue of identity in these novels but also contextualize the issue of identity and the works themselves within a more comprehensive and contemporary context and so add to our understanding of the horizons of meaning and texture in Pauline Hopkins's fiction. The title of Hopkins's 1900 novel, Contending Forces, comes from the stirring speech that Luke Sawyer, a thirty year old Louisianan African American makes to a meeting of the Boston chapter of the American Colored League called to protest the vigilante mob mutilation and burning of a southern black man accused of raping a white woman and the lynching of three of his friends. Prior to Sawyer, the three speakers are a corrupt white politician, a well meaning but overly cautious African American academic, and an ambitious African American lawyer and hack for the local political party machine who has been bribed by the corrupt politician to ameliorate the circumstances of the lynchings and to calm the passion of the crowd from political agitation. (Hopkins, Contending Forces 255-256) Against these specific forces that trouble the African American community is also the force with which, Hopkins says, the major character Will Smith's father, Henry, and ultimately all African Americans must contend, "the force of prejudice" (83).

T1  - Love thy neighbour? Exploring prejudice against ethnic minority groups in a divided society: the case of Northern Ireland
AN  - 2076970677
AB  - Northern Ireland has seen a rise in racially motivated crimes and incidents reported to police in recent years and, although this has been accompanied by intensified media coverage, this phenomenon has been the subject of relatively little research. The purpose of this study is to evaluate empirically three theories that have been proposed to explain prejudice towards ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland; economic self-interest, social contact, and 'sectarianism as racism'. Using the 2013 Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, which contains new questions on contact with ethnic minorities, this study looks at attitudes towards Eastern Europeans, Muslims and a third category of 'other ethnic groups'. Results from multivariate linear regression provide evidence for all three theories but also show that the strength and significance of predictive variables for prejudice vary across the minority groups. The findings that there are different motivations for prejudice towards different groups can inform policies to tackle racism in Northern Ireland.

T1  - Social Policy and Perceived Immigrant Labor Market Competition in Europe: Is Prevention Better Than Cure?
AN  - 1718065539; 201530983
AB  - Previous research on attitudes toward immigrants has so far focused on composite outcome measures instead of dealing with more specific forms of perceived threat and prejudice. The present article approaches this gap by investigating the antecedents of the perception that immigrants take jobs away from the host-country population. This form of perceived economic competition is a fundamental feature of immigrant-native relations in many countries, and it is embedded in the institution of the labor market. Accordingly, the main interest of this study lies in the influence of two central aspects of labor market policy, employment protection legislation and unemployment benefit level. European Social Survey data are used in multilevel models that include individual-, regional-, and country-level factors. The results indicate that unemployment benefits abate perceived competition, and the impact is strong. This finding is robust against the inclusion of several other policy indicators, including integration policies, welfare regime types, and other structural factors such as unemployment rates and unionization figures. Employment protection affects perceived economic threat only indirectly by mitigating the impact of regional unemployment. Furthermore, it actually increases perceived competition for unemployed persons. These findings challenge the notion that prevention is always better than cure. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Effects of heterosexuals' direct and extended friendships with sexual minorities on their attitudes and behaviors: intergroup anxiety and attitude strength as mediators and moderators
AN  - 1660887450
AB  - We tested processes by which heterosexuals' direct and extended friendships with lesbian and gay individuals predicted homophobic and affirming behaviors toward lesbian and gay individuals. Results demonstrated that friendships predicted less homophobic behaviors and more affirming behaviors, mediated through reduced intergroup anxiety and sexual prejudice. Further, the strength with which individuals held their prejudiced attitudes moderated the extent to which these attitudes predicted affirming behaviors. Less prejudiced attitudes only predicted affirming behaviors when these attitudes were strongly held; in contrast, prejudiced attitudes predicted homophobic behavior regardless of how strongly these attitudes were held.

T1  - After innocence: Perceptions of individuals who have been wrongfully convicted
AN  - 1700675458; 201526029
AB  - Although it is easy to assume that individuals who have been wrongfully convicted are stigmatized, research has not systematically examined this issue. This research compares perceptions of individuals who have been wrongfully convicted to perceptions of offenders to investigate the stigma that wrongfully convicted persons report. Participants were randomly assigned to complete surveys regarding their attitudes, stereotypes, and discrimination tendencies towards one of three different groups: individuals who were wrongfully convicted of a crime, actual offenders, or people in general (control). Results suggested contemptuous prejudice towards offenders and wrongfully convicted persons. In comparison to the control group, individuals who had been wrongfully convicted were stereotyped more negatively, elicited more negative emotions, and were held at a greater social distance. Although participants did report greater pity for wrongfully convicted persons than others, this pity did not translate into greater assistance or support. Perceptions of wrongfully convicted persons appear similar to negative, stigmatized views of offenders. Individuals faced stigma and discrimination even after exoneration. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - THE QUALITY OF HOUSING IN FOUR ROMA COMMUNITIES LIVING ON THE PERIPHERY OF FAGARAS CITY, ROMANIA: DIFFERENCES IN PERCEPTION BETWEEN ROMA AND ROMANIANS
AN  - 1835463553
AB  - This study is a secondary analysis of data based on "The Barometer Survey on Roma in Fagaras", conducted in 2013. Quantitative data were collected through the oral survey technique based on standardized questionnaire, applied to the peripheral areas of Fagaras City (Combinat Colony, Negoiu Street, Prunului Street, and Plopului Street), where Roma communities face severe housing problems (systematic sample, N = 400 Roma respondents aged 18 years and over) and to the central and middle city neighborhoods, majority inhabited by Romanians (systematic sample, N = 400 Romanian respondents aged 18 years and over). Through this study we intend to expose the housing situation of Roma by comparing Roma self-perceptions and Romanian perceptions about Roma. The following dimensions of quality of housing were measured: housing and household characteristics; satisfaction with housing situation; agenda of housing problems; solutions for improving housing situation. Additionally, the following aspects of Roma situation were measured: social distance towards the Roma, prejudice and discrimination against Roma. Overall, data showed that Romanians center more than Roma on the Roma lack of jobs issue, and those who think that the solution to Roma housing issue would be to move Roma elsewhere do not perceive as much as Roma that this solution would improve Roma housing conditions and do not take into account that Roma do not want to be moved at the periphery of the city. Furthermore, Romanians do not have the same opinions as Roma regarding the magnitude of public discrimination against Roma, and also they perceive more than Roma a lack of trust between the Roma and Romanian people.

T1  - Predictors of intergroup bias in Turkish Cypriots
AN  - 1735656998; 201536984
AB  - We investigated the role of certain individual and group processes on intergroup bias in the context of Cyprus, an island that has endured over 40 years of interethnic tension. One hundred and fifty Turkish Cypriots were asked to complete a survey which assessed intergroup contact and intergroup bias toward Greek Cypriots. Political affiliation, ingroup favoritism and intergroup contact played a role in predicting prejudice toward Greek Cypriots. Path analysis showed the relationship between ingroup favoritism and outgroup prejudice was partially mediated by low intergroup contact. The findings highlight the theoretical and practical implications for prejudice reduction techniques in Cyprus. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Acculturation is a two-way street: Majority-minority perspectives of outgroup acculturation preferences and the mediating role of multiculturalism and threat
AN  - 1767328952; 201606269
AB  - A 2 OE 2 experimental design investigated the effects of perceived outgroup acculturation preferences on intergroup outcomes for both the Hispanic-minority (N = 50) and European-American-majority (N = 163) in California, USA. Participants read fabricated interviews which manipulated outgroup acculturation preferences for contact (high vs. low) and culture maintenance (high vs. low). For majority participants: Hispanics' desire for contact strongly predicted positive intergroup emotions and low prejudice; desire for culture maintenance only impacted emotions. These acculturation dimensions interacted, revealing the most favorable intergroup outcomes for the high contact, high culture maintenance condition (integration). Support for multiculturalism, along with realistic threat, mediated these effects. Minority responses differed: for Hispanics, perceived European-Americans' acculturation preferences did not impact intergroup emotions or prejudice, but their support for multiculturalism did suppress the interaction of acculturation dimensions on intergroup emotions. The acculturation attitude that exemplified American support for multiculturalism differed for majority and minority participants (integration and separation, respectively). Further majority-minority discrepancies were found with a newly developed measure of behavioral investment in acculturation. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - The Moral Imperative of Social Justice Leadership: A Critical Component of Effective Practice
AN  - 1621771907
AB  - This study examined how four principals in urban middle and senior high schools with a social justice orientation responded to hypothetical scenarios involving teacher prejudice. The principals in this study did not reference their leadership preparation programs in describing the evolution of their equity-focused leadership philosophies, nor did they reference theory. Rather, the principals were predisposed to support the goals of equity and fairness because they believed they had a moral obligation to do so. The research suggests that school leaders who enter the position with a predisposition for equity and fighting injustice may be better equipped to handle scenarios involving prejudice in ways that advance the overall goals of social justice.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Imagine that: examining the influence of sport-related imagined contact on intergroup anxiety and sexual prejudice across cultures
AN  - 1552385877
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine (a) the relationship among sport-related imagined intergroup contact, intergroup anxiety, and sexual prejudice, and (b) how these relationships varied across cultures. Students enrolled at major public universities in South Korea (n=100) and the United States (n=100) participated in an experiment in which they imagined playing basketball and then engaging in a conversation with a gay man or with a friend. They then responded to a post-experiment questionnaire. South Koreans' intergroup anxiety significantly decreased when they imagined contact with a gay man, but the same was not necessarily the case for Americans. Intergroup anxiety mediated the relationship between imagined contact and sexual prejudice for Americans, but not for Koreans.

T1  - The Management of Prisoners' Children in the Russian Federation
AN  - 1532490178
AB  - The inherited geography of the penal estate in the Russian Federation, which results in prisoners being sent long distances to serve their sentences, creates difficulties for maintaining prisoners' family ties. Using the results of interviews conducted with prisoners, former prisoners and relatives in the Russian Federation in 2007-2011, the article examines the patterns of contact between minors and their incarcerated parents in the context of arrangements put in place by the prison service to support the parent-child relationship. Despite arrangements that appear positive on the surface, societal prejudice and historical practice combine with geography to militate against good outcomes.              [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Stigma of ink: Tattoo attitudes among college students
AN  - 1660023576; 201506467
AB  - We test a structural equations model of stigma against tattooed persons and attitudes toward future tattoos among 195 tattooed and 257 non-tattooed college students. Having tattooed friends and family members undermines stigma against tattooed persons while beliefs about negative side effects of tattooing reinforces stigma assignment. The variables above and the respondent having a tattoo predict attitude toward future tattoos. We test a second model, stigma victimization, drawing on data from the 195 tattooed respondents. While greater tattoo abundance results in greater stigma victimization, respondents with more tattoos also report a greater commitment to their current tattoos and less desire for removal. We discuss results using attitude theory, stigma theory, and the contact theory of prejudice. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Desecrating the sacred taste: The making of Gurram Jashua-the father of dalit literature in Telugu
AN  - 1700676599; 201524792
AB  - The experience of discrimination based on caste, especially the stigma of untouchability, never formed a part of the socio-cultural and intellectual history of modern India. This article focuses on the life of Gurram Jashua (1895-1971) and re-reads the poignant and lived experience of untouchability on the basis of his seminal autobiography and other literary texts written in Telugu. This article argues that in ideas against caste prejudices, it is the themes of self-suffering and lived experience that provide a crucial impetus to the germination of protest. Through an analysis of Jashua's writings, especially Gabbilam, often called the Dalit Bible, this article attempts to capture and record the psychosomatic agony of living under the gaze of caste. With an untouchable whose rebellious spirit questioned the legitimacy of Hindu Brahmanical ideology cast as its hero, Gabbilam's revolutionary intervention subverted the content and form of the classical Telugu literary sphere. It was a socially and politically relevant text because in it, Jashua also engaged with anti-colonial nationalism and other issues of his time. Jashua remains peerless in his ability to express the dark realities of caste harnessed into a literary rhythm, as he continues to be read and admired even by non-Dalits.

T1  - Social Cohesion Activities and Attitude Change in Cyprus
AN  - 1767329490; 201610765
AB  - Do social cohesion activities change the attitudes of the participants? This paper uses intergroup contact theory to explore attitude change resulting from contact with out-group(s) in social cohesion activities. Results from a pre-test/post-test design with fifty-five participants in two bicommunal camps in Cyprus show how attitudes change at the immediate end of these activities; an analysis of fourteen participants' comments after one, thirteen, and twenty-five months provides a medium- to long-term assessment of attitude change. Not all participants were completely positive towards the other community before they took part, as assumed by some. There is clearly space for impact in terms of attitude change. Social cohesion activities represent indispensable tools for reducing prejudice and improving relationships between former enemies in post-conflict countries. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Intergroup Conflict
AN  - 1692288605; 201522391
AB  - Intergroup contact theory is enjoying a renaissance; positive contact does reduce intergroup prejudice, but intergroup contact has generally been studied in relatively benign settings. With a number of countries either still experiencing or having just emerged from periods of pervasive intergroup animosity, contact theory is, nowadays, being put to its most stringent test as contact theorists try to uncover ways in which intergroup conflict can be reduced and reconciliation fostered. This article draws on research conducted at the Oxford Centre for the Study of Intergroup Conflict in countries including South Africa, Northern Ireland, Cyprus, and Bosnia. We report on our efforts to add to the emerging body of literature by (a) exploring the possible roles that direct and extended contact play in (post-) conflict societies; (b) asking when we might-or might not-expect contact to positively affect more demanding outcomes (such as intergroup trust and forgiveness); and (c) by investigating the processes by which contact achieves these outcomes. We then outline a research program that aims to further study both the benefits and limitations of intergroup contact in societies that are immersed in or emerging from protracted intergroup conflict.

T1  - Restricting the scope of justice to justify discrimination: The role played by justice perceptions in discrimination against immigrants
AN  - 1512219689; 201408675
AB  - In this research, we have analysed the role played by the scope of justice and belief in a just world (BJW) in discrimination against immigrants. In Study 1 (n = 185), we found that the relationship between prejudice and discrimination is mediated by a restricted view of the scope of justice. In addition, the results also showed that this mediation is moderated by BJW insofar as the mediation occurred in participants with a high level of BJW but not in participants with a low level of BJW. Studies 2 and 3 experimentally tested our prediction that the legitimising role played by the scope of justice is guided by a justice motive such as BJW. In both studies, the results showed a greater degree of discrimination against immigrants when a restricted scope of justice was considered but only when the BJW was made salient. In sum, these results introduced an innovation into the literature on the legitimation of social inequalities by demonstrating the relevant role played by the justice perceptions in discrimination against immigrants. .

T1  - Perceptions of African American College Applicants: The Roles of Race, Criminal History, and Qualifications
AN  - 1417960412
AB  - African Americans are under-represented in higher education and disproportionately represented among offender populations, with poor educational obtainment a risk factor for criminal behavior. While African American students report low acceptance from Caucasian peers that can influence their educational persistence, few studies have examined Caucasian students' perceptions of African American students, while examining the influence of race and criminal history. This study endeavored to begin to fill this gap. Students evaluated 1 of 24 hypothetical college applicants, manipulated by race, arrest record, and academic qualifications. Results showed that hypothetical Caucasian applicants benefited from no criminal record when evaluated by Caucasian students, and received higher ratings than Caucasian applicants with a drug arrest record and African American applicants with any criminal record. When evaluated by Caucasian students, African American applicants with no criminal record were no more likely to be accepted than Caucasian or African American applicants with a criminal record. In addition, Caucasian students felt more comfortable around the Caucasian applicant with a DWI arrest over the African American applicant with the same arrest. Racial preference for Caucasian applicants by Caucasian participants also emerged when qualifications were mixed (e.g., low GPA/high ACT). These racial differences did not emerge when ethnic minority students rated these same applicants. Yet, when Caucasian students were asked why they chose their ratings, race was never mentioned. These results support research that African American students can experience race-based barriers in higher education by Caucasian peers, but in a form that is less overt and not readily acknowledged.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - What Nature Makes of Her: Kant's Gendered Metaphysics
AN  - 1494751775; 201404877
AB  - Women's exclusion from political enfranchisement in Kant's political writings has frequently been noted in the literature, and yet has not been closely scrutinized. More often than not, commentators suggest that this reflects little more than Kant's sharing in the prejudices of his era. This paper argues that, for Kant, women's civil incapacities stem from defects relating to their capacities as moral agents, and more specifically, to his teleological account of the conditions within which we, as imperfect beings, develop our moral capacities. Women are not incidentally or tangentially excluded from the boundaries of political and moral agency, but rather must adopt an explicitly nonmoral character if we are to understand humanity as moving toward its naturally given, moral ends. I argue (1) that Kant's teleological view of human development requires women to develop an explicitly nonmoral character; (2) that this teleology is inextricable from his view of the moral agency that human-and not merely rational-beings are capable of; and (3) that taken together, these suggest that women's subordinate status is internally connected to Kant's view of moral personhood.

T1  - Adolescents and prejudice: A comparative study of the attitudes of two European adolescent populations regarding the issues that are raised by increasing cultural and religious pluralism
AN  - 1417524522; 201332137
AB  - This study illustrates the reaction toward the cultural and religious pluralism of two adolescent populations, from two different European countries. The goal in this study is to relate prejudices regarding immigration to the socio-cultural features that in a given context shape the issues surrounding this subject. The hypotheses proposed indicate that the socio-cultural factors represent interesting examples of variation of the stereotypes and attitudes toward the phenomenon of immigration. A survey has been conducted in Italy and France on 1277 high school students (mean age 17.2) to examine two different contexts concerning the issues that are raised by immigration phenomena. Consideration of the contextual factors will enable us to understand why young Italians express prejudices focused on economical and social issues, whereas young French people have a prejudice driven by identity issues. In order to explain such a typology of prejudice we have turned to the social and cultural characteristics that the question of immigration takes on in these two countries. Let us remember that for a more in-depth explanation of the factors that shape intergroup hostility, variables at the individual level need to be put alongside those at the contextual level. This way of working will lead to a better understanding of the social genesis of prejudices. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - The Public Stigma of Mental Illness: What Do We Think; What Do We Know; What Can We Prove?
AN  - 1512218382; 201410719
AB  - By the 1990s, sociology faced a frustrating paradox. Classic work on mental illness stigma and labeling theory reinforced that the 'mark' of mental illness created prejudice and discrimination for individuals and family members. Yet, that foundation, coupled with deinstitutionalization of mental health care, produced contradictory responses. Claims that stigma was dissipating were made, while others argued that intervention efforts were needed to reduce stigma. While signaling the critical role of theory-based research in establishing the pervasive effects of stigma, both claims directed resources away from social science research. Yet the contemporary scientific foundation underlying both claims was weak. A reply came in a resurgence of research directed toward mental illness stigma nationally and internationally, bringing together researchers from different disciplines for the first time. The author hade reported on the general population's attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral dispositions, that targeted public stigma and implications for the next decade of research and intervention efforts. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Budding Multiculturalism or Veiled Indifference? Inter-Group Contact Among Immigrant and Native-Born Adolescents in Small-Town Canada
AN  - 1492600180; 201401039
AB  - Drawing on qualitative research examining the integration experiences of immigrant adolescents in a small city (Fredericton population 50,535) and rural town (Florenceville-Bristol population 1,500) in New Brunswick, Canada, this article presents daily encounters between young immigrants and their native-born peers. It argues the citizens of Florenceville-Bristol are able to compensate for the absence of formal programming for immigrant youth by finding creative ways to communicate with the immigrant adolescents, recognizing their strengths and abilities, and including them in activities and structures where they would have the best fit. It concludes that cross-cultural interaction in our daily lives brings a more positive multicultural experience to communities when Allport's (1954) four necessary conditions for contact to result in the reduction of prejudice are met.

T1  - Interaction Through Technological Lenses: Computer-Mediated Communication and Language
AN  - 1322723551; 201312173
AB  - In 2004, the second International Association of Language and Social Psychology Task Force focused on relationships involving language and emerging communication technology, culminating in a Special Issue of the Journal of Language and Social Psychology (Vol. 23, No. 4). The present article reviews the topics and conclusions of that work and traces the continuation of study on those topics as they have evolved and influenced language and social psychology research to the present. Communication technology research offers views on the central question of how individuals adapt language to communicative action in the presence or absence of various nonverbal cue systems. This question is reflected in topics such as the expression of affect and immediacy online, the virtual presentation of self and gender, the management of online conversations, adaptation via visual grounding in electronic collaboration, and the employment of online interaction technology to reduce intergroup prejudice. As communication systems have evolved, interfaces offer new cues and representations of users, which continue to propel inquiry into these central questions about language and its usage within various technological contexts.

T1  - Nonheterosexual Binational Families: Resilient Victims of Sexual Prejudice and Discriminatory Immigration Policies
AN  - 1150010349
AB  - An unprecedented number of American citizens are facing the challenge of being in a non-heterosexual binational relationship. Although immigration laws are based on the principle of family unification, under current federal law lesbian, gay, and bisexual Americans cannot sponsor their same-sex foreign national partners for residency in the United States. Consequently, an estimated 36,000 couples face the threat of family separation because the narrow definition of "family" used by U.S. immigration services excludes same-sex binational couples and their children. Despite the fact that family research indicates that long periods of separation have harmful effects on the family, immigration law continues to deny binational families the basic right of family unity afforded many of their heterosexual counterparts. Bi-national couples must learn how to function in a social system while dealing with heterosexism, overt discrimination, violence, and the psychological symptoms that result from helplessness. This article will explore the ways in which nonheterosexual binational families must struggle to keep their families together as a result of the discriminatory ways in which laws are constructed in this country. We propose that discriminatory immigration policies have neglected contemporary family research that describes the family as a diverse array of intimate systems that provide mutual care.

T1  - Easing in: Fluent processing brings others into the ingroup
AN  - 1125220033; 201240265
AB  - Four experiments demonstrated that perceptual fluency can facilitate categorization of others as ingroup members. In Experiment 1 (replications A, B, and C), White participants were first exposed to a group of White target individuals and later judged whether fluent (repeated) and disfluent (novel) targets were members of a particular ingroup or not. In each replication, fluent targets were categorized as ingroup members more readily than were disfluent ones. Experiment 2 replicated and extended this finding by showing that both White (racial ingroup) and Black (racial outgroup) targets were more frequently perceived as school ingroup members when fluent (repeated). In Experiments 3 and 4, fluency was manipulated via visual clarity and, again, fluency engendered more ingroup categorizations than did disfluency, for both racial ingroup and outgroup targets. Moreover, findings from Experiment 4 suggested that liking fully mediated the fluency-ingroup categorization relation. Implications of these findings for the literatures on fluency and intergroup relations are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Relatively Socially Acceptable Prejudice Within and Between Societies
AN  - 1023026891; 201223747
AB  - Two studies investigated the relative social acceptability of certain prejudices within a society (Study 1) and between societies (Study 2), using (less) internal motivation to control prejudice as an indicator of social acceptability. In Study 1, White British participants reported less internal motivation to control prejudice against people with schizophrenia than against Black people. In Study 2, Jamaican participants reported less internal motivation to control anti-homosexual prejudice than did either British participants or American participants. Other differences in motivation to control prejudice were smaller, absent, or at odds with this difference, indicating that differences in motivation to control anti-homosexual prejudice were not solely due to cultural differences concerning motivation to control prejudice in general. Results are discussed in terms of novel findings, relevance to the literature and possible future research. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Prejudice Awareness Through Cultural Self-Knowledge Development: Going Beyond the Contact Reduces Prejudice Hypothesis
AN  - 1283638547; 201303608
AB  - This article challenges the simplicity of Allport's contact reduces prejudice hypothesis by emphasizing the importance of addressing previously learned cultural beliefs and attitudes as a possible factor in prejudice development and reduction. These cultural beliefs and attitudes were studied through classroom assignments where this type of learning can be explored. Data were collected from students in a graduate cross-cultural course after students' completion of a cultural self-assessment paper and a paper based on interviewing an ethnic family. These data revealed that, through a process of cultural self-knowledge development and later contact with an ethnic family, prejudice awareness appeared to occur, which has the potential to reduce prejudice.

T1  - Associative Stigma among Mental Health Professionals: Implications for Professional and Service User Well-Being
AN  - 940349553; 22382718
AB  - In contrast with growing attention given to the stigma experiences of mental health service users, the stigma literature has paid almost no attention to mental health professionals. This study focuses on experiences of associative stigma among these professionals. We investigate the link between associative stigma and three dimensions of burnout as well as job satisfaction among mental health professionals, and the link of associative stigma with self-stigma and client satisfaction among service users. Survey data from 543 professionals and 707 service users from diverse mental health services are analyzed using multilevel techniques. The results reveal that among mental health professionals associative stigma is related to more depersonalization, more emotional exhaustion, and less job satisfaction. In addition, in units in which professionals report more associative stigma, service users experience more self-stigma and less client satisfaction. The results reveal that associative stigma is related to more depersonalization, more emotional exhaustion, and less job satisfaction among mental health professionals. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Contact, evaluation and social distance: Differentiating majority and minority effects
AN  - 1417520796; 201332133
AB  - Contact research has traditionally focused on reducing negative attitudes or emotions towards outgroups. In the current studies we focus on reduced social distance as an outcome of intergroup contact -- that is a person's desire to have increased contact with members of a group -- and investigate whether outgroup evaluation in associated with these generalizing effects of contact. Drawing on data from a large sample of secondary school students in Australia gathered from majority and minority group members the findings demonstrate that having contact with an outgroup reduces social distance to the group in general. However, for majority group members, evaluation of the minority group is a strong predictor of social distance and evaluation is also improved with intergroup contact. Importantly, evaluations of the outgroup play no such role for minority group members. The findings highlight an alternate model for understanding contact effects and suggest that reduced social distance rather than improved outgroup evaluations may be more important in understanding minority responses to contact.

T1  - Pathways to Career and Leadership Success: Part 2-Striking Gender Similarities Among $100k Professionals
AN  - 925713132; 201205312
AB  - This study examined gender differences in personal, family, personality, work style, and leadership factors among a sample of highly successful business professionals. Self-report data was obtained from a survey of 56 women and 50 men, mostly from the United States, all of whom made $100,000 or more in annual personal income. Most of the respondents had senior-level positions, owned their own business, and were highly educated. Sixty percent were millionaires or multimillionaires. Contrary to past research indicating systemic gender differences that limit the success of females, this study found few gender differences overall. These women and men were similar on most of the measures tested, including parental and early-life experiences, core personality traits, work styles, leadership styles, formative career work assignments, career path life detours, and work-related failures. However, twice as many women than men reported experiencing prejudice or discrimination in their work histories. A majority of both genders acknowledged gender-specific obstacles to career success for women in general (i.e., childbearing, greater family care responsibilities, and sexism). Being a successful leader also was defined somewhat differently for women than for men. Thus, even though a high degree of similarity was found between women and men in most background and career path characteristics, traditional gender-role expectations and sexism issues still affected many of these women, and this was acknowledged by most of the men in the study as well. See companion article (Part 1) for comparisons of this sample with normative and matched samples on many of these demographic, personality, work style, and early-life experience factors.

T1  - Stigma, burden, social support, and willingness to care among caregivers of PLWHA in home-based care in South Africa
AN  - 1023025168; 201226485
AB  - Despite its benefits for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), home-based care (HBC) may have negative effects on caregivers. Caregivers experience high levels of burden and may be targets of HIV-related prejudice and discrimination. In this cross-sectional survey of 358 caregivers from five hospices across KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, 49 (13.7%) caregivers personally experienced discrimination as a result of caring for PLWHA. One hundred and seventy (47.5%) marked one or more items on the HIV stigma scale. Eighty-eight percent had low to moderate levels of caregiver burden. People with higher level of burden and higher income were more likely to hold stigmatizing beliefs. Caregivers with the following characteristics: support from a nurse, support from community careworker, HIV stigmatizing beliefs, and personal experience of discrimination as result of caring for PLWHA and low caregiver burden, had more than twice the odds of wanting to care for another PLWA in the future. Overall, caregivers in HBC experience low level of severe caregiver burden. The support offered to caregivers from the hospice and relatively low levels of discrimination encourage expansion of HBC programs for PLWHA. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Finding the Faithless: Perceived Atheist Prevalence Reduces Anti-Atheist Prejudice
AN  - 1928276555
AB  - Although prejudice is typically positively related to relative outgroup size, four studies found converging evidence that perceived atheist prevalence reduces anti-atheist prejudice. Study 1 demonstrated that anti-atheist prejudice among religious believers is reduced in countries in which atheists are especially prevalent. Study 2 demonstrated that perceived atheist prevalence is negatively associated with anti-atheist prejudice. Study 3 demonstrated a causal relationship: Reminders of atheist prevalence reduced explicit distrust of atheists. These results appeared distinct from intergroup contact effects. Study 4 demonstrated that prevalence information decreased implicit atheist distrust. The latter two experiments provide the first evidence that mere prevalence information can reduce prejudice against any outgroup. These findings offer insights about anti-atheist prejudice, a poorly understood phenomenon. Furthermore, they suggest both novel directions for future prejudice research and potential interventions that could reduce a variety of prejudices.

T1  - Opening Closed Minds: The Combined Effects of Intergroup Contact and Need for Closure on Prejudice
AN  - 1928275908
AB  - Five studies tested whether need for closure (NFC) moderates the relation between intergroup contact and prejudice toward immigrants. The results consistently showed that intergroup contact was more strongly associated with reduced levels of prejudice among people high in NFC compared to people low in NFC. Studies 1 (N = 138 students) and 2 (N = 294 adults) demonstrated this moderator effect on subtle, modern, and blatant racism. Study 2 also replicated the moderator effect for extended contact. An experimental field study (Study 3; N = 60 students) provided evidence of the causal direction of the moderator effect. Finally, Studies 4 (N = 125 students) and 5 (N = 135 adults) identified intergroup anxiety as the mediator through which the moderator effect influences modern and blatant racism as well as hostile tendencies toward immigrants. The role of motivated cognition in the relation between intergroup contact and prejudice is discussed.

T1  - Older Female Caregivers and HIV/AIDS-Related Secondary Stigma in Rural South Africa
AN  - 857992641; 20957421
AB  - South Africa's HIV/AIDS epidemic poses a major public health threat with multi-faceted harmful impacts and 'socially complex' outcomes. While some outcomes relate to structural issues, others stem from society's attitudinal milieu. Due to negative attitudes toward People Living with HIV/AIDS, stigmatization mars their own experience and often extends to those close to them, in particular their caregivers. Many of the caregivers in South Africa are older women; thus, older women are the focus of this paper, which aims to examine HIV/AIDS-related stigma from their perspective. This paper explores secondary stigma as a socio-cultural impact of HIV/AIDS through repeated semistructured interviews with 60 women aged 50-75 in the MRC/Wits Rural Public Health and Health Transitions Unit research site (Agincourt), many of whom had cared for a family member with HIV/AIDS. Respondents' narratives reveal that many older persons attribute high rates of death in their community to young persons' lack of respect for societal norms and traditions. The findings illustrate the forms and expressions of HIV/AIDS-related secondary stigma and their impacts on older female caregivers. The types of secondary stigma experienced by the respondents include physical stigma in the form of isolation and separation from family members; social stigma in the form of voyeurism and social isolation; and verbal stigma in the form of being gossiped about, finger-pointing and jeering at them. Despite mixed reports about community responses toward infected and affected people, HIV/AIDS-related stigma remains a cause for concern, as evidenced by the reports of older women in this study.

T1  - Education and conflict in Nepal: possibilities for reconstruction
AN  - 1010631679; 201211515
AB  - This paper analyses the nexus of the 'People's War' and education in Nepal and argues that education was one of the main causes of the violent conflict. Despite 'modernisation' efforts and increased participation, schools in Nepal continued to embody socially and culturally prejudiced values and institutionally legitimised the inequitable practices through the education system. Drawing on qualitative interviews with educational stakeholders from six diverse districts across the country, this paper shows how manifold deficiencies in the education system contributed to generate and fuel the 'ideology-led' Maoist rebellion and subsequently how schools thus became a key battlefield of the violent conflict.

T1  - A Multidimensional Examination of the "Stereotype" Concept: A Developmental Approach
AN  - 862596063; 201109802
AB  - The present studies tested the hypothesis that the stereotypical representation of a target group is composed of several components. It was further hypothesized that some of the dimensions are more closely associated with the perceiver's group than are others. Finally, it was hypothesized that the structure & the foundation of the stereotype is related to the age of the perceiver. In two studies, Israeli children, ranging in age from 4 to 17 years, assigned stereotyped traits to target groups (Israeli, Arabs, Americans, Germans). The respondents were then given the opportunity to rate the traits on several dimensions including group evaluation, salience, homogeneity, uniqueness, & ingroup consensus. Respondents of all ages could use the multiple components to describe their stereotype. The results indicate that the specific target group affected the structure of the stereotype. The stereotype of older children was more likely to represent a prototype of the target group & be based on personal experience than was the stereotype of younger children. The implications of the results for understanding the formation & fluctuation of stereotypes are discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - When Biased Language Use is Associated With Bullying and Dominance Behavior: The Moderating Effect of Prejudice
AN  - 758122510; 201058955
AB  - Biased language related to sexual orientation is used frequently among students and is related to prominent social concerns such as bullying. Prejudice toward gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender individuals also has been examined among adolescents, but separately from these behaviors. This study tested whether biased language use was associated with bullying and dominance irrespective of sexual prejudice or if sexual prejudice moderated these associations among 290 high school students (50% female; 56% White). Sexual prejudice was associated with biased language use among boys only. Biased language was associated with bullying regardless of levels of sexual prejudice for boys. However, this association was dependent on sexual prejudice for girls. For dominance behavior, its association with biased language was moderated by sexual prejudice for boys, but not girls. However, girls' engagement in all behaviors was significantly less than boys. These results indicate nuanced ways in which multiple factors contribute to the use of sexual orientation biased language. Also, they underscore the need to address biased language and prejudice as part of anti-bullying programs. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Passing CCKs in Japan: Analysis on Families of Cross-Border Marriages between Japanese and Brazilian
AN  - 652437177
AB  - Since an amendment to the Immigration Control Act in 1990, which granted 2nd and 3rd generation Japanese unlimited visa status to work in Japan, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of Brazilians of Japanese descent coming to Japan. As a result, there is a large number of couples comprising Japanese and Japanese-Brazilian in Japan. In this paper, I investigated the conditions involving Cross-Culture Kids (CCK) born of these marriages. The children's first language is Japanese, and an overwhelming number of parents want their children to learn English as a second language rather than Portuguese. Regarding the children's name, there were few cases in which the child used a Brazilian name. In Japanese society, which emphases uniformity and homogeneity, using a Japanese name is one method of resolving the issue of being different from others. Parents with children who are not immediately recognizable as CCKs based on characteristics of outward appearance have developed strategies for avoiding discrimination and prejudice through passing. However, passing offers little possibility of enjoying the advantages of multicultural society. CCKs with two nationalities and cultural backgrounds should be guaranteed the right to enjoy the benefit of maintaining and developing an identity as a Japanese, in addition to one more identity. We need to encourage a new awareness of CCKs as agents for a transition from a monocultural system to a multicultural system, not only in Japanese schools, but in Japanese society as a whole.

T1  - Attitudes Toward Homosexuals Among Youth in Multiethnic Brussels
AN  - 743046809; 201031991
AB  - This study examined attitudes toward lesbians and gay men (referred to in the literature as sexual prejudice ) in a sample of pupils from 70 secondary schools in Brussels. We used items measuring traditional and modern sexual prejudice and support for gay civil rights. We performed a multilevel linear multivariate response analysis to assess both the impact of individual characteristics and school influence on pupils' attitudes. Controlling for sociodemographic variables, second-generation migrants had more prejudice toward homosexuals than pupils from the ethnic majority group. Identification with the receiving society and perception of group-level institutional discrimination, however, mediated the association between ethnic origin and homonegativity. In contrast to traditional sexual prejudice and gay civil rights issues, modern sexual prejudice items were less affected by individual sociodemographic variables. Modern sexual prejudice also remained rather stable across schools; however, schools did appear to affect civil rights issues and traditional sexual prejudice. This contribution sheds light on the relationship between ethnic origin and sexual prejudice and on the variation of several sexual prejudice dimensions across social groups and schools.

T1  - Smoking, Stigma and Tobacco Denormalization: Further Reflections on the Use of Stigma as a Public Health Tool. A Commentary on Social Science & Medicine's Stigma, Prejudice, Discrimination and Health Special Issue (67:3)
AN  - 743066674; 201029649
AB  - In recent years, addictions policy has stressed the need to counteract stigmatization in order to promote public health. However, as recent observers have noted, through the widespread implementation of tobacco 'denormalization' strategies, tobacco control advocates appear to have embraced the use of stigma as an explicit policy tool. In a recent article, Ronald Bayer (2008) argues that the mobilization of stigma may effectively reduce the prevalence of smoking behaviors linked to tobacco-related morbidity & mortality & is therefore not necessarily antithetical to public health goals. This commentary takes up this question of whether stigmatizing smoking may ultimately serve the interests of public health. Through an examination of the unique contours of tobacco control policy, we suggest that stigmatizing smoking will not ultimately help to reduce smoking prevalence amongst disadvantaged smokers -- who now represent the majority of tobacco users. Rather, it is likely to exacerbate health-related inequalities by limiting smokers' access to healthcare & inhibiting smoking cessation efforts in primary care settings. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Prejudiced People Perceive More Community Support for Their Views: The Role of Own, Media, and Peer Attitudes in Perceived Consensus
AN  - 1866473486
AB  - People often overestimate others' support for their views (false consensus effect). Recent research has shown that this is particularly marked in the relation between perceived consensus and prejudice. The current research asked whether this partly arises in an in-group stereotype of the community as prejudiced. We investigated relations between different sources of normative information (self, media, peers), estimates of community attitudes, and perceived consensus in a sample of 135 community members. Media prejudice predicted community attitudes, and this further predicted consensus. However, strongest was a direct relation between own prejudice and perceived consensus. The results indicate a desire to appear nonprejudiced, relative to others. Confronting prejudiced people with information about community norms is a promising intervention under these circumstances.
