AB  - Objective: To interview healthcare providers who serve adolescent populations to learn their perspectives on the factors that influence the continuum of sexual and gender minority (SGM) youth's pregnancy expaeriences, including decision-making about sex, relationships, and pregnancy.Methods: As part of the SexuaL Orientation, Gender Identity, and Pregnancy Experiences (SLOPE) Study, semi structured interviews were conducted with 10 U.S.-based healthcare providers who had experience providing care for both SGM youth and pregnant youth. Interview questions examined providers' experiences caring for this population, including their perceptions of the risk and protective factors influencing SGM youth's pregnancy prevention, avoidance, and decision-making processes. Audio-recorded interview data were analyzed using immersion/crystallization and thematic analysis methods.Results: Three themes were identified from the healthcare providers' transcripts1) Cultural norms about adolescent pregnancy and sexuality, 2) Interpersonal relationships and family support, 3) Sex education, sexual and reproductive healthcare access, and sexual health equity.Conclusion: In conjunction with sexual health education and healthcare access, healthcare providers described many social contexts-like peers, family, and communities-that interact with each other and with adolescent development to shape pre-conception practices and pregnancy decision-making processes. Future research, practice, and sexual health messaging about adolescent pregnancy would benefit from acknowledging the complex interplay among social identities and positions, structural prejudice, and the nuanced diversity in community and interpersonal factors-including those in sexual healthcare settings, like provider-patient communication and sex education delivery-that shape SGM youth's dating and sexuality experiences.

AB  - Background: Studies demonstrate that many clinician populations have poor knowledge of and harbor negative attitudes towards intrauterine devices (IUDs). We set out to assess the impact of the clinical clerkship in obstetrics and gynecology on medical student IUD knowledge and attitudes.
   Study Design: In this prospective cohort study, students at seven diverse US medical schools were surveyed at the start and completion of their obstetrics and gynecology clinical clerkships regarding IUD exposure, knowledge and attitudes. Subject responses were compared pre-and postclerkship.
   Results: One hundred six students returned completed paired surveys (response rate 82%). The preclerkship mean knowledge percent correct (54%, SD 17%) increased significantly at postclerkship assessment (72%, SD 18%) (p<.0001). The mean attitudes score also increased significantly from pre- (34%, SD 31%) to postclerkship (59%, SD 26%) (p<.0001).
   Conclusions: US medical student IUD knowledge and attitudes are significantly improved through the obstetrics and gynecology clerkship. However, significant gaps in knowledge persist postclerkship. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: A supervisor may tell graduate trainees with obvious disabilities to disclose the disability to potential clients. Legal and ethical guidelines only partially address whether this requirement is permissible. Here we examine such disclosures from several vantage points. Background: Professional judgments guide supervisors in deciding whether to request that a trainee disclose a disability. The law provides little guidance to supervisors in making this decision. Instead, professional ethics and beliefs about disability drive decisions, and these beliefs may be prejudicial. Method: In this article, we examine whether it is good practice for a supervisor in a practicum or internship to require a trainee with an obvious disability to disclose the disability to potential clients before the first meeting so that the client has freedom to request a different therapist. We use this situation to examine the pertinent legal standards; ethical guidelines; and clinical, professional, and social justice issues. Conclusion: The requirement of disclosure may not be in the best interests of the client and has deleterious repercussions for trainees with disabilities, their peers, and the profession. Unless addressed without prejudice, differential treatment becomes discriminatory and is an obstacle to successful completion of professional education by trainees with obvious disabilities.

AB  - Purpose Emotions form an important part of stereotyping and prejudice, but little is known about how intergroup emotions are associated with anti-fat prejudice. This study examined the relation between negative intergroup emotions (disgust, contempt, and anger) and the stereotypes of obese people.
   Method A community sample (n = 380) and an undergraduate sample (n = 96) rated obese people on common obesity stereotypes (e. g., lazy, sloppy), and also indicated the extent to which they felt disgust, contempt, and anger toward obese people.
   Results In both samples, participants reported feeling more disgust and contempt than anger toward obese people. Furthermore, regression analyses indicated that disgust was a significant positive predictor of obesity stereotypes, but contempt and anger were not.
   Conclusion Overall, these findings provide further evidence that disgust plays an important role in prejudice toward obese people.

AB  - This study aims to determine the prevalence and causes of childhood vaccine and measles vaccine hesitancy and refusal among healthcare students in Turkey. The pool of this cross-sectional study, which included 718 students, was made up of healthcare students from the Faculty of Health Sciences at Balikesir University (N = 960). It was determined that 10% of students surveyed were hesitant regarding childhood vaccines, while 11.8% were hesitant with regard to the measles vaccine, specifically. Many of the participants held the belief that chronic idiopathic diseases such as multiple sclerosis and autism are related to vaccines; they also believed that vaccines should not be mandatory. More alarming than this, however, was that in response to a question regarding the measles vaccine, many of the students responded that "I would not have my child vaccinated with the vaccines administered by the Ministry of Health if I had a child." The findings revealed, overall, that the rates of childhood vaccine hesitancy and measles vaccine hesitancy are high among the healthcare students who were surveyed and that a high number of healthcare students hold negative attitudes that are related to rates of vaccine hesitancy.

AB  - For many years Northern Ireland has been a divided society where members of the two main religious groups, Catholics and Protestants, have limited opportunities to interact due to segregation in their social lives. Attempts have been made to encourage religious mixing through integration in schools, housing, and workplaces predicated on the theory that bringing people together can improve community relations and remove prejudices - known as the 'contact hypothesis'. However, little is known about those who enter into mixed-religion partnerships often against the wishes of their families and communities. This paper examines the characteristics and attitudes of mixed-religion couples and suggests that they differ in their socio-demographic characteristics and in their attitudes from those who marry within their own religion. These findings add to the weight of evidence from other countries in conflict suggesting that intermarriage has a role to play in contributing to less sectarian views and improved community relations.

AB  - Dispositional attitudes are an individual difference in the tendency to form positive versus negative attitudes. As positive (negative) attitudes promote active (inactive) responses to stimuli, we predicted that dispositional attitudes would be positively correlated with patterns of general action. In Study 1, participants reported all activities they engaged in during a 1-week period using a structured time use survey. Dispositional attitudes were positively correlated with the number of unique behaviors participants engaged in and with the total number of behaviors reported for the entire week. Study 2 replicated Study 1 using a free response time use survey. Overall, the results demonstrated that dispositional attitudes predict general action, such that the tendency to form positive (negative) attitudes predicts the tendency to engage in many (few) behaviors in daily life. This pattern occurred for both low effort and high effort behaviors. Implications for understanding activity patterns are discussed.

AB  - In South Africa, older people have become the primary caregivers of children and grandchildren infected or affected by HIV and AIDS. This study explores the determinants of the perceived ability to care for children and grandchildren in the domains of providing nursing care, communicating with ( grand) children, generating income and to relax. Structured one-on-one interviews were conducted among 409 isiXhosa speaking older people in two sites in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Results showed that perceived ability among older people to provide nursing care was primarily dependent on the level of knowledge on accessing grants and personal norm towards providing care. Perceived ability to communicate effectively with children and grandchildren was most strongly predicted by a positive attitude towards communication and perceived ability to provide income was influenced by a more negative attitude towards people living with HIV or AIDS. Perceived ability to relax was dependent on more negative attitudes towards communication, lower perceived responsibility to provide income and a higher perceived behaviour control over providing nursing care. The findings of this study add relevant information to understanding the psychosocial context in which older people provide HIV and AIDS related care and support the development of targeted programmes to assist older people in their role as caregiver.

AB  - According to social identity theory, group members sometimes react to threats to their group's distinctiveness by asserting the distinctiveness of their group. In four studies (n=261) we tested the hypothesis that heterosexual men with a greater propensity to be threatened by homosexuality would react to egalitarian norms by endorsing biological theories of sexuality. Heterosexual men, but not women, with narrow prototypes of their gender in-group endorsed biological theories the most (Study 1). Heterosexual men with higher gender self-esteem, with heterosexist attitudes, who endorsed traditional gender roles, and with narrow prototypes of their gender in-group, endorsed the biological theories more when egalitarian norms rather than anti-egalitarian norms (Studies 2 and 3) or pro-minority ideologies that emphasized group differences (Study 4) were made salient. These findings show group-level reactive distinctiveness among members of a high-status group in a context of threat to the unique privileges that they once enjoyed.

AB  - Counter-empathy significantly affects people's social lives. Previous evidence indicates that the degree of counter-empathy can be either strong or weak. Strong counter-empathy easily occurs when empathizers are prejudiced against the targets of empathy (e.g. prejudice against outgroup members) and activates brain regions that are opposite to those activated by empathy. Weak counter-empathy may have different neural processing paths from strong ones, but its underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear. In this work, we used an unfair distribution paradigm, which can reduce participants' prejudice against persons empathized with, and functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the neural mechanisms underlying counter-empathy. Here, empathy and counter-empathy shared a common neural mechanism, induced by unfair distribution, in the right middle temporal gyrus. Counter-empathy activated distinct brain regions that differed from those of empathic responses in different situations. The functions of these brain regions, which included the middle frontal, middle temporal and left medial superior gyri, were similar and mostly related to emotional regulation and cognitive processing. Here, we propose a process model of counter-empathy, involving two processing paths according to whether or not prejudice exists. This study has theoretical significance and broadens our understanding of the cognitive neural mechanisms underlying empathy and counter-empathy.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to identify the essential needs of pregnant women and new mothers who were using crack that could help them to build a drug-free life. Methods: This case study with a qualitative approach was carried out with three pregnant women and two new mothers who were crack users. Data were collected by semi-structured interviews between October and December 2015. Results: Four categories appeared: "The need for protecting the child", "The need for family support", "The need for a trust relationship with professionals", and "Spiritual needs". Conclusions: Rebuilding a drug-free way of living is a collective undertaking involving the family not just as a resource, but also as an object of care. Professionals need to rethink their values and prejudices. Furthermore, governments must take this responsibility because their children will suffer if these women do not attend public health care services.

AB  - In 2 meta-analyses, we examined the relationship between perceived discrimination and psychological well-being and tested a number of moderators of that relationship. In Meta-Analysis 1 (328 independent effect sizes, N = 144,246), we examined correlational data measuring both perceived discrimination and psychological well-being (e. g., self-esteem, depression, anxiety, psychological distress, life satisfaction). Using a random-effects model, the mean weighted effect size was significantly negative, indicating harm (r = -.23). Effect sizes were larger for disadvantaged groups (r = -.24) compared to advantaged groups (r = -.10), larger for children compared to adults, larger for perceptions of personal discrimination compared to group discrimination, and weaker for racism and sexism compared to other stigmas. The negative relationship was significant across different operationalizations of well-being but was somewhat weaker for positive outcomes (e. g., self-esteem, positive affect) than for negative outcomes (e. g., depression, anxiety, negative affect). Importantly, the effect size was significantly negative even in longitudinal studies that controlled for prior levels of well-being (r = -.15). In Meta-Analysis 2 (54 independent effect sizes, N = 2,640), we examined experimental data from studies manipulating perceptions of discrimination and measuring well-being. We found that the effect of discrimination on well-being was significantly negative for studies that manipulated general perceptions of discrimination (d = -.25), but effects did not differ from 0 when attributions to discrimination for a specific negative event were compared to personal attributions (d = .06). Overall, results support the idea that the pervasiveness of perceived discrimination is fundamental to its harmful effects on psychological well-being.

AB  - Language teachers ought to give their students a sound grounding in what is known as the five C's-communication, communities, cultures, connections, and comparisons-in addition to the classic four basic language skills. This study examines how first-year Turkish students currently enrolled in a culture course at Giresun University view culture-focused courses, and how much cultural training they had received (if any) in high school prior to entering university. This study is qualitative in nature, and provides information by using multiple sources of data. The fact of the matter is that their high school teachers focused more on grammar and avoided culture due to the constraints of both time and of an exam-oriented education system. Regarding the benefits, the course has pushed them to examine the relationship between language and culture, offered a reason to study the target language, and made the learning process real. It takes patience and effort in order to convince youth of the necessity of languages, as well as to make them better aware of, and to dispel their prejudices towards other cultures. The study also provides recommended practices that can encourage educators to implement during foreign language instruction.

AB  - The Hispanic population is now the largest and fastest growing minority in the United States, so it is not surprising that ethnic threat linked to Hispanics has been associated with harsher crime control. While minority threat research has found that individuals who associate blacks with crime are more likely to support harsh criminal policies, the possibility that this relationship exists for those who typify Hispanics as criminal has yet to be examined. Using a national random sample, this study is the first to use HLM to find that perceptions of Hispanics as criminals do increase support for punitive crime control measures, controlling for various individual and state influences. Moderated and contextual analyses indicate this relationship is most applicable for individuals who are less apt to typify criminals as black, less prejudiced, less fearful of victimization, politically liberal or moderate, not parents, and living in states with relatively fewer Latin American immigrants.

AB  - Traditional students are often introduced to unfamiliar subcultures for the first time on the college campus. Recent high school graduates find themselves transitioning from an atmosphere in which homophobia is likely to be tolerated and possibly even expected to an educational setting in which diversity is promoted. Research shows that the college years are influential in the re-socialization of core values, yet very little work focuses on the ideological shifts that may take place in attitudes toward the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered (LGBT) population. The research presented in this study includes a modified version of LaMar and Kite's Component Measure, which has been broken down into 6 distinctive components of tolerance. In addition to examining religion, gender, and racefactors that have been correlated in past research with differing levels of tolerance toward the LGBT communitythis study adds politics, sexual orientation, academic class standing, and college of majorvariables that have received little or no attention in this literature. Higher levels of LGBT tolerance are consistently observed across the indexes among women, more liberal Christian traditions, non-Christian faiths, the non-religious, and those who self-identify as LGBT. The distinctive contribution of this study is that students in the College of Arts and Sciences and students further along in their college careers are also more tolerant. Based on these findings, recommendations are made for inter-college curriculum changes that integrate students in all disciplines and students of all classifications.

AB  - Purpose/Objective: The stereotype content model is a unifying theory of the makeup of stereotypes and their consequences on emotions and behaviors. There is a need to study this theory from the perspectives of those most affected by them-targets of stereotypes. Research Method/Design: Blind adults (n = 264) living in the United States completed the stereotype content measure asking participants to rate the extent to which they believed members of wider society held certain beliefs about Blind persons. Results: Confirmatory factor analyses showed good fit for the four-factor model of stereotype content: warmth, competence, status, and competition. Conclusions: This study confirms the stereotype content model and begins to extend the stereotype content model to be inclusive of the perspectives of those who are the targets of stereotypes.
   Impact and Implications Understanding the content of stereotypes has significant implications for promoting marginalized populations in education, employment, and health. This research is the first to confirm the Stereotype Content Model from the perspectives of Blind Americans. By doing so, this study extends the model to include the perspectives of those who are targets of stereotypes.

AB  - Impacts of Internet use on political information seeking and subsequent processes have been subject to much debate. A 2-session online field study presented online search results on political topics to examine selective exposure and its attitudinal impacts. Session 1 captured attitudes, including their accessibility. Session 2 tracked what online search results participants selected and how long they read them; participants then reported attitudes again. The study represented a 4x8x2x2 within-subjects design: 4 topics, 8 browsing intervals each, with articles presenting opposing stances, with low versus high source credibility. Attitude-consistent messages and messages from high-credibility sources were preferred. Exposure to attitude-consistent search results increased attitude accessibility and reinforced attitudes, whereas exposure to attitude-discrepant content had opposite effects, regardless of messages' source credibility.

AB  - Structured interviews with 227 social workers in Turkey categorized ethical problems in the work place. An inductive content analysis categorized nine themes (dual relationships, threats by clients, worker bias leading to prejudice, child custody issues, fraudulent use of state funds, procedural tensions, coercion by authorities, confidentiality, and taking people into state care) that required problem-solving strategies on the part of the social workers. The results indicated that when confronted with ethical situations the path for deliberation was not always clear, many decisions were made in consultation, whereas others were made independently. Future recommendations include advocating for education and training that utilizes ethical decision-making principles when problem-solving, as well as, stressing the importance of clear guidelines for seeking and utilizing supportive consultation.

AB  - Social movements pushing for social change are often met with reactionary counter-movements that defend the status quo. The present research examined this interplay by focusing on the role of racial majority group members claiming collective psychological ownership. We examined collective ownership that stems from being native to the land and from being founders of the nation. Study 1 found that in Malaysia, the Malay majority group endorsed more native ownership than Chinese and Indian minorities, which in turn predicted greater threat in response to protests demanding electoral reforms and subsequently greater support for a reactionary pro-government movement. Situated in the United States, Study 2 found that the more that White Americans endorsed founder ownership beliefs, the more they reported negative attitudes towards the Black Lives Matter protests, which in turn predicted more support for White nationalistic counter-protests. This effect was stronger among White people compared to people of colour. Study 3 examined both founder and native ownership in Australia. Founder (but not native) ownership beliefs predicted more negative attitudes towards Invasion Day protests, which subsequently predicted more support for counter-protests defending Australia Day celebrations. Implications of culture-specific beliefs about collective ownership for social movement research are discussed.

AB  - Recent research has established marked punitive attitudes against people sexually interested in children. These negative attitudes are even more pronounced when such sexual interest is labeled as pedophilia, but are attenuated to the extent that such sexual interest is perceived as beyond one's own control (unintentional). We explored these effects in more detail by separately manipulating the label (pedophiles vs. people with sexual interest in prepubescent children) and degree of intentionality (pedophilia or sexual desire as malleable vs. not malleable). Participants recruited via an online platform (N = 423) were randomly assigned to the experimental conditions and asked to rate degree of intentionality, dangerousness, deviance, and punitive attitudes toward people sexually interested in children. As expected, participants expressed stronger punitive attitudes when the label was present. The manipulation of intentionality, however, was not successful. Further analyses explored whether participants found the notion that sexual interest cannot be altered at will more credible than the opposite, particularly in presence of the pedophilia label. The results are discussed with regard to the significance of and potential intervention against the markedly strong public stigma against people with pedophilia.

AB  - Introduction: Dental care has remained as an unmet need for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs). Dental students are considered as future healthcare workforce and having beliefs which are discriminating may have negative attitudes towards providing care to these individuals (Azodo et al., 2010). The study aimed to assess the ethical beliefs and attitudes of dental students towards PLWHAs for providing care.
   Methods: It is a descriptive correlational and cross sectional study. Nine public and private dental schools in Malaysia participated in the study. Data was collected using a validated self-administered questionnaire.
   Results: A total of 481 dental students participated in this study, yielding response rate of 78%. Majority of the participants (74%) believed that patients' HIV status should be disclosed to patients' sexual partner without permission. Approximately 60% of the participants reported that rooms/beds of HIV patients should be clearly marked. Regarding patient disease status 28% of the students reported that it is appropriate to test a patient for HIV/AIDS without patient's permission. Only Fifty five percent of the students expressed the willingness to treat HIV patients and 49% reported to held fear of getting infected while treating patients with HIV/AIDS. Sixty four percent of the participants reported to be more comfortable giving care to non-HIV patients than HIV-positive patients.
   Conclusion: Dental students' ethical beliefs about HIV/AIDS were not consistent with the ethical principles as stated in the code of ethics and they held negative attitudes towards PLWHAs. Ethical beliefs were found to be a determinant that may influence future attitudes of these students towards individuals with HIV/AIDS when providing care. (C) 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Two experiments carried out in Spain and the Netherlands tested the joint effects of imagined contact and similarity with a narrative protagonist on attitudes and behavioral intentions related to stigmatized immigrants. We advance a concept of optimal reception condition: imagining a positive interaction with an immigrant before reading a testimonial of an immigrant who is similar to the native audience. The optimal reception condition induced greater identification and transportation than the reference condition, leading to more positive attitudes and a higher intention of intergroup contact. The findings are discussed in the context of research on narrative persuasion and prejudice reduction.

AB  - University campuses serve as second homes for students, teachers, administrators, and parents coming from diverse regions, religions, classes, castes, and different genders. Interaction and camaraderie between the major characters in the academe develop. The bonhomie that exists between the stakeholders of the academe has its own rules, rules that are marked by the interference of power. The one wielding more power by virtue of one's position, class, caste, or gender tries to dictate the terms of a particular relationship. Relations evolve as power relations, whereby a specific code of conduct regarding speech, behavior, thought, writing, love, and life is laid down for all-from administrators and professors to students and parents. This article studies how in a location as specific as Chennai University as described in Srividya Natarajan's No Onions Nor Garlic, the ideological prejudices and hierarchical divisions highlighted by the play of power affect the daily life of the academe and chart out the course of action for everyone, from professors, students, high caste, low caste to men and women, involved in power relations. On the basis of that, this article suggests power in general serves not only to suppress the powerless but is productive also, as countering power with power creates a proper kind of resistance that blurs the difference between the agent and the target of power in power relations.

AB  - Young people in Hong Kong are more likely than any other age group to come into contact with the justice system. Despite this, there is a paucity of research on youth attitudes toward lawyers. The aim of this study was to compare the understanding and perceptions of lawyers among three youth groups classified according to experience in instructing lawyers and varying degrees of delinquency young offenders (the only group who had experience of hiring lawyers), youth-at-risk and students (N = 1157), and to determine if perceptions of lawyers affect views on the legitimacy of the justice system. Students showed greater understanding about lawyers and more favorable perceptions of fairness in lawyer client interactions compared with young offenders and youth-at-risk. A better understanding of lawyers had a positive association with perceptions of fairness and a higher perception of fairness had a positive association with legitimacy of the justice system. Recommendations are also discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Negative affect associated with autobiographical events fades faster over time than positive affect. This Fading Affect Bias (FAB) has been established in the individual and interpersonal domains. Two studies tested the FAB in intergroup relations with Muslims (N= 76 White British non-Muslim) and opposite gender (N = 242 women and men) as target outgroups. The results indicated that the FAB exists in an intergroup context, for both ingroup and outgroup memories. Mediation analyses showed that intergroup contact is related to a lower fading of positive affect associated with the outgroup memory, through greater memory strength and a more positive outgroup member evaluation. The findings are important for understanding affect associated with intergroup memories and the buffering effect of positive contact.

AB  - Context. A coyote-caused human fatality in Cape Breton Highlands National Park of Canada (CBHNPC) occurred in 2009. Because CBHNPC is federally protected, rangers have a limited number of management options for dealing with human-coyote conflict. The park initiated the present study to understand the publics' acceptance of coyotes.
   Aims. This article examined relationships between each of four independent variables (respondent type (resident vs visitor), sex, age, education) and each of four dependent variables (knowledge, attitude, two emotions) related to coyotes in CBHNPC. Researchers have repeatedly suggested that demographics are related to cognitions and emotions toward wildlife. Managers can use demographic findings to target education campaigns to specific stakeholders.
   Methods. Survey data were obtained from (a) residents living around CBHNPC (n = 556, response rate = 70%), and (b) visitors hiking two popular trails in CBHNPC (n = 443, response rate = 60%).
   Key results. All four independent variables were related to knowledge. Visitors were more knowledgeable about coyotes than were residents. Females were more knowledgeable than were males. Younger respondents were more knowledgeable than were older individuals. All education categories differed from each other. Findings for the attitude construct were similar. Residents held negative attitudes toward coyotes, whereas visitors were slightly positive. Males and females both held negative attitudes. The youngest age category held a positive attitude, whereas the oldest group was the most negative. Respondents with a high-school degree had a negative attitude; those with a college degree held a positive attitude. For the first emotion concept, residents were more emotional than were visitors. Males were more emotional than were females, and high-school graduates were more emotional than were college graduates. For the second emotion, there were statistical differences between residents and visitors, as well as between males and females. However, age and education were not related to this scenario.
   Conclusions. Although there were statistical differences for 13 of 16 tests, over 80% of the effect sizes were minimal and there were interaction effects among the four demographic variables. Implications. Findings highlighted complexities managers should consider when designing communication strategies aimed at influencing stakeholders' knowledge of and attitudes and emotions toward wildlife.

AB  - Background: Most academicians in the nursing field are women, and they face many difficulties throughout the course of their careers for various reasons.
   Purpose: This study aims to determine the career difficulties faced by female academicians in the nursing field.
   Methods: This study is descriptive, sectional, and comparative. The study was conducted in cooperation with female academicians in the nursing field (n = 132) from 11 different nursing schools in Turkey's Eastern Anatolia Region providing undergraduate education in nursing. Data were collected using the Female Academicians' Career Obstacles Scale. Ethics committee and required official permissions were obtained from the relevant institutions. Data analysis was conducted in an electronic environment using SPSS for Windows 22.0 package software for statistics.
   Results: In terms of research outcomes, it was determined that themost significant obstacles reported by female academicians were "organizational culture and politics" (M = 43.92 T 12.64) and "playing multiple roles" (M = 31.35 T 10.15); the most insignificant obstacles were reported to be "organizational conditions" (M = 21.43 T 7.06) and "stereotypical prejudices" (M = 20.44 T 6.31). Other obstacles mentioned by the academicians were working as a research assistant with a bachelor's degree, being married with children, studying with young and inexperienced academicians, and serving as department head.
   Conclusions/Implications for Practice: Organizational culture and politics in particular should be reviewed at educational institutions fromthe perspective of career obstacles, and these principles should be rearranged so that they constitute a supportive work environment.

AB  - Tolerant discourse in the United States has responded to heightened stereotyping of Muslims as violent by countering that "not all Muslims are terrorists." This subtyping of Muslims-as some radical terrorists among mostly peaceful "moderates"-is meant to protect a positive image of the group but leaves the original negative stereotype unchanged. We predicted that such discourse may paradoxically increase people's support of anti-Muslim policies because the subtyping and its associated negative stereotypes justify hostile actions toward Muslims. In Study 1, subtyping predicted support for three anti-Muslim policies, but only among political moderates and conservatives. In Study 2, participants who were exposed to subtyping narratives expressed greater support for surveillance of Muslims in the United States. The effect of subtyping narrative exposure was stronger on support for hawkish anti-terror policy when participants' preexisting endorsement of subtyping was low. Irrespective of the well-meaning intentions of peaceful vs. radical subtyping, its expression can justify ongoing "War on Terror" policies. As the population of Muslims increases in North America, the intuition that most Muslims do not meet the negative stereotype may ironically reduce inclusion.

AB  - Immigrant flows to Spain have increased greatly in the last decade, but little is known about the composition and role of their personal support networks. Our research questions are: (1) Which factors are associated with ties between immigrants and 'Spaniards' (the more settled resident Spanish population), compared with immigrants and non-Spaniards (other immigrants)? (2) Do the support roles of Spaniards and non-Spaniards differ? We analyse personal network (ego-net) survey data. Multilevel logistic regression models are applied, in which the unit of analysis is the undirected tie between an immigrant (ego) and an alter and the dependent variable is whether this tie is to a Spaniard alter, as opposed to a non-Spaniard. We determine the characteristics that are most strongly associated with the probability of a tie between an immigrant and a Spaniard, compared with a non-Spaniard, and consider characteristics of the immigrants (ego), the alters, the relative characteristics of ego-alter, support roles, and local geographical factors. We find a tie to a Spaniard alter is more likely if the immigrant's country of birth is Portugal or Eastern Europe; if the alter is a work colleague or neighbour; if alter is older than ego. There is geographical variation in the probability of ties to Spaniards, partly explained by the local area presence of co-nationals from the same country of origin as the immigrant. A tie to a Spaniard alter is less likely for immigrants from North Africa (Maghreb); those with no previous contact with Spain; those who are not the first of their peer group/family to immigrate; if ego and alter both work in agriculture. Material help is more likely to be exchanged with a Spaniard alter. Non-Spaniard alters are more likely to exchange help with accommodation and information. 'Finding a job' is equally associated with Spaniard and non-Spaniard alters. A tentative conclusion is that some combinations of these characteristics, where a tie to a Spaniard is less likely, may be associated with higher levels of prejudice. Conversely, those characteristics that are positively associated with a tie to a Spaniard may indicate situations where integration of the immigrant population with Spaniards is successfully taking place, and where prejudices are lower, or non-existent. These findings may therefore be helpful for targeting resources to reduce such prejudices. The different types of support exchanged between immigrants and Spaniards and immigrants and non-Spaniards, may indicate current shortfalls in this process, as well as indicating where this support is successfully being exchanged.

AB  - Heterosexism contributes to an unsafe campus climate for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) college students. Intergroup dialogue courses about sexual orientation seek to build awareness, cross-group relationships, and commitment to social action to address anti-LGB prejudice and discrimination. Although dialogue courses are growing in popularity, few courses address sexual orientation. To advance knowledge of these dialogues, this qualitative study explores heterosexual students' motivations and expectations, challenges, and learning outcomes related to their participation in intergroup dialogue courses on sexual orientation. Core themes include desire to learn about the LGB community, concerns about offending classmates, anxiety around LGB stigma, conflict with classmates around controversial topics, affirming LGB people, and learning about heterosexism, privilege, and intersectionality of identity. Implications for intergroup dialogue pedagogy and research are discussed.

AB  - As the technology for ectogenesis continues to advance, the ethical implications of such developments should be thoroughly and proactively explored. The possibility of full ectogenesis remains hypothetical at present, and myriad concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of the technology must be evaluated and addressed, while pressing moral considerations should be fully deliberated. However, it is conceivable that the technology may become sufficiently well established in the future and that eventually full ectogenesis might be deemed ethically acceptable as a reproductive alternative to gestation within a human womb under certain circumstances. If the safety and efficacy of full ectogenesis are established, if ethical dilemmas are sufficiently well addressed, and if the technology is offered as a reproductive option to cisgender heterosexual individuals or couples desiring to become parents, there is a moral obligation grounded in social justice to ensure that full ectogenesis be made available to individuals or couples identifying as members of sexual- or gender-minority groups who likewise seek to pursue parenthood. We examine the history of access to current family-building options, including assisted reproductive technology, surrogacy and adoption, for these populations and conclude that in the absence of robust empirical evidence suggesting an increased risk of harm to children of individuals and couples who identify as members of sexual- or gender-minority groups, equitable access to ectogenesis as a pathway to parenthood for sexual and gender minorities must be assured as a matter of reproductive justice.

AB  - Objectives Young people in Tanzania are known to access reproductive health services from a range of close-to-community providers outside formal health settings such as drug stores, village AIDS committees, traditional healers and traditional birth attendants (TBAs). However, questions remain about the quality of services such agents provide. This study investigated their capacity to provide adolescent reproductive health (ARH) services and explored their readiness and ability to integrate with the mainstream health sector through community referral interventions.
   Methods Thirty-five focus group discussions exploring close-to-community provider experiences and attitudes to ARH service provision were carried out in two districts in Northern Tanzania. Discussions were conducted in Kiswahili, digitally recorded, verbatim-transcribed, translated and back-translated from Swahili to English. A thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo 9.
   Results The major close-to-community cadres providing reproductive health services were drug stores, traditional healers, TBAs and village health workers. They reported being the first port of call for adolescents seeking reproductive health services, but their knowledge of ARH needs was poor. They had negative attitudes to, and lacked the necessary resources for, the provision of such services for adolescents. Some were particularly unwilling to provide condom services and were prejudiced against adolescents using them. There was poor integration between the close-to-community providers and the formal health sector, further limiting their ability to provide adequate services.
   Conclusions Although close-to-community providers are considered a key resource in the community, most have limited capacity to provide ARH services. Without capacity-building investments such as training and cooperation with the mainstream health sector, their contribution to positive reproductive health outcomes is limited, or could indeed lead to adverse outcomes.

AB  - Purpose: It is extremely important for teachers to have the psychological capital to enhance their performance outputs in educational organizations. Teachers having psychological capital will positively influence all the members of the school. This kind of teacher will develop and support colleagues' and students' positive attitudes attitudes such as competence, hope, motivation, and productivity. The purpose of this research is to determine the relationship between psychological capital and stress, anxiety, burnout, job satisfaction, and job involvement. Research Methods: The sample of this study consists of 335 teachers in 27 schools that were selected randomly from the schools at Hatay's Kinkhan district in the 2014-2015 academic year. The Psychological Capital Scale, Stress Scale, Anxiety Scale, Burnout Scale, Job Satisfaction Scale, and Job Involvement Scale were used to collect the data. Findings: As teachers' psychological capitals increase, their stress levels decrease. Psychological capital has a negative impact on anxiety levels of teachers through the full mediation effect of stress. Psychological capital negatively affects teachers' burnout levels through the partial mediation effects of stress and anxiety. Psychological capital has a positive effect on teachers' job satisfaction through the partial mediation effects of stress, anxiety, and burnout. Psychological capital has a positive effect on the job involvement levels of teachers through the partial mediation effects of stress, anxiety, burnout, and job satisfaction. Implications for Research and Practice: It is essential for school administrators to contribute to the development and strengthening of teachers' psychological capital if they wish for teachers to feel negative attitudes less frequently and to develop more positive attitudes at work.

AB  - In the Western world, for deaf and hard-of-hearing children, hearing aids or cochlear implants are available to provide access to sound, with the overall goal of increasing their wellbeing. If and how this goal is achieved becomes increasingly multifarious when these children reach adolescence and young adulthood and start to participate in society in other ways. An approach to wellbeing that includes personal differences and the relative advantages and disadvantages that people have, is the capability approach, as developed by Nobel Prize laureate Amartya Sen. Capability is the set of real opportunities people have to do and be things they have reason to value. We interviewed 59 young people, aged 13 through 25, with cochlear implants (37) or hearing aids (22) to capture their capability. We found that their hearing devices enabled them to actively participate in a predominantly hearing society, with few differences between cochlear implant and hearing aid recipients. They did, however, report challenges associated with prejudices and expectations, and with feeling poorly understood, all of which appeared to impact their capability. Through the lens of capability, alleged differences between hearing aid and cochlear implant recipients began to fade. We discuss the implications for initiatives focused on the long-term support young recipients of hearing devices to meet their specific requirements over time.

AB  - Purpose: Self-efficacy belief procures teachers to root for each other's development in some issues such as ameliorating new methods to conduct much more effective teaching. A school with a high level of self-efficacy teachers makes a great contribution in order to corroborate self-efficacy perceptions of students. When examining it on a model with many attitudinal variables, self-efficacy belief, an important concept in terms of education quality, has been deemed significant so as to propound the effects of self-efficacy more clearly. This study aimed to determine the relationship between self-efficacy and job satisfaction, organizational commitment, motivation and job involvement.
   Research Method: 321 teachers from 33 schools that were selected randomly with the cluster sampling method from the middle schools in the province of Hatay city center in the 2017-2018 academic year have composed the sampling of this study.
   Findings: The more teachers' self-efficacy beliefs increased, the more their job satisfaction, organizational commitment, motivation and job involvement increased. Both job satisfaction and organizational commitment partially mediated the relationship between teachers' sense of self-efficacy and motivation. Self-efficacy beliefs positively affected teachers' job involvement through the full mediation effect of job satisfaction and motivation Organizational commitment and motivation fully mediated the relationship between teachers' self-efficacy and job involvement.
   Implications for Research and Practice:It is crucial for school administrators to contribute to amend and strengthen self-efficacy perceptions of teachers if they hope teachers to take positive attitudes towards their work much more frequently and to take the edge off negative attitudes.

AB  - Dialectal variations are present in all languages, originating from cultural, geographic and socioeconomic diversity. This study investigates speech-language pathologists' (SLPs) linguistic bias towards non-standard language forms and dialects, and factors that may impact on these attitudes. Language attitude studies reveal that negative attitudes towards variation can lead to bias against speakers of non-standard dialects. If SLPs hold linguistic bias towards speakers of non-standard dialects, this has the potential to impact upon their clinical judgement of difference vs. disorder and lead to inequality of service provision. A total of 129 Australian SLPs completed an online survey, which involved ranking 28 attitudinal statements regarding language variation on a 5-point scale from strongly disagree to strongly agree. The survey data were analysed using a factor analysis in SPSS to identify latent factors that identified attitudes towards non-standard dialects followed by inferential analyses to investigate how attitudes were related to the demographic data of participants. Results identified five key factors from the survey, these were (1) Use of non-standard English, (2) Language purity, (3) Diversity in form, (4) Social acceptability, and (5) Prescriptive language rules. SLPs held generally positive attitudes towards the use of non-standard forms and the socially determined acceptability of language. SLPs were more neutral in their attitudes towards diversity in form and the need for prescriptive rules and generally held negative views towards language purity (e.g., the use of "youse" as a plural form of you). A significantly positive association was found between professional development (PD) on cultural and linguistic diversity and positive attitudes towards Factors 1 and 3. Years of practice were significantly related to Factor 2, with less experienced SLPs holding more negative views relating to language purity. While many SLPs identify the value of language variation and its reflection of a person's cultural and linguistic diversity, negative attitudes towards non-standard forms and variation in school and occupational settings have the potential to negatively impact differential diagnosis, goal setting and the delivery of culturally responsive speech-language pathology services to speakers of non-standard dialects.

AB  - Historians of British antisemitism consider Arnold White (publicist, author, journalist, campaigner) a key exponent of racially orientated anti-Jewish sentiment in the United Kingdom in the period before the First World War. These attitudes were repeatedly demonstrated by his vehement opposition to East European Jewish immigration and underscored by a large literary output on the topic. In the late 1880s, White frequently clashed with leading Anglo-Jewish figures on immigration yet, in general terms, there was often difficulty in assigning him definitively to the antisemitic camp. This was the result of his work for Baron Maurice de Hirsch and the Jewish Colonization Association, which led to a more flattering interpretation of White's contribution to solving the so-called Jewish question. Indeed, at times, he was actually regarded as a friend of the Jews. Johnson's study examines the problems Anglo-Jewish society had in analysing and negotiating the White world-view. For instance, an appreciation in the Jewish Chronicle described him as a veritable Janus at the gates of Jewry, essentially a two-faced troublemaker whose true attitude was not easy to determine. For almost three decades, the question of whether White was friend or foe was asked by various individuals and publications. Ultimately, Johnson considers what White and his Anglo-Jewish encounters reveal about the nature of the Jewish-Gentile relationship and how antisemitic ideology was confronted in Britain in the period before the outbreak of the First World War.

AB  - Through the lens of stereotyping and stigma, this article examines discrimination and prejudice toward homeless families from the perspective of social service providers. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with practitioners. A critical social work practice perspective is used to provide a framework for understanding how social worker knowledge about discrimination and prejudice informs the ways in which the workers engage with clients, build capacities, and advocate for clients in an anti-oppressive manner. The themes found in this study include: a) providers' awareness of bias, stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination; b) providers' use of a range of strategies to work with people experiencing homelessness; c) providers' ideas about strategies that organizations can implement for service provision; and) providers' belief that additional advocacy and policy are needed in relationship to people experiencing homelessness.

AB  - This research examined how familiarity with a brand influences how negative publicity related to a celebrity endorser is perceived. Specifically, the current research determined if familiarity with event and sponsor brands may temper any negative consequences of being linked with negative celebrity endorser publicity. Two studies were conducted to investigate this aim. Study 1 (n = 136) used unfamiliar brands and indicated attitudes towards the selected sponsor and the event brands were significantly reduced after negative publicity surrounding an associated celebrity endorser emerged. In contrast, individuals not exposed to negative publicity did not report reduced attitude scores. Study 2 (n = 272) used unfamiliar and familiar brands and found that negative publicity surrounding celebrity endorsers has the capacity to weaken attitudes towards associated event and sponsor brands. However, any negative impact was tempered by an individual's familiarity with the respective brand, indicating brand familiarity has a moderating effect on brand attitudes within the sports marketplace. This research furthers understandings related to sport sponsorship theory by assessing the role of brand familiarity in tempering information transference. Additionally, the paper provides insights to the events category which has not been researched previously. Brand managers can use this information to develop proactive and reactive strategies to employ to protect their brands when celebrity endorsers attract negative publicity.

AB  - A heterosexist campus climate can increase risk for mental health problems for sexual minority students; however, the relationship between campus climate for sexual minorities and academic outcomes remains understudied. Using a sample of sexual minority respondents extracted from a campus climate survey conducted at a large university in the Midwest, we examine relationships between multiple dimensions of psychological and experiential campus climate for sexual minorities with academic integration (academic disengagement, grade-point average [GPA]) and social integration (institutional satisfaction, acceptance on campus). We also investigate the protective role of engagement with informal academic and peer-group systems. Findings suggest campus climate affects sexual minority students' integration. In multivariate analyses, perceptions of whether lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people could be open about their sexual identity was positively associated with acceptance on campus; personal heterosexist harassment was positively associated with academic disengagement and negatively with GPA. Students' informal academic integration (instructor relations) and informal social integration (LGB friends) demonstrated influential main effects but did not moderate any of the climate-outcome relationships. Researchers should further explore the relationships between climate and academic outcomes among sexual minority students, both collectively and among specific sub-groups, and address the role of other protective factors.

AB  - Introduction Prejudice toward sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals plays a significant role in SGM youth healthcare. This study examines relations between psychosocial predictors (spirituality, religiosity, SGM education, experience with SGM individuals) and SGM moral condemnation among three distinct samples. Methods This study utilized online questionnaires to assess moral condemnation toward SGM individuals, religiosity, spirituality, SGM experience, and education/training about SGM individuals. The questionnaires were distributed to a college sample, community sample, and pediatric healthcare provider sample. Data were collected in years 2016-2019. Results Religiosity positively predicted moral condemnation in all three samples. Spirituality positively predicted moral condemnation in the community and college samples, but not the provider sample. Education about SGM individuals, previous experience with SGM individuals, having a close SGM friend/family member, and self-reporting previous personal discrimination experiences, as a set, significantly explained additional variance in SGM moral condemnation within the community and college sample, but not within the healthcare provider sample. Conclusion This study lays groundwork for innovative research to further improve pediatric SGM healthcare and to increase the extent to which SGM youth disclose and discuss specific healthcare risks with their medical providers. Policy Implications There is a significant need for social policy focused on decreasing SGM stigmatization and discrimination within the healthcare environment.

AB  - Ageism, or the discriminative attitudes toward specific age groups, often older adults, is a common prejudice with many negative consequences. This study explored the relationships between personality, fears of death and dying, and subscales of ageism (i.e., Avoidance, Discrimination, and Antilocution). Participants (N = 436) completed measures of personality, death and dying fears, and ageism. Multiple linear regressions showed that agreeableness, openness, and fearing others' death were negatively associated with ageism, whereas fearing the dying process of others was positively associated with ageism. This study demonstrates the distinct effects of personality and fears of death and dying on ageism.

AB  - Background: Studies on hospital violence have emphasized the importance of staff-service recipient interaction in leading to violent incidents. These incidents are the extreme result of service recipients' frustration and anger in their interaction with staff.
   The aim of this study was to analyze factors related to negative experiences of emergency department (ED) patients and accompanying persons in Israeli hospitals.
   Methods: Structured interviews with 692 participants in seven major general Israeli hospitals: 322 patients and 370 accompanying persons.
   Results: Negative feelings while in the ED were reported by 23.6% of patients and 20.5% of accompanying persons. Eight aggregate variables relating to staff-patients/accompanying persons interaction were identified: 1. General attitudes of staff and quality of ED experience; 2. Staff attitudes towards patients; 3. Staff attitudes towards accompanying persons; 4. Waiting; 5. Quality of perceived medical care; 6. Information provided to patients and accompanying persons; 7. Information provided to patients, as reported by accompanying persons; and 8. Severity of medical problem. Among patients, the only significant aggregate variable related to anger and frustration was perceived quality of care. Among accompanying persons, the three significant contributors to negative feelings were: 1. Staff's general attitudes; 2. Attitudes towards patients; and 3. Severity of patients' medical problem. Analysis of specific items within the variables revealed that, whereas patients' negative feelings were related to nurses' perceived negative attitudes those of accompanying persons were related to the doctors' perceived negative attitudes. In addition, patients' negative feelings were related to low severity of medical problem, whereas accompanying persons' negative feelings were related to patients' low severity of pain.
   Conclusions: The study reveals the importance of including both patients and accompanying persons in the analysis of staff-service recipient interactions in EDs. The results are discussed in terms of patients' and accompanying persons' different perspectives. Three practical implications of the results are put forward, aiming at reducing patients/accompanying persons-staff frictions in the EDs, thus decreasing the potential of violent outbursts against ED staff: (1) implementing a framework based on "patient-centeredness" for the restoration of patient's sense of agency and empowerment; (2) broadening the scope of laws concerning patient's rights to include their families and other accompanying persons; and (3) implementing courses on interpersonal and human service skills, as well as teaching skills of handling emotional stressors experienced by both the staff and service recipients.

AB  - The number of male employees who take paternity leave in Japan has been low in past decades. However, the majority of male employees actually wish to take paternity leave if they were to have a child. Previous studies have demonstrated that the organizational climate in workplaces is the major determinant of male employees" use of family-friendly policies, because males are often stigmatized and fear receiving negative evaluation from others. While such normative pressure might be derived from prevailing social practices relevant to people's expectation of social roles (e.g., "Men make houses, women make homes"), these social practices are often perpetuated even after the majority of group members have ceased to support them. The perpetuation of this unpopular norm could be caused by the social psychological phenomenon of pluralistic ignorance. While researches have explored people's beliefs about gender roles from various perspectives, profound understanding of these beliefs regarding gender role norms, and the accuracy of others beliefs remains to be attained. The current research examined the association between pluralistic ignorance and the perpetually low rates of taking paternity leave in Japan. Specifically, Study 1 (n = 299) examined Japanese male employees' (ages ranging from the 20n to the 40 s) attitudes toward paternity leave and to estimate attitudes of other men of the same age, as well as behavioral intentions (i.e., desire and willingness) to take paternity leave if they had a child in the future. The results demonstrated that male employees overestimated other men's negative attitudes toward paternity leave. Moreover, those who had positive attitudes toward taking leave and attributed negative attitudes to others were less willing to take paternity leave than were those who had positive attitudes and believed others shared those attitudes, although there was no significant difference between their desires to take paternity leave. Study 2 (n = 425) replicated these results and further indicated that they could not be explained by the participants' needs to be socially desirable. Together, our findings suggest that pluralistic ignorance occurs in the context of taking paternity leave in Japanese men, and this leads to the low use of available paternity leave.

AB  - Women with dependent children have repeatedly been shown to be more likely to be self-employed than other women. The mumpreneurship thesis explains this motherhood effect as a preference-based strategy to meet both good worker and good mother norms. The disadvantaged worker thesis argues that mothers in weak labour market positions are pushed into self-employment because of work-family conflict. Exploring patterns of motherhood effects across 23 high- and middle-income countries, I argue that the mumpreneurship and disadvantaged worker theses should not be considered as conflicting hypotheses, but rather as addressing separate social position groups. I identify four clusters of countries where either one, both or neither of the two hypotheses can be confirmed. Country-level analyses indicate that more negative attitudes towards housewives are associated with larger motherhood premiums for women in high social positions, whereas higher enrolment and smaller classes in pre-primary education increase the motherhood premium for all groups.

AB  - This article explores racial exclusion, bias, and prejudice in the context of same-sex mobile dating, focusing on the experiences of a group of Australian-based Chinese queer women. Semi-structured in-depth interviews and participant observation were used to examine participants' racialized experiences. The findings indicate that Western dating apps, such as Tinder, Bumble, and HER, served as crucial channels of these women's interracial and intercultural encounters while living in Australia. However, they largely perceived these apps, and HER in particular, as White-dominated and ill-suited to their dating practices, thus reinforcing their sense of exclusion and ostracism. Although the participants frequently encountered subtle prejudice on dating apps, they experienced more blatant and aggressive forms of racism triggered by the COVID-19 outbreak. Multiple factors, including their language capability, the COVID-19 pandemic, and their racial, ethnic, and diasporic identities, played an intersectional role in these women's racialized experiences. Correspondingly, the participants developed diverse interpretations of and responses to their racialized experiences. This study reveals how the anti-Asian racism in the global West permeates the realm of queer women in the context of mobile dating. It contributes to understanding the digital dating practices and racialized experiences of queer women and the broader Chinese diaspora.

AB  - Background: Previous research has shown that young adults are more hesitant/resistant to COVID-19 vac-cine uptake than older age groups, although the factors underlying this tendency are still under debate. The current study aimed to identify the sociodemographic and psychological correlates of vaccine hesitancy and resistance among young adults (18-40 years) during the nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Italy, the first country after China being hit by the pandemic and which suffered a large number of fatal-ities.Methods: This is a cross-sectional, web-based study conducted in Italy using an ISO-certified international survey company (respondi.com). Data were collected on 1200 participants in June 2021. Results: Vaccine hesitancy/resistance was found for 25% of the sample. In multinomial logistic regression (N = 1159), being aged 30-40 years, residing in northern Italy, having lower educational and income level, being unemployed, and not knowing any friends/relatives diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with higher odds of hesitancy or resistance. In multivariate analysis of variance (N =1177), both vaccine hesi-tant and resistant young adults perceived significantly less social support from friends and family than vaccine accepting ones. Resistant individuals reported significantly higher levels of conspiracy theories and negative attitudes toward vaccines than their accepting and hesitant counterparts. Moreover, resis-tant individuals reported significantly lower levels of attachment to country and perceptions of a just gov-ernment compared to accepting ones, with hesitant young adults scoring in between.Conclusions: Our findings support the idea that young adults with a hesitant (vs. resistant) attitude show a more nuanced and less extreme psychological profile. Public health messaging should capitalize on social media to provide accessible, transparent, and age-appropriate information concerning COVID-19 vaccine safety. Moreover, policy efforts improving the availability of social support systems are warranted to strengthen connectedness and foster trust in institutions amongst this particular segment of the population.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this article, I document a problematic ethnographic encounter that I experienced while conducting fieldwork in the neo-colonized space of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Through reflexivity, I describe how the encounter begins to illuminate the surfacing of prejudices that were originally enacted by oppressive neo-colonial structures but which I had come to discursively accept against the communities and the peoples that were to become the subjects of my ethnographic study. As I explain, these prejudices are sourced to the perception of the denigrated embodiment of the Other - in this case, the Palestinian masculine subject. Finally, I consider how I originally understood these latent prejudices and how I ultimately came to negate them through a prudent engagement with, and deconstruction of, a reified socio-political discourse that ideologically endeavors to maintain the subjugation of a disenfranchised and unrecognized nation.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MORAL EDUCATION

KW  - SECULARISM
KW  - EDUCATION
AB  - In the Journal of Moral Education, 39(2), Brenda Almond and Lawrence Blum debate the importance of tolerance versus acceptance in sex education. Blum defines acceptance as 'positive regard', in contradistinction to mere tolerance, 'a live and let live attitude toward others, an acceptance of coexistence, but with a disapproval of that "other"'. Employing consequentialist and definitional arguments, he defends an acceptant educational policy. I shore up this defence by addressing the issue of autonomy: specifically, I refute the claim that acceptance undermines parental autonomy in a morally unacceptable fashion. Drawing on Philip Pettit and Michael Smith's defence of the idea of 'orthonomy' or right-rule, I argue that orthonomy, rather than autonomy, should guide educational policy-making. I then show that the principle of orthonomy, together with teachers' professional responsibilities to ensure a safe and prejudice-free learning environment, entails that teachers have an inalienable responsibility to promote homophilic (gay-positive) values, regardless of whether they or their students' parents agree.

AB  - Although pro-environmental behaviors (PEBs) have been characterized as feminine, some PEBs are masculine suggesting that gender bending (e.g., engaging in pro-environmental behaviors inconsistent with one's own gender) and gender conformity (e.g., engaging in pro-environmental behaviors consistent with one's own gender) are possible for both women and men. Social consequences for gender bending versus conformity with PEBs were assessed in three studies. Gender bending created uncertainty about an actor's heterosexual identity (Studies 1 and 2). Consistent with stigma-by-association, actors' gender bending influenced judgments about an actor's friend's sexual identity (Study 2). However, gender bending had limited effects on ascription of gendered traits: More feminine than masculine traits were ascribed to PEB actors, even actors of masculine PEBs (Studies 1 and 2). Consistent with social ostracism, Study 3 illustrated that men were most likely to socially distance themselves from female gender benders, likely as a result of prejudice against gender-bending women. In contrast, women preferred to socially interact with gender-conforming women, likely resulting from a combination of their greater interest in feminine than masculine PEBs and preferring to interact with women more so than with men. Social repercussions are discussed in terms of stigmatizing engagement in PEBs.

AB  - The integration of scientific research into medical curricula remains insufficient despite its advantages for medical students' professional development and the advancement of medicine. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of first-year medical course attendance on medical students' attitudes and perceptions towards scientific research and clinical practice, while also assessing the contribution of sociodemographic and academic factors. Two hundred and thirteen medical students self-administrated a questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of the first school year. Their responses were compared and two regression models were calculated to assess factors influencing students' attitudes and perceptions. After freshman year, students displayed significantly lower positive attitudes towards science and research. Their motivation to perform research and to integrate it into the curriculum also decreased, while the importance attributed to research skills for clinical practice increased. Motivation to perform research and negative attitudes were positively and negatively associated with grade point average (GPA), respectively. Female students and those who attended public secondary schools attributed greater importance to communication skills. This study reinforces the need to early develop research skills and positive attitudes in medical students, motivating them to become physician-scientists. Additional follow-up studies may offer further contributions to the integration of research into medical curricula.</p>

AB  - Older adults (n = 113) participated in focus groups discussing their use of and attitudes about technology in the context of their home, work, and healthcare. Participants reported using a wide variety of technology items, particularly in their homes. Positive attitudes (i.e., likes) outnumbered negative attitudes (i.e., dislikes), suggesting that older adults perceive the benefits of technology use to outweigh the costs of such use. Positive attitudes were most frequently related to how the technology supported activities, enhanced convenience, and contained useful features. Negative attitudes were most frequently associated with technology creating inconveniences, unhelpful features, as well as security and reliability concerns. Given that older adults reported more positive than negative attitudes about the technologies they use, these results contradict stereotypes that older adults are afraid or unwilling to use technology. These findings also highlight the importance of perceived benefits of use and ease of use for models of technology acceptance. Emphasizing the benefits of technology in education and training programs may increase future technology adoption. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study explored the effects of tag questions, hedges, and argument quality on receivers' perceptions of a speaker, perceptions of message quality, cognitive responses, and attitude change. The results showed that tag questions and argument quality directly affected speaker and message quality perceptions and cognitive responses. They also interacted to directly affect perceptions of the speaker's power and credibility. Mediational analyses also showed that tag questions and argument quality had indirect effects on attitude change. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for the cognitive processing of and research on linguistic markers of powerlessness.

AB  - In line with the international policies, Global Education (GE) programs have been widely spread in European schools over the last 20 years, in order to promote environmental and social sustainability and the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. Despite this popularity, their effects on attitudes and behaviors have been poorly investigated so far, particularly for teachers. Our study addressed this research gap analyzing the psychological impact of an extensive GE project involving 1,303 teachers from 10 European countries. Relevant changes in teachers' emotional states and attitudes toward sustainability and migrations were analyzed through a pre-post experimental design. Results showed that the GE activities had wide positive effects on teachers, reducing their negative emotions after teaching, increasing their attitudes about sustainability, and mitigating negative attitudes toward migrants. No significant impacts on positive emotions have been detected. Educational and methodological implications of the applied psychological assessment are finally discussed.

AB  - Haiti has the highest number of individuals living with HIV in the Caribbean. Due to Haiti's resource-poor environment and inadequate mental health and substance abuse services, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be especially difficult. This study examined associations among demographics, maladaptive coping, partner conflict, alcohol problems, depression, and negative attitudes about medications and their impact on adherence among 194 HIV-positive Haitians. In a mediated directional structural equation model, depression and negative attitudes about ART directly predicted poorer adherence. Greater partner conflict, maladaptive coping and alcohol problems predicted more depression. Maladaptive coping predicted a negative attitude about ART. Alcohol problems predicted partner conflict and maladaptive coping. Significant indirect effects on adherence mediated through both depression and negative attitudes about ART include negative effects of female gender, alcohol problems and maladaptive coping. Results highlight the importance of integrated care for depression, alcohol use and other psychosocial problems to increase ART adherence.

AB  - One factor that has united Fijians of Indian descent is the language of Fiji Hindi, or Fiji Baat. Developed on the plantations of the indenture period, it is now the mother tongue of virtually all Indo-Fijians, distinct from the Standard Hindi that is taught in schools. This paper examines the way these two varieties of Hindi have been metalinguistically reconstructed from the early colonial period to the present day, focusing particularly on the labels Hindustani, Hindi, Fiji Hindi and Fiji Baat. We examine the extent to which Fiji Hindi fits into the pan-Fijian identity that is supposed to unite all Fiji citizens without drawing attention to ethnic difference. We argue that the acceptance of Fiji Hindi as part of a hybrid national identity is impeded both by this political erasure of ethnicity, and by the lingering negative attitudes expressed by its own speakers about the intralingual variation within Hindi.

AB  - This article presents the results of an experience of death education (DE) course with bibliodrama in Italian high schools, which focused on emotions and existential themes. The research analyzed the inability to recognize or describe one's own emotions (alexithymia), fantasy-proneness, and attitudes toward death in two different groups of students: one who took a course on DE (with 113 students) and another who did not participate in it (with 114 students). The use of a mixed method allowed this study to explore the quantitative results that the students indicated in the questionnaire and the qualitative open answers to the final question about how they had profited from this DE course. The results showed that the course had a positive effect, as the DE group significantly decreased alexithymia and negative attitudes toward death, particularly in fear and avoidance of death, making their representation of death less traumatic.

AB  - Anti-Semitic quotas to restrict access to medical school, graduate medical education and hospital privileges were common in the United States from the 1920s to the 1960s. In Brooklyn, New York, medical education prejudice resulted in violence. In 1916 a Jewish intern at Kings County Hospital, Matthew Olstein, was bound and gagged by Christian interns, put on a train at Grand Central Station, and warned that if he returned he would be thrown in the East River. Olstein died in combat in World War I as an Army physician. In 1927 3 Jewish interns at Kings County Hospital were assaulted, bound, dumped in tubs of water and covered in black fluid. Six gentile physicians were charged with assault. Criminal proceedings and public investigations followed. These attacks are the only known episodes of violence associated with American medical education anti-Semitism.

AB  - The present study aims to analyze the psychometric properties of the revised version of the Adolescent Cyber-Aggressor scale (CYB-AGS). This scale is composed of 18 items that measure direct and indirect cyberbullying. A cross-sectional study was conducted using two independent samples of adolescents. The first sample included 1318 adolescents (52.6% girls) from 12 to 16 years old (M = 13.89, SD = 1.32). The second sample included 1188 adolescents (48.5% boys) from 12 to 16 years old (M = 14.19, SD = 1.80). First, to study the psychometric properties of the CYB-AGS, exploratory factor analysis was performed on Sample 1. Results indicated a two-factor structure: direct cyber-aggression and indirect cyber-aggression. Second, to verify the structure of the CYB-AGS, we selected Sample 2 to conduct confirmatory factor analysis and test the scale's convergent validity with theoretically-related measures. Results confirmed the reliability and validity of the two-dimensional model. Moreover, measurement invariance was established. Finally, regarding convergent validity, positive correlations were obtained between cyberbullying and aggressive behaviors in school, anger expression, negative attitudes towards school, and transgression of norms. Furthermore, negative correlations were found between cyberbullying and attitudes towards institutional authority.

AB  - Appropriate recognition and management of obesity is imperative given the fact that one-third of Americans are clinically obese. Up to 25% of patients with a body mass index >= 30 are not appropriately identified by primary care physicians as being obese. An even smaller portion of recognized patients is offered any form of weight-loss treatment. This may be the result of approximately 40% of physicians possessing negative attitudes toward such patients given the challenges in managing this population. In the near future, physicians will be empowered with further knowledge regarding metabolic and neurologic adaptations that make weight loss so difficult. Along with this new information will come novel treatment options. It is predicted that many of the barriers preventing appropriate management of obesity will diminish as further knowledge and treatment options become available. Mt Sinai J Med 77:466-471, 2010.

AB  - Background: Inadequate knowledge and negative attitudes toward epilepsy can affect the provision of health services for patients with epilepsy.
   Aim: The aim of the present study was to assess the knowledge and attitudes toward epilepsy among clinical dental students in Jordan.
   Method: The study was conducted using a 21-item questionnaire to assess professional experience with epilepsy, knowledge about epilepsy, social tolerance, and willingness to care for patients with epilepsy among dental students at the University of Jordan.
   Results: More than one-third of dental students believed that epilepsy is due to insanity or mental illness. Only 45% were able to identify convulsion or shaking as a sign of epilepsy, and more than one-third did not know how to act in case of an epileptic seizure in the dental clinic. Disappointingly, 43.4% of the respondents were of the opinion that people with epilepsy should not have children, and only 38.6% thought that people with epilepsy should be employed at the same jobs as other people. About 50% indicated that their families would be concerned about them treating patients with epilepsy, and 30% believed that knowing that patients with epilepsy were treated in their clinic might make other patients reluctant to continue their treatment there.
   Conclusion: The results revealed an inadequate level of knowledge and negative attitudes toward epilepsy among dental students at the University of Jordan. There is an urgent need to educate dental students about epilepsy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - People often become evangelists for their own lifestyles. When it comes to relational status, people are rarely content to simply say being single works for me or being in a relationship suits my disposition. Results from four studies suggested that this tendency to view one's own relational status as the universal ideal emerges in part from a desire to rationalize one's own relational status. Building on existing evidence that people are motivated to rationalize circumstances they perceive as likely to persist, we predicted that participants' perceptions of the stability of their own relational status would lead them to rationalize that status. In Studies 1 and 2, we found evidence for an association between perceptions of stability and idealizations and ruled out an alternative explanation. In Studies 3 and 4, we found evidence of the effect of stability on people's judgments of same- and different-status others in contexts in which relational status should carry little objective weight.

AB  - In many regions around the world, wildlife impacts on people (e.g., crop raiding, attacks on people) engender negative attitudes toward wildlife. Negative attitudes predict behaviors that undermine wildlife management and conservation efforts (e.g., by exacerbating retaliatory killing of wildlife). Our study (1) evaluated attitudes of local people toward the globally endangered tiger (Panthera tigris) in Nepal's Chitwan National Park; and (2) modeled and mapped spatial clusters of attitudes toward tigers. Factors characterizing a person's position in society (i.e., socioeconomic and cultural factors) influenced attitudes toward tigers more than past experiences with tigers (e.g., livestock attacks). A spatial cluster of negative attitudes toward tigers was associated with concentrations of people with less formal education, people from marginalized ethnic groups, and tiger attacks on people. Our study provides insights and descriptions of techniques to improve attitudes toward wildlife in Chitwan and many regions around the world with similar conservation challenges.

AB  - This essay spans a long and somewhat unconventional arc - from Goethe's 1795-6 Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship Years to Lena Dunham's recent television series Girls. On the one hand, it focuses on the question of collectivity and coercion in Goethe's Ur-Bildungsroman, set initially among itinerant actors, joined and then partly led by a bourgeois scion escaping from his upbringing. Yet the novel differs in important ways from the picaresque. The essay argues, moreover, that Dunham's Girls, in the plural, with its collective protagonists, is only the latest iteration in a long tradition of female Bildungsromane (from Austen's 1813 Pride and Prejudice to Louisa May Alcott's 1868-9 Little Women, the widely-popular 1890s Australian girls' novels of Ethel Turner and Louisa Mack, and subsequent family books by E. Nesbit, Noel Streatfeild, etc.) featuring a small sibling or friend group in lieu of a single protagonist. These grouped characters, traversing trials and incidents together, or in contrast to one another, enabled a more faceted account of female social models, developmental variables, and struggles for agency. To chronicle one's own life, on film, as fiction, and as part of a generational plural, is to reground the Bildungsroman itself as a thoroughly self-interrogatory and feminist practice.

AB  - Within Australia, divisive debates regarding the processing of asylum seekers have delivered increasing polarisation rather than convergence on an evidence-based, humane approach. In order to investigate the role of motivated reasoning (the idea that our judgment is based on our motivations) with respect to attributions of warmth and competence, 186 participants indicated the extent to which they accepted false beliefs regarding asylum seekers. They read an article rebutting such false beliefs and then reported their attitudes towards the author and the extent to which the author possessed warmth and competence traits. They then reported whether they agreed with the information in the article before completing a test of recall. Participants who disagreed with the article recalled less accurate information and rated authors significantly lower on warmth and competence. These findings suggest that motivated reasoning plays an important role in the way stereotypes are applied and in the way information is processed.

AB  - Background There is a gradient relationship between socio-economic status and health. We investigated the views and perceptions of health promotion service providers regarding factors that affect lack of engagement in public health initiatives by residents in socio-economically disadvantaged (SED) communities.
   Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with a purposive sample of key providers (n = 15) of community-based health promotion services to elicit their views about engagement-related factors and their experiences of the provision, delivery and impact of health promotion in SED areas. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results Failure to (i) recognise within SED communities, socio-cultural norms of health-related behaviour and (ii) communicate to local residents an understanding of complex lifestyle influences appeared to affect adversely service engagement and contribute to the development of negative attitudes towards health promotion. Engagement is more likely when services are delivered within familiar settings, peer support is available, initiatives are organized within existing groups, external incentives are offered and there are options regarding times and locations. Collaborative working between providers and communities facilitates efficient, context-sensitive service delivery.
   Conclusions Knowledge of a local community and its socio-environmental context alongside a collaborative, facilitative and tailored approach to delivery are required to ensure successful engagement of SED communities in health promotion.

AB  - Introduction: This research was planned and conducted to determine the attitudes of university students toward elders and elder discrimination.
   Materials and Method: The research sample consisted of 584 students studying in the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences, Karabuk University. The study protocol was approved by the university research ethics committee and informed consent was obtained from all individuals who agreed to participate the study. Elder discrimination attitude scale was used as a data-gathering tool. This scale consisted of the following subdimensions-"limitation of the lives of elders," "positive attitudes toward elders," and "negative attitudes toward elders."
   Results: Of the students participating in the research study, 37.3% were males, and 62.7% were females. In the subdimension "limitation of the life of elders," the most positive approach was "care of elders should not be seen as a financial burden by family members." In the subdimension "positive attitudes toward elders," the most positive attitude was shown to be that "priority should be given to elders in queues," and in the subdimension "negative attitudes toward elders," the most positive approach was that "the main responsibility of elders is helping their children with tasks such as household and kitchen chores and in the care of grandchildren."
   Conclusion: The study found that students in the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences, Karabuk University had a positive approach toward elders and respected elders and cared about them.

AB  - ObjectiveThe Cancer Stories Study aimed to identify the factors that empower people who have experienced cancer. More specifically the project sought to explore the coping and support mechanisms people adopted to help understand and manage their cancer experience.
   MethodsA participatory research approach involved researchers and consumers working in partnership on the project. This research team agreed on a qualitative method that focused on cancer survivors' personal stories. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 38 cancer survivors in the lower half of the North Island, New Zealand (NZ). Generic qualitative analysis methods were employed including the recording, transcribing and thematic coding of interview narratives.
   ResultsSeven distinct themes were classified under the overarching theme of empowerment: attitude, change, family/whnau and friends, healthcare professionals and services, sources of support, employment and tangata whenua (NZ's indigenous peoples). The unique needs of each individual were strongly emphasised throughout all the themes indicating a one-size-fits-all' approach has its limitations. The need for improvements in communication, cultural and spiritual care was highlighted by many participants.
   ConclusionsIt is anticipated that this project will contribute to a greater understanding of the factors that might empower people in their cancer journey. An empowerment lens, that asks how those affected by cancer may be further enabled at an individual, family/whnau, employer and healthcare professional level may be useful in assisting people navigate and manage their cancer.

AB  - Background: undergraduate midwifery programmes offer opportunities for school leavers and young people (aged less than 21 years) to enter the profession. There is limited research exploring this age groups experience of their Bachelor of Midwifery programme. In order to retain these students we need to ensure that their experiences of undertaking a Bachelor of Midwifery program are positive and barriers and challenges are minimised.
   Aim: this study explored young midwifery students' experience of their Bachelor of Midwifery program. Method: a descriptive exploratory qualitative approach was used to explore the experiences of eleven students aged 20 years or less on enrolment. Data was collected using face-to-face or telephone-recorded interviews. Thematic analysis was used to analysis the data set.
   Findings: three major themes described the young students' experiences. The first labelled 'The challenges of being young' presented a number of age related challenges including transport issues with on call commitments as some students had not gained a driver's license. Students experienced some degree of prejudice relating to their age from their older student peers and some clinical staff during placements. 'Finding your way' was the second theme and described the strategies students used to build confidence and competence both in the university and clinical environment. The young students reported a strong commitment to the profession. They demonstrated high levels of connection with women and found the continuity of care experiences invaluable to their learning. The final theme 'Making the transition from teenager to midwife' demonstrated some unique insights into how studying to become a midwife impacted upon their personal and professional growth.
   Conclusion: the young students in this study encountered some unique issues related to their age. However as they progressed through the program they developed confidence in themselves and visualised themselves as having a long midwifery career. They were strongly motivated towards providing woman-centred maternity care and considered their continuity of care experiences fundamental to them developing a strong sense of themselves as midwives. Attracting and retaining young students is essential if the profession is to realise its goal of ensuring all women have access to a known midwife. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, television and social media informed and entertained people. This cross-sectional study among adolescents and young adults (n = 859, 71.94% female, M-age = 20.55, SDage = 4.59) examined the associations between pro-and anti-governmental (social) media and youth's violations of the lockdown measures following the prototype willingness model (PWM). Data were collected during Belgium's first and strictest lockdown. The results largely confirmed the applicability of the PWM in a public health context. Posting of and exposure to anti-governmental social media messages positively related to violations of the regulations via higher descriptive norm perceptions of peers violating the measures and positive attitudes towards violations. Pro-governmental media interactions (i.e., exposure to news media and pro governmental social media messages) negatively related to violations via negative attitudes towards violations. No support emerged for the role of (televised) series, prototype favorability, or subjective norms in the PWM. Differences in posting versus exposure of social media messages were found. Posting generally related stronger to risk cognitions and behaviors compared to exposure. Gender and age moderated some of the examined relations in the PWM. Implications for media research and health campaigns are discussed.

AB  - Dental professionals may be exposed to bloodborne pathogens in their work, and dental students may be a particularly vulnerable group. Fear of exposure has also been linked to discriminatory practices. A cross-sectional survey of dental students was conducted at one U.S. dental school to assess their knowledge about the transmission of bloodborne pathogens and management of exposures; the frequency of their bloodborne pathogen exposures (BBPEs); and associations among their prior exposure, knowledge, perception of knowledge, and attitudes toward practice. Overall, 220 students (72.1 percent) responded to the survey, and 215 (70.5 percent) answered questions about exposures. The prevalence of BBPE was 19.1 percent and was greater among clinical than preclinical students (p<0.01). Percutaneous injuries occurred in 87.5 percent of those exposed. All students (preclinical and clinical combined) answered more survey questions correctly about transmission of bloodborne pathogens (66.7 percent) than about post-exposure management (25.0 percent). Fewer than half reported adequate knowledge of transmission and management (47.5 percent and 37.3 percent, respectively). In this context, 8.2 percent of the respondents acknowledged an unwillingness to perform procedures on patients with HIV. Since knowledge gaps may lead to failure to report incidents and delays in appropriate exposure management and some negative attitudes towards treating individuals with HIV persist, these findings justify improving BBPE education at U.S. dental schools.

TI  - Attitudes of undergraduates towards mental illness: A comparison between nursing and business management students in India

KW  - PEOPLE
AB  - Background. Mental illness is an important public health issue worldwide; stigmatisation and negative attitudes towards people with mental illness are widespread among the general public. However, little is known about the attitudes of undergraduates to mental illness.
   Purpose. To compare the attitudes towards mental illness among undergraduates enrolled in nursing courses v. those enrolled in Bachelor of Business Management (BBM) courses.
   Methods. A cross-sectional descriptive design was adopted for the present study. A total of 268 undergraduates were selected to complete the Attitude Scale for Mental Illness (ASMI) and the Opinions about Mental Illness in the Chinese Community (OMICC) questionnaires.
   Results. We found significant differences between the number of nursing and BBM students who agreed with statements posed by the questionnaires, e.g., that they would move out of their community if a mental health facility was established there (chi(2)=16.503, p<0.002), that they were not afraid of treated mentally ill people (chi(2)=15.279, p<0.004), and that people with mental illness tend to be violent (chi(2)=14.215, p<0.007) and dangerous (chi(2)=17.808, p<0.001). Nursing students disagreed that people with mental illness are easily identified (chi(2)=30.094, p<0.000), have a lower IQ (chi(2)=70.689, p<0.000) and should not have children (chi(2)=24.531, p<0.000). Nursing students were more benevolent than BBM students, as they agreed that people with mental illness can hold a job (chi(2)=49.992, p<0.000) and can return to their former position (chi(2)=11.596, p<0.021), that everyone faces the possibility of becoming mentally ill (chi(2)=38.726, p<0.000), and that one should not laugh at the mentally ill (chi(2)=17407, p<0.002). Nursing students held less pessimistic attitudes, as they felt that the mentally ill should receive the same pay for the same job (chi(2)=10.669, p<0.031) and that the public are prejudiced towards people with mental illness (chi(2)=17.604, p<0.001).
   Conclusion. College students' attitudes towards people with mental illness vary based on the course that they are enrolled in. Attitudes may be positively improved by revising curriculum design to incorporate educational sessions about mental illness. These are essential steps to combat discrimination, and potentially enhance the promotion of human rights for the mentally ill.

AB  - This article identifies and presents the main debates and issues that are generating interest in the field of creole studies. It is composed of two main sections. The first one presents the debates currently stimulating creolistics: the nature of pidgins and creoles and the relation between the two, the sociological and typological distinction between pidgins and creoles, the various theories explaining their origin, and their transformation through time. The second part raises issues linked to the social life of these languages, an area of research that, though present since the beginning of creolistics, has remained limited. Using the framework of linguistic ideology, this review surveys the social status of pidgins and creoles, the prejudices that exclude them from being used at schools, and their lack of linguistic legitimacy. It concludes with a discussion of pidgins and creoles on social media.

AB  - A number of studies on CLIL, particularly from Spain, which is familiar to this author, will be analysed to show that there are numerous anomalies not only in the research, but in the analysis, and doubts about the conclusions drawn. CLIL instruction is not always necessarily that beneficial, and there is every reason to believe some students may be prejudiced by CLIL, and that not only academic, but also institutional, interests may be taking precedence over some students' interests in the state educational sector. Some research issues are covered in the detailed analysis of one study before a plea is made for ensuring that disinterested research is carried out into the overall effects of CLIL initiatives in state educational institutions and systems, so that the welfare of all state-school students is recognised and respected.

AB  - Purpose Students with disabilities have lower enrollment and higher attrition than their non-disabled peers. They identify negative attitudes from educators in their accommodation experiences within professional programs, such as occupational therapy and physiotherapy. Educators in these accredited programs must address a myriad of requirements through curriculum delivery. The documents or "texts" containing program requirements include discourses or dominant understandings of reality. The purpose of this study is to identify these discourses and the resulting positions of educators, to better understand the tensions in accommodating students with disabilities. Methods A critical discourse analysis study was conducted. Key informants and inclusion criteria led to the collection of 9 texts, which were subsequently analyzed using Norman Fairclough's three-dimensional conception of discourse. Results Three discourses were identified. "Rights and responsibilities" was the most salient discourse, followed by "normative assumptions" and then "inclusion and equity." The associated educator positions are "navigator," "gatekeeper" and "advocate," respectively. Conclusions The discourses and resulting educator positions are varied and in conflict with one another. There is a potential for change in the social practices related to accommodating students with disabilities. However, these changes need to be conscious and deliberate to ensure inclusivity within the occupational therapy and physiotherapy professions.

AB  - Introduction: Coronavirus disease of 2019 has overwhelmed public health systems worldwide and forced governments to impose draconian lockdowns on entire populations. With no vaccine or treatment during the early days of the pandemic, it is of paramount importance to assess the public's awareness about COVID-19 so that prevention-focused educational campaigns can be sufficiently deployed. This study aimed to gauge the Syrian public's adherence to infection control measures by assessing attitudes and practices during the pandemic which ravaged an already war-torn Syria. Methods: The web-based cross-sectional study was conducted in March 2020, nearly 11 years into the Syrian crisis. The survey contained 3 sections: socio-demographic characteristics, attitudes, and practice. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with good practices and negative attitudes. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 25.0.Results: Of the 3586 participants, 68.2% were females, 50.8% were unemployed, and 79.2% were collegeeducated. Only 1402 (39.1%) participants wore face masks when leaving their homes. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that female, age, and residence were factors associated with good practices such as avoiding mass gatherings, wearing face masks, and maintaining a 1-meter interpersonal distance. However, age and occupation were factors associated with negative attitudes towards the closure of universities and schools, travel bans, and quarantines for travellers.Conclusion: This survey highlights the need to address specific populations using various measures; there should be a specialized method of prevention for each occupation, age group, and place of residence to contain further outbreaks of COVID-19. This can be achieved through targeted awareness campaigns.

AB  - This article examines the terms "culturally deprived" and "disadvantaged" in light of their popular use in the sixties and following decades, particularly in the ethnic and mainstream press. These expressions represented an effort to explain differences in educational attainment and academic achievement along lines of social class, race, and ethnicity from an environmental, liberal viewpoint. We consider the use of such terms from the standpoint of both the African American and Mexican American communities at the time, representing perspectives from the North, South, and West Coast. In doing this, we document a national effort by educators and the concerned public to comprehend and address long-standing patterns of social and educational inequity. State and federal programs that used "compensatory" and "remedial" education to address the problems of "culturally deprived" and "disadvantaged" communities are also considered, along with political tensions within and between the African American and Mexican American communities over benefits to be gained. The use of these expressions was eventually marked by controversy as ethnic communities and academic critics labeled them a new form of prejudice, based on conceptions of cultural and academic inadequacy. While the terms fell out of favor, a new generation was left with the problem of explaining persistent differences in educational outcomes and academic achievement that marked children's lives. The expression "at risk" was brought into the mainstream, and the academic terms "social capital" and "cultural capital" were introduced and gained currency. While these new terms have not sparked the controversies of the past, they fail to fully characterize the systematic educational disadvantages experienced by children from poor or minority backgrounds. The article closes with a brief discussion of the recurring dilemma of how best to describe persistently unequal educational outcomes, particularly when they continue to correspond to broad patterns of social and economic inequality in contemporary society.

TI  - SEARCHING FOR A BETTER CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTOR FOR FRE 413-415: THE CONFLICT AMONG CIRCUITS IN APPLYING THE FRE 403 BALANCING TEST AND A NEW SOLUTION
T2  - UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - This Note argues that the federal circuits' current approaches in applying the FRE 403 balancing test in the context of FRE 413-415 are inadequate to ensure the constitutionality of FRE 413-415. Under the FRE 403 balancing test, evidence is inadmissible only if the probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice. Federal circuits rely on FRE 403's balancing test as the constitutional guarantor for FRE 413-415, which allow the admission of evidence of the defendant's prior sexual assaults or child molestation, despite its significance of propensity reasoning and huge potential to mislead the jury. In addition, this Note introduces and provides detailed analysis on the current approaches used by different federal circuits in applying the FRE 403 balancing test to evidence admissible under FRE 413-415. Finally, this Note proposes a new approach for federal circuits where the lower-threshold, pro exclusion balancing test utilized in FRE 609(a) (1) (B) is applied in the context of FRE 413-415. The new approach, which is a combination of the balancing test utilized in FRE 609(a) (1) (B) and five factors set forth in United States v. LeMay, takes into account both the Congressional intent to admit evidence of the defendant's prior sexual misconduct and the unfair prejudice of propensity reasoning that character evidence of this kind can generate.

AB  - Theory suggests that teachers' implicit racial attitudes affect their students, but large-scale evidence on U.S. teachers' implicit biases and their correlates is lacking. Using nationwide data from Project Implicit, we found that teachers' implicit White/Black biases (as measured by the implicit association test) vary by teacher gender and race. Teachers' adjusted bias levels are lower in counties with larger shares of Black students. In the aggregate, counties in which teachers hold higher levels of implicit and explicit racial bias have larger adjusted White/Black test score inequalities and White/Black suspension disparities.

AB  - Little is known about current attitudes towards cousin marriages. Using data from a rural population in the Mexican state of Oaxaca, the present research examined how life history was related to attitudes towards cousin marriages in various ethnic groups. Participants were 205 parents from three ethnic groups. i.e., Mestizos (people of mixed descent, n = 103), indigenous Mixtecs (n = 65), and Blacks (n = 35). Nearly all men in this study were farm workers or fishermen. Participants reported more negative than positive attitudes towards cousin marriage, and women reported more negative attitudes than did men. The main objection against marrying a cousin was that it is wrong for religious reasons, whereas the risk of genetic defects was considered relatively unimportant. Cousin marriage was not considered to contribute to the quality and unity of marriage and the family. The three ethnic groups did not differ in their attitude towards cousin marriages. However, a slower life history was related to a more negative attitude towards cousin marriages, especially among Blacks, less so among Mixtecs, and not at all among Mestizos. In addition, and independent of the effect of life history, with increasing levels of parental control over mate choice, the attitude towards cousin marriage was more positive, but among men the attitude was more negative the more religious they were. The results are discussed in the context of theorizing on life history theory and the benefits and costs of cousin marriages.

AB  - According to the broaden-and-build theory of positive emotions, the frequency of positive emotions is associated with the development of positive attitudes, cognitions, and behaviors in organizational contexts. However, positive and negative attitudes at work might also be influenced by different personal and job resources. While emotional intelligence has been significantly associated with positive job attitudes and personal well-being, no studies have yet examined the joint role of teacher happiness and emotional intelligence in key teacher job attitudes. The present study assesses whether emotional intelligence interacts with levels of teacher happiness to jointly explain important teacher job attitudes (i.e., job satisfaction and turnover intention). A total sample of 685 teaching professionals (431 female) filled out a battery of scales including subjective happiness, emotional intelligence, job satisfaction, and turnover intention. Our results revealed that subjective happiness was significantly associated with both higher job satisfaction and lower turnover intention. Likewise, emotional intelligence was positively related to happiness and job satisfaction, and negatively related to turnover intention. Finally, interaction analysis showed the main effects of happiness and emotional intelligence in explaining teacher job attitudes. Beyond the main effects, the interaction effects of happiness and emotional intelligence were significant in predicting all teachers' job attitude indicators, even controlling for the effects of their sociodemographic variables. This work expands our knowledge about the role of teachers' positive emotions in the development of positive work attitudes, and also supports the inclusion of emotional skills in future teacher preparation programs as resources to facilitate work-related well-being.

AB  - In Flanders, citizens hold rather negative attitudes towards immigrants and refugees. This could be due to the news media, which depict newcomers in a rather negative way. The purpose of this study is to analyze whether there are separate media worlds at work in Flemish young people and adults and whether this results in different attitudes towards immigrants and refugees. To do so, we questioned 1,759 people aged 13 to 65 by means of an online questionnaire. Results indicate that overall news consumption increases with age, and that young people mainly use social media for their news consumption while adults still rely on traditional media. Interestingly, young adults are the most welcoming group towards immigrants and refugees. Although news media consumption seems to be related to fear of terrorism and attitudes towards newcomers to some extent, socio-demographic factors play an important role in the development of fear and negative attitudes towards newcomers.

AB  - This paper explores the role of self-reflection in a teacher education program. In a mandatory Aboriginal Education course in northwestern Ontario, teacher candidates participated in a variety of self-reflection activities that included two reflection papers, non-traditional sharing circles, and lectures, and classroom discussions that challenged common myths, stereotypes, and prejudices about Indigenous peoples. In a survey with open-ended questions administered at the end of the course, 36 teacher candidates shared their perspectives about self-reflection at the end of the course. Findings from the survey were correlated with seven teacher candidates' reflection papers and with my personal reflections as a participant-as-observer in two of the mandatory courses. The themes that emerged from analysis were placed into three categories; these categories described the role of self-reflection as a process of (1) self-evaluation, (2) establishing personal connections with course theory, and, (3) developing a culturally inclusive pedagogy. The findings suggest that self-reflection in an Indigenous Education course can provide teacher candidates with an effective approach to uncover, identify, and examine internal biases that impact their understanding of teaching Indigenous students and integrating Indigenous content into the curriculum.

AB  - Research finds inducing empathy toward an Asian American movie character reduces explicit prejudice toward other Asian American individuals (Shih, Wang, Trahan & Stotzer, 2009). We examine whether inducing empathy toward an Asian American movie character might also reduce implicit group bias more generally (e.g., us vs. them). We report the results of a study in which participants watched a video clip from The Joy Luck Club in one of two conditions: an empathy condition-in which they were asked to put themselves in the shoes of the Asian American movie character-or a control condition. Participants then completed a computer task in which they were asked to judge the valence of good and bad adjectives after being subliminally exposed to either the ingroup pronoun "us" or the outgroup pronoun "them." Results showed that participants in the control condition exhibited ingroup bias, displaying faster RTs for judging good words after being exposed to "us" and faster RTs for bad words after being exposed to "them." Participants in the empathy viewing condition, however, did not show this bias. These results suggest that inducing empathy is a particularly robust form of prejudice reduction, one that not only improves explicit intergroup attitudes but also implicit attitudes.

AB  - Background: An understanding of the cultural aspects of suicidal behavior is essential for the development of culturally appropriate suicide prevention and intervention strategies. Aims: This study explored the attitudes toward youth suicide in 686 Italian, Indian and Australian undergraduate students (18-24 years old). Method: A 21-item suicide attitude inventory titled Attitude towards Youth Suicide (AtYS) scale, included in this paper, was used in the three samples. Results: Four factors were extracted, labeled negative attitudes toward suicide, belief that suicide was not preventable, suicide as acceptable and normal, and the existence of risk signs for suicide. Country differences were found for all four subscales, with Indian students having the most negative attitudes toward suicide. Sex differences were found in all three countries with women, on the whole, having less negative attitudes toward suicide, more belief in the preventability of suicide in India and more belief in risk signs for suicide in Italy. Conclusion: Attitudes are linked to suicide in a complex manner. More quantitative and qualitative studies, including in lower-income and non-English speaking Western societies, are needed.

AB  - The present study examined the effects of sexual objectification of female artists in music videos on male undergraduates' sexual beliefs. Findings showed that participants who viewed music videos of highly objectified female artists reported more adversarial sexual beliefs, more acceptance of interpersonal violence, and, at a level of marginal significance, more negative attitudes about sexual harassment than participants assigned to low-sexual objectifying music videos by the same female artists. Path models indicated that adversarial sexual beliefs mediated the relationship between condition, and (1) acceptance of interpersonal violence and (2) negative attitudes regarding sexual harassment.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, its duration, and its intensity are harbingers of demographic change. In the context of social demography, it is crucial to explore the social challenge emerging from the coronavirus disease. The main purpose of this study is (i) to explore the determinants that affected the population in Greece in terms of social isolation during the lockdown period and (ii) to examine possible differences in the assessment of the social isolation factors depending on whether individuals live in urban or rural areas or regions with relative geographical isolation. Field research was conducted with 4216 questionnaires during the first wave of COVID-19 (March to April 2020). Multivariate analysis methods were applied to detect the main factors that impacted the feeling of social isolation, and nonparametric tests were performed to detect possible differences between population groups. Despite the resistance shown to the spread of the disease, the Greek population totally complied with the measures of social distancing and thus was socially and psychologically affected. The results indicate that psychosomatic disorders, employment situations, changes in sleep habits, socialization on the Internet, demographic status, health concerns, and trust in government and the media response determine the Greeks' social isolation feeling. Pandemic and confinement measures have consequences for individuals and social groups and may prejudice social cohesion at multiple levels. By understanding how the pandemic affected the societies, interventions and public policies may be implemented to ensure both social cohesion and populations' wellbeing by addressing the social isolation feeling.

AB  - Aim: The present study aimed to clarify the factors affecting early psychiatric intervention for patients with first-episode psychosis in Japan.
   Methods: A postal questionnaire survey was conducted in 346 members of the Association of Family of Psychosis Patients, in Mie, Japan.
   Results: The questionnaire was completed by 138 respondents. The mean interval between a suspected first episode of psychosis and the first visit to a medical institution was 18.4 months (SD: 40.0, range: 0-336 months). Forty-five respondents consulted a family member first and required a mean duration of 9.8 months (SD: 11.2) before their first visit; this was significantly shorter than those who did not. Eighteen respondents consulted their class teacher at school first and required a mean duration of 40.2 months (SD: 63.0) before their first visit; this was significantly longer (P < 0.05) than those who did not. When loss of sleep or appetite was present, the mean duration before their first visit was 9.3 months (SD: 12.1), which was significantly shorter (P < 0.05) than the time required by those who did not. Logistic regression analysis using the first episode-first visit interval as an independent variable, and independent variables such as age, gender of the patient and family member, and loss of sleep, revealed that variables relating to the respondent's notion about the psychosis were mitigating factors (e. g. 'prejudice-causing' and 'nothing to do with me').
   Conclusion: Prejudice towards psychosis and poor awareness about mental illnesses are two factors that may affect early psychiatric intervention.

AB  - Previous studies have investigated how Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers adjust to life in the US in order to understand their lives and help them to adapt to the new culture. Based on acculturation and mobile media theories, this study explores particularly how Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers' child-rearing practices in the US are mediated by mobile media. Guided by the theoretical framework of interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), we conducted 16 in-depth interviews with Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers. Findings reveal that while going through the acculturation process, Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers attempt to play the traditional social role of mother as defined in their home countries when utilizing mobile media in their new home. Mobile media have symbolic meanings of empowerment and can be used as tools to deal with prejudice in the host country. This study also suggests that mobile media may mediate Chinese and Korean immigrant mothers' acculturation processes when adopting different types of acculturation strategies (e.g., integration or separation). Implications for practice and future studies are further discussed.

AB  - Five experiments investigated the hypothesis that perspective taking-actively contemplating others' psychological experiences-attenuates automatic expressions of racial bias. Across the first 3 experiments, participants who adopted the perspective of a Black target in an initial context subsequently exhibited more positive automatic interracial evaluations, with changes in automatic evaluations mediating the effect of perspective taking on more deliberate interracial evaluations. Furthermore, unlike other bias-reduction strategies, the interracial positivity resulting from perspective taking was accompanied by increased salience of racial inequalities (Experiment 3). Perspective taking also produced stronger approach-oriented action tendencies toward Blacks (but not Whites; Experiment 4). A final experiment revealed that face-to-face interactions with perspective takers were rated more positively by Black interaction partners than were interactions with nonperspective takers-a relationship that was mediated by perspective takers' increased approach-oriented nonverbal behaviors (as rated by objective, third-party observers). These findings indicate that perspective taking can combat automatic expressions of racial biases without simultaneously decreasing sensitivity to ongoing racial disparities.

AB  - Objectives This study draws on an in-depth investigation of factors that influenced the career decisions of junior doctors.
   Setting Junior doctors in the UK can choose to enter specialty training (ST) programmes within 2 years of becoming doctors. Their specialty choices contribute to shaping the balance of the future medical workforce, with views on general practice (GP) careers of particular interest because of current recruitment difficulties. This paper examines how experiences of medical work and perceptions about specialty training shape junior doctors' career decisions.
   Participants Twenty doctors in the second year of a Foundation Training Programme in England were recruited. Purposive sampling was used to achieve a diverse sample from respondents to an online survey.
   Results Narrative interviewing techniques encouraged doctors to reflect on how experiences during medical school and in medical workplaces had influenced their preferences and perceptions of different specialties. They also spoke about personal aspirations, work priorities and their wider future. Junior doctors' decisions were informed by knowledge about the requirements of ST programmes and direct observation of the pressures under which ST doctors worked. When they encountered negative attitudes towards a specialty they had intended to choose, some became defensive while others kept silent. Achievement of an acceptable work-life balance was a central objective that could override other preferences. Events linked with specific specialties influenced doctors' attitudes towards them. For example, findings confirmed that while early, positive experiences of GP work could increase its attractiveness, negative experiences in GP settings had the opposite effect.
   Conclusions Junior doctors' preferences and perceptions about medical work are influenced by multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors and experiences. This paper highlights the importance of understanding how perceptions are formed and preferences are developed, as a basis for generating learning and working environments that nurture students and motivate their professional careers.

AB  - Demand for fresh-cut flowers and floral products has been decreasing in recent years, particularly among young consumers. The objectives of this study were to explore Generations X and Y's positive and negative attitudes toward flowers as gifts; explore differences in perceptions about price, product, place, and promotions among Generations X and Y to determine the best marketing techniques to reach them; and determine what actions the floral industry can take to improve Generations X and Y's use of flowers as gifts. Participants were recruited in Minneapolis and St. Paul, MN, and Lansing and East Lansing, MI. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire and participate in a focus group discussion. An ordered probit model was used to analyze the data. Results showed that younger consumers were dissatisfied with several floral product attributes, including short longevity, lack of trendiness, relative high cost, lack of appropriateness, and lack of uniqueness. Results also indicate that younger consumers perceived that their friends do not enjoy floral gifts. Additionally, younger consumers viewed floral advertisements less frequently and considered floral gifts difficult to purchase, resulting in decreased awareness and interest. Overall, most participants felt that in-store sales or discounts, greater flower longevity, more price ranges, and trendier arrangements/flowers would increase their use of fresh flowers as gifts.

AB  - This paper is based on a cross-national experimental study conducted among American, Turkish, Israeli-Jewish, and Israeli-Palestinian students using a computer game called PeaceMaker. The game is a highly realistic and complex simulation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. PeaceMaker was used for educational and experimental purposes in a classroom setting and each student played the game in both Israeli and Palestinian decision maker roles. Our purpose was to evaluate the game's effectiveness as a pedagogical tool in teaching about conflict and its resolution, especially with regard to generating knowledge acquisition, perspective taking as a crucial skill in conflict resolution, and attitude change. We were also interested in understanding whether these effects changed depending on whether the participants were direct parties to the conflict or not. In order to gauge the effect of the game in these areas, we used a pre- and post-intervention experimental design and utilized questionnaires. We found that the game increased the level of knowledge about the conflict for the Israeli-Jewish, Israeli-Palestinian, American, and Turkish students. We also found that the game successfully contributed to perspective taking among Turkish and American students only on a contemporary issue related to the conflict.

AB  - A national sample of addiction treatment Program Directors (N = 296) were assessed regarding their attitudes about pharmacological treatment for addiction disorders. Multivariable analyses indicate that directors who worked in organizations affiliated with research institutions and who had more professional experience had significantly more positive attitudes about a range of pharmacological therapies. Also, directors in organizations serving higher percentage homeless clients and clients with severe and persistent mental illness had more negative attitudes toward use of buprenorphine. Community-based organizations providing addiction treatment to specific vulnerable client groups exhibit more negative attitudes about pharmacological evidence-based practices and may underutilize those practices.

AB  - Foreign language anxiety, the feeling of tension and apprehension specifically associated with learning a foreign language is considered to be the major factor encountered by language learners around the world. The consideration of language anxiety in the modern English classroom is highly significant to help learners boost their confidence and develop their communication skills in the target language. The current study addresses the following research questions: 1. What factors may cause the anxiety that university students encounter in the process of learning English? 2. What psychological and pedagogical strategies in reducing the language anxiety among English language learners to cope with the language anxiety can be utilized? The research is of qualitative and descriptive type. A survey questionnaire (by Horwitz et al.) was suggested to 86 students of National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv. The findings of this study clearly indicate that in spite of the use of modern communicative approaches and techniques by university teachers, the problem of English language anxiety still persists among the students. Teachers should do their best to reduce anxiety in their students by creating an attractive, warm atmosphere inside the classrooms and increasing students' motivation in learning English. They should help their students to cope with negative attitudes and unpleasant feelings towards learning English. Furthermore, they should build students' self-confidence by using positive reinforcement, encouragements. Coping strategies for foreign language anxiety may include those helping the students learn to deal with the context provoking anxiety and those making the learning context less stressful. In order to reduce the language anxiety, special trainings, activities and sessions should be used for language learners such as direct discussing students' anxieties, cooperative learning activities, progressive relaxation, deep breathing, meditation, soothing music and humor, encouraging statements as well.

The Priazoviya, as one of the regions of Ukraine's population, is the basis of geological, geographical, historical, economic, encyclopedic vocabulary, the main warehouse of the population of the Azov region population, some of which are Ukrainians, Bulgarians, and others was revealed. The same goal was determined by the region's simple space and its specificity changed the form of the national holy society. The lord of voluntary and imaginative migrations of the people felt as if they were completely blessed, the culture and traditions on the territory were reunited. The powerful moved of human streams, the resettlement of different nationalities representative, formed the multicultural character of the Priazov region. The base of the whole region even far away in the great waters of the Dnieper Sea and the Sea of Azov - all the whole rivers did not empty the land of the whole region. Actions, as it were at the other half of XVIII - the cob of the XX century. In the South of Ukraine, they have seized the license for the fake development of the country. The most important aspect of the region development is given this research work. In this way, Ukraine, as a multicultural storehouse has a perspective for formulating a dialogue with other representatives through a prism of a perfect life.

AB  - In the last decade, environmental issues have become a major topic of public opinion. People have begun to develop increasing environmental awareness and positive attitudes toward ecological matters. In particular, young people have begun to actively participate in environmental challenges by organizing green movements and engaging with policymakers. In this perspective, this study explores two main aspects: 1) awareness of the potential impacts of climate change and of environmental issues in each individual's daily life, and 2) the relationship between attitudes and pro-environmental actions. To this end, we analyse qualitative data obtained from a tailored online survey involving either students from a selected group of Italian High schools or volunteer respondents from the students' acquaintances. A total of 1834 responses are analysed using statistical tools to assess the multiple objectives of the survey. We distinguish between young and adult respondents and examine the relationships between awareness, personal experience, and risk perception in the two groups. We then propose a Multiple Correspondence Analysis that focuses on youth attitudes to examine the factors that influence their propensity to environmental issues and to determine the impact of global green movements on the onset or acceleration of their environmental awareness. Although the results show a more pessimistic view of the threats posed by environmental crises, our results highlight that younger generations have a deeper awareness of environmental conditions and are committed to environmental recovery by adopting "good ecological practices" and "active ecological behaviors."

KW  - PAIN
AB  - Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disease associated with both chronic pain and acute painful events referred to as vaso-occlusive crises. Individuals with SCD suffer from a multitude of medical complications in addition to pain. Patients often are stigmatized as "drug-seeking'' and receive inadequate pain management. The purpose of this study was to compare clinicians' SCD knowledge and attitudes toward patients with SCD before attending a 2-day conference on SCD (T1) with knowledge and attitudes immediately postconference (T2) and 2 months postconference (T3). A prospective, descriptive survey design was used. The authors administered surveys to assess SCD knowledge and clinicians' attitudes toward patients with SCD at three time points: T1 (N = 59), T2 (N = 38), and T3 (N = 30). SCD knowledge was measured using a 20-item survey, and clinicians' attitudes toward patients with SCD were measured with the General Perceptions About Sickle Cell Patients Scale, which included items on four independent subscales: positive attitudes, negative attitudes, concern-raising behaviors, and red-flag behaviors. The authors compared changes in knowledge and attitude scores between T1-T2 and T1-T3. Overall, knowledge scores were significantly improved (p < .001) and significantly increased between T1-T2 (p < .0001) and T1-T3 (p = .01). Negative attitudes trended lower over the three time points (p = .07), but a significant decrease in the negative attitudes score was only noted for T1-T3 (Z = -2.16.17, p = .03). Attendance at an educational SCD conference was an effective means to improve knowledge and decrease negative attitudes among clinicians. These differences were maintained at 2 months postconference.

AB  - Background: The data of substance abuse are limited in Iraq. Psychiatrists perceived non-medical use of prescription drugs, including benzhexol (muscle relaxant), benzodiazepines (anti-anxiety medication), and codeine (opiate painkiller), as the most common form of illicit substance use.
   Aim of the: study: This study was designed to assess the substance - abuse - related knowledge and attitude among the youth in Tikrit.
   Results: Results showed that 78% didn't know any substance abusers while 22 knew at least one substance abuser. Also, a sizeable number of females and males(57.4%) were not able to define substance abuse correctly. Avoiding friends who are substance abusers can help in the prevention of substance abuse" was the most agreed upon factor for the prevention of substance abuse among males (82.5%) and females (85.7%). A percentage of females (84.6%) and males (70.2%) wary of those who used illegal substances. Also, females (76.9%) and males(68.2%) tended to avoid drug addicts.
   Conclusion: Both genders did not have enough knowledge about globally and locally used illicit substances. Negative attitudes toward substance abusers and substance abuse were clearly apparent in their responses. The youth agreed with spending as much money as possible on the treatment of substance abusers. The population showed good know, ledge about the ways and factors that may help in the prevention of substance abuse.

AB  - Background:
   India accounts for approximately 72% of reported diphtheria cases globally, the majority of which occur in the state of Andhra Pradesh. The aim of this study is to better understand lack of knowledge on diphtheria vaccination and to determine factors associated with diphtheria and low knowledge and negative attitudes.
   Methods:
   We performed a 1:1 case-control study of hospitalized diphtheria cases in Hyderabad. Eligible case patients were 10 years of age or older, resided within the city of Hyderabad and were diagnosed with diphtheria per the case definition. Patients admitted to the hospital for nonrespiratory communicable diseases and residing in the same geographic region as that of cases were eligible for enrolment as controls
   Results:
   There were no statistical differences in disease outcome by gender, education, economic status and mean room per person sleeping in the house in case and control subjects. Not having heard of diphtheria (adjusted odds ratio: 3.56; 95% confidence intervals: 1.58-8.04] and not believing that vaccines can prevent people from getting diseases (adjusted odds ratio: 3.99; 95% confidence intervals: 1.18-13.45) remained significantly associated with diphtheria on multivariate analysis.
   Conclusion:
   To reduce the burden of diphtheria in India, further efforts to educate the public about diphtheria should be considered.

AB  - As electronic books continue to attract attention as a pedagogical tool in language classrooms, the impact that e-books are expected to have on higher education cannot be ignored. Despite the pervasiveness of e-book reading studies in higher education, most studies show that students' reactions to e-books are often negative. However, the effects of using e-books are considered beneficial in extensive reading programs in many first- or second-language classrooms. The different results may be due to different reading purposes. In addition, limited studies have investigated whether students' perceptions of e-books change over time since many of the e-book reading studies used a survey, rather than longitudinal, approach. Thus, this study intended to determine (1) English as a foreign language (EFL) college students' perceptions of e-books when they read for the purpose of responding to literature rather than for the purpose of intensively studying in an academic context; and (2) whether these perceptions change over time as based on a qualitative perspective. Twenty freshmen enrolled in a literature-based course participated in a semester-long e-book reading. The results showed that the students in this study generally valued the intangible nature of e-books. However, the e-book reading experience was still considered unpleasant to most of the participants in this study. This implies that the reading purpose may not have a great influence on students' perception of e-books. Despite the overall negative perceptions of e-books, the students also demonstrated some improved attitudes toward reading e-books for an entire semester. The findings indicate that when students are given time and opportunities to read e-books, they are likely to develop e-book reading habits and strategies. It would be a pity if we gave up providing students e-books merely because of their initial negative attitudes.

AB  - Humans are contributing to large carnivore declines around the globe, and conservation interventions should focus on increasing local stakeholder tolerance of carnivores and be informed by both biological and social considerations. In the Okavango Delta (Botswana), we tested new conservation strategies alongside a pre-existing government compensation programme. The new strategies included the construction of predator-proof livestock enclosures, the establishment of an early warning system linked to GPS satellite lion collars, depredation event investigations and educational programmes. We conducted pre- and post-assessments of villagers' livestock management practices, attitudes towards carnivores and conservation, perceptions of human-carnivore coexistence and attitudes towards established conservation programmes. Livestock management levels were low and 50% of farmers lost livestock to carnivores, while 5-10% of owned stock was lost. Respondents had strong negative attitudes towards lions, which kill most depredated livestock. Following new management interventions, tolerance of carnivores significantly increased, although tolerance of lions near villages did not. The number of respondents who believed that coexistence with carnivores was possible significantly increased. Respondents had negative attitudes towards the government-run compensation programme, citing low and late payments, but were supportive of the new management interventions. These efforts show that targeted, intensive management can increase stakeholder tolerance of carnivores.

AB  - Although research on discrimination and health has progressed significantly, it has tended to focus on racial discrimination and US populations. This study explored different types of discrimination, their interactions and associations with common mental disorders among Brazilian university students, in Rio de Janeiro in 2010. Associations between discrimination and common mental disorders were examined using multiple logistic regression models, adjusted for confounders. Interactions between discrimination and socio-demographics were tested. Discrimination attributed to age, class and skin color/race were the most frequently reported. In a fully adjusted model, discrimination attributed to skin color/race and class were both independently associated with increased odds of common mental disorders. The simultaneous reporting of skin color/race, class and age discrimination was associated with the highest odds ratio. No significant interactions were found. Skin color/race and class discrimination were important, but their simultaneous reporting, in conjunction with age discrimination, were associated with the highest occurrence of common mental disorders.

TI  - Stylistic Duality in Gabriel Faure's Music for Pauline Viardot's Salon
T2  - NINETEENTH-CENTURY MUSIC REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - When Gabriel Faure (1845-1924) became a 'regular' at the Parisian salon of opera legend Pauline Viardot in 1871, he encountered businessmen and politicians in addition to aristocrats and socialites, plus artists and authors as well as amateur musicians and professional peers. Encouraged by Madame Viardot and inspired by her 'artistic salon', Faure produced sophisticated works with stylistic duality: music that appealed to and satisfied both intuitive and analytic listeners.
   This essay examines three of Faure's compositions that feature stylistic duality, each dedicated to a member of the Viardot family. These include two early melodies, 'Chanson du pecheur (Lamento)' (1872) and 'Au bord de l'eau' (1875), plus the Romance pour violon (1877). It demonstrates that these pieces, which sought to engage a diverse audience and involve each member in an individualized and interactive aesthetic experience, reveal considerable sophistication below their immediately attractive surfaces. This article also avers that abandonment of misconceptions and prejudices is essential to full appreciation of Gabriel Faure's refined and innovative art.

KW  - WORLD
AB  - Choosing not to have children remains a quietly controversial decision. Curious about the increasing phenomenon of childlessness coinciding with a recognition of her internalised pronatal conditioning and her gradual realisation that she would not be a mother, the author started researching the parenthood decision in the late 1990s. Through autoethnography this paper explores pronatalism and prejudice towards those without child, particularly those who are voluntarily childless-now commonly known beyond academic circles as being "childfree" or "childfree by choice." This exploration includes the lack of attention given to childfreedom in counselling and psychotherapy discourses beyond the therapy room, for example, in workshops, talks, books and papers. It recognises how therapists might offer spaces for creative dialogue about child-bearing-or not-as well as challenging implicit and explicit pronatalism in this intimate area of life. The chapter ends celebrating the "empty womb in the room," reclaiming the potency of the childfree, other than mother body, and the importance of women without children reclaiming the sovereignty of their bodies. The author underlines the importance of creativity as well as procreativity in the anthropocene, as we face interrelated crises, for example the sixth extinction crisis and the climate emergency, and refers to the response of the budding field of ecopsychology.

AB  - Size scholars routinely discuss the negative effects of fat stigma within youth culture. For example, fat kids are more likely to be bullied than their thinner peers, increasing their risk for depression, loneliness, anxiety, and behavior problems. These studies, however, do not adequately address kids' active resistance to fatphobia and size discrimination. In this chapter, I highlight the importance of kids' resistance work at Girls Rock Camp. Pulling from my own experiences as a (fat) camp counselor, I explore the different ways campers push-back against fat stereotypes. While this push-back creates dialogue around size privilege and oppression, organizational obstacles for fat bodies result in conflicting messages about body positivity. Kids challenge size discrimination on an interpersonal level by showing their stomachs, writing anti-shame lyrics, and criticizing unrealistic beauty standards. Adult volunteers, though, continue to navigate organizational sizeism through inaccessible seating, a culture of fat talk, and anti-fat emotional labor. I argue that while Girls Rock Camp indeed helps kids fight against fat prejudice within youth culture, it simultaneously privileges thin adult bodies at an organizational level.

AB  - The belief that women are more emotional than men is one of the strongest gender stereotypes held in Western cultures (Shields, 2002). And yet, gender stereotypes of emotion have received little attention from gender and leadership scholars. In this paper, I review the existing research on gender and emotions and propose that gender stereotypes of emotion present a fundamental barrier to women's ability to ascend to and succeed in leadership roles. I first define the nature of people's gender-emotion stereotypes and outline why perceptions of emotionality may be particularly detrimental to women when they are in high-status positions in work contexts. I then suggest that gender-emotion stereotypes create two complex minefields that female, but not male, leaders have to navigate in order to be successful: (1) identifying how much emotion should be displayed and (2) identifying what kind of emotions should be displayed. Specifically, female leaders can be penalized for even minor or moderate displays of emotion, especially when the emotion conveys dominance (e.g., anger or pride), but being emotionally unexpressive may also result in penalties because unemotional women are seen as failing to fulfill their warm, communal role as women. I conclude by considering the interactive role of race and ethnicity with regards to gender stereotypes of emotion and proposing avenues for future research. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The shortage of human resources in nursing is a global challenge, and males may play an important role in alleviating this shortage, especially in China. Just as single-sex education has a potentially positive impact on women in male-dominated professions, it may also have the same impact on men in nursing, which may promote male engagement in nursing. This study delved into the experiences and perceptions that are peculiar to male nursing students in a single-sex class. A qualitative, descriptive design was employed using conventional content analysis. A purposive sample of 12 male nursing students in a male-only class of a university in China participated. Individual semi-structured interviews were performed between January and March 2019. Data analysis revealed five themes. Considering the negative peer influence and potential communication barriers of a male-only nursing class, establishing a male nursing student alliance instead of a male-only nursing class may be a better choice. In Asian culture, reconstructing the current social norms of gender is crucial to eliminating prejudice and male dividends and changing the definitions of masculinity, all of which are conducive to the development of male involvement in nursing.

AB  - The spiritual dimension of patients has progressively gained more relevance in healthcare in the last decades. However, the term "spiritual" is an open, fluid concept and, for health purposes, no definition of spirituality is universally accepted. Health professionals and researchers have the challenge to cover the entire spectrum of the spiritual level in their practice. This is particularly difficult because most healthcare courses do not prepare their graduates in this field. They also need to face acts of prejudice by their peers or their managers. Here, the authors aim to clarify some common grounds between secular and religious worlds in the realm of spirituality and healthcare. This is a conceptual manuscript based on the available scientific literature and on the authors' experience. The text explores the secular and religious intersection involving spirituality and healthcare, together with the common ground shared by the two fields, and consequent clinical implications. Summarisations presented here can be a didactic beginning for practitioners or scholars involved in health or behavioural sciences. The authors think this construct can favour accepting the patient's spiritual dimension importance by healthcare professionals, treatment institutes, and government policies.

AB  - The influence of personal opinions and biases on scientific conclusions is a threat to the advancement of knowledge. Expertise and experience does not render one immune to this temptation. In this work, one of the founding fathers of statistics, Karl Pearson, is used as an illustration of how even the most talented among us can produce misleading results when inferences are made without caution or reference to potential bias and other analysis limitations. A study performed by Pearson on British Jewish schoolchildren is examined in light of ethical and professional statistical practice. The methodology used and inferences made by Pearson and his coauthor are sometimes questionable and offer insight into how Pearson's support of eugenics and his own British nationalism could have potentially influenced his often careless and far-fetched inferences. A short background into Pearson's work and beliefs is provided, along with an in-depth examination of the authors' overall experimental design and statistical practices. In addition, portions of the study regarding intelligence and tuberculosis are discussed in more detail, along with historical reactions to their work.

AB  - Psychological essentialism is the layperson's belief that social categories are natural and entitative. Studies have shown that essentialist beliefs are strongly connected with different types of prejudice. Previous research into essentialist beliefs predominantly used a variable-centred approach to investigate the relationship between essentialist beliefs and prejudice. Extending this research, we used a person-centred approach to explore the relationship between different essentialist beliefs related to sexual orientation and gender (naturalness, homogeneity, discreteness and informativeness). The study involved 282 (sample 1) and 194 (sample 2) respondents from Russia with different sexual orientations. Using latent profile analysis, we identified three distinct essentialist belief profiles, which are the same for both our target groups, gay men and lesbian women. We examined the relationships between belonging to essentialist belief profiles and social distance towards gay men and lesbian women. We found individuals from various profiles differed in levels of gender identification and right-wing authoritarianism. Individuals with relatively low levels of naturalness beliefs and high levels of essentialist beliefs about the social and psychological differences between gender groups and between heterosexuals and non-heterosexuals demonstrated greater social distance towards gay men and lesbian women compared to respondents with lower essentialist beliefs in the differences between groups.

AB  - Introduction. - Anti-fat attitudes reflect a type of discrimination on the basis of body weight and are one of the last accepted types of social stigma.
   Objective. - To evaluate the effect of exposure to priming messages about the causes of obesity on attitudes toward fat people.
   Method. - Participants (n = 580, M age = 22.19, 64.1% female) were randomly assigned to one of three possible conditions and then provided responses on three AFA subscales: Dislike, Fear of fat, and Willpower.
   Results. - Priming participants with messages confirming/challenging the weight controllability belief was associated with higher/lower levels on Willpower respectively compared to the control group. Unexpectedly, participants in both confirming and challenging groups showed significantly higher scores on Fear of fat. No differences were found on scores indicating Dislike.
   Conclusion. - The current findings emphasize the effect of exposure to information about the causes of obesity on weight controllability beliefs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Negative attitudes toward bisexuals have been documented among heterosexuals as well as lesbians/gay men, and a common theme is that bisexuals would not be suitable romantic or sexual partners. While gender, sexual orientation, and attitudes toward bisexuality influence people's willingness to engage in romantic or sexual activities with a bisexual partner, there are other individual differences that may contribute. The current study examined the associations between four types of conservative beliefs and willingness to engage in romantic/sexual activities with a bisexual partner in a sample of heterosexuals and lesbians/gay men (N= 438). Attitudes toward bisexuality were examined as a mediator of these associations. In general, results indicated that higher social dominance orientation, political conservatism, and essentialist beliefs about the discreteness of homosexuality were associated with lower willingness to engage in romantic/sexual activities with a bisexual partner. Further, more negative attitudes toward bisexuality mediated these associations. There were several meaningful differences in these associations between heterosexual women, heterosexual men, lesbian women, and gay men, suggesting that influences on people's willingness to be romantically or sexually involved with abisexual partner may differ for different gender and sexual orientation groups. Implications for reducing stigma and discrimination against bisexual individuals are addressed.

AB  - We conducted a simulated trial study to investigate the effectiveness of a "gay-panic" provocation defense as a function of jurors' political orientation. Mock jurors read about a murder case in which a male defendant claimed a victim provoked the killing by starting a fight, which either included or did not include the male victim making an unwanted sexual advance that triggered a state of panic in the defendant. Conservative jurors were significantly less punitive when the defendant claimed to have acted out of gay panic as compared to when this element was not part of the defense. In contrast, liberal jurors were unaffected by the gay-panic manipulation. The effect of the gay-panic defense on punitiveness was mediated by conservatives' decreased moral outrage toward the defendant. Implications for psychological theory and the legal system are discussed.

AB  - Although there is a growing body of work concerning cross-group friendship and intergroup attitudes, this work typically focuses on a limited number of interpersonal processes among established friendships. In addition, little is known about the role of group-related processes within such friendships. Two studies were conducted to address this gap. Results from a retrospective online survey and a longitudinal study reveal that both interpersonal friendship processes (e.g., intimacy, affection, trust, self-disclosure) and intergroup friendship processes (e.g., belief that outgroup friend respects one's own group, spending time with outgroup friend's family members and friends) are associated with positive intergroup attitudes. Specifically, the current findings suggest that interpersonal friendship processes are vital to fostering positive attitudes for the outgroup early in the relationship, but that intergroup friendship processes become more strongly linked to attitudes once the relationship progresses. Results may inform interventions designed to promote positive interactions across "real-world" group boundaries.

AB  - The successful impact of healthy eating campaigns often depends on the extent to which messages are effective in changing attitudes and behaviors over time. The present work proposes that healthy eating campaigns can be designed taking into consideration elaboration and validation processes so that the degree of attitude change is maximally influenced and is consequential. The first set of studies described in this review demonstrates the importance of considering elaboration in determining initial attitudes toward healthy foods as well as the subsequent attitude strength consequences (e.g., stability, prediction of behavior, spreading). The second set of studies focuses on the role of perceived validity of one's thoughts in the domain of eating as a potential mediator of the persuasion process. These studies include campaigns promoting positive attitudes toward healthy eating (e.g., eating of vegetables and fruits), and interventions oriented to decreasing the intake of unhealthy food (e.g., taxing junk food). We also discuss the role of modality of information presentation (e.g., verbal and visual information vs. direct physical experience) in those studies. Finally, the review offers a tutorial with concrete recommendations that researchers, practitioners and public policy makers can follow in order to predict both short and long-term attitude and behavior changes.

AB  - A well-known result, the person-group discrimination discrepancy (PGDD), shows that members of disadvantaged groups believe that other members of their social groups are discriminated against, but that they themselves are not. In this paper, we test whether this explicit self-protective strategy is also obtained on indirect measures of personal discrimination. Three experiments, using both explicit (self-report) and implicit (IAT) measures of discrimination showed that although members of disadvantaged groups do not explicitly report self-discrimination (replicating previous research), they do reveal self-discrimination on the implicit measure. That the PGDD effect is bound to explicit measurement should be recognized both when implementing research protocols and when understanding the effects of discrimination whether it is consciously recognized or not.

AB  - Despite the widely ratified United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, support for civil liberties is easily eroded in times of threat. Understanding which factors moderate the relationship between threat and support for civil liberties is critical, yet remains relatively unexplored. In this study, we test a double moderation model in which support for the restriction of civil liberties in the face of threat is moderated by both right-wing authoritarianism and political sophistication. In a national representative dataset (N = 12,507), those low on right-wing authoritarianism became more like their high right-wing authoritarian peers in the face of threat. Also, those more sophisticated about political issues were less supportive of restrictions on civil liberties, but only when threat was low. We tested this model on both restrictions for the in-group, in terms of being wiretapped, and for the out-group, in terms of torturing suspected terrorists. Our results suggest that increasing political sophistication may have desirable consequences when considering the outcomes for in-group members, and we argue for increased efforts to expand the in-group we seek to protect.

It reviews basic principles and the interpretation of the 1982 UN Law of the Sea Convention and the CLCS Rules. As the 2006 Annex VII Barbados/Trinidad and Tobago Award and the 2012 ITLOS Bangladesh v. Myanmar Judgment reaffirmed, the CLCS Recommendations must in no way prejudice existing and prospective boundary delimitations, nor must they prejudice other land or maritime disputes. All practical means of giving effect to such "without prejudice" principles are carefully analysed. The present Part covers Latin America and the Wider Caribbean, Northeast and Southeast Asia, and the South Pacific. Part Two will cover South Asia and the Middle East, East Africa-Indian Ocean, South Africa, West Africa and North Africa.

AB  - Background People with intellectual disability (ID) are often socially isolated, and many experience stigma and discrimination. Increased contact with the general public is thought to overcome prejudices. This large-scale international study had three main aims: to determine the type and frequency of contact that the general public has with people with ID; to identify the personal characteristics of those who have greater contact; and to examine the public's level of comfort at the prospect of having contact with people with ID.
   Method Self-completed online questionnaires were administered to nationally representative panels of respondents in 17 countries; totally 24 504 persons. Multivariate analyses were used to identify respondents more likely to have had frequent personal contact with persons with ID from those with infrequent or no contact and those respondents who were most comfortable at meeting a person with ID.
   Results Internationally around one in four of the general population reports having frequent personal contact with people who have an ID although this varied from 7% in Japan to 46% in Panama. The principal forms of contact were through friendships, neighbours or extended family members. Over all countries, volunteering and engagement with Special Olympics were the two main predictors of frequent personal contact followed by employment in the education, health or social care field, being a parent of children under 18 years, playing sports and being employed. People who reported frequent personal contact were also more comfortable at meeting a person with ID.
   Conclusions This international dataset provides a baseline against which public contact can be compared across countries and changes monitored over time. The findings suggest ways in which greater contact can be promoted and making the public more comfortable at meeting people with ID.

AB  - Aims and objectives. To investigate nursing students' attitudes towards providing sexual health care in clinical practice and to identify associated factors.
   Background. Sexual health care is an important component of holistic health care. Nurses' personal sexual knowledge and attitudes are shown to influence provision of sexual health care.
   Design. This is a descriptive, cross-sectional study.
   Methods. We selected 146 senior nursing students by convenience sampling from nursing schools in two medical universities in central Taiwan. Data were collected using the Nursing Attitudes on Sexual Health Care scale developed based on the Permission/Limited Information/Specific Suggestions/Intensive Therapy' model. Higher scores indicated more positive attitudes.
   Results. Participants' mean age was 22 center dot 15years. Mean total Nursing Attitudes on Sexual Health Care scores ranged from 45-75 (61 center dot 40 +/- 10 center dot 17). Nursing students' most positive attitudes towards Permission/Limited Information/Specific Suggestions/Intensive Therapy sexual healthcare interventions were at the Permission level, and least positive attitudes were at levels of Specific Suggestion and Intensive Therapy. The top three positive items were as follows: accept patients' expression of sexual concerns, initiate discussions and encourage patients to talk. Male nursing students had negative attitudes towards sexual healthcare interventions, which became more positive as age increased, especially at the Limited Information level.
   Conclusions. Nursing students had different attitudes towards different levels of sexual health care in the Permission/Limited Information/Specific Suggestions/Intensive Therapy model. Attitudes were associated with age and gender. The Nursing Attitudes on Sexual Health Care scale is useful and reliable for identifying nurses' attitudes towards providing sexual health care.
   Relevance to clinical practice. The Permission/Limited Information/Specific Suggestions/Intensive Therapy-based Nursing Attitudes on Sexual Health Care scale helps to identify nurses' attitudes. A better understanding of nurses' attitudes towards provisional sexual health care will provide information needed to develop appropriate education programmes to improve delivery of sexual health care.

AB  - A large number of churches hire youth pastors or workers to support their ministry for adolescents and young adults. An empirical exploration of whether and how youth pastors influence youth attitudes toward the church and denomination remains to be done, however This study using a nationwide youth survey data set, attempts to fill this research gap. The results affirm hiring a youth pastor or worker is an effective way to develop and maintain quality programs in the church, which in turn induce youth to remain faithful to the denomination. This study also confirms a positive link between caring pastorship and youths' attitudes toward the church, although it is far from obvious that most youth pastors successfully adopt relational ministry

AB  - Although female singlehood has become a lifestyle in western countries, never married and being over 30 is still viewed as "special" in contemporary China. Chinese single females live in a culture of traditional social prejudice against singlehood. Traditional family and societal values in general place pressure on single females to marry and have a child. This phenomenological study explores the meaning of being single and presents a firsthand view of how such women feel. Ten never-married single females over 30 years of age took part in one-on-one telephone interviews. Constant comparison data analysis revealed three major themes in their lived experiences of being single: (1) awareness of the advantages and disadvantages of singlehood; (2) ambiguous attitudes towards marriage; and (3) adjustments in life needed to make living as singles worthwhile.

AB  - Teachers? decisions to nominate the students whom they think are gifted and talented can seriously be negatively influenced by their possible prejudices and lack of knowledge. In this respect, it is considered that it is important to compare the teachers? nomination decisions with the tests used to officially identify gifted and talented students. In this study, it is aimed to identify the relationship between the teachers? nominations and the results from the Raven Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM) of students who are identified as gifted or non-gifted. Also, the effects of gender on teacher?s nominations or RSPM results have been examined. The relational survey model, one of the quantitative research models, was used in the research. The number of students to be included in the research was determined by using stratified sampling, which is one of the probabilistic sampling methods. Accordingly, 385 students studying from the 1st grade to the 4th grade in the selected schools formed the sample of the research. In this study, RSPM was used to determine whether students are gifted or not. Teachers were also given a form in which they could list the students? names, surnames, and gender to nominate the gifted students. Chi-square test was used in the analysis of the data obtained from the research. If the relationship was significant as a result of the chi-square test analysis, the strength of the relationship was examined by using Phi & Cramer V test. According to the obtained results, although there was an acceptable significant relationship between RSPM results and teacher?s nominations in diagnosing gifted students, it was observed that success of the teachers? nomination was not sufficient, and RSPM results, teachers? nominations and gender factor were not related. Also, the results indicate that teachers showed a bias towards male students in nomination.

AB  - Man is born into a tangle of standard processes and behaviour patterns created and modified over time. Through gradual socialization, he acquires the attributes of his own culture and gets acquainted with the admissible modus operandi for the social group he is a member of; he also deepens these principles and confronts them with the experiences of others. Stereotyping is a process that represents the initial classification of phenomena and people, which it categorizes into groups and assigns them positive or negative characteristics. Stereotypes form the ideas that people have about themselves and 'their' group with which they identify and are aimed at members of other groups with which they do not identify. Negative stereotypes about other people arise from pursuing one's own positive social identity and positive self-presentation. Stereotyping of believers occurs precisely because of perceived differences between 'we' and 'them' (for example, in attitudes and values, possibly in 'religious' practice). Stereotypes are often the unconscious 'beginning' of a range of known intolerant attitudes; they can lead to racism, anti-Semitism, ethnic discrimination, and other forms of intolerance. According to the experts, no nation has innate attitudes to hate, as they cannot be inherited in a biological-psychological sense. Intolerance is acquired, often to justify negative attitudes and behaviours. Using the qualitative method of guided group interviews (the so-called focus group), we examine the existence of stereotypes in university students towards their religious classmates. We consider the potential of social exclusion of young believers due to stereotypes and present current measures in prevention.

AB  - We examined whether zero-sum thinking explains White Australian-born people's majority-culture perceptions of discrimination towards their ingroup and an outgroup (immigrants), and the relationships among perceived discrimination and support for multiculturalism and immigration. Two correlational cross-sectional studies were conducted among self-identified White Australians (Study 1, N = 517), and White Americans (Study 2, N = 273), as well as an experiment among White Australians (Study 3, N = 121) in which we manipulated discrimination towards immigrants over time. Our findings did not support a zero-sum account but revealed that perceptions of group discrimination were positively correlated: a case of 'they're discriminated against, but so are we' rather than 'if they gain, we lose'. Moreover, concerns about future discrimination of the ingroup were most predictive of opposition to multicultural policy and immigration. We argue our findings are more consistent with a competitive victimhood account of intergroup relations than a zero-sum thinking account.

AB  - Background: A number of studies have indicated that students lose idealistic motivations over the course of medical education, with some identifying the initiation of this decline as occurring as early as the second year of the traditional US curricula. This study builds on prior work testing the hypothesis that a decline in medical student idealism is detectable in the first two years of medical school.
   Methods: The original study sought to identify differences in survey responses between first-year (MS1) and second-year (MS2) medical students at the beginning and end of academic year 2010, on three proxies for idealism. The current study extends that work by administering the same survey items to the same student cohorts at the end of their third and fourth years (MS3 and MS4), respectively. Survey topics included questions on: (a) motivations for pursuing a medical career; (b) specialty choice; and (c) attitudes toward primary care. Principle component analysis was used to extract linear composite variables (LCVs) from responses to each group of questions. Linear regression was then used to test the effect of the six cohort/time-points on each composite variable, controlling for demographic characteristics.
   Results: Idealism in medicine decreased (beta = -.113, p<.001) while emphasis on employment and job security increased (beta =.146, p<.001) as motivators of pursuing a career in medicine at each medical school stage and time period. Students were more likely to be motivated by student debt over interest in content in specialty choice (beta = .077, p = .004) across medical school stages. Negative attitudes towards primary care were most sensitive to MS group and time effects. Both negative/antagonistic views (beta = .142, p<.001) and negative/sympathetic views (beta = .091, p<.001) of primary care increased over each stage.
   Conclusions: Our results provide further evidence that declines in medical student idealism may occur as early as the second year of medical education. Additionally, as students make choices in their medical careers, such as specialty choice or consideration of primary care, the influences of job security, student debt and social status increasingly outweigh idealistic motivations.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the knowledge and attitudes in Moscow towards people with epilepsy (PWE).
   Methods: Data were collected from 1167 adults, permanent residents of Moscow, who were interviewed. A 10 -item questionnaire was used addressing three major domains: familiarity with epilepsy (2 questions), understanding of epilepsy (5 questions), and attitude towards the PWE (3 questions). Results were standardized to the Moscow population.
   Results: The study population was generally well informed about epilepsy. About 80% "has heard" of epilepsy; however, personal acquaintance with PWE was reported by less than half of the study participants. The level of understanding of the disease and its etiology was quite low. About 60% of the survey participants believed that epilepsy was a type of mental retardation. One-third (34%) of respondents were afraid to stay in the proximity of PWE. Only 38% of the survey participants considered epilepsy to be curable; men significantly less frequently than women. Overall, the level of understanding of epilepsy was proportional to the level of education of respondents.
   Negative attitudes towards PWE were demonstrated in a significant part of the population. Almost half of the respondents would object to their child playing or studying with a child who has epilepsy and more than half (57%) were against the marriage of their daughter or son to a person with epilepsy. Two-fifths of the respondents ranked epilepsy as the "least preferred" of the six chronic diseases for a colleague.
   Conclusion: This is the first study on awareness and attitudes to PWE in the adult population of Moscow. The study demonstrated that the general public is familiar with epilepsy, but has a rather low level of understanding of essential aspects of the disease. There is an overall high level of negative attitudes towards PWE in Russia, creating a need for targeted interventions. These results reinforced the importance of public education in reducing the stigma of epilepsy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Past research has assumed that social egalitarians reject group-based hierarchies and advocate for equal treatment of all groups. However, contrary to popular belief, we argue that egalitarian advocacy predicts greater likelihood to support "Succession"-based ageism, which prescribes that older adults step aside to free up coveted opportunities (e.g., by retiring). Although facing their own forms of discrimination, older individuals are perceived as blocking younger people, and other unrepresented groups, from opportunities-that in turn, motivates egalitarian advocates to actively discriminate against older adults. In 9 separate studies (N = 3,277), we demonstrate that egalitarian advocates endorse less prejudice toward, and show more support for, women and racial minorities, but harbor more prejudice toward (Studies 1 and 2), and show less advocacy for (Studies 3-6), older individuals. We demonstrate downstream consequences of this effect, such as support for, and resource allocation to, diversity initiatives (Studies 3-6). Further, we isolate perceived opportunity blocking as a critical mediator, demonstrating that egalitarian advocates believe that older individuals actively obstruct more deserving groups from receiving necessary resources and support to get ahead (Studies 4-6). Finally, we explore the intersectional nature of this effect (Study 7). Together this research suggests that when it comes to egalitarianism, equality for all may only mean equality for some.

AB  - Previous studies have yielded ambiguous results regarding the impact of income and financial experience on the decision of residential borrowers to strategically default. One explanation for these findings is the presence of an interaction effect between income and financial experience, which was ignored in earlier studies. We hypothesize that borrowers with a greater ability to assess the financial benefits of strategic default, due to a higher financial experience, and overcome the financial consequences of it, due to higher incomes, have fewer negative attitudes towards strategic default. We capture negative attitudes of US homeowners (borrowers) by measuring their anger towards residential borrowers who decided to strategically default. In particular, we (1) ask them to self-report their anger and (2) measure their anger with artificial intelligence (AI)-based emotion recognition software. We find evidence for the hypothesized interaction effect: Borrowers with higher incomes and greater financial experience, particularly regarding value of money, savings, and investments, have fewer negative attitudes towards strategic default. Our results have implications for mortgage lenders. While borrowers with higher incomes and more financial experience are likely to have a lower economic default risk, their strategic default risk may be higher.

AB  - As an assistant professor who teaches clinical psychology trainees about social aspects of behavior, I devote one week to the topic of weight bias. In this class, I rely on the research literature to challenge common myths about "obesity," demonstrate the pervasiveness and harm of weight bias, and offer recommendations to trainees to apply to their own professional and personal lives. I encourage trainees to shift focus from weight and weight loss to health and well-being and to engage in self-reflection on the role of weight bias in their interactions with others. Here, I describe my weight bias seminar and outline common questions and my responses to them (e.g., Do you actually believe that "obese" people can be healthy?). Weight bias is a neglected topic in most clinical psychology training programs. Weight bias must be addressed in clinical psychology programs to produce culturally competent graduates who are aware of diversity issues.

It reviews basic principles and the interpretation of the 1982 UN Law of the Sea Convention and the CLCS Rules. As the 2006 Barbados! Trinidad and Tobago Award and the 2012 ITLOS Bangladesh v. Myanmar Judgment reaffirmed, the CLCS Recommendations must in no way prejudice existing and prospective boundary delimitations, nor must they prejudice other land or maritime disputes. All practical means of giving effect to such "without prejudice" principles are carefully analysed. Part One covers Latin America and the Wider Caribbean, Northeast and Southeast Asia, and the South Pacific. The present Part Two covers South Asia and the Middle East, East Africa-Indian Ocean, South Africa, West Africa and North Africa.

AB  - Through a personal narrative account, this paper explores the nature of the author's cognitive dissonance experienced during a traverse of a high-altitude ski mountaineering objective (Nevado Ishinca 5530 m) in Peru's Cordillera Blanca. The author experienced psychological discomfort in the ascent and a role of self in determining a continued commitment with the ski mountaineering challenge. Distraction, trivialization, act rationalization and finally attitude change were all used in attempt to reduce negative levels of cognitive dissonance. The lack of consonant cognitions to support abandoning the climb, the notion of free choice, the role of self-concept and self-esteem values motivated continued commitment until the negative levels of arousal subsided. Through a challenging mountaineering experience, I developed a greater self-awareness of the role of commitment to an objective which could be applied to other life events and experiences.

KW  - PUBLIC-OPINION
AB  - Large-scale military aggression is argued to damage the international image of the aggressor and mobilize global public opinion against it. Previous cross-country research also finds that negative views of the aggressor are usually limited to the government and do not extend to the citizens of the invading country. Our article provides micro-level evidence on attitude change toward Russia as a country, the Russian people, and the Russian government after its invasion of Ukraine. We use data from a survey conducted between the morning of 21 February 2022 (3 days before the Russian invasion of Ukraine) and the night of 28 February 2022 (5 days after the invasion) in the United States to evaluate how the Russian invasion of Ukraine affected attitudes toward the country, its people, and the government. We also conduct a subgroup analysis to explore the magnitude of attitude change across sociodemographic and political subgroups after the invasion. Our findings show fairly significant damage to the image of Russia as a country as well as the Russian government. However, the reputational damage of the Russian people is minimal. The results also suggest that Republican and religious subgroups had the largest attitude change on Russia and the Russian government.

AB  - While a persuasion network has been proposed, little is known about how network connections between brain regions contribute to attitude change. Two possible mechanisms have been advanced. One hypothesis predicts that attitude change results from increased connectivity between structures implicated in affective and executive processing in response to increases in argument strength. A second functional perspective suggests that highly arousing messages reduce connectivity between structures implicated in the encoding of sensory information, which disrupts message processing and thereby inhibits attitude change. However, persuasion is a multi-determined construct that results from both message features and audience characteristics. Therefore, persuasive messages should lead to specific functional connectivity patterns among a priori defined structures within the persuasion network. The present study exposed 28 subjects to anti-drug public service announcements where arousal, argument strength, and subject drug-use risk were systematically varied. Psychophysiological interaction analyses provide support for the affective-executive hypothesis but not for the encoding-disruption hypothesis. Secondary analyses show that video-level connectivity patterns among structures within the persuasion network predict audience responses in independent samples ( one college-aged, one nationally representative). We propose that persuasion neuroscience research is best advanced by considering network-level effects while accounting for interactions between message features and target audience characteristics.

TI  - INSURMOUNTABLE OBSTACLES: STRUCTURAL ERRORS, PROCEDURAL DEFAULT, AND INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE
T2  - STANFORD LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - Federal habeas corpus procedure involves an elaborate set of rules for when state criminal judgments may be reviewed by federal courts. One of these rules the procedural default rule forbids federal courts to review state judgments if the state court rejected the proposed claim on procedural grounds. This bar may be overcome by a showing of cause and prejudice (a showing that the outcome of the trial would have been different absent the error). In enforcing this rule, federal courts have failed to realize that there are some claims for which a showing of prejudice is never possible. These claims, sometimes called "structural errors," are exempt from harmless error review when they arise on direct appeal; in that context, courts have realized that demanding a showing that the error changed the outcome would in many cases be asking the impossible. A particularly troubling example arises when defendants raise Batson claims; a prejudice requirement for such claims would mean that defendants would have to prove that a jury selected in the absence of racial discrimination would have reached a different verdict. Courts have realized that such a showing generally cannot be made, and they have granted relief anyway. What courts have not uniformly acknowledged is that the showing of prejudice is equally impossible in the habeas context. Instead, some courts have decided that prejudice can be presumed for structural errors in this posture, and other courts have required the impossible showing meaning that such claims are doomed to fail under the procedural default rule in every instance, even where other, less serious claims can sometimes overcome the bar. This Note identifies and traces the two clashing strands of case law the structural error cases and the procedural default cases and explicates the underlying incompatibility. It then examines cases that have attempted to adjudicate such claims, and finally proposes a solution: that courts should modify, their procedural default test to accommodate these claims.

AB  - Weight bias is a neglected issue in the health professions, including mental health training programs. Even though mental health professionals exhibit many of the same weight biases that are seen at the societal level and among other health professionals, mental health programs rarely provide training on weight bias, weight diversity, or critical weight science. No study to date has tested the effectiveness of a weight bias reduction intervention in a mental health setting. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy of a weight bias seminar informed by the attribution-value model of prejudice. Using a pretest-posttest design, 45 clinical psychology trainees completed measures of weight controllability beliefs, anti-fat attitudes, and attitudes toward fat clients 1 week before and 1 week after the weight bias seminar. After the weight bias seminar, participants reported weaker weight controllability beliefs, anti-fat attitudes, and negative client attitudes. Furthermore, weight controllability beliefs mediated the effect of the weight bias seminar on participants' general anti-fat attitudes and client-specific attitudes. Thus, this study identifies weight controllability beliefs as a potential mechanism underlying the efficacy of educational weight bias interventions in mental health training programs. Future weight bias educational interventions may benefit from application of the attribution-value model of prejudice.

AB  - Scholars view racial identity as a fluid social construction that can shift with time and context. But outside of academia, do people intuitively see racial identity as fluid or fixed? Four studies reveal that people see racial identity as varying flexibly with the social context-in particular, assimilating to the race of one's friends. Participants perceived the same Black-White Biracial men as identifying as more Black (Study 1) and wanting to be perceived as more stereotypically Black (i.e., athletic; Study 3c) when with Black friends than when alone. Conversely, Biracial men were perceived as identifying as more White (Study 2) and wanting to be perceived as more stereotypically White (i.e., competent and well-spoken; Studies 3a, 3b) when with White friends. Fluid inferences of racial identity also extended to Monoracial people (Studies 4a, 4b). We conclude that people perceive others' racial identity as shifting with the social contexteliciting distinct biases.

AB  - Stigma may have detrimental effects on the rights of individuals with disabilities. This study examined the association between stigma and the perception of rights of people with Intellectual disabilities and people with physical disabilities. Telephone interviews using vignette methodology were conducted with a nationally representative sample of 605 adults. Items included stereotypes, prejudice, behavioral reactions and the perception of rights of these individuals. More negative stereotypes, greater social distance and greater withdrawal behaviors were found toward people with intellectual disabilities as compared to people with physical disabilities. Lower support of rights was found toward people with intellectual disabilities as compared to people with physical disabilities. Lower degree of acceptance and higher perception of dangerousness were associated with greater social distance, which was related to lower perception of rights. Programs should aim at decreasing social distance to improve support to exercise rights, especially among people with intellectual disabilities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examined the effects of ad prominence and persuasion knowledge (PK) priming on game users' responses to in-game ads, the advertised brands, and the game. The experimental results suggested that game players showed more negative attitudes toward the brand and the game in response to high prominence ads. In addition, there was a significant interaction between ad prominence and PK priming on recall and attitudes. High prominence ads resulted in better product recall, only when PK was not primed. In contrast, high prominence ads resulted in more negative attitudes toward the game and game players' lower intention to play the game in the future, only when PK was primed. These results suggest that high prominence ads might be preferred when PK is not primed, whereas low prominence ads might be preferred when PK is primed. This study contributes to research on the effects of in-game ads in mobile games and provides practical implications for advertisers and game developers.

TI  - Attitudes towards vaccines and intention to vaccinate against COVID-19: Implications for public health communications
T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-EUROPE
LA  - English
KW  - COVID-19
KW  - Attitudes towards vaccines
KW  - Vaccine refusal
AB  - Background: Negative attitudes towards vaccines and an uncertainty or unwillingness to receive vaccinations are major barriers to managing the COVID-19 pandemic in the long-term. We estimate predictors of four domains of negative attitudes towards vaccines and identify groups most at risk of uncertainty and unwillingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine in a large sample of UK adults.
   Methods: Data were cross-sectional and from 32,361 adults in the UCL COVID-19 Social Study. Ordinary least squares regression analyses examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors on four types of negative vaccine attitudes: mistrust of vaccine benefit, worries about unforeseen effects, concerns about commercial profiteering, and preference for natural immunity. Multinomial regression examined the impact of socio-demographic and COVID-19 related factors, negative vaccine attitudes, and prior vaccine behaviour on uncertainty and unwillingness to be vaccinated for COVID-19.
   Findings: 16% of respondents displayed high levels of mistrust about vaccines across one or more domains. Distrustful attitudes towards vaccination were higher amongst individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds, with lower levels of education, lower annual income, poor knowledge of COVID-19, and poor compliance with government COVID-19 guidelines. Overall, 14% of respondents reported unwillingness to receive a vaccine for COVID-19, whilst 23% were unsure. The largest predictors of both COVID-19 vaccine uncertainty and refusal were low-income groups (< 16,000 pound, a year), having not received a flu vaccine last year, poor adherence to COVID-19 government guidelines, female gender, and living with children. Amongst vaccine attitudes, intermediate to high levels of mistrust of vaccine benefit and concerns about future unforeseen side effects were the most important determinants of both uncertainty and unwillingness to vaccinate against COVID-19.
   Interpretation: Negative attitudes towards vaccines are a major public health concern in the UK. General mistrust in vaccines and concerns about future side effects in particular will be barriers to achieving population immunity to COVID-19 through vaccination. Public health messaging should be tailored to address these concerns and specifically to women, ethnic minorities, and people with lower levels of education and incomes. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an increase in the factors that typically facilitate the endorsement of materialistic values (e.g., higher media consumption, stress and anxiety, loneliness, death anxiety, and lower moods). In this paper, we examine how contextual changes affecting the antecedents of materialism influence its advocacy with a mixed-method approach. First, a correlational study (Study 1) suggests that increases in media consumption and stress and anxiety during the pandemic predicted current levels of materialism, however, these effects were limited. Second, contrary to our expectations, a longitudinal study (Study 2) shows that people's focus on money decreased during the pandemic. Last, a social media content analysis (Study 3) reveals a downward trend in users' online discourses about consumption-related behaviors, but an upward trend in brands promoting spending as a way to attain well-being. The observed effects could fuel deeper societal change in the labor market and in consumer behavior, and have further implications for individual and societal well-being in a post-pandemic world. We recommend future interventions aimed at diminishing materialistic attitudes to examine the effects of decreasing media consumption and to explore how other factors introduced by the pandemic (e.g., a health or well-being focus) might moderate its advocacy.

AB  - This article discusses the essential need for developing the Bantu languages of South Africa into fully-fledged standard languages. Departing from the standard definition of standard language, and emphasising the notion of fully-fledged standard language, it points out - with reference to communities' negative attitudes to the prescribed 'standards', the lack of competency in these varieties, the use of urban vernaculars (even in school contexts) and the preference for English as 'symbol of prestige, eloquence and beauty' - that the Bantu languages still need considerable development. The article then discusses the factors which impact on standardisation; the processes involved (top down, bottom up); and the agencies necessary for the development of standard varieties. A series of questions conclude the article: how supportive are the post-1994 contexts of the development of Bantu languages? Are there activists and NGOs who can drive these developmental processes? Why is there so little community pressure in this regard?.

AB  - In this paper we examine the role of Hip Hop and rap lyrics in the reevaluation and legitimization of a new multiethnolectal speech style developed in multiethnic and multilingual environments in Oslo, Norway. This speech style, commonly referred to as "Kebab-Norwegian", has been met with negative attitudes not only from the establishment but also in mainstream media. However, attitudes seem to be changing, partly due to the efforts of rappers from immigrant backgrounds who promote themselves as users and propagators of the new speech style. They take a clear stance against the prevalent idea that "Kebab-Norwegian" poses a threat to the Norwegian language. In our paper we present on-going research on some of the most recent high school textbooks where lyrics from these performers have been included, and we also consider the strategies of promotion employed by some of the publishing houses.

AB  - In the midst of rising tension between China and Japan, two powerful countries in Asia, the favorable attitudes of each country's citizens toward the other country have dropped to a historical low. The Taiwan issue, historical legacy, island disputes, and maritime resource competition are major obstacles in Sino-Japanese relations, but the most fundamental issue is a deep-seated mutual distrust and suspicion between the two countries, which result in rising threat perceptions. Beyond the structural and political elite-centered approaches, this study examines the evidence related to the three approaches (face-to-face contact, cross-cultural exposure, and social identity) to reduce mutual distrust and antipathy in the two countries. With a careful analysis of the survey data, this study sheds light on the conditions under which contact (a) results in improved attitudes toward outgroup, (b) has little or no effect on intergroup relations, and (c) yields more prejudice and hostility toward the outgroup. The findings of this study not only identify factors that could facilitate mutual understanding between Chinese and Japanese people and more favorable impressions of one another, but are also relevant to planning interventions to reduce prejudice and distrust among people from different races, religions, and countries.

AB  - Background Although primary care physicians are highly involved in the detection and management of schizophrenia since the early stages, prior research has shown that they hold negative attitudes toward patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. We aimed to compare attitudes towards schizophrenia between family medicine residents and non-medical students. Method This was a cross-sectional study. A 18-item questionnaire concerning attitudes toward schizophrenia was used. Results The two participant groups held similar attitudes in terms of "social distance", "belief of dangerousness" and "skepticism regarding treatment". After controlling for confounders, help-seeking intentions contributed negatively to the prediction of attitudes toward schizophrenia in the non-medical students, and accounted for 5.3% of their variance. Conclusions Implementing anti-stigma programs in medical schools, reviewing the current medical curriculum and the family medicine residency programme to help improve future physicians' attitudes and prepare them to provide primary mental health care to young help-seekers who experience psychosis should be given priority attention.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to incorporate a model of prejudice reduction and cultural identity development theory to assess: the implementation of a diversity case study in a disaster management course; and the cultural competency understanding among the students.
   Design/methodology/approach - A diversity case study was implemented in an undergraduate Disaster Response and Recovery course (Fall 2013 n = 17; Spring 2014 n = 21; Fall 2014 n = 35). The discussion encouraged students to contemplate how their biases, preconceived notions, and stereotypes affect their future role in emergency management.
   Findings - Results from Likert scale pre/post tests showed a marked increase in knowledge and a positive change in attitudes (p<0.05). Open-responses denoted linkages to the prejudice reduction model and cultural identity development theory.
   Research limitations/implications - Bias can be attributed to the instructor and facilitator, and contextual limitations including a lack of: previous conversations and courses on diversity-related topics and participation motivation.
   Practical implications - By developing cultural competency, managers initiate intergroup contact reducing negative perceptions and increasing empathy for those deemed different. Integrating cultural competency into emergency management academic programs allows students to identify how their biases, stereotypes, and preconceived notions affect their performance.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to the literature by focussing on implementing a diversity case study to explore cultural competency, which is lacking in emergency management higher education. The diversity case study and instructional design could be adopted in disaster management courses.

AB  - The article examines the origins of the phrase "oom-shmoom" that has become emblematic of Israel's negative attitudes to the United Nations. The discussion is situated in the context of the competing foreign-policy schools of thought associated with David Ben-Gurion (activist, militant) and Moshe Sharett (diplomatic, moderate). It looks at examples from the 1950s illustrating the rhetorical uses that politicians made of the slogan in order to denigrate rivals for their presumed lack of toughness and inadequate concern for Israel's security needs. While much about Israel's foreign policy during its early years can be explained in terms the Ben-Gurion/Sharett dichotomy, the differences between the Ben-Gurionists and the Sharettists regarding "oom-shmoom" were more often in the realm of rhetoric than in action and policy. In their day-to-day political decisions, both Ben-Gurion and Sharett showed a healthy respect for the UN and for the great powers which stood ready to back UN decisions.

AB  - The impact of Covid-19 has had a far reaching effect on higher education institutions. However, few studies report on the relative perceptions of students about face-to-face (F2F) and blended learning (BL) in periods when Covid-19 is/not a consideration. Using a sample of 103/79 undergraduate students, a mixed-method approach is utilized to report qualitative and quantitative evidence regarding student perceptions. The results demonstrate BL is perceived more positively during the Covid-19 pandemic. However, F2F is preferred to BL when Covid is not an issue. F2F learning is perceived more positively to BL because students feel that there are limitations to BL in terms of; interactions with the lecturer; group work; peer engagement; class involvement; and the ability to ask questions about technical information. Moreover, qualitative evidence shows that students perceive F2F to be superior to BL because social elements expected in a F2F environment may not be embedded into netiquette frameworks. From a policymaking standpoint, we encourage embedding social elements into BL to enhance student experience so that student's negative attitudes regarding the transition from F2F delivery to online/BL can be minimized. From a practical standpoint, we provide insights about strategies to embed socials elements into netiquette frameworks.

AB  - Globally, older adults, especially nursing home residents, are at a higher risk of suicide. This study examined the life of nursing home residents with suicidal ideations and their help-seeking experiences. A qualitative analysis of 19 semi-structured interviews was conducted. Results indicate that suicidal ideations among nursing home residents correlates with their negative life experiences, both personally and institutionally. In terms of their life experiences, themes included the desire for death, emotional loneliness, a state of discomfort arising from incapacity, feeling like a burden on children, and dealing with the low-quality service. Older adults' negative attitudes toward seeking assistance as well as limited resort resources and ineffective help-seeking hinder them from finding more support or treatment. This study adds to a growing body of research on late-life suicide in institutional settings, and relevant findings can serve as references in improving nursing home residents' life quality and developing suicide-prevention strategies.

AB  - Negative attitudes are a major barrier to the equality of people with disabilities. Governments and other organizations have implemented numerous programmes to change attitudes towards people with disabilities. We analyse published evidence about the effectiveness of such programmes using a framework of the interrelationship among three levels of policy intervention to change attitudes: personal level directed at changing the attitudes of individuals; organizational level concerning attitudinal barriers in domains such as employment, education and health; and government level - legally mandating behaviour change. The analysis finds that the following policy types can be effective if used together: policies that involve direct contact with people with disability; information and awareness campaigns; education and training about disability; and antidiscrimination enforcement. Policy characteristics that contribute to effectiveness include a positive programme experience for participants; multifaceted and prolonged interventions; and adequate programme resources. Policy effectiveness to change attitudes relies on corresponding reinforcement at all three policy levels.

AB  - This article explores the disability related identity experiences of young people with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. Using a narrative inquiry methodology, 25 young people between 18 and 29 years participated in in-depth interviews. Their narratives highlighted growing perceptions of difference and how the negative actions and attitudes of a few people in their past continued to shadow their current lives. Influenced by perceived negative attitudes of others to disability and their own internalisation of these, the young people conceptualise a binary of normalcy and difference, finding themselves liminally positioned, somewhere in between, and mostly seeking to avoid a disability association. In new social situations, the young people reported engaging in disability identity management work, while often resisting having disability as part of their identity. These can be conceptualised as acts of resilience and of resistance in the face of oppressive social forces. There is a powerful counter narrative in a sub group of the participants who were actively engaged with peers with experience of disability. For these young people, the inclusion of disability within social identities became possible. The findings of this study have implications for our understandings of managing identities in young lives, particularly for those in marginal positions.

AB  - This study examines the determinants of using (non-)fluoroscopy-guided positioning (FGP) for radiographs, in order to improve the use of non- FGP imaging techniques.
   We focused on knowledge and attitudes of radiographers and radiologists with respect to applying non- FGP in radiography and organizational factors. We analyzed data from an in-depth multiple case study that includes observations and field notes, interviews, documents and images collected from the radiology departments of four hospitals. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) was used to frame the findings.
   We found that inadequate skills and insufficient knowledge of positioning techniques and negative attitudes towards non- FGP were present. More precisely, staff expressed concerns with respect to the impact on the workload and workflow. Besides facilitating organizational conditions, the social influence of peers and the clinical leadership of RLs were found to be important. Adequate supervision, regular feedback and coaching were identified as important enabling factors for increasing the quality of the applied imaging techniques.
   In the conclusion we state that determinants of using non- FGP are quite complex. Therefore we argue that a holistic approach considering all these aspects is needed to improve imaging practices.

AB  - Gender-based violence and violence against women (VAW) refers to any violation of fundamental rights. However, some forms of VAW are viewed as unproblematic, acceptable and deserved. Taking into account that sexist chants in football stadiums reinforce VAW, the purpose of the study is to determine how a group of adolescents can normalize or challenge an example of sexist chants. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted and the participants were asked to discuss to what extent the actions could be considered as gender-based violence. Most of the youth were highly unconscious of the sexist nature of the video and only a few recognized it as gender-based violence. Such awareness is essential in order to recognize the discrimination and prejudices, but especially, characteristic of VAW in football stadiums. Therefore, the implementation of a new pedagogy in order to reduce VAW in and outside the school is absolutely mandatory.

AB  - The current study aimed to examine medical students' attitudes toward individuals with mental illness. Stratified cluster sampling was used to survey 735 Chinese medical students from three medical universities in Shandong, China. Participants completed the Perceived Devaluation and Discrimination Scale (PDD). Scores on the devaluation subscale items (mean = 2.80, SD = 0.59) were lower than the mid-point score (i.e., 3) (p < 0.001), and scores on the discrimination subscale items (mean = 3.20, SD = 0.52) were higher than the midpoint score (p < 0.001). Higher scores indicated more negative attitudes toward individuals with mental illness. Significant gender differences were found in the discrimination subscale scores and total PDD scores, with lower scores in men compared with women. Compared with medical students in other years, students in their senior year of medical school had the lowest scores on the discrimination subscale. Students may benefit from increased education regarding psychology and psychiatry and by having more contact with individuals with mental illness.

AB  - In the 193 os, sanatorium directors and medical bureaucrats warned of the threat to Canadian society of 'Indian tuberculosis.' Long-standing government policy aimed to isolate Aboriginal people on reserves and in residential schools, while their access to medical care was limited by government parsimony and community prejudice. Characterized as 'racially careless' concerning their own health, Aboriginal bodies were seen as a menace to their neighbours and a danger to the nation. By the 1940s state-run racially segregated Indian hospitals institutionalized Aboriginal people who were not welcome in provincial sanatoria or in the modernizing community hospitals. The opening of the Charles Camsell Indian Hospital in Edmonton in 1946, one of the first acts of the newly created department of National Health and Welfare, was a very public demonstration of the state's commitment to define and promote 'national health' by isolating and institutionalizing Aboriginal people.

AB  - Aim: This Universite du Quebec en Outaouais study examined professionals' attitudes towards fathers, their perceived self-efficacy when working with them and their perceptions of the importance of including fathers in family interventions.
   Methods: Professionals in Quebec, Canada, working in childcare fields such as education, social services, health, community services and management answered a self-report questionnaire between 2013 and 2015. The 296 respondents (90% females) had a mean age of 39 (20-65), were from urban, semi-urban and rural settings and provided services to families with children up to five years of age.
   Results: Social service professionals perceived fathers more negatively than did other professionals. Even though male professionals perceived fathers more negatively, they felt more confident working with them than did their female counterparts. Positive perceptions of fathers were associated with more favourable attitudes towards including them in family interventions, and this association was mediated by the professionals' perceptions of their own self-efficacy.
   Conclusion: The most negative attitudes were reported by social service professionals. Male professionals viewed fathers more negatively but were more confident working with them than were female colleagues. Improving professionals' perceptions of fathers could help to promote their inclusion in family interventions.

AB  - We examine political attitude change using data from a large national probability sample collected over the months leading up to, and following, the 2019 March 15 terror attacks against a Muslim minority community in Christchurch, New Zealand. Satisfaction with the government declined in the months prior to the attack, rose sharply immediately following the attack, and returned to pre-attack levels roughly 3 months after the attack. Support for the ruling centre-left Labour party followed a similar trend, whereas centre-right National party support was unchanged. These results provide valuable comparison to studies focusing on the effects of Islamist attacks, and insight into the time-course of attitude change by examining the effects of far right terrorism toward a minority community.

AB  - This qualitative study examines the participation of individuals with disabilities in political activities in Jordan: a topic on which there is little existing literature despite its capacity to promote successful social integration. Data for this study was gathered by conducting sixteen semi-structured interviews with individuals with disabilities and was then examined collectively using thematic analysis, in the context of related literature and medical and social models of disability. The resulting findings revealed that the most prevalent obstacles that people with disabilities encountered regarding participating in political activities were poor communication, their own negative attitudes towards politics and politicians, and inaccessible physical environments.

AB  - One hundred and sixty-one Mexican respondents completed a questionnaire that measured beliefs and attitudes toward hysterectomy and another that measured gender-role ideology in marriage (GRIMQ). The participants were divided into two groups according to the GRIMQ: "high machismo/marianismo" and "low machismo/marianismo" groups. The participants belonging to the first group showed the most negative attitudes toward hysterectomy. In this group, men showed more negative attitudes toward hysterctomy and were less likely than women to believe that hysterectomy has positive aspects. The findings are discussed in light of male dominance and female subordination that prevail in certain cultural groups of Mexico.

KW  - language education
KW  - skilled migration
AB  - The current concern about low levels of English proficiency among international students who graduate from degree courses - that students' English language skills are not being developed during their higher education experience - reflects negatively on the quality of Australian higher education and its graduates. More careful selection of students and increased use of English language testing are among the solutions put forward. These debates over English language proficiency tend to construct English language as a skill that can be applied in any context and 'native-speaker'-levels of language ability as essential for employment. Within such a formulation international students can only ever be defined as in deficit. Drawing on socio-cultural theories of language learning and academic literacy, alternative understandings of language proficiency in internationalized higher education are explored. Improved communication skills among graduates are likely to be achieved through a better understanding of issues beyond classroom instruction, such as barriers to social integration with native-speakers, which reveal many international students unable to access adequate levels of language experience. Without wider perspectives on the debate over English language proficiency in higher education, the many benefits of having international students in higher education institutions are obscured by negative attitudes and unrealistic expectations.

AB  - This paper explores how Australian gay men experience gender and sexuality in relation to heteronormative gender norms, specifically masculinity. A sample of 32 gay men 22-72 years of age participated in an online interview, using a videoconferencing software, on masculinity and homosexuality. Thematic analyses revealed that gay men experience gender and sexuality-related strain across all levels of their socioecological environment through social regulation, homophobic discrimination/harassment, and anti-effeminacy prejudice. The gay men expressed feelings of self-loathing, shame, internalized homonegativity, and isolation as a result. In examining interactions at each level of the socioecological environment, future research and practice may gain understanding in the social phenomena and how to ameliorate such strain.

AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa faces and is severely affected by many conflicts. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) threaten both the physical and financial well-being of individuals in these struggling countries. This research aims to investigate the immigrants' attitudes and beliefs regarding HIV/AIDS in the Mopani district, Limpopo Province. Qualitative and quantitative designs were used, and 200 immigrants were sampled. Data was collected using a questionnaire with closed and open-ended questions. Ethical standards were maintained. The study revealed that many respondents expressed discriminatory practices towards individuals infected by HIV. Many viewed promiscuity and the disease called Makhume (meaning illness caused by the omission of purification rites following the death of a family member) as causes of HIV/AIDS. These attitudes could hinder the achievement of healthy lives and the promotion of well-being at all ages if not addressed appropriately. The collaboration of various departments in the Mopani district is required to change these negative attitudes and beliefs that influence immigrants' behaviours. Also, the use of audio-visuals and peer teaching is most successful in changing attitudes and beliefs.

AB  - Social psychology highlights ingroup identity as an important determinant of intergroup attitudes and relations; however, research has demonstrated that its effects can be positive, negative, or nonexistent depending on how such identity is conceptualized. This research explores how national identity inclusiveness (Study 1) and centrality (Study 2) are associated with immigration related attitudes in school and countrywide settings, respectively. Study 1 showed that teachers' inclusive (i.e., overlapping) identities regarding their immigrant students related to positive attitudes toward these students, but not to attitudes about immigrants in general or immigration policy preferences. Study 2 found that national identity centrality was related to negative attitudes toward the social impact of immigrants, and to higher support for policies inhibiting the social inclusion of immigrants in the receiving community. Combined, these studies highlight the importance of considering different conceptualizations of ingroup identity in identifying relations to immigration-based attitudes. Moreover, the studies highlight the value of promoting inclusive identities when aiming to improve attitudes toward immigrants. We conclude by discussing a new approach for promoting inclusive identities by framing immigrants as indispensable to the receiving community.

AB  - For the first time in Ecuador a hate crime was tried in court and led to a conviction. This was the case of Michael Arce, a young Afro-Ecuadorian former cadet who won the trial against Captain Fernando Encalada of the Eloy Alfaro Military School (ESMIL). ESMIL belongs to the Ecuadorian Armed Forces, a state institution considered to be of great prestige and a guarantor of citizens' rights and democracy, but not for all. Arce suffered in ESMIL 2 months of humiliation and torture. Through a socio-legal analysis this article demonstrates the normalization of racial stereotypes and prejudices, and the sometimes subtle existence of structural and institutional racism in the education and judicial systems. This case represents a pioneering judicial action in Ecuador that legally established and defined new pretrial and trial proceedings in regard to litigation concerning violation of human rights, racial discrimination and hate crimes.

AB  - The use of 'neopatrimonialism' as a category in mainstream scholarship on African polities and economies is ubiquitous. A critique by Thandika Mkandawire has shown that the 'neopatrimonial school' is devoid of conceptual coherence and analytical power - it is an expression of a prejudice, not a useful tool for research and analysis. The article endorses Mkandawire's view but points out that this is by no means the only example of its kind. On the contrary, the use of categories which assume the superiority of societies in the global North over those in Africa is widespread. The article illustrates this by discussing and criticising two others, the 'democratic consolidation' paradigm and the 'failed state' framework. It argues that all three shape assumptions by scholars in Africa as well as outside it which obstruct concrete analysis. A critique of these paradigms is thus essential to the development of scholarship on and about Africa.

AB  - This study examined characteristics of cisgender people who use non-traditional sexual orientation labels and investigated minority stress in these groups. Pansexual (n = 160), queer (n = 80), and asexual (n = 98) participants were compared with heterosexual (n = 1,021), bisexual (n = 1,518), and lesbian/gay (n = 2,730) individuals recruited from a cross-sectional survey. Participants were compared on sexual attraction, age, gender and childhood gender nonconformity. Hierarchical regression models with psychological distress as the dependent variable and outness, prejudice events, expectations of rejection, self-stigma, and rumination as independent variables were then tested in pansexual, queer, and asexual individuals. Sexual attraction, age, gender and recalled childhood gender nonconformity were significant predictors of group identity. Pansexual individuals were not significantly distinct from bisexual individuals in sexual attraction. Queer individuals fell between bisexual and lesbian/gay individuals in sexual attraction scores. Prejudice events and rumination were significantly associated with distress in all three non-traditional groups. Rumination scores attenuated the relationship between prejudice events and distress in all groups. These findings help characterize pansexual, asexual and queer individuals and suggest indirect effects of prejudice events on distress via rumination represent a worthy avenue for future minority stress research in these groups.

AB  - Promoting changes in an organisation is never an easy task. Coping with changes is an individual process and affects our individual physical and psychological well-being. This study attempted to analyse how university reforms were experienced by academic staff. It is framed by Self-Determination Theory, according to which there are three basic psychological needs that affect all people: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. I conducted Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA; Smith et al., 2009) to gain insight into participants' experiences during the period of 4 years, 2014-2018. The participants came from two academic staff communities of the same institution. The data collection methods were observations, diary notes, and interviews. The data were analysed according IPA. The results reveal the important role of the sense of community and belongingness between academic peers and colleagues within broader academic staff communities. In fact, it may influence the individual's experience of reforms in both directions-peaceful confidence or alarming apprehension. The findings suggest that lack of autonomy about one's work life increases negative attitudes towards the reforms and alludes to emotion-focused coping strategies, whilst autonomy supportive and open working environment supports coping with reforms in an academic institution.

AB  - Importance Women and black physicians encounter workplace challenges because of their gender and race. It is unclear whether these individuals are assessed with lower patient satisfaction or confidence ratings compared with white male physicians. Objective To examine whether physician gender and race affect participant ratings in scenarios in which physician competence is challenged. Design, Setting, and Participants This randomized trial enrolled a geographically diverse sample of 3592 online respondents in the United States who were recruited from 2 crowdsourcing platforms: Amazon Mechanical Turk (n = 1741) and Lucid (n = 1851). A 2 x 2 factorial design for the gender and race of simulated physicians was conducted between March 9 and July 25, 2018. Participants were excluded before intervention if they were younger than 18 years, were pregnant, or had a history of cancer or abdominal surgical procedures. Interventions A clinical vignette was presented to the participant with a picture of the emergency department physician. Participants were randomly assigned to physicians with different gender and race, with 823 assigned to black women, 791 to black men, 828 to white women, and 835 to white men. A contradictory diagnosis from an online symptom checker introduced doubt about the clinical diagnosis. Main Outcomes and Measures A composite outcome (range, 0-100, with 0 representing low patient confidence and satisfaction and 100 representing the maximum on the composite scale) measured participant (1) confidence in the physician, (2) satisfaction with care, (3) likelihood to recommend the physician, (4) trust in the physician's diagnosis, and (5) likelihood to request additional tests. Results Among 3277 adult participants, complete data were available for 3215 (median age, 49 years [range, 18-89 years]; 1667 [52%] female; 2433 [76%] white). No significant differences were observed in participant satisfaction and physician confidence for the white male physician control physicians (mean composite score, 66.13 [95% CI, 64.76-67.51]) compared with white female (mean composite score, 66.50 [95% CI, 65.19-67.82]), black female (mean composite score, 67.36 [95% CI, 66.03-68.69]), and black male (mean composite score, 66.96 [95% CI, 65.55-68.36]) physicians. Machine learning with bayesian additive regression trees revealed no evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity as a function of participants' race, gender, racial prejudice, or sexism. Conclusions and Relevance No significant differences were observed for simulated patients' evaluations of female or black physicians, suggesting that bias in favor of white male physicians is negligible in survey-based measures of patient satisfaction.
   This randomized trial examines whether physician gender and race affect patient ratings of satisfaction and confidence in the physician during a simulated clinical encounter for an emergency department visit.
   Question In a simulated clinical encounter, do participants evaluate physicians differently based on the physician's gender or race? Findings In this randomized trial of 3592 online respondents, simulated physician gender and race did not significantly affect participant satisfaction or confidence in physician clinical judgment compared with a white male physician control. Meaning Participants reported equal satisfaction and confidence in the simulated physicians' diagnosis and treatment plans regardless of the physician's gender or race.

AB  - In MOOCs, course reviews serve as a new interactive tool that has not yet been sufficiently exploited. Therefore, this study investigated learners' explicit behaviors and implicit discourse content derived from reviews by using a mixed approach of text mining and statistical analysis. We proposed an improved topic model called Behavior-Emotion Topic Model (BETM) to detect reviews' semantic content between two achievement groups (completers and non-completers). Then we performed statistical analysis to investigate differences in the two groups' discourse behaviors and content. Results showed significant differences in discourse behaviors and focused topics between completers and non-completers. Specifically, posting reviews was a significant behavior for completers, while replying and giving peers' reviews "thumps up" were significant behaviors for non-completers. Furthermore, completers tended to express appreciation of course-related content by posting reviews and, afterward, showing certificates, whereas non-completers tended to hold negative attitudes toward the platform construction's technical issues by replying. Finally, we conducted an evolutionary analysis to explore the dynamics of learners' focused content throughout the course over 3 years; this can provide instructors new insights for the development of online course, thus meeting future learners' needs by adjusting the teaching process.

AB  - The high prevalence of people with Intellectual Disability (ID) fosters the recognition of their health, work, and social needs. However, few studies have focused on the assessment of their affective and sexual needs (a basic personal need and universal right). Even though the current literature suggests changes in social attitudes toward this population, it is unclear whether these changes have actually occurred and their impact on the development of healthy and non-stigmatized sexuality. This question is particularly relevant due to the lack of a sound measure to assess this shift in the social consideration of the sexuality of people with ID. Thus, this preliminary study focuses on the design and validation of a reliable measure to assess attitudes toward the sexuality of people with Intellectual Disability. This study comprises 1103 participants (43.3% men; 56.7% women) between 20 and 92 years old, classified into three groups: parents or relatives of people with ID, professionals working with ID individuals, and the general population. Results from Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) yielded three factors explaining 49.19% of the scale variance: Normalizing Attitudes (NOR-A), Negative Attitudes (NEG-A), and Paternalistic Attitudes (PAT-A). This three-factor structure was subsequently confirmed through Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Regarding internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha values ranged between 0.66 and 0.86. In conclusion, this research demonstrates that the ASEXID is useful and reliable for the assessment of relatives', professionals', and societal attitudes toward the sexuality of people with ID, contributing to the assessment of a potential paradigm shift in attitudes toward the affective sexual education of people with this condition.

TI  - Screening migrants for tuberculosis - a missed opportunity for improving knowledge and attitudes in high-risk groups: A cross-sectional study of Swedish-language students in Umea, Sweden
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA  - English
KW  - IMMIGRANTS
KW  - HIV
AB  - Background: Migrants from countries with a high-burden of tuberculosis (TB) are at a particular risk of contracting and developing the disease. In Sweden, new immigrants are routinely offered screening for the disease, yet very little is known about their beliefs about the disease which may affect healthcare-seeking behaviours. In this study we assessed recent immigrant students' knowledge of, and attitudes towards TB, and their relationship with the screening process.
   Methods: Data were collected over a one-year period through a survey questionnaire completed by 268 immigrants consecutively registered at two Swedish-language schools in Umea, Sweden. Participants originated from 133 different countries and their ages varied between 16-63 years. Descriptive and multivariate logistic regression analyses were then performed.
   Results: Though most of them (72%) were screened, knowledge was in general poor with several misconceptions. The average knowledge score was 2.7 +/- 1.3 (SD), (maximum = 8). Only 40 (15 %) of the 268 respondents answered at least half of the 51 knowledge items correctly. The average attitude score was 5.1 +/- 3.3 (SD) (maximum = 12) which meant that most respondents held negative attitudes towards TB and diseased persons. Up to 67% lacked knowledge about sources of information while 71% requested information in their vernacular. Knowledge level was positively associated with having more than 12 years of education and being informed about TB before moving to Sweden. Attitude was positively associated with years of education and having heard about the Swedish Communicable Disease Act, but was negatively associated with being from the Middle East. Neither knowledge nor attitude were affected by health screening or exposure to TB information after immigration to Sweden.
   Conclusions: Though the majority had contact with Swedish health professionals through the screening process, knowledge about tuberculosis among these immigrants was low with several misconceptions and negative attitudes. Information may currently be inaccessible to most of these immigrants due to the language barrier and unfamiliarity with the Swedish healthcare system. If TB education was included as a component of screening programmes, ensuring that it was tailored to educational background, addressed misconceptions and access problems, it could well help improve TB control in these communities.

AB  - Lack of knowledge and negative attitudes towards mental health is linked to low utilization of services among Latinxs. Entertainment-education videos have been effective at increasing literacy and reducing stigma across different health domains but Latinxs have not been a focus of research. We developed an E-E video aimed at reducing stigma and increasing mental health literacy. Focus groups (N = 28) and expert consultants (N = 2) were used to aid in the development of the video. After the video was developed, we conducted a randomized control trial (RCT) in which Latina participants (N = 111) were assigned to view the video or receive an informational brochure. Results indicated that participants in the video intervention condition experienced statistically significant increases in mental health literacy as compared to the participants in the flyer condition and that both the video and the flyer contributed to shifts in stigma.

AB  - Journal writing involving guided reflections on intercultural experiences has a potential in facilitating intercultural communicative competence (ICC). However, most of the research on reflective journal writing relied on content-based thematic analysis alone and neglected the use of language that reveals, complements or even distorts the true meaning of the content. Using linguistic tools provided by appraisal theory, the study investigated the attitudinal changes towards self and others in the reflective journals of intercultural encounter written by 41 undergraduates in an College English Intercultural Communication class in a Chinese university. Positive attitudinal changes were found, including the extension of reflection from people in the incidents to cultures they represented, more appreciation of the intercultural experience, more objectivity and empathy for others, and critical reflection on one's own behaviour in intercultural experience and one's initial ethnocentric interpretation of it. Problematic tendencies included outgroup-favouritism, non-judgement on the surface and overgeneralisation. Suggestions were provided for teachers who intend to use reflective journals in facilitating students' ICC growth. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background
   Cultural and religious beliefs influence perceptions about health and illness. Data, from India, on perceptions about intellectual disability are scant. This study explored people's cultural beliefs and attitudes about intellectual disability, perceived needs and burden associated with care in Vellore, south India.
   Method
   A qualitative methodology using focus groups was employed. Eight focus groups were conducted in three settings and included the mothers of children and adolescents with intellectual disability (four groups, n = 29), community health workers (two groups, n = 17) and schoolteachers (two groups, n = 16).
   Results
   Our results suggest that cultural and religious beliefs perpetuated negative attitudes towards disability. This meant that caregivers bore a high burden of care with little support from family or society. The study confirmed the presence of diverse, multiple and contradictory models of disability drawing from biomedical and local religious, social and cultural constructs.
   Conclusions
   Public awareness, education and community-level interventions for reducing the misconceptions and stigma related to intellectual disability are needed in addition to culturally sensitive treatment methods to improve the attitude towards and management of intellectual disability.

AB  - Following terrorist threats and events, some research has focused on the behavior, religious beliefs, and clothing of non-Western cultural groups and their intersection with Western cultures. Social workers, law enforcement, and other human service workers may be affected by their perceptions in their interactions with members of these groups. This exploratory study investigated beliefs about safety and religious and cultural diversity in light of age and gender (N = 324). Respondents completed 30 items following 1 of 4 vignettes in which a younger or older male or female character in non-Western attire was boarding an airplane. When controlling for respondents' travel frequency, knowing someone who has been or is in military service and knowing someone affected or personally being affected by national or international acts of terrorism, a general linear model was significant (F = 116.617, df = 30, p < .001). Differences centered on perceptions of safety, racial profiling, and attributing behaviors of people attired in non-Western clothing to the culture and religion of the vignette character. Female characters were perceived to be less dangerous than male characters. These perceptions may impact service delivery and professionals' willingness to interact with some religious/cultural groups. This area requires continued research.

AB  - This paper analyses the coverage of Indigenous topics in K-12 education in British Columbia (BC) using curriculum documents and course enrolment. It focuses on curriculum documents published between 1995 and 2010 and mandated in public education from 1995 to 2019, and argues that Indigenous topics were marginalized in the curriculum overall. Motivated by decades of work by Indigenous leaders and educators to grapple with non-Indigenous people's prejudices, ignorance, and lack of understanding, the British Columbia Ministry of Education has increasingly recognized the importance of integrating Indigenous topics into core curricula and has offered all students Indigenous Studies course options. However, coverage remained marginalized in the core curriculum and recent curricular revisions have relied increasingly on teachers' voluntary integration of Indigenous topics and meaningful consultation with local Indigenous educators and communities, for which insufficient support and resources are provided by the Education Ministry. The paper explores challenges to the curriculum's ability to combat prejudice, eliminate discrimination and promote tolerance, understanding and good relations among Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples in the province.

AB  - The paper investigates the effect of Communist legacies on attitudes toward migrants in present-day Russia. Midway through the first decade of the 2000s, Russia established itself as an attractive center of labor migration. This rise of migration triggered an upsurge of xenophobic sentiment and nationalism. This paper examines the variation of anti-migrant sentiments across the regions of the Russian Federation and concludes that it is strongly affected by the legacies of the Communist regime. Regions with a higher share of CPSU members in their population in the 1970s are characterized by stronger negative attitudes towards migrants.

AB  - Using an accelerated longitudinal design, we investigated developmental changes in young peoples' evaluations of sexual harassment (SH) and how young peoples' own experiences with harassment, their perceptions of teacher intervention, as well as how gender and sexual orientation related to their judgments. This study documented significant changes in adolescents' evaluations of peer-based SH from grades 7 to 10. Overall, there was a significant decrease in the extent to which youth judged SH to be wrong as they progressed through school. Yet, there was also significant variability across youth in their initial judgments at grade 7 and the extent to which their judgments changed over time. Youth judged SH to be less wrong at occasions when they reported engaging in this behavior more frequently. Conversely, youth judged SH to be more wrong at occasions where they saw teachers intervene. In grade 7, girls, youth more frequently reporting seeing teachers intervene, and youth reporting less SH perpetration judged SH as more wrong than boys, those reporting less teacher intervention, and those reporting higher perpetration, respectively. Perceptions of teacher intervention attenuated the grade-related declines in judgments of wrongness. The results of this study have important implications for research and policy related to SH among adolescents.

AB  - Background: Although being in the frontline of healthcare and having a crucial role in the reduction of stigma, evidence has shown that nurses and undergraduate nursing students hold unfavourable attitudes toward mental illness . There is, to our knowledge, no previous study that explored attitudes toward mental illness among nursing students in Tunisia, nor in North African countries. Aim: We aimed to assess stigma in nursing students as compared to nonhealth care students, and the relationship between stigma and education variables in the nursing students group. Methods: The 'Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill', the 'Mental Health Knowledge Schedule', and 'Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale' were administered to 255 nursing students and 332 non health care students. Findings: Despite nursing students being more knowledgeable about mental disorders than nonhealth care students; they held significantly more stigmatising attitudes toward people with mental disorders in two dimensions: Authoritarianism and Community mental health ideology. After controlling for confounders, we found that having taken mental health courses significantly predicted more favourable attitudes toward people with mental disorders and better knowledge of mental health stigma. Being interested in working in psychiatric wards helped predict more favourable attitudes and intended behaviours. Discussion: In general, results from this study are of concern as it presents evidence of an overall similar or even greater tendency to negative attitudes toward mental illness among nursing students than among nonhealth care students. Conclusion: There is an urgent need for antistigma interventions in nursing schools. These interventions should target nursing students with the most negative attitudes, including male students and those who have never had personal experience with mental illness. Interventions should also work to build up nursing students' interest in mental health nursing during their undergraduate years.(c) 2021 Australian College of Nursing Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A substantial body of research on diversity philosophies has shown that multiculturalism (i.e., emphasizing and valuing cultural/ethnic differences) is a more effective way to promote equality and reduce bias than color blindness (i.e., deemphasizing cultural/ethnic differences in lieu of similarities). However, across two experiments, we present evidence for an unexpectedly negative outcome of multiculturalism: increased belief in race essentialism, or the notion that racial group differences are valid, biologically based, and immutable. Study 1 (N = 165) shows that participants exposed to multiculturalism expressed greater race essentialist beliefs compared to those exposed to color blindness. Study 2 (N = 150) replicates this effect and also finds that exposure to multiculturalism, compared to color blindness, decreased participants' belief that racial equality is a problem. These findings raise the ironic possibility that well-intentioned efforts to portray the value of differences may reinforce the belief that fixed, biological characteristics underpin them.

AB  - Criminal-justice-involved clients often are a complicated population for students to consider through a lens of oppression. Nevertheless, it is critical that they do so given that many will serve clients with criminal records during their careers. An attempt to challenge students' prejudice toward criminal-justiceinvolved people was deployed using a teaching technique derived from intergroup contact theory. The authors invited Juan Melendez to share his story of incarceration on death row for more than 17 years for a crime he did not commit. This article is an examination of the impact of Mr. Melendez's story and the application of intergroup contact theory.

KW  - Childhood emotional maltreatment
KW  - intrusions
KW  - suppression
KW  - autobiographical memories
AB  - Background: During childhood emotional maltreatment (CEM) negative attitudes are provided to the child (e.g., "you are worthless"). These negative attitudes may result in emotion inhibition strategies in order to avoid thinking of memories of CEM, such as thought suppression. However, thought suppression may paradoxically enhance occurrences (i.e., intrusions) of these memories, which may occur immediately or sometime after active suppression of these memories.
   Objective: Until now, studies that examined suppressive coping styles in individuals reporting CEM have utilized self-report questionnaires. Therefore, it is unclear what the consequences will be of emotion inhibition styles on the intrusion of autobiographical memories in individuals reporting CEM.
   Method: Using a thought suppression task, this study aimed to investigate the experience of intrusions during suppression of, and when no longer instructed to actively suppress, positive and negative autobiographical memories in individuals reporting Low, Moderate, and Severe CEM compared to No Abuse (total N = 83).
   Results: We found no group differences during active suppression of negative and positive autobiographical memories. However, when individuals reporting Severe CEM were no longer instructed to suppress thinking about the memory, individuals reporting No Abuse, Low CEM, or Moderate CEM reported fewer intrusions of both positive and negative autobiographical memories than individuals reporting Severe CEM. Finally, we found that intrusions of negative memories are strongly related with psychiatric distress.
   Conclusions: The present study results provide initial insights into the cognitive mechanisms that may underlie the consequences of childhood emotional maltreatment and suggests avenues for successful interventions.

AB  - Situated in neo-democratic globalizing Northeast Brazil, this anthropological study probes the role of ecological context in framing, experiencing, and expressing human distress. Ethnographic interviews, narratives, and "contextualized semantic analysis" reveal the lived experience of childhood respiratory diseases among 22 urban mangrove dwellers. Informants speak an "ecoidiom of respiratory distress" based on a popular "eco-logic", reflecting the harsh reality of "living in dampness". "Higher-up" residents legitimize their feelings of superiority by stigmatizing "lowlanders" as taboo, diseased (with porcine cysticercosis, swine flu) "filthy pigs, stuck in the muck" (atolados na lama). Animalizing inhabitants' identities demotes them to nonpersons. Besides infections, children suffer social stigma, ostracism, and barriers for accessing care. Promoting a "favorable environment" requires reducing ecological risk, challenging class-based prejudice, and restoring human dignity.

AB  - Wildlife-vehicle collisions threaten most wildlife taxa as road and traffic densities increase across landscapes. While the biophysical effects of roads on wildlife are well-studied, research on psychosocial factors that influence wildlife-vehicle collisions remains sparse. Road characteristics and species behavior are often used to estimate the frequency of collisions, but drivers' attitudes and intentions toward striking animals may put persecuted species at an elevated risk. To inform management and education of road impacts to wildlife, especially reptiles, we surveyed patrons of Jekyll Island (JI), Georgia, USA: to (1) measure their degree of concern for broad impacts of wildlife-vehicle collisions; (2) gauge their degree of disfavor with hitting animals of different taxa with a vehicle; (3) understand specific predictors influencing attitudes toward hitting deer, turtles and snakes. Respondents were more concerned with personal safety and impacts to wildlife than damage to vehicles. They were most upset with collisions involving large mammals (bears and deer), domesticated animals (dogs and cats) and turtles, and they were least upset with hitting snakes. Respondents that showed concern for wildlife and had visited JI nature centers were more likely to be upset with hitting each taxa. Our results support previous psychosocial findings regarding negative attitudes toward snakes but additionally demonstrate that these attitudes can remain alongside positive attitudes toward other taxa, such as mammals and turtles. These findings can inform our ability to predict the frequency of wildlife-vehicle collisions and tailor conservation messages toward taxa when negative attitudes exist.

AB  - Primary teachers' attitudes have been shown to strongly influence both their intention to teach science, and ultimately student engagement and learning outcomes, with previous research consistently showing preservice teachers hold negative attitudes towards science and/or science teaching. A recently developed instrument informed by a theoretical framework for attitudes towards science teaching (van Aalderen-Smeets et al.2012) has shown promise in effectively identifying and evaluating primary teachers' attitudes. This study explored 96 Australian preservice primary teachers' attitudinal constructs toward teaching science in a single-semester science education course. Data sources included participants' pre- and posttest responses to the Dimensions of Attitude towards Science (DAS) instrument, and interview responses from a smaller subset of participants (n = 5). Results indicated a significant improvement in participants' confidence in teaching science, their perceptions of the relevance of science teaching, and their enjoyment of science teaching at the conclusion of the course. Participants were less anxious about teaching science and expressed improved intentions to include science activities in their classrooms. Self-efficacy was the most improved attitudinal construct, with findings indicating the science education course facilitated cognitive content mastery and cognitive pedagogical mastery (Palmer2006). Evidence from this study supports the assertion that significant improvements in preservice primary teachers' attitudes toward teaching science are possible in courses considered to be 'typical' science education courses in Australia, and future courses should focus on maximising opportunities for preservice teachers to improve their confidence via cognitive content mastery experiences and cognitive pedagogical mastery experiences.

AB  - Prior research suggests that segregation in the U.S. workplace is on the rise (Hellerstein, Neumark, & McInerney, 2008); as such, leaders are more likely to lead groups of followers composed primarily of their own race (Elliot & Smith, 2001; Smith & Elliott, 2002). Drawing from theory on stigma-by-association, the authors posit that such segregated proximal social contexts (i.e., the leader's group of followers) can have detrimental effects on leader appraisals. Specifically, they argue that leaders of mostly Black follower groups experience stigmatization based on race stereotypic beliefs, which affects how they are viewed in the eyes of observers. The results of a large field study show performance evaluations generally tend to be lower when the proportion of Black followers is higher. Moreover, 3 experiments demonstrate that the impact of proximal social contexts extends to other outcomes (i.e., perceptions of market value and competency) but appears limited to those who are less internally and externally motivated to control their prejudice. Taken together, these findings explain how workplace segregation systematically can create a particular disadvantage for Black leaders.

AB  - Objectives: To compare how community pharmacists felt they and other health professionals perceived individuals with depression and schizophrenia and whether pharmacists' attitudes and other factors affected willingness to provide services to patients with mental illness.
   Setting: Northeastern United States in summer 2006.
   Participants: Pharmacists at 750 community pharmacies.
   Intervention: A survey was mailed to the community pharmacies, which were randomly selected from a list obtained from a state board of pharmacy in the northeastern United States.
   Main outcome measures: Pharmacist attitudes toward individuals with schizophrenia and depression and willingness to provide pharmacy services to patients with mental illness.
   Results: 292 surveys were completed (response rate 38.9%). The pharmacists surveyed felt that they had more positive attitudes toward individuals with depression and schizophrenia compared with other pharmacists (P <= 0.01). Compared with physicians, pharmacists perceived themselves as having less negative attitudes toward those with depression (P <= 0.001) but greater negative attitudes toward individuals with schizophrenia (P <= 0.05). More pharmacists were willing to provide services to those with asthma than those with mental illness (P <= 0.001). Pharmacists were more likely to provide services to patients with mental illness if they had fewer negative attitudes for those with depression or schizophrenia and placed a greater value on counseling patients (P <= 0.001). Minority pharmacists were more willing to provide services to patients with mental illness.
   Conclusion: Community pharmacists have more negative views of schizophrenia than depression and felt that they perceived those with schizophrenia more negatively than physicians. Our findings suggest two ways to improve community pharmacist willingness to provide services to patients with mental illness: reduce negative attitudes toward patients with mental illness and increase pharmacists' perceived value of counseling patients.

AB  - Forecast growth in global demand for air travel is incompatible with emissions reduction targets. Scholarly attention is urgently needed to address attitude and behaviour change that supports sector-wide emissions reduction. Informed by the longstanding field of consumer psychology, the innovative approach adopted in this paper is to critically address air travel behaviour change through the application of attitude function theory. An analysis of the literature reveals that current attitudes reflect industry myths, and are further hampered by travellers' knowledge gaps regarding the relationship between aviation and climate change. Five attitude functions are analysed in the context of attitudes to air travel; knowledge, utilitarian, value-expressive, ego-defensive and social adjustive functions. A conceptual framework is presented that integrates attitude structure, attitude function and the elaboration likelihood model of persuasion as an innovative approach to address discretionary air travel and behaviour change at the level of the individual consumer. Utilizing this framework, future research can help develop a critical understanding of the antecedents that shape attitudes. Researchers will be better positioned to create persuasive messages aimed at changing attitudes towards air travel, as arguably the key step towards the illusive goal of significant behaviour change and a shift towards more sustainable tourist mobilities.

AB  - Background: Past survey studies document that people strongly prefer Covid-19 vaccines developed domestically over those developed abroad. Available evidence suggests that this preference for domestic vaccines over foreign ones may stem from prejudice against foreign countries, but identifying prejudice-based vaccine preferences is difficult because people also draw inferences about the quality of vaccines based on country of origin. We exploit a unique opportunity provided by the announcement of a viable vaccine by a bi-national venture, BioNTech and Pfizer, to examine the effect of such prejudice on vaccination intentions while controlling for beliefs about the vaccine quality. Methods: We implemented a survey experiment in Germany and the United States (n = 582, 661 respectively) a few days after the BioNTech/Pfizer announcement of a viable vaccine. We randomized the identified company (and country) responsible for the vaccine development between BioNTech (Germany) and Pfizer (U.S.) and asked respondents when they would take said vaccine. Results: In either the German and U.S. samples, we find little evidence that a country of origin of the vaccine makes a difference in when respondents intend to get vaccinated. We also see no evidence that those with a general animus toward the other foreign country would be more biased against a foreign vaccine. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that prejudice against foreign countries may be less of a concern for vaccine hesitancy and that its effect may be highly context specific.

TI  - Understanding the Humanities crisis: an argument for Humanities' national value
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
LA  - English
AB  - What justifies the negative perception of the Humanities? What justifies budget cuts and curricula changes in schools and universities that prejudice the Humanities? In this article I argue that what is meant to justify the crisis narrative as well as curricula and budget cuts is the following argument: education has national value if and only if it positively contributes to the economy. The Humanities do not and cannot positively contribute to the economy. Therefore, the Humanities fail to contribute anything of national value. Therefore, governments are justified in cutting the Humanities from curricula and reapportioning funding away from the Humanities. In addition to defending this argument as the argument against the Humanities, I argue that the first premise is false. I argue that there are non-profit-seeking national goods that the Humanities are ideally placed to meet and promote. Therefore, the argument against the Humanities fails.

AB  - Background Depression is the leading contributor to the burden of disease worldwide. Stigma and negative attitudes to depression can act as barriers to treatment and to social inclusion. Understanding attitudes to depression and treatment has implications for individual outcomes and societal mental health. Aims To explore public attitudes to, and management of depression, including lifestyle factors, medication, and psychotherapy. Methods A nationally representative online population survey of Irish adults was conducted by RED C. Results Nine hundred ninety-one people completed the survey. The majority thought that depression was a medical illness (90%), was different to sadness or stress (89%), and that awareness of depression was increasing (89%), while stigma was reducing (69%). Self-reported lifetime depression rates were high and were significantly higher in younger people (18-34 yrs) (63% vs 55%, p = 0.017), and in urban areas (60% vs 44%, p < 0.0001). Younger people were less likely to contact their GP (46% vs 61%, p = 0.034) and reported more stigma around antidepressants (ADTs) compared to older people (> 55 years) (74% vs 58%, p < 0.0001). There were negative attitudes to ADTs and a preference for talking therapies and lifestyle changes. Males were more likely to hold negative attitudes to ADTs. Conclusions Stigma around depression is reducing and public awareness is improving. However, the very high self-reported lifetime rates of depression may reflect milder forms or emotional/psychological distress, rather than clinical depression. Negative attitudes and stigma towards ADTs remains high. A collaborative, sustained effort is required to advance public appreciation of mood and its management, across the severity spectrum, in tandem with destigmatising the targeted use of ADTs.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to review the perceptions of faculty members, preschool teachers, and pre-school teacher candidates with regard to the Anti-Bias Education Programs (ABEP) by using a phenomenological pattern. The participants' metaphors on ABEP were established and categorized and the differences in participants' perceptions were analyzed in terms of their demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and service time. The working group of this research consisted of 129 participants: from 17 universities, 22 faculty members from the Education Faculty Pre-school Education Departments and 71 pre-school teacher candidates, studying in the fourth year of the Pre-School Education Departments; and 36 pre-school teachers from 9 different cities. The findings of this study show that faculty members produced 17, teachers produced 28 and teacher candidates produced 30 different metaphors about ABEP. The faculty members' metaphors vary in terms of age and service time, whereas the teachers' vary in terms of service time, type of institution, education level and age. Teacher candidates' metaphors vary in terms of age and gender.

AB  - Objective Students with visual impairments have built negative attitudes towards their abilities due to difficulties in achieving social skills, orientation, and independent mobility. Their negative attitude towards blindness puts them at high-risk developing loneliness, social isolation, depression, anxiety, decreased life expentancy, no participation in group activities, and low levels of social support. Lack or no social skill reduces social acceptance and real feeling about themselves, which in turn reduces self-esteem in students with visual impaiments. Using appropriate therapeutic intervention with the aim of ensuring mental health as well as promoting self-esteem can prevent many psychological problems in these people. The acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is one of the third wave approaches to behavioral therapy that aims to control effectively the pain, suffering and stress that a person faces in the life. The acceptance and commitment therapy helps the person increases her psychological relations with herself and her feelings, trying to adapt to the environment and community instead of changing her cognition. The present study aimed to determine the effectiveness of the acceptance and commitment group therapy on self-esteem of students with visual impairment in Tehran City.
   Materials & Methods The present study was a quasi-experimental study in which a pretest-posttest design with a control group used along with a two-month follow-up. The sample was consisted of twenty-eight 14-20 year old female students who was selected from the population of students with visual impairment studying in the schooling year of 2019-2020 in Narjes day-and-night school for the blind individuals. In Tehran, there is only one school for female blind students and the sample purposefully selected according to the probability of sample's dropout. At first, 50 students completed the Cooper Smith Self-Esteem Questionnaire (CSSEQ) and after scoring the CSSEQ, twenty-eigth students selected according to receiving a score of 23 or lower in the CSSEQ. All subjects matched based on their age and grade, then randomly assigned to the experimental and the control group. The experimental group (two subgroups consisted of seven people in each) participated in eight therapeutic sessions (twice a week and 75 minutes for per session) and received the acceptance and commitment group therapy while the control group participated only in the mainstream programs at the school. At the end of the therapeutic sessions all subjects completed the CSSEQ again and the experimental group completed CSSEQ after two months follow-up. The multiple analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) used for analyzing the obtained data. Furthermore, for comparing the posttest and follow-up situations in the experimental group the related t-test used.
   Results The results of multiple analysis of covariance for the data obtained from the self-esteem questionnaire showed that the participation of female students with visual impairment in the acceptance and commitment group therapy sessions led to significant increase (P<0.001) in self-esteem (general, family, social, and educational) of them. In fact, according to Eta quotient, 71%, 78%, 78%, and 72% of variation in self-esteem (general, family, social, and educational respectively) of the experimental group can be explained by participating in the acceptance and commitment group therapy sessions. The results of the related t-test for comparing the self-esteem of the experimental group in post test and follow-up situations showed that the effectiveness of group therapy based on acceptance and commitment has been lasted on the self-esteem (general, family, social, and educational) of the experimental group after two months follow-up later (P>0.05).
   Conclusion We conclude according to the findings of the present study that the acceptance and commitment group therapy can use for planning and policy making instructional courses suitable for students with visual impairments. Furthermore, the specialists who are working with these children can use the ACT as a practical technique for improving self-esteem and the adaptation in many areas such as family, social and educational areas in students with visual impaiments. Additionally, the ACT recommend improving self-esteem and positive performance of students with visual impairment in social, educational and family areas along side the routin instructional couses. However, the acceptance and commitment group therapy helps the students with visual impairment know how to control their thoughts and feelings in order to prevent problems from getting worse. This therapeutic method helpls them to accept their behavioral changes through accepting the unpleasant thoughts and feelings.

AB  - Binge-watching is becoming a new "norm" for viewers in the way they consume their favorite TV shows and movies, nevertheless, most scholarly research on binge-watching remains exploratory. This study investigated (1) the relationship between attitudes toward binge-watching and the extent of binge-watching and (2) the role of viewers' personality traits (i.e., immediate gratification [IG] and needs for cognition [NFC]) on this association. The results from the analysis of the survey data (N = 714) illustrated that there was a positive association between viewers' negative attitudes and the extent of their binge-watching, showing a signature indicator of attitude-discrepant behaviors. Furthermore, a significant interaction effect of a negative attitude toward binge-watching and IG on binge-watching behavior was found. High-IG respondents with a negative attitude toward binge-watching were more likely to binge-watch than their low-IG counterparts, marked by a greater negative attitude toward binge-watching as a guilty pleasure.

AB  - In 2005, 60 health care workers were recruited through services that attract injecting drug users (IDUs) and asked to complete attitude measures regarding IDU clients. Mediation analyses indicated that conservative health care workers displayed more negative attitudes toward their IDU clients because they believe that injecting drug use is within the control of the IDU. Negative attitudes toward IDU clients, in turn, were associated with worry about IDU clients' behavior in the clinic and with beliefs that IDU clients should disclose their hepatitis C status to their health care worker. Perceptions of controllability of drug use were also associated with the belief that IDU clients' ailments were caused by their IDU status. The study's limitations are noted.</.

AB  - The present study seeks to explain individual differences in self-reported politically motivated violence and vandalism, and participation within an extreme right-wing group. While violent extremism is highly debated, few criminological studies explicitly test factors that can trigger violent extremism. The present study addresses this gap by integrating two different frameworks: a perceived injustice and group threat-initiated model and an impulsivity-initiated model. We also investigate several intervening mechanisms. We draw on a sample of 705 adolescents and young adults living in Flanders, Belgium to test the strength of direct and intermediary effects of perceived injustice, perceptions of out-group threat from Jewish populations, ethnocentrism, feelings of superiority, moral support for right-wing extremism, and exposure to racist peers on politically motivated violence and vandalism. Results of structural equation models (SEM) indicate various direct and intermediary effects between both perceived injustice and violent extremism, and between impulsivity and violent extremism. Our model reveals the complex and intricate antecedents of violent extremism. Importantly, we find that feelings of injustice and unfair treatment are a major source of extremist violence, as they easily trigger often debated causes such as high in-group identification and ethnocentrism. Implications of these findings for preventing violent extremism are discussed, given the centrality of perceptions of injustice and threat.

AB  - Objective: Rural men affected by cancer are difficult to engage in psychosocial support services. This exploratory study tested whether exposure to printed brochures describing services, distinguished by a focus on rural men affected by cancer, resulted in more positive help-seeking attitudes than exposure to material focused on rural location only or generic cancer support material.
   Methods: Targeted versions of a South Australian Cancer Council service brochure were developed to enhance cultural appropriateness, consistent with the Elaboration Likelihood Model. Rural men affected by cancer were recruited via supportive accommodation and randomized to receive one of the three brochures. The primary outcome was positive attitude to help-seeking at post-test (between 1 and 2 days). Negative attitudes to help-seeking, intention to seek help, perceived isolation, and service use were secondary outcomes; perceived information relevance at immediate post-test was also measured.
   Results: Analysis (N = 114) indicated no detectable group differences (rurality/male gender, n = 33; rurality, n = 41; control, n = 40) on primary or secondary outcome measures (p > 0.05). Participants' existing service use was high, due to the recruitment methods. Support service information was primarily sourced from other people (e.g., friends/family, 22.22%; medical professionals, 27.27%).
   Conclusions: Existing service use rates suggest that ceiling effects obscured any potential benefit from demographic targeting of materials. Further research should consider building understanding about the acceptability of targeting techniques in this population, replication with materials designed with greater consumer input, and employ samples recruited outside a support service.

AB  - Researchers who study perspective taking are generally optimistic about the potential for interventions to improve intergroup perceptions. The current research provides new insight into the conditions that frame the intergroup outcomes of perspective taking. The results show that the effects of perspective taking are not always positive but depend on perspective takers' degree of identification with the in-group. In two experiments, we demonstrated that adopting the perspective of an out-group member can have damaging effects on intergroup perceptions among group members who are highly identified with the in-group. Specifically, compared with less committed members, those who identified highly with the in-group used a greater number of negative traits to describe the out-group following perspective taking. Such perspective taking also led participants with high in-group identification to judge the out-group less favorably. Understanding how social identity concerns frame the outcome of perspective taking is crucial to its effective employment in intergroup-relations programs.

AB  - Objective: In recent years, mass shootings by persons with serious mental illness have received extensive news media coverage. The authors test the effects of news stories about mass shootings on public attitudes toward persons with serious mental illness and support for gun control policies. They also examine whether news coverage of proposals to prevent persons with serious mental illness from having guns exacerbates the public's negative attitudes toward this group.
   Method: The authors conducted a survey-embedded randomized experiment using a national sample (N=1,797) from an online panel. Respondents were randomly assigned to groups instructed to read one of three news stories or to a no-exposure control group. The news stories described, respectively, a mass shooting by a person with serious mental illness, the same mass shooting and a proposal for gun restrictions for persons with serious mental illness, and the same mass shooting and a proposal to ban large-capacity magazines. Outcome measures included attitudes toward working with or living near a person with serious mental illness, perceived dangerousness of persons with serious mental illness, and support for gun restrictions for persons with serious mental illness and for a ban on large-capacity magazines.
   Results: Compared with the control group, the story about a mass shooting heightened respondents' negative attitudes toward persons with serious mental illness and raised support for gun restrictions for this group and for a ban on large-capacity magazines. Including information about the gun restriction policy in a story about a mass shooting did not heighten negative attitudes toward persons with serious mental illness or raise support for the restrictions.
   Conclusions: The aftermath of mass shootings is often viewed as a window of opportunity to garner support for gun control policies, but it also exacerbates negative attitudes toward persons with serious mental illness. (Am J Psychiatry 2013; 170:494-501)

AB  - Antisocial personality is generally used to describe people who treat other people with callous disregard and disrespect. Although animal cruelty is diagnostic of conduct disorder, a precursor of antisocial personality in children, it is unclear whether the term antisocial also encompasses disregard and disrespect toward nonhuman animals among adults. In this study, we examined associations between three antianimal attitudes and behaviors-speciesism, hunting/fishing, and lack of sympathy for animal rights-and traits that underlie adult antisocial behavior. We found consistent links between antisocial personality traits and antianimal attitudes and behaviors in 2 samples. These effects were generally specific to traits linked to antisociality (although we also found associations with low openness), and these traits were stronger as predictors of variation among meat eaters than as predictors of differences between vegetarians and meat eaters. These results suggest that the term antisocial applies to negative attitudes and behaviors toward both humans and nonhuman animals and imply the potential value of considering antianimal attitudes and behaviors in the clinical assessment of antisocial personality.

AB  - Background: In the setting of end-of-life care, biases can interfere with patient articulation of goals and hinder provision of patient-centered care. No studies have addressed clinician bias or bias management specific to goals of care discussions at the end of life.
   Objectives: To identify and determine the prevalence of palliative care clinician biases and bias management strategies in end-of-life goals of care discussions.
   Design: A semistructured interview guide with relevant domains was developed to facilitate data collection. Participants were asked directly to identify biases and bias management strategies applicable to this setting. Two researchers developed a codebook to identify themes using a 25% transcript sample through an iterative process based on grounded theory. Inter-rater reliability was evaluated using Cohen . It was 0.83, indicating near perfect agreement between coders. The data approach saturation.
   Setting/Participants: A purposive sampling of 20 palliative care clinicians in Middle Tennessee participated in interviews.
   Results: The 20 clinicians interviewed identified 16 biases and 11 bias management strategies. The most frequently mentioned bias was a bias against aggressive treatment (n = 9), described as a clinician's assumption that most interventions at the end of life are not beneficial. The most frequently mentioned bias management strategy was self-recognition of bias (n = 17), described as acknowledging that bias is present.
   Conclusion: This is the first study identifying palliative care clinicians' biases and bias management strategies in end-of-life goals of care discussions.

AB  - Each individual's personal experiences-and the developmental environments that individuals create for others' personal experiences-are profoundly affected by membership in, and attitudes toward, social groups. Although social groups may offer supports to their members and though members may contribute to groups' collective good, social-group divisions also create occasions for stereotyping and prejudice. This article reviews developmental intergroup theory (Bigler & Liben, 2006) that argues for the emergence of stereotyping and prejudice through the relational interplay of constructive and contextual processes. The theory is then discussed in the domain of gender by describing first, illustrative laboratory and field research on gender stereotypes and biases, and second, implications for gender-segregated (single-sex) educational programs.

AB  - This paper explores how a group of immigrant Roma women are shaping their reproductive lives in the transnational context generated by the migratory flows of post-1989 Romania. The analysis is based on the ethnographic reconstruction of the reproductive lives of 124 women from seven Roma family networks residing in Spain and connected with relatives all over Europe. Although these groups are increasingly heterogeneous, some common patterns seem clear. Primarily, we observe that these women are transforming the tempo and quantum of their reproductive careers in a culturally specific fertility transition that is not based on the postponement of childbearing and marriage. Early, pronatalist and patrilocal marriage followed by adolescent maternity are powerful normative orientations in the groups studied. Spacing the second or the third child and stopping having children in their early 30s seem to be the most common strategies by which they are responding to the increasing costs and setbacks of high fertility. Their transnational experiences in Western Europe are contributing to this process in ideological, structural and instrumental terms. The demographic contrasts of many Roma groups with their non-Roma neighbours are a source of prejudice and 'ethno-demographic anxiety' that fuel populist, nationalist and illiberal sentiments and movements.

All these partners and friends have contributed to the final result, although often they did not share the approaches or tenets of the author. Hence the responsibility for the shortcomings and mistakes of this paper rest entirely with him. We also warmly thank the Roma women who shared their views with us. We hope we are portraying their experiences and understandings accurately, and apologize if the questions we posed sometimes may have seemed too personal and invasive to them. We also answered the personal questions they asked us, but acknowledge that it was an asymmetrical exchange, and we are aware of the power imbalances generated by differences of education, class, income, gender, ethnicity and nationality. We could only hope that we are using the transient and precarious power that we might have had in those exchanges for promoting an understanding of processes that we consider crucial to the welfare and empowerment of these women.

AB  - Childhood-onset fluency disorder, the most common form of stuttering, is a neurologic disability resulting from an underlying brain abnormality that causes disfluent speech. Stuttering can lead to significant secondary effects, including negative self-perception and negative perception by others, anxiety, and occasionally depression. Childhood-onset fluency disorder affects 5% to 10% of preschoolers. Early identification of stuttering is important so that therapy can begin while compensatory changes to the brain can still occur and to minimize the chances of the patient developing social anxiety, impaired social skills, maladaptive compensatory behaviors, and negative attitudes toward communication. However, stuttering may be persistent, even with early intervention, and affects about 1% of adults. In patients with persistent stuttering, speech therapy focuses on developing effective compensatory techniques and eliminating ineffective secondary behaviors. The role of family physicians includes facilitating early identification of children who stutter, arranging appropriate speech therapy, and providing support and therapy for patients experiencing psychosocial effects from stuttering. Finally, physicians can serve as advocates by making the clinic setting more comfortable for people who stutter and by educating teachers, coaches, employers, and others in the patient's life about the etiology of stuttering and the specific challenges patients face.

AB  - Objectives Increasing vaccination hesitancy threatens societies' capacity to contain pandemics and other diseases. One factor that is positively associated with vaccination intentions is a supportive subjective norm (i.e., the perception that close others approve of vaccination). On the downside, there is evidence that negative attitudes toward vaccinations are partly rooted in conspiracy mentality (i.e., the tendency to believe in conspiracies). The objective of this study is to examine the role of subjective norms in moderating the association between conspiracy mentality and vaccine hesitancy. We examined two competing predictions: Are those high in conspiracy mentality immune to subjective norms, or do subjective norms moderate the relationship between conspiracy mentality and vaccination intentions? Methods We conducted five studies (total N = 1,280) to test these hypotheses across several vaccination contexts (some real, some fictitious). We measured conspiracy mentality, vaccination intentions, subjective norms, attitudes toward vaccination, and perceived behavioural control. Results A merged analysis across the studies revealed an interaction effect of conspiracy mentality and subjective norm on vaccination intentions. When subjective norm was high (i.e., when participants perceived that close others approved of vaccines) conspiracy mentality no longer predicted vaccination intentions. This was consistent with the moderating hypothesis of subjective norms and inconsistent with the immunity hypothesis. Conclusions The typical negative relationship between conspiracy mentality and vaccination intentions is eliminated among those who perceive pro-vaccination subjective norms. Although correlational, these data raise the possibility that pro-vaccination views of friends and family can be leveraged to reduce vaccine hesitancy.

AB  - The growing older population will increase the demands on the health and welfare systems, including elder care services. One way of meeting these growing service needs is to shift from traditional care services to technologically oriented services. Robotic innovations are gradually being introduced to elder care services. The aim was to explore attitudes toward the use of care robots in elder care services - specifically focusing on situations and interaction, influence, and emotions in interaction with care robots. Data were obtained from visitors at a welfare technology fair (n = 124). The results show that the most negative attitudes concerned if the care robots were humanized and had emotions. The attitudes toward interacting with care robots in general were predominately positive. In conclusion, concrete usage scenarios in elder care services need to be detected, based both on users' needs, digital literacy and on the maturity of the technology itself.

AB  - Background. Gays, lesbians and bisexuals (i.e. non-heterosexuals) have been found to be at much greater risk for many psychiatric symptoms and disorders, including depression. This may be due in part to prejudice and discrimination experienced by non-heterosexuals, but studies controlling for minority stress, or performed in very socially liberal countries, suggest that other mechanisms must also play a role. Here we test the viability of common cause (shared genetic or environmental etiology) explanations of elevated depression rates in non-heterosexuals.
   Method. A community-based sample of adult twins (n = 9884 individuals) completed surveys investigating the genetics of psychiatric disorder, and were also asked about their sexual orientation. Large subsets of the sample were asked about adverse childhood experiences such as sexual abuse, physical abuse and risky family environment, and also about number of older brothers, paternal and maternal age, and number of close friends. Data were analyzed using the classical twin design.
   Results. Non-heterosexual males and females had higher rates of lifetime depression than their heterosexual counterparts. Genetic factors accounted for 31% and 44% of variation in sexual orientation and depression respectively. Bivariate analysis revealed that genetic factors accounted for a majority (60%) of the correlation between sexual orientation and depression. In addition, childhood sexual abuse and risky family environment were significant predictors of both sexual orientation and depression, further contributing to their correlation.
   Conclusions. Non-heterosexual men and women had elevated rates of lifetime depression, partly due to shared etiological factors, although causality cannot be definitively resolved.

AB  - Research with typically developing groups has identified loneliness as a significant predictor of a range of physical and mental health problems. This paper reviews research about loneliness in children and adults with intellectual disability. Although a considerable body of evidence has highlighted the difficulties individuals with intellectual disability have with friendships, there is a relative scarcity of research focused explicitly on loneliness. The available evidence suggests that up to half of persons with intellectual disability are chronically lonely, compared with around 15-30% of people in the general population. The cognitive, physical, and mental health problems already associated with intellectual disability are likely to be compounded by experiences of chronic loneliness. We argue that people with intellectual disability are highly vulnerable to loneliness and present a theoretical model of vulnerability that comprises three reciprocally influencing domains: social attitudes and expectations; opportunities and experiences; and skill deficits associated with intellectual disability. We propose that societal views that have traditionally devalued and stigmatized persons with intellectual disability limit their opportunities for experiencing social and emotional connectedness with others. Individual skill deficits in areas such as communication, self-regulation, and social understanding, as well as functional difficulties associated with intellectual disability, also potentially influence the opportunities and experiences of people with intellectual disability, both directly and via multiple layers of the social context. In turn, limited opportunities will entrench particular skill deficits and reinforce negative attitudes toward intellectual disability. The model proposed in this paper provides a starting point for developing a more sophisticated understanding of the experience of loneliness for individuals with intellectual disability.

AB  - This article is based on scientific evidence from a national survey carried out in Italy in 2017 on a sample of 4011 students. The results of the statistical analysis show that the potential educational role of sports is not an explicit value embedded in its practice. In these terms, today the causal link between sports and education appears to be a stereotype. The study shows that teenagers who play sports outside of school have an increase in their levels of tolerance of bullying and racism. In addition, respondents who play sports have highly stereotyped opinions about gender roles and ethnic diversity. The neutrality of sports practice in Italy, with regard to social inclusion and the dissemination of positive values, has been demonstrated. Although sport can be a useful educational tool to mitigate limits arising from disadvantaged social conditions, a direct relation between sports and education has not been observed. In order to spread positive social values and promote social inclusion through sport, we hypothesise that it is necessary to overcome two limits: the inequality in sports opportunities among students and the weakness of the relation between sports and pedagogy. This article finally proposes a pedagogical approach aimed at sports teaching oriented towards social inclusion.

AB  - Indigenous people are the most underrepresented racial/ethnic group in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine (STEMM) in the United States. Most prior research suggests this trend is the result broadly of settler colonialism, and more specifically of cultural differences between students and school/university environments; poor academic preparation in K-12 schools; vague constructs of educational or vocational goals; insufficient financial aid; unwelcoming school and university environments; prejudice and racism; and social isolation. There is also a vast body of published work on the unique epistemologies and knowledge systems held by Indigenous peoples, which are only recently being acknowledged within mainstream STEMM communities. One potential reason for lower participation in STEMM programs and professions by Indigenous people that has generally gone unexplored relates to unique cultural and spiritual factors that could deter Indigenous people from STEMM fields. Our research investigates the range and variation of cultural/spiritual/ethical practical issues that may be affecting Indigenous people's success in STEMM. Our research provides valuable insights for policy and practices within higher education institutions and industry to provide flexible pathways for Indigenous people to reduce or eliminate barriers related to culturally- and spiritually-informed issues. In this paper, we explore how our findings can be used by professional societies to provide leadership to higher education institutions and industry in the area of changing some standard practices to be more inclusive of Indigenous people. An important mode of systemic change in STEMM fields is through professional societies that guide future practices in various STEMM disciplines.</p>

AB  - This study used experimental methods to examine the effects of a media portrayal of two gay 13-year-old characters on young viewers' attitudes toward LGBTQ people and issues by exploring the influence of gender identity and sexual orientation on viewers' reactions. An online quasi-experiment of 469 participants, ages 13-21, revealed that gender identity and sexual orientation influenced viewers' emotional involvement with the storyline and identification with the characters, which was associated with a change in attitudes. For LGBTQ youth, the story evoked hope and fostered positive attitudes; however, it tended to produce a boomerang effect among heterosexual/cisgender youth, eliciting the emotion of disgust and leading to significantly more negative attitudes toward LGBTQ people and issues.

AB  - Previous research has drawn mixed conclusions regarding the relationship between White racial identity and attitudes toward diversity. We propose that identity form may help to disambiguate this relationship. In the present study, White participants wrote brief essays and were grouped based on their exhibition of one of three White identity forms: power-cognizant, prideful, or weakly identified. These groups were then compared on measures of White identification and attitudes toward diversity. A power-cognizant identity was associated with more pro-diversity attitudes than a prideful identity, despite equivalently high identification. A weakly identified form was associated with low identification and relatively neutral attitudes toward diversity. The findings suggest that, when predicting Whites' attitudes toward diversity, identity form matters.

TI  - "I am Kichwa": The Funds of Identity of an Indigenous Ecuadoran NNES Teacher
T2  - TESOL QUARTERLY
LA  - English
KW  - POWER
AB  - To counter ongoing NES/NNES, NEST/NNEST dichotomies and the essentializing of NNESs (Ellis, 2016), we examine the personal and professional tensions of an Indigenous Ecuadoran NNES teaching in a dominant Spanish-speaking context. We attend to the ways Roberto (pseudonym) responds to his students and his peers through the lens of his Kichwa identity, the historic oppressed positionality of and ongoing prejudice toward Indigenous peoples in Ecuador. In such contexts, Roberto cannot share "insider" cultural references to enhance his EFL instruction; rather, he is perpetually set as an outsider-both in the broader frame of NNES movement and more singularly and powerfully within his own professional context. We draw upon Esteban-Guitart and Moll's (2014) "funds of identity" and teacher professional identity development (Sachs, 2005) to explore the following central tensions in Roberto's evolving professional teaching identity: (1) Roberto's sense of himself as (il)legitimate speaker of English, (2) role of structural oppression toward Kichwa as it mediates his perceptions and interactions, and (3) the increased use of communicative-based language instruction. Attending to the multiple facets and resources that comprise "funds of identity," EFL teacher educators can better account for the complex identity formation for EFL teachers and students.

AB  - Background. Breastfeeding is the natural way of feeding an infant with mother's milk by direct nipple contact with the baby's mouth in order to provide nutritional, metabolic and physiological needs, as well as to protect the baby from morbidity and mortality. However, inadequate knowledge and negative attitudes lowers the prevalence rate of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) among rural mothers.
   Objectives. To assess the level of knowledge, attitudes and practice of breastfeeding among rural women and to determine the factors that affect this practice.
   Material and methods. This study was a cross-sectional descriptive study conducted on 130 conveniently selected mothers aged 18-35 years having at least one child (aged 1 week to 6 years). Simple descriptive statistics were used to identify the general characteristics of the participants, where univariate logistic regression was used to determine the factors considering p-values less than < 0.01 and < 0.05.
   Results. Most of the women had a positive attitude towards breastfeeding, where 68.46% of mothers had properly given breast milk to their children up until 6 months, while 91.6% fed them colostrum; respectively, 78.5% and 73.1% of mothers washed their hands and cleaned their baby's mouth before and after the child's mouth contact with the breast. The mother's age and education (OR = 0.428 [CI = 0.176-1.039] p < 0.001), (OR = 1.627 [CI = 0.870-3.046] p < 0.001), the father's education and occupation (OR = 0.987 [CI = 0.828-1.177] p < 0.001), (OR = 0.906 [CI = 0.574-1.429] p < 0.005) and dwellings structure (OR = 2.555 [CI =0.722-9.042] p < 0.001) are associated with the practice of breastfeeding.
   Conclusions. Breastfeeding and EBF should be promoted through primary care and counseling programs together with programs designed to uplift the socio-economic status of rural women.

AB  - High rates of mental health problems are a growing concern in Czech higher education, negatively impacting students' performance and wellbeing. Despite the serious nature of poor mental health, students often do not seek help because of negative attitudes and shame over mental health problems. Recent mental health research reports self-compassion is strongly associated with better mental health and reduced shame. However, relationships between those constructs remain to be evaluated among Czech students. This study aims to appraise the relationships between mental health problems, negative mental health attitudes, mental health shame, and self-compassion in this population. An opportunity sample of 119 psychology students from a Czech university completed questionnaires regarding these constructs. Correlation, regression, and path analyses were conducted. Mental health problems were positively associated with negative mental health attitudes and shame, and negatively associated with self-compassion. Self-compassion negatively predicted mental health problems, while negative attitudes and shame did not. Last, self-compassion fully mediated the negative attitudes-mental health problems relationship, and partially mediated the shame-mental health problems relationship. Findings suggest self-compassion is essential for mental health in Czech students and associated with negative mental health attitudes and mental health shame. Czech universities can benefit from incorporating self-compassion training into their curricula to protect students' mental health.

AB  - Delay in help-seeking for sexual health issues may lead to relationship discord and impact the quality of life. The study aimed to explore the factors related to HSBs (help seeking behaviors) for sexual health issues and to determine the role of negative attitudes relating to sexual concerns in the HSBs of Iranian women. This cross-sectional study was performed in 2020. Participants were 390 randomly selected women from Rasht, Iran. The data were collected using a demographic and a sexual history checklist, the Female Sexual Function Index-6-item (FSFI-6), the Attitudes-related Sexual Concern Scale (ASCS), and a help-seeking behavior questionnaire. Formal help-seeking in women with sexual concern was 16.2% and 48.6% engaged informal HSB. Informal HSB was associated with younger age (OR = 0.93; CI = 0.89-0.97), having a university degree (OR = 3.42; CI = 1.89-6.18), sexual abuse in adulthood (OR = 2.59; CI = 1.07-6.26) and lower negative attitudes-related sexual concerns (OR = 0.53; CI = 0.32-0.87). Formal HSB was related to having a university degree (OR = 3.03; CI = 1.32-6.98) and history of a chronic disease (OR = 3.43; CI = 1.68-6.98). Negative attitudes relating to sexual concerns greatly impact informal HSBs of women, so it should be considered in their health care programming.

AB  - Purpose Contemporaneously, the crime of rape has experienced an increase in reporting. The majority of rape survivors continue to experience, however, extensive victimisation due to biased attitudes held by many people and organisations within the general population. The paper aims to discuss these issues.
   Design/methodology/approach In a quantitative study with a sample of 176 participants, this research aimed to explore sexuality and religiosity as factors that affect attitudes towards survivors of rape.
   Findings Results indicated that negative attitudes towards rape survivors could be predicted by rape myth acceptance. While the sexuality of the victim affected attitudes towards rape survivors and negative attitudes towards survivors were also found to be predicted by high religiosity scores, analyses concluded that both males and females perceived gay male victims with more negative attitudes in comparison to lesbian rape survivors. Male participants demonstrated, overall, more negative attitudes towards rape survivors than their female counterparts. In sum, sexuality and religiosity were concluded to be crucial factors in explaining blame attributions.
   Practical implications This study indicates: (1) the effect of social correlates other than gender on rape myths; (2) the effect sexuality has on the perception of rape myths; and (3) the effect religiosity has on the perception of rape myths. This study also reveals implications for the reporting, prosecution and conviction of rape cases that may be subject to bias and discrimination due to victim characteristics other than gender.
   Originality/value Attitudes towards rape survivors based on social correlates other than gender have received little attention within existing literature and research. This paper adds to this discussion by considering the affects of sexuality and religiosity which have implications for the reporting of such a crime.

AB  - Since its original formulation, Tajfel's Social Identity Theory (SIT) has broadened considerably from its original focus on intergroup relations and is now applied to a wide range of phenomena. Indeed, the 'social identity approach' has become one of the most widely used perspectives in contemporary social psychology. In this article, I examine the popularity of Tajfel's writings on social identity and intergroup relations, especially over the last thirty years when they started to become more generally used. I offer a critical appraisal of the original SIT, both as a theory of intergroup relations and as a theory of identity, concluding that its real value lies in its success in offering an over-arching perspective on the importance of groups in social life and its ability to stimulate new areas of research. I then widen the discussion to consider how the social identity perspective has been used in a number of other fields of enquiry.

AB  - We investigated the racial content of perceivers' mental images of different socioeconomic categories. We selected participants who were either high or low in prejudice toward the poor. These participants saw 400 pairs of visually noisy face images. Depending on condition, participants chose the face that looked like a poor person, a middle income person, or a rich person. We averaged the faces selected to create composite images of each social class. A second group of participants rated the stereotypical Blackness of these images. They also rated the face images on a variety of psychological traits. Participants high in economic prejudice produced strongly class-differentiated mental images. They imagined the poor to be Blacker than middle income and wealthy people. They also imagined them to have less positive psychological characteristics. Participants low in economic prejudice also possessed images of the wealthy that were relatively White, but they represented poor and middle class people in a less racially differentiated way. We discuss implications for understanding the intersections of race and class in social perception.

AB  - According to social dominance theory, intergroup dynamics are strongly influenced by the social positions which individuals hold in society. Several studies suggest that holding a position of power can, sometimes automatically, generate negative attitudes and hostile behaviors toward subordinate social groups. However, at present, the studies carried out on these effects of power have not taken into account the influence of the normative context. Based on the distinction made by Sidanius and Pratto between hierarchy-enhancing (HE) vs. hierarchy-attenuating (HA) environments, this study examines if the effects of power on legitimizing cognitions vary as a function of the normative environment. A laboratory study and a study conducted in a natural environment confirm our hypothesis that individuals holding a powerful or dominant social role in a HE setting differ significantly from individuals holding an equally powerful role in a HA setting. The effects of power observed in past research probably resulted from studying power in hierarchy-enhancing environments, but not in hierarchy-attenuating ones.

AB  - Issues of race periodically rupture in the national and international consciousness, while at other times, there is a false belief that society has arrived at a post-racial era. Either way, there remains impetus for the critical interrogation of the racialisation of multimodal literacies in education, and critical race theory (CRT) is a leading approach. This article reviews original studies that collectively analyse multimodal texts and practices to understand the construction of race in education. Multimodal texts have proliferated in online textual ecologies due to the ease of production and rapid global dissemination of image-based texts in the twenty-first century. Such texts combine two or more modes, such as images, words, sounds, and gestures. Sites for the circulation of multimodal literacies-online and offline-serve to disrupt, reify, or perhaps even exacerbate racial identities, prejudice, and subordination in education. The review highlights the prevalent themes: (a) Discursive construction of race in the spoken mode, (b) Anti-racist and multimodal counter-narratives, (c) The racialisation of multimodal literature for children and adolescents, and (d) Race in music, visual and performing arts, and digital media. Gaps in CRT research and challenges are posed for future research of race in the context of cultural and technological change.

AB  - Receiving help can make or break a career, but women and racial/ethnic minorities do not always receive the support they seek. Across two audit experiments-one with politicians and another with students-as well as an online experiment (total n = 5,145), we test whether women and racial/ethnic minorities benefit from explicitly mentioning their demographic identity in requests for help, for example, by including statements like "As a Black woman horizontal ellipsis " in their communications. We propose that when a help seeker highlights their marginalized identity, it may activate prospective helpers' motivations to avoid prejudiced reactions and increase their willingness to provide support. Here we show that when women and racial/ethnic minorities explicitly mentioned their demographic identity in help-seeking emails, politicians and students responded 24.4% (7.42 percentage points) and 79.6% (2.73 percentage points) more often, respectively. These findings suggest that deliberately mentioning identity in requests for help can improve outcomes for women and racial/ethnic minorities.
   In two audit experiments with politicians and students, and an online experiment, Kirgios et al. show that women and racial/ethnic minorities seeking help are more likely to receive support when they explicitly mention their marginalized demographic identity.

AB  - ObjectiveWe examine how women high in social dominance orientation reconcile supporting a social system that seemingly disadvantages them. We propose that women high in social dominance orientation are more likely to adopt a benevolently sexist worldview.
   MethodThis paper contains data from two survey studies. Study 1 used data from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Survey (N=10,485) which is a study of social attitudes, personality, and health outcomes among New Zealanders. Measures of Social Dominance Orientation, as well as Hostile and Benevolent Sexism were included in Study 1. Study 2 consisted of data from a smaller sample of American females (N=269). In addition to the variables described above, we also measured the extent to which participants perceived the gender hierarchy to be legitimate and their perceived personal need for protection from men. Control variables included hostile sexism and demographic variables (participants' age, race, and socioeconomic status).
   ResultsResults revealed that social dominance orientation was a stronger predictor of benevolent sexism among women compared to men. Serial mediation analysis was then conducted in Study 2. Study 2 confirmed the hypothesised mechanism: Higher social dominance orientation was associated with perceptions that women's low status is legitimate which, in turn, was associated with higher perceived personal need for protection from men. This was then associated with the endorsement of a benevolently sexist worldview.
   ConclusionOur findings suggest that social dominance orientation might help to explain why some women endorse benevolent sexism.

AB  - Marketing executions (e.g., advertisements, packaging, and brand imagery) incorporating racial or ethnic stereotypes are present in many brands' histories. Over time, these executions have been updated to comport with societal norms, but much of the dated brand information remains accessible to consumers, especially via various digital platforms and archives. Over four studies, we investigate how exposure to these historical remnants affects contemporary consumers' held brand attitudes, showing that these executions have a detrimental influence in certain marketplace subsegments. Respondents generally report more negative brand attitudes upon exposure to the historical execution based on perceived offensiveness (Studies 1, 2, and 3). Study 4 rounds out these findings by identifying that offensiveness perceptions are differentially tied to how consumers (majority vs. minority) utilize their egalitarian beliefs.

AB  - We test a novel framework for how ingroup members are perceived during intergroup interaction. Across three experiments, we found that, above and beyond egalitarian attitudes and motivations, White observers' automatic responses to Blacks (i.e., their implicit anti-Black bias) shaped their affiliation toward ingroup targets who appeared comfortable engaging in interracial versus same-race interaction. White observers' implicit anti-Black bias negatively correlated with liking of White targets who were comfortable with Blacks (Experiments 1-3). The relationship between implicit bias and liking varied as a function of targets' nonverbal comfort in interracial interactions (Experiment 1). Specifically, implicit bias negatively correlated with liking of targets when targets' nonverbal behaviors revealed observers felt comfortable with interracial contact, irrespective of the nature of those behaviors (Experiment 2). Finally, the relationship between implicit bias and target liking was mediated by perceived similarity (Experiment 3). Theoretical implications for stigma-by-association, social network homogeneity, and extended contact are discussed.

AB  - Synthetic drug use (SDU) is on the rise in China. Utilizing a grounded three-level social-ecological theoretical model, we aim to better understand how users, medical professionals, and other community gatekeepers perceive the causes and consequences of synthetic drug use in Kunming, China. Past work typically relies on drug users confined to rehabilitation facilities. Utilizing qualitative methods, our work integrates how various community actors perceive problems around synthetic drug use. Thirty face-to-face interviews were conducted in Kunming that were audio-recorded and transcribed. We identify emergent personal, interpersonal and societal level themes shaping SDU which provided our grounded theoretical model. Regardless of their social position, informants identified curiosity, peer networks that facilitated exposure, and the communality of sharing the drug experience as reasons to try synthetic drugs. Drug users reported negative consequences of SDU including the inability to sleep, a fear that others might discover one was using, and the difficulty of quitting. Medical professionals and others in the community were more likely to identify potential harms of SDU. Still, these community members felt synthetic drugs were less problematic than traditional drugs and reported less prejudice and stigma about these new drugs. Overall, medical professionals felt ill-prepared to deal with this new epidemic.

AB  - A survey of 340 UK residents was conducted when the COVID-19 virus first reached the UK in February 2020. We measured past experiences of positive and negative intergroup contact with Chinese people as predictors of intergroup threat and emotions in the context of the pandemic; and how these processes in turn predicted support for discriminatory policies designed to restrict the freedom of Chinese people in the UK. We tested a novel threat-matching hypothesis which draws upon models of outgroup-specific social perception to predict that the emotional processes underlying contact effects will depend on the specific threat posed by the outgroup. In the present epidemiological context, Chinese people posed a salient threat to individuals' physical health and welfare. Accordingly, we show that whilst intergroup contact predicted both fear and anger towards the outgroup, the indirect effect of contact on support for Chinese restriction policies via fear was significantly stronger than the indirect effect via anger. Our findings provide a more nuanced understanding of how specific threat and emotions drive intergroup contact effects, and offer important insights for efforts to maintain positive intergroup relations in the face of the crisis.

AB  - The growth of STEM career occupations is outpacing the college enrollment of STEM students in the United States. There have been many research projects investigating this issue. There has not however been a study which investigated the impact non-fiction literature has on student interest in studying STEM (specifically engineering) content. The purpose of this study was to investigate the change of student attitudes toward engineering after reading literature involving non-fiction engineering centric narratives. The study used a modified version of the PATT (Pupils Attitudes Towards Technology) called the TEAS (Technology and Engineering Attitudes Scale) to measure student attitude change. The students were high-school aged students in the United States (ages: 15-17) who were enrolled in an English Literature course. The students completed the TEAS before and after reading and studying two engineering and technology centric non-fiction books (The Boy Who Harnessed The Wind and October Sky). The data revealed that student attitude after reading and studying the two books did not statistically change.

AB  - In recent years, a number of authors have commented on the current diversification of archaeological theory into different paradigms defined by diverse epistemologies and methods. One of the main consequences of this process has been the closure of the theoretical debate in archaeology, i.e. the fragmentation of archaeological theory into separate non-communicating paradigms. In this setting, several archaeologists have argued that there is a need for new theoretical discussions that promote dialogue among archaeologists belonging to different schools of thought. I suggest that a reflection on scientific progress, if executed properly, can fulfil this goal. In particular, I examine the conception establishing that science progresses by discarding incorrect prejudices and assumptions rather than by accumulating new facts and evidence. I argue that this view may be of particular relevance for different groups of archaeologists because it is compatible with the main philosophies that have oriented archaeological research since the 1980s. I illustrate this point with a number of examples drawn from the history of archaeology.

AB  - Child sexual abuse is a prevalent problem within our communities, yet policies that address it are mostly responsive rather than preventive. Given its impact on victims, it is important to move toward secondary prevention strategies, such as targeting individuals at higher risk for offending due to their sexual interest in minors, but who have yet to offend, and providing them with the resources needed to remain offense-free. This strategy is hindered by stigma, which prevents minor attracted persons (MAPs) from self-identifying. To dispel that stigma, the present study aimed to assess public attitudes toward MAPs and determine whether they could be changed by reading a psychoeducational text about MAPs. Analysis revealed that reading the text was associated with more negative attitudes. Findings are discussed as they pertain to the development of an anti-stigma intervention for MAPs.

AB  - Background: Access to mental health care services for patients with neuropsychiatric disorders remains low especially in post-conflict, low and middle income countries. Persons with mental health conditions and epilepsy take many different paths when they access formal and informal care for their conditions. This study conducted across three countries sought to provide preliminary data to inform program development on access to care. It thus sought to assess the different pathways persons with severe mental disorders and epilepsy take when accessing care. It also sought to identify the barriers to accessing care that patients face.
   Methods: Six in depth interviews, 27 focus group discussions and 77 key informants' interviews were conducted on a purposively selected sample of health care workers, policy makers, service users and care takers in Uganda, Liberia and Nepal. Data collected along predetermined themes was analysed using Atlas ti software in Uganda and QSR Nvivo 10 in Liberia and Nepal
   Results: Individual's beliefs guide the paths they take when accessing care. Unlike other studies done in this area, majority of the study participants reported the hospital as their main source of care. Whereas traditional healers lie last in the hierarchy in Liberia and Nepal, they come after the hospital as a care option in Uganda. Systemic barriers such as: lack of psychotropic medicines, inadequate mental health specialists and services and negative attitudes of health care workers, family related and community related barriers were reported.
   Conclusion: Access to mental health care services by persons living with severe mental disorders and epilepsy remains low in these three post conflict countries. The reasons contributing to it are multi-faceted ranging from systemic, familial, community and individual. It is imperative that policies and programming address: negative attitudes and stigma from health care workers and community, regular provision of medicines and other supplies, enhancement of health care workers skills. Ultimately reducing the accessibility gap will also require use of expert clients and families to strengthen the treatment coalition.

AB  - Researchers investigated the impact of a professional learning intervention focused on teaching teachers to increase rigor, challenge, and engagement to reveal talent in low-income learners. The professional learning intervention's goal, to improve teachers' ability to recognize student ability and talent through use of proven high-level curricular and instructional strategies, focused teacher learning on culturally responsive teaching, fundamental principles of learning, and specific curriculum. Researchers hypothesized teacher perceptions of students' abilities would shift from a deficit view to a strengths-based one. Results indicated that teacher beliefs were positively impacted after one year and that those impacts leveled off over time. Specifically, teachers' perceptions of student potential and the importance of talent development improved. Engagement in professional learning predicted positive change in classroom support, organization, and instruction. Finally, the professional learning intervention positively impacted teacher efficacy related to engaging, instructing, and managing learners.

AB  - The paper explores the activities of the Dublin Society as a form of public reason. Founded in 1731 when the Irish legislature and all trade policy was under the oversight of the British parliament, the Dublin Society undertook two roles usually under the purview of the government: economic improvement and public reason. Rawls' definitions of public reason, with some qualifications are used. Given the nature of Irish governance, the Society transmutes the idea of public reason into the economic realm. Through its various projects, experiments, contests, schools, and publications, which all had public input, the Society develops a process whereby factual conclusions and social consensus can be made on the Irish economy. Although it did not fully escape the prejudices of its time, the Society provides a larger space than Irish political institutions for members of the public to engage in public reason as economic citizens rather than political or religious ones.

AB  - The aim of the research was to find out whether participants completing an SCM questionnaire to assess attitudes towards the Roma would give different answers in response to different sets of instructions. Three sets of instructions were tested using cognitive interviews: answer from your personal viewpoint, from the viewpoint of the majority of Slovaks, from the viewpoint of those close to you. The research sample comprised 24 respondents, of whom 12 were upper secondary school students and 12 working adults. Responses from the personal viewpoint differed markedly from responses from the viewpoint of the majority of Slovaks, but were very similar to responses from the viewpoint of those close to the person. In the research, internal and external motivation to respond with/without prejudice was also investigated. Participants with internalised unbiased beliefs showed a preference for assessing the Roma minority from their own viewpoint, while participants with internalised biased beliefs thought the instructions were unimportant.

AB  - Although research continues to demonstrate that HIV stigma is associated with decreased HIV testing, the psychological processes implicated in this association remain unclear. The authors address this gap by differentiating between the HIV stigma mechanisms of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. They hypothesize that HIV stereotypes specifically, more so than prejudice or discrimination, are associated with HIV testing among at-risk populations. Ninety-three HIV-negative people receiving methadone maintenance therapy at a clinic in the northeastern United States participated by completing a survey. Results demonstrated that HIV stereotypes are associated with HIV testing via the mediator of perceived HIV risk. As hypothesized, prejudice, discrimination, and objective HIV risk were not associated with perceived HIV risk. Differentiating between HIV stigma mechanisms in future work can provide critical insight into how to intervene in HIV stigma to increase HIV testing and improve HIV prevention among at-risk populations.

AB  - To what extent did U.S. natives' social distance attitudes toward various European ancestry groups affect European immigrants' residential segregation in the early twentieth century? Surprisingly, this question has not been directly addressed, even though it is well known that, at the time, U.S. natives' social distance attitudes toward different racial/ethnic groups, documented by Emory Bogardus's famous 1926 survey, were key features of a boundary separating whites into two divisions: (1) those of Southern, Central, and Eastern European ancestry, and (2) those of Northern and Western European ancestry. The present study finds that variation in natives' expressed desires for social distance from different European ancestry groups was a decisive factor in European immigrant groups' residential segregation from the native-born U.S. population, independently of the immigrant groups' formal schooling and monetary assets. The results bolster claims in the residential segregation literature that majority-group prejudice plays a central role in minority groups' spatial distance from the majority group, net of any socioeconomic inequalities.

AB  - People's physical appearance can have a profound impact on their social interactions. Faces are often the first thing we notice about people and the basis on which we form our first impressions of them. People with facial disfigurement are discriminated against throughout their lives. Currently, we do not know why this discrimination occurs. In order to develop viable interventions, we must first understand the nature of people's reactions to disfigurement. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that a "disfigured is bad" stereotype exists, wherein people attribute negative characteristics to individuals with facial disfigurement. People made judgments of individuals before and after they received corrective treatment for their disfigurement. Observers reported lower emotional valence (i.e., more negative emotion), higher arousal, and lower dominance when viewing pretreatment (vs. posttreatment) photographs. Moreover, pictured pretreatment individuals were viewed significantly more negatively in terms of personality (e.g., emotional stability, conscientiousness), internal attributes (e.g., happiness, intelligence), and social attributes (e.g., trustworthiness, popularity). These subjective judgments further reduced to people with disfigurement being regarded as less sociable and happy, less dominant, less emotionally stable, and more as objects of curiosity compared with those with corrected facial disfigurement. Our findings suggest that negative stereotype of people with facial disfigurement may drive discrimination in social, academic, and professional contexts. Knowing what inferences people draw on the basis of disfigurement will make it possible to design interventions to improve the way people with disfigurement are viewed and ultimately treated by others.

AB  - This article addresses the way in which the securitisation of education, effected through initiatives in counter-terrorism such as Prevent, leads to what I call 'pedagogical injustice' for students and teachers. It analyses the implications of the pre-crime agenda in the space of the classroom and draws upon literature on epistemic injustice, communicative injustice and institutional prejudice to explain why bringing counter-terrorist legislation into education undermines the educational endeavour. It argues that by re-framing the Prevent agenda in the language of therapy, resilience and well-being, indicators guiding its implementation that might otherwise be seen as illegitimate or even illegal forms of profiling are given credence in the spheres of education and other domains which demand pastoral care from professionals. By targeting ideas instead of focusing on violence, Prevent undermines educators. Foucault describes this kind of blurring of discourses as ubuesque and examines the veneer of legitimacy given when professionals engage in discourses and practices beyond their specific expertise. This new figure is the counter-terrorist educator operating between the spheres of security, psychology and education. To contest this image of education and outline the dangers of this approach, we turn to Arendt's writings on education and her commitment to 'training the imagination to go visiting'.

AB  - Objective: Patient care is one of the most important functions of nursing. Nurses are responsible legally and ethically to take care of male patient without any discrimination. Sexuality perceptions and embarrassment effect negatively on intimate care particularly between male patients and female nurses. In this study we aimed to; determine nurses' attitudes, towards male patient and evaluate some factors that can improve this situation.
   Methodology: This cross sectional study was performed from March-June 2009, in Gulhane Military Medical Academy School of Nursing. A total of 300 female nursing students voluntarily participated out of 310 students, and responded to the questionnaires. The questionnaire comprised of 29 questions 8 questions were about socio-demographic characteristics of participants, and 21 questions were about attitude towards male patient.
   Results: Results showed that (71.3%) students indicated that performing any application to a male patient was as easy as performing on a female patient 78.3% indicated that same age male patients were the most difficult age group for taking care. Calculated attitude point of Year III students about body cleaning, rectal lavage, perinea( cleansing, rectal tube application, and naso-gastric tube applications are higher than other students'. Similarly; the attitude was more positive among the students that chose their school intentionally, than others as regards taking care of a male patient which was considered as easy as performing to a female patient.
   Conclusion: Many students have negative attitudes towards specific physical care needs of male patients, especially genital area related applications. Applied education methods, professionalism and providing ethical information and insight can resolve this gap.

AB  - Stigma about mental health is a significant problem in Jamaica and the wider English-speaking Caribbean. In general, negative attitudes and opinions about mental illness have been found to negatively impact psychological help-seeking among several populations.
   This study examined Jamaican adolescents' preferential sources of help for a variety of psychological problems. This study also examined adolescents' beliefs about the usefulness of seeking help for several psychological issues.
   Survey data were collected from (N = 339) Jamaican male and female adolescents.
   Results of rank ordered data indicate that for many psychological problems, Jamaican adolescents were likely to first turn to friends and family for help. In addition, faith healers, teachers and guidance counselors were consistently identified as the last sources of help among this population. Differences in this pattern were noted when specific descriptions of mental illness were provided versus when left more vague; and between adolescents from upper and lower socioeconomic groups. Discouraging findings reveal that regardless of disorder, adolescents did not believe seeking help would provide any relief from mental health symptoms.
   Jamaican adolescents in general do not think that seeking help for psychological problems would be useful. In spite of this, there are some clinical presentations where adolescents would likely seek help from specific providers based on symptoms experienced. In most cases however, teachers and guidance counselors were a last resort for seeking help. Implications for improving youth access to mental health services, community public health education, and stigma reduction programs are discussed.

AB  - By asking students to fill in 10 statements beginning with 'I am ' and a further 10 statements beginning with 'I am not ' we constructed profiles of British Muslim ethnic and national identity. Participants were 108 British Muslim girls of mean age 12 6 years studying in a single sex girls' school in Birmingham, UK. Using content analysis we found that some adolescent girls are rooted only in their personal identity. Others are rooted in their social identity. We found a number of major categories rooted in ethnic identity only, rooted in ethnic identity but differentiating self from other groups, tooted in bicultural identity, rooted in national identity and confused ethnic and national identity. Significantly a number of participants were concerned to transcend group identities and described themselves as 'not racist' or 'not prejudiced' A model of ethnic and national identify is presented incorporating rootedness. differentiation, confusion and transcendence (C) 2009 The Association for Professionals in Services for Adolescents Published by Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

AB  - Latino immigrants in the United States face a hostile climate, including policies that reinforce community-level prejudices and acts of discrimination. Discrimination has an impact on the well-being of individuals who are targeted. The purpose of this study was to learn from Latino immigrant parents about responses to incidents with discrimination, including the process by which they determine how to respond. Fifty-four Latino immigrants participated in in-depth interviews. Using constructivist grounded theory methods, a model was developed to reflect participants' responses to discrimination. Findings indicate Latino immigrants' responses to discrimination evolve in a consciousness-raising process, including five phases of awareness: recognizes discrimination; questions discrimination; engages in reflection/dialogue on issues of race and discrimination; acknowledges value in self; and takes action. Moving through these phases, participants are more critically reflective on personal experiences and larger environmental contexts. Participants also engage in assessment of risks and opportunities when deciding how to respond to discrimination. Documentation status, English proficiency, and knowledge of systems of care affected their ability/decision to advocate. This study offers guidance for social service providers to support and collaborate with immigrants to increase their capacity to advocate. Findings suggest that future research is needed to explore the connection between phases of response and well-being.

AB  - In criminal cases, evidence about psychological syndromes is typically introduced by the defense in support of insanity, self-defense, or imperfect self-defense claims and by the prosecution to show that a criminal act occurred. The admissibility of defense-proffered testimony about phenomena such as battered woman syndrome, combat stress syndrome, or XYY syndrome depends in the first instance on how insanity, self-defense, and other defensive doctrines are defined (the materiality issue). Additionally, this type of testimony, as well as prosecution-proffered evidence about phenomena such as rape trauma syndrome and abused child syndrome, must bear indicia of reliability (the probative value issue), add to the fact finder's knowledge (the helpfulness issue), and avoid distracting or confusing the fact finder (the prejudice issue). The ultimate admissibility decision involves consideration of the scope of the criminal law, the scientific methodology associated with the syndrome, the counter-intuitiveness of the evidence, and the role and capacities of juries.

AB  - Chimpanzee conservation is dependent on addressing key threats such as habitat degradation, which is fueled by collection of firewood in Uganda ' s Kibale National Park. To address this threat, sustained behavior change that reduces dependence on fuelwood is needed. One of the greatest challenges for conservation education programs and behavior change campaigns is to have long-term and consistent effects on communities. Teacher trainings have potential to influence a large number of students over an extended period of time. In this study, we tested if teacher training on an activity designed to reduce community impact on the environment and thus reduce habitat encroachment in a critical chimpanzee habitat-construction of fuel-efficient stoves (FES)-could lead to retained knowledge and attitude improvements for students as well as sustained behavioral change in communities around Kibale National Park up to 2 years after initial training on the topic. We consistently found improvements in student knowledge and attitude change between the beginning and end of the year for third- and sixth-grade students in 11 program schools, but not in four control schools. In addition, the number of FES built by 120 teachers engaged in the program and their students continued to average over 150 stoves per year across 4 years. Our study suggests that teacher training can lead to sustained and multiplicative behavior change, which may mitigate threats to chimpanzees and other wildlife threatened by habitat encroachment in the park over time.

AB  - The antecedents and consequences of intergroup interactions have been well studied, but interaction contentwhat partners actually talk abouthas not. In the experiment we report here, interaction content moderated well-documented self-regulation effects (i.e., cognitive depletion) among White participants interacting with a Black partner. Specifically, White individuals participated in a video email interaction with an ostensible Black or White partner who broached topics systematically varying in intimacy. Greater cognitive depletion was evident after interacting with a Black partner relative to a White partner, but only after discussing more intimate topics. When conversation topics aligned with Whites' preferences to avoid intimacy in interracial interactions, depletion effects were reduced. Thus, interaction content, which has been largely ignored in intergroup interaction research, has important implications for intergroup interaction.

TI  - Tobacco Industry Denormalization Beliefs in Hong Kong Adolescents

LA  - English

KW  - SMOKING
KW  - ASSOCIATION
AB  - Background: Tobacco industry denormalization (TID) seeks to expose the industry's misconducts. Research on TID beliefs, meaning negative attitudes toward the tobacco industry (TI), may inform TID programs, but was limited to western populations. We investigated TID beliefs and their association with smoking and sociodemographic characteristics in Hong Kong adolescents.
   Methods: In a school-based cross-sectional survey of 14 214 students (mean age 15.0 years, 51.5% boys), TID beliefs were assessed by two questions: (1) whether the TI was respectable and (2) whether the TI tried to get youth to smoke, each with four options from "definitely no" to "definitely yes." Smoking susceptibility and behaviors were also assessed. Sociodemographic characteristics included age, sex, perceived family affluence, highest parental education, numbers of co-residing smokers, and school-level smoking prevalence.
   Results: Of all students, 77.6% considered the TI not respectable and 56.6% believed that the TI tried to get youth to smoke. Stronger TID beliefs were inversely associated with smoking susceptibility and behaviors. For example, students considering the TI definitely not respectable (vs. definitely yes) were 56% (95% confidence intervals [CI] = 45% to 66%), 49% (95% CI = 41% to 56%), and 53% (95% CI = 36% to 65%) less likely to be susceptible to smoking (among never-smokers) and be ever- and current smokers, respectively. Of all correlates examined, only younger age and having no co-residing smoker were associated with TID beliefs.
   Conclusions: Substantial proportions of Hong Kong adolescents did not hold TID beliefs, but those who did were less likely to smoke. Our results suggest that TID programs may help reduce adolescent smoking.

AB  - Pacific Islander (PI) women experience disproportionately high rates of cervical cancer and mortality and have lower rates of Pap testing. Since up to 70% of cervical cancers could be prevented by being vaccinated for human papilloma virus (HPV), this cross-sectional study explored the predictors of HPV and vaccine awareness, receipt of the vaccine, and attitudes toward vaccinating children among adult PI women in southern California, who historically have low rates of HPV vaccination and high rates of cervical cancer that could be prevented with HPV vaccination. Participants (n=148) consist a subsample of Chamorro, Samoan, and Tongan women, ages 21 to 65 years, who were in a larger randomized community study to promote Pap testing. Overall, younger age and higher American acculturation were significantly associated with ever hearing about HPV and the vaccine. However, American acculturation was also associated with negative attitudes toward vaccinating their children for HPV. This paper provides preliminary insights into barriers and facilitators to HPV vaccination among PIs in the USA and also informs the development of educational programs to reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortality in this underserved population.

AB  - There are numerous media offerings targeted to young audiences that claim to have educational benefits. It is hard to overemphasize the need for evidence about which of these offerings are effective, for which populations, and for which outcomes. The current article begins by discussing the value and limitations of meta-analysis (as opposed to narrative literature reviews) as a tool for marshaling such evidence. We illustrate these points with a recent meta-analysis of the educational impact of Sesame Street international coproductions. We then present two further studies that emerged from one aspect of the findings, examining effects of educational TV narratives on children's racial/ethnic attitudes.

AB  - Religious belongings help migrants, especially irregular ones, to confront the precariousness of their lives. France represents a peculiar case because it is a secular country where undocumented migrants have access to free medical care and their children to compulsory education. The present paper explores Filipino migrants' religious space in France by examining irregular migrant Filipinas' church involvement and shows the contrasting attitudes of these women towards religion: some find in the Church a social institution supporting their social and economic incorporation in France, whereas others stay away from religious gatherings to avoid prejudice and gossip. These attitudes point to the key roles of religion in the structuring of migrant populations, as well as of the Church as a centre of collective identity, a source of empowerment and an instrument of social control.

We know less about how a researcher's prejudice can unconsciously exclude Dalits and females from their research. In this critical autoethnographic study, I extend the concept of reflexivity by illustrating first awareness of the subtle nuances of my own prejudiced disposition and belief against Dalit and female participants, and second how preconceptions can be disrupted by the researcher being conscious of everyday actions in the research field, and questioning moments of awkwardness or difficulties in and out of the field.

AB  - Scientists and laypeople agree on high ability as a defining feature of giftedness. Yet their views on gifted people's socioemotional characteristics diverge. Most studies find the gifted to be similar or slightly superior to average-ability persons in these domains ("harmony hypothesis"). However, subjective conceptions and media representations, most of which have focused on gifted children and youth, stress the socioemotional downsides of giftedness ("disharmony hypothesis"), affecting highly able individuals and those around them, thus hampering individual development. To date, most studies on gifted stereotypes have examined selective samples, mostly teachers. The present study is the first to provide representative data on conceptions of gifted individuals in general. A brief survey of 1029 German adults assessed quality and prevalence of stereotypes about gifted individuals, without an explicit focus on children and/or adolescents. Latent class analysis (LCA) revealed two conceptions of giftedness, with twice as many "disharmonious" than "harmonious" raters. Male gender, single parenthood, unemployment, higher income or negative attitudes toward the gifted predicted disharmonious ratings. However, effects were small, suggesting future studies look deeper into the processes of stereotype formation and maintenance.

AB  - Attitude measurement error is one of the main factors that deteriorates the imaging accuracy of laser scanning. In view of the fact that the inertial navigation system (INS) with high accuracy is very costly, a low-cost but effective GPS-aided method based on the target images is proposed to measure the platform attitude angles in this paper. Based on the relationship between the attitude change of the platform and the displacement of two adjacent images, the attitude change can be derived by the proposed method. To quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of the platform attitude angles measured by the proposed method, an outdoor experiment was carried out in comparison with the GPS/INS method. The preliminary results demonstrated that the measurement accuracy using the proposed method was better than 0.05 degrees (RMSE). (C) 2017 Optical Society of America

T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY
LA  - English
AB  - Between the World Wars, public transportation in Northern cities like Chicago and New York allowed African Americans, many of them newly migrated from the South, to contest geographical and bodily boundaries. Attention to the public, liminal space of subways and streetcars complicates scholarly understanding of black mobility that typically centers on restrictive residential covenants. While covenants did confine African Americans to living in delimited black belts, the necessities of work or school and the gratification of leisure activities often led to interracial contact on public transportation outside black neighborhoods. Once on public transportation, the close proximity of white and black bodies both fueled and challenged prejudices that marked African Americans as loci of disease and violence; subways and streetcars were spaces for African Americans to enact and police standards of respectability within their own community. Mobility that offered both promise and peril in the interwar years also inspired aesthetic reflection on the modern black urban experience by writers like Langston Hughes, Richard Wright, and Ralph Ellison.

AB  - Introduction: The attitudes towards older people is essential. Society's perception of older adults is often unpleasant. Inappropriate treatment of older people in society causes a decrease in self-esteem, a sense of control over one's own life, a decrease in the quality of life, an increase in anxiety, depression, anger, and sadness. The aim of this study was to compare the attitudes of young people and seniors towards older people in relation to their satisfaction with life and self-esteem. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted online in groups of young adults under 35 years of age (Group I) and over 65 years of age (group II), with 177 people each. Method: The study used the following questionnaires: Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Self-Assessment of Own Person (SOP), and Kogan's Attitude Towards Old People Scale (KATOPS). Results: The satisfaction of life in both groups was average. The mean value of self-esteem was significantly (p < 0.001) lower in the group of seniors. Both groups of respondents had negative attitudes towards seniors in the KATOPS. There was a statistically significant correlation between life satisfaction and self-esteem in seniors. Gender, age, education, or place of residence of respondents had no impact on negative attitudes in both groups. Conclusions: Both groups showed negative attitudes towards seniors. No significant correlation was found between the groups and gender of the respondents, and the influence of the respondent's age, education, marital status, or place of residence. There was a correlation between the respondents' attitudes in the subscale of negative attitudes and their satisfaction with life. No correlation between self-esteem and age and marital status were found with no dependence on gender, education, or place of residence.

AB  - This research examined the role that group dynamics played in the 2016 US presidential election. Just prior to the election, participants were assessed on perceived self-similarity to group members' views, perception of own leader's prototypicality, perceptions of social values, and strength of support (attitudes). Results indicated that Democrats were more inclusive, seeing more similarity between themselves and members from the outgroup political party, while Republicans displayed more ingroup solidarity and negative attitudes toward outgroup members. Trump was viewed as a more prototypical leader by Republicans than Clinton was by Democrats. These results may help to explain the perhaps surprising fragility of Democrat voters' support for Clinton.

AB  - Underwater photo-elicitation is a novel experiential marine education technique that combines direct experience in the marine environment with the use of digital underwater cameras. A program called Show Us Your Ocean! (SUYO!) was created, utilising a mixed methodology (qualitative and quantitative methods) to test the efficacy of this technique. Participants (adults and high school students) snorkelled, explored the ocean, and captured images both in and out of the water. Underwater photo-elicitation was proven effective at increasing awareness, eliciting emotional reactions, and fostering a sense of connection to the ocean. However, it was not necessarily effective for raising awareness of environmental issues nor for motivating pro-environmental behaviour. Interestingly, while some attitudes about and behaviours toward the ocean did become more environmentally sensitive, others appeared to shift unexpectedly away from environmental concern. This result was perhaps due to the lack in the program of an ecological knowledge-based component. Participants enjoying the beauty of the ocean did not realise the threats facing it or what to do about these. If the goal is to achieve significant attitude change and cultivate pro-environmental behaviour, this new approach should be supplemented with critical thinking/action competence and ecological/ocean literacy.

AB  - This article provides a review of the research record on the potential for media literacy education to intervene in the media's influence on racial and ethnic stereotypes, and explores the theoretical concepts that underlie these efforts. It situates media literacy theory and practice within particular emphases in the field and synthesizes qualitative and quantitative studies. Quantitative research on the effect of media literacy training and mediated counterstereotypes on reducing racial/ethnic prejudice is described. In addition, we report qualitative data from an ongoing study of early adolescents who took part in a media literacy curriculum on stereotypes. The research record reveals that although the topic is severely understudied, media literacy education holds great promise for its ability to shape media-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors and encourage an active and critical stance toward media.

AB  - During the last decade, many European countries have faced sizeable immigration inflows accompanied by high prevalence of negative sentiments toward immigrants among majority members of the host societies. We propose that basic human values are one important determinant of such negative attitudes, and we seek to explain variation across countries in the strength of the effects of values. Based on Schwartz' (1992, 1994) basic human value theory, we hypothesize that universalism values are conducive to positive attitudes toward immigration, while conformity-tradition reinforce anti-immigration sentiments. We furthermore hypothesize that these value effects are moderated by two contextual variables. Both value effects are expected to be weaker in countries with a higher level of cultural embeddedness. Furthermore, negative effects of conformity-tradition values are hypothesized to be cushioned by a lower proportion of immigrants in the country. A multilevel analysis of data from 24 countries from the fourth round of the European Social Survey (2008-2009) supports these hypotheses. Moreover, we demonstrate that the measurement properties of the theoretical constructs exhibit equivalence across countries, thereby justifying statistical comparisons.

AB  - Cross-sectional research has shown that frequency of self-disclosure to outgroup members mediates the positive relationship between intergroup friendship and outgroup attitudes. The current research investigated the relationship between self-disclosure and attitudes in more depth. New undergraduate students were asked to nominate an ingroup or outgroup friend and then report the intimacy of their disclosures to them, their anxiety and attitudes towards a series of social groups, in the first week of the semester and 6 weeks later. Intimacy of disclosure predicted more positive attitudes towards outgroups over time, but this association was only found among participants who nominated an outgroup friend. In the ingroup friend condition, a negative association was found. These associations were mediated by general intergroup anxiety. These relationships highlight the importance of integrating theories of interpersonal and intergroup relations when investigating intergroup contact. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This qualitative case study utilized critical media literacy to guide the analysis of the depiction of racially and ethnically diverse college students in contemporary popular films. Participants in this study were racially and ethnically diverse undergraduate students enrolled at a private, predominantly White institution in the United States. Three primary themes emerged from this study. First, students of color were more apt to recognize stereotypical portrayals of people of color in the films, whereas White students' responses were more attuned with color-blind racial ideology (CBRI). Second, media-centered discussions provided an outlet for students of color to share their personal experiences with racism, stereotyping, and prejudice. In doing so, students of color seek to build the cultural competence of peers who may hold CBRI beliefs. Finally, this study presents a need for critical media literacy. Regardless of race and/or ethnicity, the undergraduates who participated in our study communicated an importance of examining media messages, such as stereotypes of people of color, from a critical perspective. For college and university administrators, such as chief diversity officers, this study is significant in presenting a means for engaging students, faculty, and other stakeholders in dialogue about racial issues in the hopes of fostering a more welcoming campus racial climate for students of color.

AB  - Qualitative researchers have long observed that rationales for medical interventions on intersex characteristics, or variable sex characteristics (VSC), invoke heteronormative ideals. Such medical interventions are controversial and described as infringing human rights. Recent survey research has confirmed that support for medical intervention, and opposition to its legal limitation on human rights grounds is predicted by (1) identifying as heterosexual and (2) endorsing gender binary beliefs. We replicated both findings here among 59 LGB+ and 61 heterosexual participants. Opinions about medical interventions on intersex characteristics were additionally predicted by belief in heterosexual complementarity among all participants, and by strength of heterosexual identification among heterosexual-identified participants. Participants read excerpts from three published interviews with a medical professional, a parent of a child with intersex characteristics, and an adult with intersex characteristics and generated analogies to these experiences. Participants who generated more diverse analogies endorsed the gender binary and medical interventions less, and supported legal limitations more. The results are discussed in relation to the formation and distribution of public attitudes to the controversial medicalisation of intersex characteristics.

AB  - Background: Integration of psychiatric care with public health services and offering mental health care services to patients from lower socioeconomic status remains a global challenge. Scarcity of funds and professional workforce in psychiatric hospitals contribute to this situation. However, negative attitudes in the population are also a known impediment to patients seeking mental health services. This study aimed to assess the attitudes toward psychiatric hospitals among the urban and rural population in India.</p>
   Subjects and Methods: The study was carried out amongst the general population in Odisha, India. The total sample (n = 988) includes 496 respondents from an urban-setting, and 492 respondents from rural parts of the district. Participants were selected by using simple random-sampling from the Asian Institute of Public Health (AIPH) data base. A standardized seven-item questionnaire was adopted, with responses indicated on a 5-point Likert-scale. Interviews were fully structured and conducted face-to-face.</p>
   Results: Level of education (B = -0.192, ss = -0.320, p < 0.000) and urban-rural comparison (B = -0.272, ss = -0.189, p < 0.000) significantly influenced attitudes toward psychiatric hospitals. Gender, age, and religious beliefs did not show any significant effect on attitudes toward psychiatric hospitals. Individuals in rural areas and those with lower education levels showed more negative attitudes toward psychiatric hospitals.</p>
   Conclusion: Negative attitudes toward psychiatric hospitals from those living in rural areas as well as those with lesser education may be reflective of the lack of availability, accessibility, affordability, and credibility of such mental health services. The Mental Health Care Act in India is a progressive legislation which might improve the situation of the provided services and, consequently, reduce negative attitudes in the years to come.</p>

AB  - Analyses of racist discourse have often involved data from contexts concerning issues of human mobility. A great deal of this literature points to the extent to which people draw on the tropes of liberalism to justify social exclusion, and in particular to warrant negative evaluations of outgroups. Using media data from political debates involving the radical right-wing U.K. Independence Party (UKIP) in the U.K. General Election campaign of 2015, the present article highlights a different rhetorical strategy by which exclusion can be warranted by speakers arguing for a reduction in immigration. This novel strategy explicitly avoids any negative characterization of outgroups, and instead advocates the individualization of immigration decisions. This is exemplified in UKIP's policy of basing the United Kingdom's approach to immigration on an "Australian-style points-based system." This was invoked by UKIP representatives in the debates as a straightforward "off-the-shelf' system that would enable the U.K. to "take back control" of immigration. while ensuring that immigration decisions were based on individual merit rather than on group membership. As such, the points system could also be invoked specifically to anticipate and counter accusations of racism and/or xenophobia. The findings are discussed in relation to the tacit ideological assumptions underpinning UKIP's policy, specifically around psychologization, the reliance on an acultural version of Australia, and the tacit use of categorical accounting.

KW  - pure means
AB  - This article is concerned with the educational value of raising the human body at school. Drawing inspiration from the work of Giorgio Agamben, I develop a new perspective that explores the possibility of taking the concept of physical education in a literal sense. This is to say that the specific educational content of physical education (in contradistinction to organized sporting life outside school) resides in its concentration on the physical 'as such'. This is not an obvious path to explore, because defenders of physical education as a rule have to compete against the (dualist) prejudice that this discipline is merely an instrument to train the body or to keep it fit, and that it therefore should not be considered as a serious endeavour. Therefore, more often than not, apologists try to justify the relevance of physical education on the very ground that it is a practice that is concerned with something 'beyond' the merely physical that is at stake in movement activity. I argue, however, that this line of thought excludes the possibility of conceiving an alternative approach that relates the concentration on 'entirely physical' activities (as opposed to 'merely physical' activities) to an experience of potentiality. I develop this idea on the basis of an analysis of repetitive, rhythmical and collective body-exercise (e.g. running in a group or basic callisthenics).

AB  - This paper reports on an ethnographic exploration of the lawyer-client relationship focusing on the attitudes held by legally aided lawyers to their criminal clients. The study combines formal interviews with participant observation in a mixed methodology approach designed to give voice to the lawyers taking part as well as allow the researcher to provide their own perspective. The research produced two quite contradictory viewpoints as lawyers claimed to hold positive attitudes of their clients in interview while presenting negative attitudes under observation. To reconcile this difference, the author suggests considering psychoanalytic literature on self-image, which can be applied to show that the lawyers may have been displaying signs of Freudian defence mechanisms and, ultimately, presented as neurotic in their practise.

AB  - Do attitudes toward and perceptions of infidelity depend on perceived relationship quality? A prediction was made that there should be a positive correlation between perceived relationship quality and negative attitudes and perceptions of infidelity, and that these correlations should be stronger for males than for females. These predictions were confirmed. More specifically, strongly negative evaluations of infidelity were reported by females regardless of relationship quality, and for males with high relationship quality. Negative attitudes toward infidelity increased for both males and females in high-quality committed relationships, but males who reported lower relationship quality had the most favorable attitudes toward infidelity. These results are consistent with an evolutionary rationale, which suggests that males' attitudes and perceptions of infidelity depend on their perceived risk of cuckoldry.

AB  - Context. Palliative care (PC) education for medical students is important. Knowledge concerning drugs and services can be readily taught, and skills of communicating with terminally ill patients and their families are increasingly being addressed. Developing positive attitudes toward caring for patients near the end of life is more challenging.
   Objectives. To examine medical students' attitudes toward PC in each year of their course, investigate changes in these attitudes over time during their course, and identify gender differences in attitudes and attitudinal change.
   Methods. Questionnaires administered to four cohorts of preclinical core science and clinical medical students at the University of Cambridge Medical School from 2007 to 2010, with annual longitudinal follow-up in subsequent years; 1027 participants in total.
   Results. Students started their medical course with broadly positive attitudes toward PC, which largely persisted into the final years. During the core science component, some attitudes became more negative, whereas during the clinical component, some attitudes became more positive. Over the whole course, there was evidence of increasingly positive attitudes. No significant effect of gender on attitudes or attitudinal change was found. Although statistically significant, all these changes were small.
   Conclusion. Medical students' attitudes toward their future role in caring for people with PC needs were broadly positive. Core science was associated with increasingly negative attitudes and clinical studies with increasingly positive attitudes. For teaching faculty, the challenge remains to address negative and foster positive attitudes toward PC during medical school. (C) 2015 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

AB  - Drawing upon the stimuli-organism-response framework, we investigate the effects of the possible actions and self-location of virtual reality experiences on perceived enjoyment, affecting millennials' attitude changes and visit intentions. The results show a significant influence of possible actions on perceived enjoyment, leading to attitude change and visit intention, while self-location leads to perceived enjoyment and thus attitude change. Through two independent samples (i.e., pre- and post-COVID-19), we examine the moderating effects of a change in circumstances on structural relationships. Our findings suggest that self-location is critical to changing attitudes toward destinations during the pandemic. Thus, we demonstrate that VR plays a critical role in helping tourism destinations recover and building tourism resilience. This study extends current knowledge of spatial presence by examining the respective roles of self-location and possible actions in tourism destinations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite promotional measures at a national level, female surgeons account for only 10% of the consultant workforce in the United Kingdom. With rising proportions of female medical graduates, it is important that surgery continues to recruit the most able candidates regardless of sex. This study investigates the differing perceptions of surgical careers among recent medical school graduates and identifies factors discouraging female doctors from pursuing a career in surgery.
   METHODS: Newly qualified graduates from the University of Nottingham Medical School, Nottingham, UK, were invited to complete a nonmandatory questionnaire investigating career intentions and factors influencing this.
   RESULTS: Two hundred and eight questionnaires were returned (a 66% response rate). Male respondents were significantly more likely to rate surgery as an attractive or very attractive career (P = .0116). Overall, only 33 (25%) female doctors expressed interest in a surgical career as opposed to 33 (42%) male doctors (P = .010). Frequently cited reasons included no interest in surgery itself (21%) and negative attitudes toward women in surgery among the surgical teams (18%). Irrespective of career interests, 59% of male and 68% of female respondents believed surgery was not a career welcoming women (P = .186). Reasons included difficulty maintaining family life, limited flexible training, and lack of role models.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies significant sex differences in the perception of surgical careers. The majority believes surgery does not welcome female trainees. Future strategies to promote surgery must address attitudes and behaviors in both sexes while taking active steps to support female surgeons during their training and in the workplace.

AB  - This study explores teacher identities of native English-speaking teachers (NESTs) and non-native English-speaking teachers (NNESTs) based on interview data collected from twenty teachers who teach English to young learners in South Korean primary schools. The participants comprised ten NESTs and ten NNESTs. Bourdieu's concept of three pillars was used to explore hegemonic relations between NESTs and NNESTs. The interview analysis showed that two different types of symbolic capital-one specified as native-speakerism and the other concretized as qualified tenured teacher positions-shape the dynamic nature of hegemonic relations that have constructed an antagonistic collective habitus between NESTs and NNESTs. This study revealed that power fluctuations and lack of institutional cultural capital shaped NESTs and NNESTs' fragmented teacher identities which increased their dissatisfaction with their current roles. Bourdieu's concepts provide a sociological vocabulary for understanding NESTs and NNESTs' teacher identities and social status trajectories. This study provides an important theoretical and policy implication that English education practices and policies based on the ideology of native-speakerism fortify students' preference for native English and negative attitudes towards localized variants of English which threatens the sustainability of linguistic and cultural diversities of localized variants of English.

AB  - Objective: People with dysphonia are judged more negatively than peers with normal vocal quality. This preliminary study aims to (1) investigate correlations between both auditory -perceptual and objective measures of vocal quality of dysphonic and non-dysphonic speakers and attitudes of listeners, and (2) discover whether these attitudes towards people with dysphonia vary for different types of stimuli: auditory (A) stimuli and combined auditory-visual (AV) stimuli. Visual (V) stimuli were included as a control condition. Method: Ten judges with no experience in the evaluation of dysphonia were asked to rate A, AV and V stimuli of 14 different speakers (10 dysphonic and 4 non-dysphonic speakers) Cognitive attitudes, evaluation of voice characteristics and behavioral attitudes were examined. Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated to examine correlations between both Dysphonia Severity Index (DSI) values and perceptual vocal quality as assessed by a speech -language pathologist (PVQSLP) or perceptual vocal quality as assessed by the judges (PVQjudge). Linear mixed model (LMM) analyses were conducted to investigate differences between speakers and stimuli conditions. Results: Statistically significant correlations were found between both perceptual and objective measures of vocal quality and mean attitude scores for A and AV stimuli, indicating increasingly negative attitudes with increasing dysphonia severity. Fewer statistically significant correlations were found for the combined AV stimuli than for A stimuli, and no significant correlations were found for V stimuli. LMM analyses revealed significant group effects for several cognitive attitudes. Conclusion: Generally, people with dysphonia are judged more negatively by listeners than peers without dysphonia. However, the findings of this study suggest a positive influence of visual cues on the judges' cognitive and behavioral attitudes towards dysphonic speakers. Further research is needed to investigate the significance of this influence.

AB  - Background: Mild microcytic hypochromic anemias caused by iron deficiency (IDA) and beta-thalassemia trait (beta-TT) continue to be problematic and a significant threat to society, particularly in relatively poor developing countries. The goal of this study was to use an accuracy approach to improve the diagnostic function of eight different prejudiced indices in Egyptian pediatric patients with microcytic anaemia.
   Methods: Eight discrimination indices for diagnostic performance are introduced to analyze the differences between beta-beta-TT and IDA among Egyptian paediatric patients by using evaluation metrics calculated from RBC indices by various mathematical formulae. CBC, iron study and hemoglobin electrophoresis were performed to all included participants.
   Results: A total of 300 Egyptian paediatric patients with beta-TT or IDA were enrolled. The Mentzer and Ehsani index exhibited the highest diagnostic accuracy (100%) followed by Sirdah (97.5%), Sirvistava (95%), MDHL (92.5%) Green & King, Recierca, (90%), and Matos (70%). Indices with AUCs greater than 0.8, such as Mentzer, Ehsani, and Sirdah had very valuable predictive accuracy in distinguishing between beta-TT and IDA.
   Conclusion: Although Hb electrophoresis is the gold standard for diagnosing beta-TT, in developing countries, the Mentzer index, followed by the Ehsani and Sirdah indices, could be used as a simple and cheap method to distinguish beta-TT from IDA in pediatric patients with mild microcytic hypochromic anaemia.

AB  - Domestic Homicide Reviews (DHRs) are a statutory requirement in England and Wales, conducted when somebody aged 16 and over dies from violence, abuse or neglect by a relative, intimate partner or member of the same household. While key aims of DHRs are to identify recommendations and lessons learned to eventually prevent further domestic homicides, there is limited evidence globally regarding the extent to which these are followed up or make a difference. This paper explores the barriers and facilitators to the conduct and impact of DHRs to enhance their learning potential. It is based on nineteen qualitative interviews with professionals involved in the DHR process across five Safeguarding Boards in Wales and fourteen Community Safety Partnerships in the North-West of England, UK. Findings are presented thematically under four section headings: upskilling and democratising the review process; family and friends' involvement; negotiating organisational blame to foster learning; and actioning and auditing recommendations. It is suggested that organisational learning cannot be achieved without accepting organisational responsibility, which could be interpreted as blame. The role and skills of the Chair are perceived as key to ensure a safe, evidence-based, transparent and learning-focused DHR process. Developing and actioning recommendations may challenge longstanding prejudices. Promoting the role of families/survivor networks and professionals on an equal footing would support a more democratic process. Learning could be enhanced by thematising recommendations and proactively using lessons from one area to inform another. Participants called for appropriate central regulation and accountability to support the action of recommendations.

AB  - Study Objective: Nonadherence in sexual risk reduction interventions might be common among adolescents. We compared intervention completion rates among adolescent and young adult women with and without a previous pregnancy or sexually transmitted infection (STI) participating in a program to improve contraceptive continuation. Design: Secondary data analysis from a feasibility study of a health-coaching intervention to improve contraceptive continuation. Setting: Three urban pediatric clinics in Philadelphia. Participants: Women ages 14-22 years who were English-speaking, sexually active in the past year, not desiring pregnancy in the next year, and starting a new contraceptive method. Interventions: At baseline, participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and semistructured interview, followed by 5 monthly coaching sessions. Interviews and coaching sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded for thematic content. Main Outcome Measures: Intervention completion was defined as the number of completed coaching sessions. Secondary outcomes were qualitatively explored group differences in reproductive knowledge, attitudes, and risk perception. Results: Participants with a previous adverse outcome (a previous STI and/or a previous pregnancy) completed fewer coaching sessions than those without such history (median: 2 vs 4; P = .03). Both groups had low HIV/STI knowledge, negative attitudes toward pregnancy, and low HIV/STI risk perception. Those with a previous adverse reproductive outcome held more negative attitudes toward condoms. Conclusion: Despite similar reproductive knowledge, attitudes, and risk perception, young women who have experienced an adverse reproductive outcome might be less likely to fully engage in sexual risk reduction interventions. Future studies should confirm these findings and consider strategies to optimize the intervention's reach for vulnerable youth.

AB  - Tragic acts of school violence such as what occurred in Columbine, Newtown, and, more recently, in Parkland and Santa Fe, provoke intense feelings of anger, fear, sadness, and helplessness. Understandably, in response to these incidents (and for other reasons), many schools have intensified the manner in which they monitor and control students. Some schools rely on combinations of security measures such as metal detectors; surveillance cameras; drug-sniffing dogs; locked and monitored gates; random searches of students' belongings, lockers, and persons; and law enforcement officers. Not only is there little empirical evidence that these measures actually make schools safer, but overreliance on extreme security measures can create prisonlike environments that are inconsistent with students' best interests. Specifically, overreliance on intense surveillance measures often engenders distrust and discord among members of the school community in the long term, leading to increased disorder and dysfunction. Extreme security measures also play a role in pushing more students out of school and into the criminal justice system, which can have devastating consequences on students and their families.
   Although all schools do and should monitor students to some extent, empirical evidence demonstrates that not all students experience these intense, prisonlike conditions. Rather, schools serving higher concentrations of students of color are more likely to rely on coercive surveillance measures than schools serving primarily white students. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that legitimate safety concerns do not fully explain these racial disparities, but that implicit racial bias influences school officials' decisions to rely on intense surveillance methods to some degree. Indeed, empirical studies repeatedly document that many people unconsciously and unfairly associate minorities, particularly African Americans, with aggression, violence, crime, and danger.
   Recognizing that our current constitutional jurisprudence establishes prime conditions for these racial disparities to develop, this Article proposes a reformulated legal framework to evaluate the constitutionality of coercive surveillance methods that is firmly grounded in the U.S. Supreme Court's current Fourth Amendment jurisprudence. Applying this reformulated framework in connection with other strategies will ameliorate the effects of implicit racial bias, help address the disproportionate application of coercive security measures on students of color, and motivate school officials working in majority-minority schools to rely on alternative, evidence-based methods to enhance school safety without harming the learning climate.

AB  - Study background: Increasing cultural safety in health settings is essential to address stark health disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Respect for cultural knowledge, better communication, and recognition of racism as a determinant of health are required for improved service delivery. How this knowledge is acquired in health professional training and translated to clinical settings is poorly understood.
   Purpose: Impacts of an innovative Indigenous health unit and remote clinical placements on knowledge acquisition and attitude change were explored among midwifery students to inform cultural competency initiatives in health professional training.
   Methods: A multiphased, mixed methods research design used surveys, observations, and interviews. Qualitative analysis was strengthened through triangulation with quantitative data.
   Results: A unit conceived with substantial Indigenous Australian input and which privileged these voices enhanced knowledge and shifted attitudes in a positive direction; however, immediate gains diminished over time. Remote placements had a profound effect on student learning. Exposure to Indigenous Australians in classrooms and communities, and the self-reflection generated, helped dispel stereotypes and challenge assumptions based on limited cultural knowledge and contact.
   Conclusion: Optimization of receptivity to Indigenous Australian content and opportunities for remote placements contributed to students' developing cultural capabilities with implications for all health professional training. Whether this heightened awareness is enough to address institutional racism identified in health service delivery remains unanswered. The focus must include those established health practitioners and administrators who influence organizational culture if real systemic change is to occur. Given appropriate on-going support, graduates can play a vital role in expediting this process.

AB  - In recent decades, legal scholars have advanced sophisticated models for understanding prejudice and discrimination, drawing on disciplines such as psychology, sociology, and economics. These models explain how inequality is implicit in cognition and seamlessly woven into social structures. And yet, obvious, explicit, and overt forms of bias have not gone away. The law does not need empirical methods to identify bias when it is marching down the street in Nazi regalia, hurling misogynist invective, or trading in anti-Muslim stereotypes. Official acceptance of such prejudices may be uniquely harmful in normalizing discrimination. But surprisingly, many discrimination cases ignore explicit bias. Courts have refused to consider evidence of biased statements by government officials in cases alleging, for example, that facially neutral laws were enacted for the express purpose of singling out Muslims. Courts outright ignore explicit bias when they consider intentional discrimination to be justified by goals such as law enforcement. And courts have developed a "stray remarks doctrine" in employment discrimination cases to prevent juries from hearing evidence of explicit bias. This Article identifies and criticizes legal arguments against consideration of explicit bias, including concerns about the feasibility of inquiries into intent, worry about undermining otherwise legitimate policies, the desire to avoid chilling effects on free speech, and the fear that confronting explicit bias will result in backlash. It argues that discrimination law should dispense with doctrines that shield explicit bias from consideration.

AB  - State courts decide claims based on federal or sister-state law every day. Although the applicable constitutional provisions are different, there are significant similarities in the way the Supreme Court conceptualizes the constraints on how those claims must be treated. One project of this Article is to chart those similarities, providing a unified account of the Court's approach to judicial federalism. The larger project, however, is not to describe the Court's approach, but to replace it. The current emphasis on discrimination and interference imposes burdensome and unwarranted obligations on state courts. A more flexible approach to judicial federalism is needed, and this Article takes important steps in that direction by developing a new analytical framework focused on prejudice. Prejudice may result when a state court renders a decision on the merits that does not adequately respect the law being applied. Or it may result when the same court refuses to entertain a suit in circumstances where no alternative forum is available. Neither result should be countenanced. But when a state court declines to decide a claim, and does so in a way that produces no prejudice to the legal rights involved, abstention should be tolerated and perhaps even applauded.

AB  - Introduction: Behavioral engagement in schools is an important contributor to academic outcomes for adolescents, but may also protect them from substance abuse. Positive and negative attitudes to the past, present, and future have been linked to adaptive and maladaptive behaviors in adolescence, respectively, but there is a need for research that examines whether time attitudes promote behavioral engagement and lower risk for substance use.
   Methods: Structural equation models involving 1961 diverse high school students were utilized, which controlled for sex, GPA, and alcohol use.
   Results: Positive time attitudes were positively associated with behavioral engagement and students' GPA. Girls had stronger levels of behavioral engagement. Positive time attitudes were indirectly associated with less marijuana use via intrinsic motivation, engagement, and less alcohol use. The indirect effect of positive time attitudes on engagement via intrinsic motivation was significant and substantial. In a second structural model, we examined the effects of negative time attitudes, intrinsic motivation, and behavioral engagement on marijuana use. Negative time attitudes and intrinsic motivation were indirectly associated with less marijuana use via behavioral engagement. Both models explained 41% of the variance in engagement and 36% of the variance in marijuana use, suggesting that positive and negative time attitudes are equally valuable in understanding academic engagement and marijuana use among adolescents. A third model indicated that behavioral engagement was negatively related to a latent variable composed of binge drinking and alcohol use.
   Conclusions: Implications for practice and future research are discussed, as the current findings suggest the importance of positive time attitudes as promotive of behavioral engagement and protective against substance use.

AB  - Objective The image of the wicked stepmother has created a prejudice against stepmothers, which makes it difficult for them to adjust to their stepfamilies. This study compared fairy tales from different cultures to reestablish the nature of stepmothers.
   Methods Grimms' Fairy Tales (GFT) was used to represent Western culture, with stepmother characters appearing in 15 out of 210 tales. "The Collection of Korean Traditional Fairy Tales" (KFT) was used to represent Eastern culture, with stepmother characters featured in 14 out of 15,107 tales. We examined the relationships between stepmothers and stepchildren in GFT and KFT.
   Results Daughters were abused more often than sons in both genres. In GFT, jealousy spurred the abuse in 12 of 15 cases, while in KFT greed was predominant in 12 of 14 cases.
   Conclusion The fairy tale portrayals of wicked stepmothers may be associated with the stigma children place on their stepmothers, which needs to be overcome.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate hazing in collegiate marching bands. Specifically, the researchers were interested in marching band students' experiences with hazing behaviors, to whom they were reported, attitudes toward hazing, and level of awareness of institutional hazing policies. Using a multistage cluster sampling approach, we distributed an online questionnaire to college marching band members attending National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I schools. Participants (N = 1,215) were representative of 30 different states and included college freshmen, sophomores, juniors, seniors, and graduate students. Nearly 30% of respondents indicated they observed some form of hazing in their marching band. The most common acts of hazing involved public verbal humiliation or degradation, which generally went unreported. Reticence to report hazing was largely due to fear of social retaliation or perceptions that the hazing behaviors were innocuous. The vast majority of participants had negative attitudes regarding hazing and most learned about their institution's hazing policy through a marching band orientation. Implications for the college marching band, contextualization of results, and future directions are discussed.

AB  - Two experiments tested whether nostalgia is a resource for fighting ageism. In Experiment 1, younger adults who recalled a nostalgic (vs. ordinary) encounter with an older adult showed a more positive attitude towards older adults, mediated by greater inclusion of older adults in the self (IOGS). In Experiment 2, these findings were replicated and extended with a subtle nostalgia manipulation. Younger adults identified an older, familiar adult, before writing about an encounter with this person that was characterized by either central (e.g., keepsakes and childhood) or peripheral (e.g., wishing and daydreaming) features of the construct of nostalgia (i.e., prototype). Participants who recalled a central (vs. peripheral) nostalgic encounter reported greater social connectedness, which predicted increased IOGS. In turn, increased IOGS was associated with a lower desire to avoid older adults. Several alternative explanations for the intergroup benefits of nostalgia were ruled out. The research established that nostalgia qualifies as a resource for combatting ageism.

AB  - Introduction: There are multiple dimensions of HIV-related stigma that can compromise the mental and physical health of people living with HIV. We focused on the dimension of experienced stigma, defined as exposure to acts of discrimination, devaluation, and prejudice, and investigated its relationship with HIV health and psychosocial outcomes.
   Methods: We examined associations between experienced stigma in the community and health care settings and psychosocial and health outcomes for people living with HIV (N = 203) receiving care at an urban HIV clinic in the Southeastern United States. We also investigated whether those effects are unique to experienced stigma or are mediated by other dimensions of HIV-related stigma.
   Results: Experienced stigma was associated with suboptimal clinical outcomes such as viral nonsuppression, as well as poor affective, cognitive, and mental health outcomes (self-esteem, depressive symptoms, avoidance coping, and blame coping) and interpersonal outcomes such as social support and physician trust. Furthermore, serial mediation models suggested significant indirect effects of experienced stigma through internalized stigma and anticipated stigma from various theoretically expected sources of stigma (eg, community members, friends and family, and health care workers), with varying effects depending on the source.
   Conclusions: These findings suggest nuanced mechanisms for the effects of experienced HIV-related stigma, especially in health care settings, and may be used to inform stigma-reduction interventions. Interventions designed to address experienced stigma in health care settings might be more tailored to specific outcomes, such as depression and physician trust, than interventions designed to address experienced stigma in the community.

AB  - BackgroundUnderstanding community perspectives on antibiotics and antibiotic resistance (ABR) is a key component in designing educational interventions to combat ABR at the community level in Malaysia. Therefore, this study aimed to explore community residents' knowledge, attitudes and perceptions regarding antibiotics and ABR in Jelutong District, Penang, Malaysia. Moreover, it intended to identify areas of focus to be addressed when designing an educational intervention to increase residents' knowledge and change their attitudes and perceptions.MethodsA qualitative approach was adopted to gain a deeper understanding of community residents' knowledge, attitudes and perceptions regarding antibiotics and ABR. A purposive sampling was employed. Twenty-two residents (aged >= 18years) were interviewed with the aid of a semi-structured interview guide. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed.ResultsThe majority of the participants asserted that antibiotics could be effective against viral infections. Moreover, many participants were unaware that antibiotics have adverse effects. Some acquired antibiotics from a community pharmacy without a prescription, took antibiotics given to them by their family or friends, or took leftover antibiotics prescribed for a previous illness. A few indicated that they would request antibiotics from their physician when they had viral infections. More than half of the participants discontinued taking antibiotics when their symptoms improved. The majority stated that ABR occurs when the body becomes used to antibiotics. Most participants were unaware of the causes, consequences and prevention of ABR. In fact, they were not concerned about it. As a result, only a few perceived themselves as having responsibility for preventing this problem.ConclusionsThe community residents had misconceptions about antibiotics and ABR, negative attitudes towards antibiotics and negative perceptions of ABR. The areas of focus that need to be addressed when designing an educational intervention to increase the general public knowledge and change their attitudes and perceptions are the appropriate use of antibiotics and their adverse effects; the importance of adhering to antibiotic therapy; and the definition, causes, consequences and prevention of ABR.

AB  - Purpose: To describe the EEG pattern of seizures in patients with benign childhood epilepsy with centro-temporal spikes (BCECTS). Methods: The clinical and EEG data of 701 BCECTS patients with at least a 3 years follow-up were reviewed from 10 epilepsy centers. Results: Thirty-four seizures were recorded in 30 patients. Four different ictal EEG patterns (A-D) were identified. The most frequent (pattern A) was characterized by low voltage activity of fast rhythmic spikes, increasing in amplitude and decreasing in frequency, and occurred in 14 children. Pattern B (six patients) was constituted by a discharge of spikes intermixed with sharp waves increasing in frequency and amplitude. Pattern C (seven children) consisted of monomorphic theta which progressively formed a discharge increasing in amplitude and decreasing in frequency. Pattern D (5 children) was characterized by a initial focal depression of the electrical activity, followed by one of the three above described patterns. In 21 out of 28 children, the initial ictal pattern, altered from one pattern to another one. No clinical or EEG feature was predictive of a specific ictal pattern. Discussion: We failed to identify a unique ictal EEG pattern in our patients with BCECTS. The occurrence of per-ictal features, e.g., initial EEG depression or postictal slowing, is common and should not be interpreted with prejudice. Alteration of ictal EEG pattern from one to another is not in conflict with the diagnosis of BCECTS. (C) 2010 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Ageism (negative attitudes and behavior toward older adults) is a serious social issue and is of growing concern as the population of older adults continues to increase. Research demonstrates that negative aging perceptions and aging concerns are associated with poor health and well-being among older adults; yet, few studies have examined sexual orientation or gender differences in aging perceptions and concerns among older adults.
   Research Design and Methods: The current online study examined aging perceptions and concerns among a national community sample of 821 (female = 464) participants (76 lesbian, 159 gay, 88 bisexual, 498 heterosexual participants) ranging from 45 to 80 years of age (M = 55.56).
   Results and Discussion: Older women reported more aging anxiety and endorsement of aging stereotypes while older sexual minority individuals reported heightened general aging concerns compared to their heterosexual peers. Among sexual minority participants, discrimination based on age and sexual orientation predicted greater sexual minority-specific aging concerns, anxiety, and depression. Experiencing sexual orientation discrimination buffered age discrimination's impact on sexual minority-specific aging concerns, suggesting that experiencing discrimination based on one stigmatized identity (sexual minority) may promote effective coping with discrimination based on another stigmatized identity (older adult). Conversely, age and sexual orientation discrimination had multiplicative effects on anxiety and depression.

AB  - RESUME Nous avons examine les relations entre la sante percue (p. ex., l'etat de sante auto-evaluation) et des pratiques d'autoregulation de la conduite (p. ex., la frequence de la conduite, l'evitement des situations de conduite difficiles) comme mediee par les attitudes et les perceptions de conduite (a savoir, le confort de conduite, les attitudes positif et negatif envers la conduite) dans les donnees recueillies pour 928 conducteurs ages de 70 ans et plus inscrits a l'etude Candrive II. Nous avons observe que les attitudes specifiques a la conduite (p. ex., le confort de conduite, les attitudes negatives envers la conduite) assurent la mediation des relations entre les symptomes de sante et les comportements de conduite auto-reglementes au debut et au fil du temps. Seuls les attitudes negatives a l'egard de conduite ont medies entierement les relations entre les changements dans les symptomes percus de la sante et les changements dans le comportement de conduite. Les symptomes percus pour la sante influencent apparemment la probabilite d'eviter des situations difficiles de conduite par le biais de deux attitudes negatives initiales pour la conduite, ainsi que des changements dans les attitudes negatives au fil du temps. Comprendre les influences sur le comportement de conduite d'auto-reglementation seront benefiques lors de la conception des interventions visant a ameliorer la securite des conducteurs ages.
   ABSTRACT We examined the relations between perceived health (e.g., self-perceived health status) and driving self-regulatory practices (e.g., frequency of driving, avoiding challenging driving situations) as mediated by driving attitudes and perceptions (i.e., driving comfort, positive and negative attitudes towards driving) in data collected for 928 drivers aged 70 and older enrolled in the Candrive II study. We observed that specific attitudes towards driving (e.g., driving comfort, negative attitudes towards driving) mediate the relations between health symptoms and self-regulatory driving behaviours at baseline and over time. Only negative attitudes towards driving fully mediated the relationships between changes in perceived health symptoms and changes in driving behavior. Perceived health symptoms apparently influence the likelihood of avoiding challenging driving situations through both initial negative attitudes towards driving as well as changes in negative attitudes over time. Understanding influences on self-regulatory driving behaviours will be of benefit when designing interventions to enhance the safety of older drivers.

AB  - Attributing the negative behavior of an adversary to underlying dispositions inflames negative attitudes. In two studies, by manipulating both implicit theories and attributions, we show that the negative impact of dispositional attributions can be reduced. Both studies showed that inducing an incremental theory ("traits are malleable") in Israelis kept negative attitudes toward Arabs low (Study1), and political tolerance and willingness to compromise for peace high (Study 2), even when people were oriented toward dispositional attributions. Thus an incremental theory blocked the negative effect of dispositional attributions. Inducing an entity theory ("traits are fixed") had a negative effect on attitudes, tolerance, and compromise when dispositional attributions were salient but not when situational attributions were made salient. These findings have important implications for promoting intergroup relations and conflict resolution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Engaging key populations, including gender and sexual minorities, is essential to meeting global targets for reducing new HIV infections and improving the HIV continuum of care. Negative attitudes toward gender and sexual minorities serve as a barrier to political will and effective programming for HIV health services. The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), established in 2003, provided Gender and Sexual Diversity Trainings for 2,825 participants including PEPFAR staff and program implementers, U.S. government staff, and local stakeholders in 38 countries. The outcomes of these one-day trainings were evaluated among a subset of participants using a mixed methods pre- and post-training study design. Findings suggest that sustainable decreases in negative attitudes toward gender and sexual minorities are achievable with a one-day training.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine the attitudes of practicing Canadian family physicians about individuals with obesity, their healthcare treatment, and perceptions of obesity treatment in the public healthcare system. Method: A national sample of Canadian practicing family physicians (n = 400) completed the survey. Participants completed measures of explicit weight bias, attitudes towards treating patients with obesity, and perceptions that people with obesity increase demand on the public healthcare system. Results: Responses consistent with weight bias were not observed overall but were demonstrated in a sizeable minority of respondents. Many physicians also reported feeling frustrated with patients with obesity and agreed that people with obesity increase demand on the public healthcare system. Male physicians had more negative attitudes than females. More negative attitudes towards treating patients with obesity were associated with greater perceptions of them as a public health demand. Conclusion: Results suggest that negative attitudes towards patients with obesity exist among some family physicians in Canada. It remains to be determined if physicians develop weight bias partly because they blame individuals for their obesity and its increased demand on the Canadian public healthcare system. More research is needed to better understand causes and consequences of weight bias among health professionals and make efforts towards its reduction in healthcare.

AB  - Research demonstrates that religiosity and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) are positively correlated (Altemeyer & Hunsberger, 1992). The extent to which this relationship holds across the population, however, is unknown. Because support for conformity and traditionvalues fostered by religion (Saroglou, Delpierre, & Dernelle, 2004) and consonant with RWA (Altemeyer, 1996)may be facilitated by the perception that the status quo is fair, endorsement of system-justifying beliefs should moderate the relationship between religiosity and RWA. We tested this hypothesis in a national probability sample of religiously identified New Zealanders (N = 1,600). As predicted, church attendance was associated with a steep initial increase, followed by a gradual plateau, in RWA. This relationship was, however, stronger for those who were high (vs. low) in system justification. These findings provide the first demonstration that system-justifying beliefs strengthen the relationship between religiosity and RWA, while simultaneously broadening the scope of system justification theory.

According to dual-process theories, teachers have two strategies that they can apply to derive judgments of students. Teachers' judgments are based on stereotypes when the information they have about students is consistent with teachers' expectations, whereas teachers make judgments on a more individualized basis when their expectations are not supported by student information. We experimentally investigated this hypothesis with regard to teachers' judgments of female ethnic minority and majority students. Teachers were presented with one of four different descriptions of a female student. The below average student was described as low performing, and the above average student represented an easy-to-teach student with high academic achievement. The two student descriptions were compiled for both an ethnic minority student and an ethnic majority student. Results showed that teachers judged the ethnic minority female student less favorably but only when comparing the below average students. The above average female ethnic minority student was judged more favorably than the above average ethnic majority student. Results are discussed with respect to the conditions that might result in advantages or in disadvantages for female ethnic minority students and their implications for future research.

AB  - Owing to their potential impact on students' cognitive and noncognitive outcomes, the negative attitudes toward science held by many elementary teachers are a critical issue that needs to be addressed. This study focuses on the science education of preservice elementary teachers with the goal of improving their attitudes before they begin their professional lives as classroom teachers. Specifically, this study builds on a small body of research to examine whether exposure to inquiry-based science content courses that actively involve students in the collaborative process of learning and discovery can promote a positive change in attitudes toward science across several different dimensions. To examine this issue, surveys and administrative data were collected from over 200 students enrolled in the Hands on Science (HoS) program for preservice teachers at the University of Texas at Austin, as well as more than 200 students in a comparison group enrolled in traditional lecture-style classes. Quantitative analyses reveal that after participating in HoS courses, preservice teachers significantly increased their scores on scales measuring confidence, enjoyment, anxiety, and perceptions of relevance, while those in the comparison group experienced a decline in favorable attitudes to science. These patterns offer empirical support for the attitudinal benefits of inquiry-based instruction and have implications for the future learning opportunities available to students at all education levels.

AB  - Active learning increases performance in STEM courses, but many instructors are hesitant to adopt active-learning practices because they are afraid students will have negative attitudes toward them. It was hypothesized that students whose first college biology experience was in a course that used active learning would have more positive attitudes toward active learning than students who initially experienced a traditional lecture-based course. Students in an introductory Cell Biology course were queried regarding their attitudes toward active-learning practices used in the class. Responses to a Likert-scale survey indicated that students had positive attitudes toward active learning, and an analysis of variance indicated that there were no significant differences between the attitudes of students who had previously taken a lecture-based biology course at the same institution, students who had previously taken a biology course at another institution, and students who were enrolled in Cell Biology as their first college biology experience (n = 52, P = 0.530). Students strongly favored active-learning techniques over passive techniques but were less convinced of their learning benefits. Experienced students indicated that they preferred the teaching methods used in Cell Biology over the techniques used in their prior biology course. The results indicate that in the context of a small classroom setting, most students have positive attitudes toward active learning regardless of their prior biology lecture experiences.

AB  - I describe "spiritual" addiction as a felt compulsion to seek surrogates in the absence of that spirit of unconditional love underlying core personality change. We awaken to a "real" world akin to a prison in which all sides seem morally compromised, so any choice seems to necessitate sacrificing our conscientious relationship to the truth. Thus, spiritual addiction runs deeper than physical and psychological addictions to include socially accepted "addictions" to all we associate with "success"-including our morality and religion. All that we seek may be grounded in a collectively imbibed prejudice toward truth itself. If so, such a prejudice, underlying spiritual addiction, compromises our will, reason, feelings, actions, and character-including all of our relationships. It underlies the reality of a collective moral crisis which, we show, is more deeply a religious crisis tempting us to doubt the reality and attainability of that unconditional love that provides a foundation for hope. To overcome the prejudice underlying spiritual addiction, we show how unconditional love can be realized by placing conscientiousness in the foreground of concern as we are guided by the most reliable moral and spiritual witnesses in our history distinct from any religious group claiming to speak in their name.

AB  - People use many cues to infer the likelihood of acceptance or rejection in intergroup interactions. Nearly all prior research has focused on personal cues directly given off by the potential interaction partner (e.g., eye contact and smiling). However, we argue that in the context of intergroup interactions, individuals may be especially sensitive to broader social cues, such as an interaction partner's social network. Across three experiments we explored differences in White participants' evaluations of a smiling Black man presented with a Black or White friend. When this Black man was featured with a Black friend, White participants reported greater rejection concerns and a greater inclination to reject this Black man compared to when he was featured with a White friend (Experiments 1-3) or featured alone (Experiment 2). Furthermore, when participants received a simple intervention designed to buffer against social rejection, the race of the Black man's friend no longer influenced participants' interests in befriending the Black man (Experiment 3). This research demonstrates the power of friendships in interracial interactions and provides evidence for a simple intervention to reduce the weight of rejection concerns in interracial interactions.

AB  - Internalized stigma has a direct and detrimental effect on the mental health of sexual and gender minorities (SGMs), yet few interventions have been specifically designed to reduce such internalized stigma. This article describes numerous social psychology concepts and theories integrated into a brief, online intervention that has demonstrated success in reducing internalized stigma among SGM subpopulations. Using this intervention as an example, we illustrate how concepts from social psychology can expand the development of such interventions and strategies. We demonstrate how social psychological theories, particularly those related to attitude formation and change, may inform development of this and other interventions.

AB  - Objective: Psychiatric educators are often faced with students' negative attitudes toward psychiatry. A new type of seminar has been established in order to enable students to gain a deeper understanding of psychiatric illness.
   Method: A "cinemeducation seminar," combining a movie, a lecture, and a patient interview, has been established as part of the undergraduate curriculum at Hamburg Medical School, where 1,032 students attended 39 cinemeducation seminars between 2005 and 2008. A student evaluation covering different aspects of education took place after each seminar.
   Results: The students valued the combination of a movie and a seminar and found the movie and the additional patient interview useful for accessing the subject of Psychiatry and understanding " the underlying psychiatric illnesses shown in the movies.
   Conclusion: From the students' perspective, this type of seminar seems to be helpful for providing an impression of psychiatric illnesses and enabling students to put themselves in the position of a person suffering from these illnesses. Therefore, we judged the cinemeducation seminar to be an appropriate teaching format in undergraduate medical education.

AB  - Although the adverse impacts of health-related stigma are well established, there is growing evidence to suggest that some people reject stigma and become empowered through involvement in education and advocacy. C-een and Heard (C&H) is a positive speaking programme in Sydney, Australia, using educational presentations by people living with hepatitis C to increase understanding of the illness among health and community workers. This study explored C&H speakers' experiences of and responses to stigma, as well as their motivations to participate in the C&H programme. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine C&H positive speakers. Transcripts were analysed using an inductive thematic approach. Experiences of discrimination were common especially in healthcare and were linked to misinformation and negative attitudes towards injecting drug use. Although discriminatory experiences were distressing, many participants reacted with anger and challenged their stigmatised identity, ultimately leading participants to take part in positive speaking. Speakers reported feeling empowered by participation in the C&H programme and by the support received from audience members, peers and programme organisers. Findings highlight the potential benefits of positive speaking programmes for people with chronic illness in relation to overcoming stigma and experiencing empowerment.

AB  - AIMS - This article examines how Finns perceive obstacles to overcoming various substance and behavioural addictions. DESIGN - A random population survey (n=740) was conducted in the autumn of 2007. The survey included questions on five types of barriers to recovery: the properties of the substance or behaviour, the personal properties of the individual, the significance of the environment, the effect of difficult living conditions, and the prejudices and negative expectations of other people. RESULTS - The individual and the substances or behaviours as such were considered bigger obstacles to recovery than contextual factors such as the environment, living conditions or attitudes and prejudices. The substances were considered bigger obstacles to recovery than behaviours not involving psychoactive substances. The personal properties of the individual were considered a moderately big obstacle in all forms of addictions, while prejudices were believed to restrict the recovery possibilities the least. CONCLUSION - The result reflects people's overall tendency to explain other people's unpleasant or troublesome behaviour with clear-cut and definable factors. The obstacles to recovery are located in the individual and substances and not so much in socio-cultural factors. The reduction of dependence problems could succeed better if, in addition to the individual factors, attention were directed at the environmental factors that feed and maintain these problems.

AB  - Norms determine regular patterns of behavior and influence members' identification with a group. They are also a proximate way to predict and understand behavior in diverse work groups but, surprisingly, have not been extensively examined in this context. After reviewing research on group norms and the psychology of prejudice, I suggest that reaping the benefits of the increased range of available task relevant resources in demographically diverse work groups may depend on the strength and content of the norms it adopts, but that diverse groups face distinct obstacles in developing strong norms that create satisfying interpersonal interaction and effective work performance. I consider the difficulties diverse work groups have in forming strong norms and then focus on how anti-bias norms, which are directed toward preventing behaviors associated with prejudice and discrimination and address members' security concerns, and openness norms, which promote people's ability to individuate those whom they might otherwise stereotype as well as address nurturance concerns, may increase a work group's ability to optimize social interaction and performance amidst diversity. I suggest that reorienting psychological and organizational research on prejudice to focus on group norm strength and content may be a way of both understanding and solving the greater challenges of discrimination.

AB  - Many people have preconceived notions about games and distrust the effects of game-based learning and show negative attitudes. In fact, there are limitations and disadvantages of game-based learning, and it is difficult to overcome them. More than half of the inconveniences or problems of teachers who want to try game-based learning revealed by the 2009 survey have not been solved yet. Due to the sudden spread of COVID-19, the Ministry of Education has issued a policy to convert classes at schools and academies into non-face-to-face. Non-face-to-face classes have the characteristics that instructors and learners will be spatially separated, spatially simultaneous, interactive, and teaching and learning behavior will be mediated by the screen. And these features are common to live streaming. Taking advantage of this, this study aims to approach improving the perception of game-based learning as an advantage of "watching games" beyond "playing games" by using live streaming for game-based learning. This study conducted game-based learning and game streaming learning for 210 third-year middle school students, compared the effects of game-based learning on learning interest, immersion, and satisfaction with the results of previous studies to verify the design and prove the combined effect of live streaming and game-based learning. In addition, in-depth interviews with instructors who conducted game-based learning confirmed that awareness of the introduction, value, and finance of game-based learning improved.

AB  - Evolutionary theorists have argued that perceived competitive disadvantage may lead to more positive evaluation of, and greater likelihood of engaging in, risky and antisocial behavior. However, experimental studies have not yet examined the effects of competitive disadvantage on perceptions of rape. In the current study, we created a manipulation of perceived competitive status to test its effects on beliefs about rape. In one condition, participants were made to feel disadvantaged relative to male peers in terms of financial, physical, and intellectual power, whereas in the other condition they were made to feel advantaged. Participants were 120 heterosexual male undergraduate students. The manipulation was effective; compared to participants in the advantage condition, those in the disadvantage condition rated themselves as significantly worse off financially, shorter, in worse physical shape, and as having lower course marks than the average male student at the university. Compared to perceived competitive advantage, perceived disadvantage led to less negative attitudes towards rape. However, perceived competitive status did not significantly affect justifications and excuses for rape. Future studies using similar experimental manipulations can complement correlational studies and may contribute to greater clarity, precision, and sophistication of research and theory on the role of competitive disadvantage in rape.

AB  - Since the Black Lives Matter movement's rise to prominence, there has been significant opposition from both media and political figures who believe that the movement is promoting a "war on cops." Because there is no evidence to support this claim, the current study examines the basis for negative attitudes towards Black Lives Matter using a sample of over 500 undergraduate students from a large Midwestern university. The findings indicate that the strongest predictors of negative attitudes towards Black Lives Matter are being white and holding symbolically racist attitudes. Perceiving the police to be equivalent to soldiers in a war on crime, perceiving police misconduct to be less common, and holding a conservative crime ideology are also significant in the model.

AB  - Background: HIV stigma in health care settings acts as a significant barrier to health care. Stigma drivers among health professionals include transmission fears and misconceptions and pre-existing negative attitudes toward marginalized groups vulnerable to HIV. The DriSti intervention, consisted of 2 sessions with videos and interactive exercises on a computer tablet and one interactive face-to-face group session, mostly tablet administered, was designed to target key stigma drivers that included instrumental stigma, symbolic stigma, transmission misconceptions and blame to reduce HIV stigma, and discrimination among nursing students (NS) and ward staff and tested in a cluster randomized trial. Setting: This report focuses on second and third year NS recruited from a range of nursing schools that included private, nonprofit, and government-run nursing schools in south India. Results: Six hundred seventy-nine NS received intervention and 813 NS were in the wait-list control group. Twelve months outcome analyses showed significant reduction among intervention participants in endorsement of coercive policies (P < 0.001) and in the number of situations in which NS intended to discriminate against PLWH (P < 0.001). Mediation analysis revealed that the effects of intervention on endorsement of coercive policies and intent to discriminate against PLWH were partially mediated by reductions in key stigma drivers. Conclusions: This brief scalable stigma reduction intervention targeting key stigma drivers fills a critical gap in identifying the mechanistic pathways that aid in stigma reduction among health professionals.

AB  - There is a strong push to increase American students' interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematic (STEM) careers. However, minority and female students remain underrepresented in the STEM fields. Therefore, it is essential that we continue to examine the potential factors that both incite and dissuade STEM interest. We apply Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) to examine STEM attitudes of predominantly low-socioeconomic status minority elementary school students over the course of a computing intervention. Furthermore, we integrate the digital inequality mental access conceptualization of emotional costs' into the EVT model in order to predict students' negative STEM attitudes. Data are from a large-scale computing intervention that took place in a primarily minority, high poverty, urban elementary school district located in the southeastern USA. Results indicate that positive expectancies for success and subjective task values predict students' positive STEM attitudes. Emotional costs toward technology primarily predict negative STEM attitudes. Students' expectancies/values and emotional costs may have a push-and-pull' effect on the formation of STEM attitudes. This study successfully links digital disparities to STEM disparities by integrating the digital inequality concept of emotional costs. Practically, we conclude that future computing interventions should increase students' academic-related expectancies and values while also minimizing their emotional costs in order to address both digital and STEM inequalities. Theoretically, we conclude that broad conceptualizations of emotional costs should be included in future studies to help explain negative attitudes/motivations toward STEM-related topics.

AB  - Children's ethnic outgroup attitudes are influenced by their teachers' beliefs and multicultural education. However, research has ignored the possible impact of interpersonal relationships with teachers on students' ethnic attitudes. Three studies, using comparable datasets gathered among native Dutch children (8-13 years) attending grades 4 to 6 in elementary schools in the Netherlands, assess the importance of student-teacher relationships. In Study 1 (N = 389), student-teacher relationships were found to be associated with more positive outgroup attitudes, independent of factors commonly used to explain children's outgroup attitudes. Study 2 (N = 334) replicated these findings and showed that the impact of student-teacher relationships was not a reflection of the perceived teacher norm on multiculturalism. The results of Study 3 (N = 308) show that the association between close student-teacher relationships and children's ethnic attitudes is indirectly associated through internal motivations for intercultural openness, but not through external motivations or intergroup anxiety.

AB  - In a tumultuous world where populism is on the rise as the result of an enraged, disenchanted, misguided and susceptible populace, empathy, one of the most vital of our moral virtues, is in serious jeopardy. Fear, prejudice and the rise of the extreme right has provoked a number of naysayers to draw our attention to what they believe to be the darker side of empathy, its biases and its vulnerability to subversion. This paper examines empathy, what it is, how it feels, the neural and environmental basis for its development, our moral obligation to nurture it in our children and how it may be induced in the case of empathy deficiencies. It considers the influences of gender and hormones on the expression of empathy and its relationship with sympathy and compassion. Also discussed are the properties of empathy as a motivational, socioemotional mechanism, that evokes kindness, caring, compassion and understanding in each of us, and its potential to neutralize the negativism, cruelty, violence and aggression, so prevalent in the world today.

AB  - As lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for pregnant women is implemented, it is important to understand the attitudes and norms affecting women's postpartum ART adherence. This is a qualitative cross-sectional study of HIV-positive postpartum women (n=112) enrolled in a 2-year observational prospective cohort in Rwanda. Informed by the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA), we conducted in-depth interviews with women whose children were 0-6, 7-12, 13-18, or 21-24 months of age to describe factors contributing to adherence and changes over time. Positive ART attitudes reported by women included mothers' health promotion, prevention of infant HIV infection, higher CD4 count, and improved physical appearance. Negative attitudes were few, but included side effects and the lifelong nature of treatment. Learning from people living with HIV (PLHIV) was identified as a norm facilitating adherence; ART adherence was inhibited by fear of disclosure or stigmatization in communities and clinics. Poor adherence behaviors were common immediately after HIV diagnosis, not necessarily during prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). Women with older children, most of whom stopped breastfeeding by 13-18 months, reported more barriers and missed doses than women with younger children. The TRA was useful in identifying the collective influence of attitudes, norms, and intentions on behavior. Findings suggest that HIV-positive women are vulnerable to poor adherence following HIV diagnosis and around the time of breastfeeding cessation. Lifelong treatment adherence can be supported through PLHIV exemplifying long-term ART use, fewer and less stigmatizing clinic visits, and counseling messages highlighting the benefits of drugs on appearance and illness prevention and incorporating biological feedback.

AB  - The development of social robots has the potential to address significant societal concerns, however, most people have limited experience of such technology. The present research investigated whether techniques borrowed from the psychology of intergroup relations - namely direct and extended contact - affect people's attitudes towards robots. Participants were provided with either direct contact with a social robot or extended contact (these participants watched a video recorded by a friend who had met the robot) before their explicit and implicit attitudes towards robots were measured. Results indicated that direct contact affected both explicit and implicit attitudes, while extended contact affected implicit attitudes. The implication of these findings is that contact with a robot, direct or indirect, can change attitudes; much as previous research has shown that contact with a person who is a member of an out-group can change attitudes towards that group. We conclude that methods and theories from the study of human intergroup relationships can be usefully applied to understand attitudes toward social robots.

AB  - This article explores the experiences of women with intellectual disabilities in becoming a mother. The presented findings are from a grounded theory research study with 19 women with intellectual disabilities from the Czech Republic. The findings are organised around external and internal factors affecting the women's assumption of the mother identity, with the most prominent being poverty of the participating mothers, negative attitudes towards their motherhood, and a lack of preparation for motherhood. There is a need for systemic support for mothers with intellectual disabilities, starting in adolescence with sexual education, and continued throughout adulthood, including programmes focused on skills development.

AB  - Objectives: There is a lack of understanding about how adolescents perceive dementia, and what their dementia related experiences are. Without such information, it is hard to make a case for the need to raise awareness of dementia in adolescents, and the best strategies to achieve this. Methods: In a cohort of 901 adolescents (aged 13-18) from the South East of England, we explored what the experiences and perceptions of dementia were using a series of questionnaires. Descriptive data of individual items were reported, comparing differences between genders. Results: The adolescents within this study tended to have positive or neutral attitudes towards dementia, though there was evidence that a proportion of adolescents had misconceptions or held negative attitudes (e.g. 28.5% of adolescents disagreed with the statement 'In general, I have positive attitudes about people with dementia'). We also identified that the adolescents had a range of experiences of dementia including providing some form of care for someone with dementia (23.2%), though most had indirect contact with dementia through TV and movies (77.3%), or adverts (80.2%). Females nearly always had better attitudes towards dementia and had significantly more contact with dementia. Conclusions: Considering that adolescents are already forming negative attitudes and misconceptions of dementia, it is important that we raise awareness about dementia in this age group.

AB  - Previous research highlights that important differences exist between victim groups, but the impact victim status can have on perceptions of police legitimacy remains underexplored. The following paper contributes to this body of literature by utilizing the National Security and Preparedness Survey (NSPS, 2011-2012) to explore the risk/protective factors for victimization and differences between prejudice motivated crime (PMC) victims, non-PMC victims and non-victims in the Australian context, using Multinomial Logit Regression models. This study provides new insights into key differences between victim groups and perceptions of government and police legitimacy in the victimization context.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to adapt the twenty-six-item Communication Skills Attitude Scale (CSAS) developed for medical students for use among dental students and to test the psychometric properties of the modified instrument. The sample consisted of 250 students (an 80.1 percent response rate) in years D1 to D4 at a dental school in Washington, DC. The mean age of participants was 26.6 years with a range from twenty-one to forty-two years. Slightly more than half of the participants were female (52.4 percent) and were African American or of African descent (51.7 percent). Principal components analysis was used to test the psychometric properties of the instrument. The index that resulted measured both positive and negative attitudes toward learning communications skills. The final twenty-four-item scale had good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.87), and the study obtained four important factors-Learning, Importance, Quality, and Success-that explained a significant portion of the variance (49.1 percent). Stratified analysis by demographic variables suggested that there may be gender and ethnic differences in the students' attitudes towards learning communication skills. The authors conclude that the CSAS modified for dental students, or DCSAS, is a useful tool to assess attitudes towards learning communication skills among dental students.

AB  - Just world research has shown that observers derogate victims more for their misfortunes if the perpetrator is not harshly punished (Lerner in J Personal Soc Psychol 1(4):355-360, 1980). However, few studies have investigated minority group derogation as a just world preservation strategy after instances of intergroup harm-doing. This study is among the first to demonstrate the derogation of both individual victims and of the victim's minority group experimentally, using the context of a racist hate crime in Australia. In the present experiment, participants (N = 110) read a news article describing a hate crime against an Aboriginal Australian teenager and were informed that the perpetrator was harshly or leniently punished (secure vs. justice threat condition). Our results show that in the justice threat condition, participants not only derogated the individual Aboriginal Australian victim more after his death, they also expressed greater racism toward the victim's group. An indirect effect of the justice threat condition on modern racism via individual victim derogation was observed, along with moderating effects of individual differences in belief in a just world. These findings provide support for the alarming hypothesis that racist hate crimes are not only the manifestation of a racist society, but may also bolster racial prejudices if leniently treated. The results highlight the important role of political and judicial authorities, whose response or non-response to a hate crime can exacerbate or ameliorate existing prejudices.

AB  - Background: Cervical cancer has become a major public health problem worldwide. Iran, like other developing countries, is facing a number of challenges in managing the disease. This qualitative study documents challenges encountered in cervical cancer preventing programs in Iran. Materials and Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 28 participants including eleven patients with cervical cancer, three gynecologic oncologists, five specialists in Obstetrics and Gynecology, five midwives, three health care managers and one epidemiologist in Mashhad Iran, between May and December of 2012. The sample was selected purposively until data saturation was achieved. Data credibility verified via allocated sufficient time for data collection, using member checking and peer debriefing. Data analysis was carried out using conventional content analysis approach with ATLAS. ti software. Results: Findings from data analysis demonstrated 2 major themes and 6 categories about challenges of providing cervical cancer prevention programs including: individual and social challenges (cognitive/behavioral challenges and socio/cultural challenges) and health system challenges (stewardship, financing, competency of health care providers and access to services). Each category included some subcategories. Conclusions: Managing the cervical cancer prevention programs need to include the consideration of individuals, health care providers and health system challenges. Addressing the low level of knowledge, negative attitudes, socio cultural challenges, Poor intersectional collaboration and coordination and intra-sectional management, financing and competency of health care providers are essential steps toward significantly reducing the burdens of cervical cancer.

AB  - Background: Early, frequent encounters with people with disabilities may improve medical students' knowledge, attitudes and skills regarding their care. We developed and implemented a longitudinal four-year curriculum addressing caring for people with disabilities. Objectives/hypothesis: To test differences in mean scores between intervention and control groups on individual post-survey items regarding attitudes toward people with disabilities, and to conduct exploratory procedures to examine individual factors that may account for group differences.
   Methods: Students at two U. S. medical schools, one with the new curriculum, and one with no specific disabilities curriculum, were surveyed in Year 1 of medical school, prior to curriculum introduction, and again at the end of Year 3, using a validated 30-item instrument measuring medical students' self-reported attitudes and comfort toward people with disabilities. We compared mean item ratings between the two groups using chi(2) and ANOVA. Principal components analysis was then used to construct linear composite variables that were then regressed on potential predictors of attitudes and comfort level.
   Results: The intervention led to significant or near-significant improvement in several factors. However, male students in the intervention group, particularly those who encountered people with disabilities in a clinical context, had a tendency to more frequently agree with negative statements (beta - 5.628, p - .005).
   Conclusions: Exposure of medical students to a longitudinal curriculum for caring for people with disabilities led to significant improvement in several factors related to comfort and attitudes. The gender-related reinforcement of some negative attitudes merits further investigation and caution when implementing the curriculum in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose
   Anti-obesity prejudices affect the quality of care obese individuals receive. The authors sought to determine the prevalence of weight-related biases among medical students and whether they were aware of their biases.
   Method
   Between 2008 and 2011, the authors asked all third-year medical students at Wake Forest School of Medicine to complete the Weight Implicit Association Test (IAT), a validated measure of implicit preferences for fat or thin individuals. Students also answered a semantic differential item assessing their explicit weight-related preferences. The authors determined students' awareness of their biases by examining the correlation between students' explicit preferences and their IAT scores.
   Results
   Of 354 medical students, 310 (88%) completed valid surveys and consented to participate. Overall, 33% (101/310) self-reported a significant (moderate or strong) explicit anti-fat bias. No students self-reported a significant explicit anti-thin bias. According to the IAT scores, over half of students had a significant implicit weight bias: 39% (121/310) had an anti-fat bias and 17% (52/310) an anti-thin bias. Two-thirds of students (67%, 81/121) were unaware of their implicit anti-fat bias. Only male gender predicted an explicit anti-fat bias (odds ratio 3.0, 95% confidence interval 1.8-5.3). No demographic factors were associated with an implicit anti-fat bias. Students' explicit and implicit biases were not correlated (Pearson r = 0.03, P = .58).
   Conclusions
   Over one-third of medical students had a significant implicit anti-fat bias; few were aware of that bias. Accordingly, medical schools' obesity curricula should address weight-related biases and their potential impact on care.

AB  - We study what determines whether someone is an early Facebook adopter in a context in which Facebook is still relatively new compared to a far more popular Dutch social networking site (SNS) (Hyves). We use representative survey data of 4363 adolescents aged 14-15years. First, adolescents who participate in more leisure activities, who have more digital resources, and who have more friends who are SNS members are more likely to be SNS members. Second, we hypothesize and show that for adopting communication technology that highly fluctuates in popularity and is highly time-dependent, individuals are more likely to be early Facebook adopters when the number of their friends who are Facebook members increases. Finally, non-native adolescents are also more likely to be early Facebook adopters.

AB  - Although generic drugs are pharmacologically equivalent to their brand-name counterparts, prejudices against them remain strong. We assess the extent to which generic (versus brand-name) labels affect patients consumption of and adherence to medication.
   One hundred one patients who received dental implants agreed to participate in a study. In a pre-surgery survey, most patients reported a positive view about generic drugs. After dental surgery, the patients were prescribed a once-daily analgesic regimen (50 mg tramadol hydrochloride) for up to 7 days. All the patients received at no cost the same brand-name medication with either a brand-name label (n = 51) or a generic label (n = 50) and were informed of the retail prices associated with both labels. Telephone follow-up was conducted 24 hours, four days, and seven days after surgery to assess the number of prescribed pills consumed and when their use was discontinued, the number of non-prescribed pills consumed, pain levels throughout the follow-up period, the perceived efficacy of the analgesic, and the willingness to recommend it to a friend.
   The label manipulation impacted the participants behaviour and subjective assessments. Discontinuation before the end of the 7-day period was more frequent under the generic (vs. brand-name) label condition. The patients in the generic label group were also more likely to consume non-prescribed pills (non-adherence). Additionally, the patients in the generic label group reported higher levels of pain.
   Generic labels may negatively affect adherence to treatment even if patients report ex ante positive evaluations of the quality of generics drugs.

AB  - Due to the heterosexist ideals associated with gender norms, gay men often experience negative attitudes towards their own sexuality-internalized homophobia. As a result, gay men often feel compelled to compensate for their perceived lack of masculinity. The study aimed to investigate the relationship and predictive power of masculinity on gay men's experiences of internalized homophobia. A sample of 489 self-identified Australian gay men 18-72 years old participated in an online survey on masculinity and homosexuality. Descriptive statistics, bivariate correlations, and sequential multiple regressions were used to test the study's aims. Sequential multiple regressions revealed that conformity to masculine norms and threats to masculinity contingency were stronger predictors of internalized homophobia over and above demographic and other factors. Given the already known psychological risks associated with social isolation, internalized homophobia, and the poor mental health outcomes associated with sexual minority groups, it is suggested that gay men who are experiencing high degrees of internalized homophobia should not be distancing themselves from other gay men but, conversely, seek a strong relationship with the LGBTI community.

AB  - Psychological theories of aging highlight the importance of social context. However, very little research has distinguished empirically between older people's perception of how others in their social context perceive them (personal meta-perceptions) and the shared perceptions in society (societal meta-perceptions). Drawing on theories of intergroup relations and stereotyping and using a multilevel perspective, this article examines how well older people's perceptions of age discrimination (PAD) are predicted by (a) older people's personal meta-perceptions, (b) societal meta-perceptions, and (c) social norms of intolerance toward age prejudice. Aging meta-perceptions are differentiated into the cognitive and affective components of ageism. Multilevel analyses of data from the European Social Survey (N-over 70 years of age = 8,123, 29 countries; European Social Survey (ESS) Round 4 Data, 2008) confirmed that older people's personal meta-perceptions of negative age stereotypes and specific intergroup emotions (pity, envy, contempt) are associated with higher PAD. However, at the societal-level, only paternalistic meta-perceptions were consistently associated with greater PAD. The results show that a few meta-perceptions operate only as a psychological phenomenon in explaining PAD, some carry consonant, and others carry contrasting effects at the societal-level of analysis. This evidence extends previous research on aging meta-perceptions by showing that both the content of meta-perceptions and the level of analysis at which they are assessed make distinct contributions to PAD. Moreover, social norms of intolerance of age prejudice have a larger statistical effect than societal meta-perceptions.

AB  - We analyse data from the largest survey of university staff in Australia to determine whether bullying and harassment are more common in regional than metropolitan and Go8 universities, and to what extent any differences could be attributed to other factors. While professional staff showed no difference in harassment rates between regional and metropolitan and Go8 universities, academic staff at regional universities reported significantly higher levels of harassment. This probably reflected the labour market and resource context of regional universities. Binary logistic regression indicated that a perceived lack of support for professional development partially explained the effect of regional status on differences in the rates of harassment/bullying across university types. Markers of organisational culture only partially account for differences in the rates of harassment/bullying between university types.

AB  - In discussing the potential implications of the attitudes of the registered nurse towards the work of caring for older people, it was helpful to highlight why this work is important, gain some understanding of quality care and how it can be facilitated or hindered. Patient centred care is essential as there is great diversity found amongst older people. It was found that attitudes held by registered nurses and students towards older people have a direct impact on the quality of care provided. Negative attitudes and stereotyping get in the way of quality care while positive attitudes enabled quality care. In identifying the factors that influence these attitudes, registered nurses can take on a leadership role in promoting positive attitudes and challenging negative attitudes towards the care of older people with the goal of providing patient centre care.

AB  - Community brief Why is this topic important?Many neurodivergent people are, or want to be, students at college and university. However, neurodivergent people face many challenges and barriers at colleges and universities. What is the purpose of this article?This article recommends system-wide changes to make colleges and universities more inclusive for neurodivergent people, focusing on autistic and ADHD people. What personal or professional perspectives do the authors bring to this topic?The authors are neurodivergent people or parents of neurodivergent people. Most of the authors are members or allies of a community led by and for neurodivergent people at the University of California, Davis. The authors are all neurodiversity advocates and have personal experience of attending universities. What is already known about this topic?Previous studies show that neurodivergent people at colleges and universities face barriers and can require accommodations and supports in a number of areas. Moreover, neurodivergent people at colleges and universities can face stigma and prejudice. What do the authors recommend?First, the authors recommend changes to address prejudice and stigma toward neurodivergent people and to foster neurodivergent culture: The authors believe university and college offices for promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion should do more to help neurodivergent people.The authors suggest colleges and universities should create Disability Cultural Centers and provide neurodiversity training to everyone on their campuses.The authors recommend neurodivergent people should be leaders in neurodiversity programs and initiatives.Next, the authors recommend changes to improve supports and accommodations for neurodivergent students: The authors recommend giving neurodivergent people a single contact person to set up their individualized accommodations.The authors recommend changes to make it easier for neurodivergent people to show they are eligible for accommodations.The authors recommend creating transition programs to support neurodivergent students as they arrive at college and as they leave college.The authors recommend providing better mental health supports and providing accommodations for sensory distress and distraction.The authors suggest that universities should establish mechanisms to help students who are denied accommodations. Moreover, the authors recommend changes to help neurodivergent people communicate and study in ways they find accessible: The authors recommend that support people should be welcomed when neurodivergent people want them to be involved in their education.The authors recommend that neurodivergent people should be allowed to communicate with college/university staff in whatever way is most comfortable for them.The authors recommend that students should be able to choose to take classes online or in-person. How will these recommendations help neurodivergent adults now or in the future?The authors hope these changes will help neurodivergent people thrive at colleges and universities. Success at college could help neurodivergent adults achieve their personal employment and career goals.
   Neurodivergent people are increasingly involved in postsecondary education, but they continue to face serious barriers and challenges on college campuses. These challenges are not only related to disability functional differences and accommodation needs, but also to stigma and prejudice toward neurodivergent people. Consequently, neurodivergent people are less successful than neurotypical peers; moreover, intersections between neurodivergence and other marginalized groups are associated with even greater inequities. This article was written by neurodivergent students and researchers, and their allies, who suggest a system-wide approach is needed to promote inclusion of neurodivergent students, staff, and faculty on postsecondary campuses. Specific recommendations, based on those the authors suggested to and that were endorsed by the University of California Academic Senate, are provided. These recommendations include diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)-oriented reforms (viewing neurodiversity through a DEI lens; establishing Disability Cultural Centers; providing campus-wide neurodiversity training; and fostering neurodivergent leadership in neurodiversity initiatives). Other recommendations address disability accommodations and supports (integrating disability accommodations in one place; making eligibility requirements less onerous; recognizing and accommodating sensory distress and distraction; establishing programs to facilitate transitions in and out of postsecondary; improving mental health support; and creating mechanisms to resolve issues where students are denied accommodations). Finally, further recommendations address accessibility of communication (respecting students' decisions to involve support people; and offering neurodivergent people the option to choose accessible modalities for communicating with instructors and staff and for taking classes). Institutions that embrace these reforms have an opportunity to position themselves as neurodiversity inclusion leaders and destination campuses for neurodivergent people.

AB  - Much research suggests mental health diagnoses elicit stigmatization of individuals. The current study builds upon this literature at the intersection of same- and cross-race perceptions. Black and White participants viewed Black and White targets paired with either a mental health diagnosis (e.g., depression), a physical health diagnosis (e.g., high blood pressure), or no health information (control) while indicating each target's favorability and how much social distance they would want from them. Overall, people were more stigmatizing toward targets with a mental health diagnosis than a physical health diagnosis or no diagnosis. Black targets with a mental health diagnosis were stigmatized more than White targets with a mental health diagnosis and White participants displayed a greater aversion to Black targets with a mental health diagnosis than did Black participants. Results contribute to the mental health stigma literature and suggest it may be particularly problematic for White perceivers' attitudes toward Black individuals with mental health diagnoses. Findings may shed light on the racial differences in treatment-seeking amongst Black and White individuals.

AB  - Microteaching has gained considerable attention for its effectiveness in rapid and contextual training in professional development programs. However, the interpretive quality of the teaching demonstration and peer feedback may influence individuals' attribution and self-correction, leading to ineffective learning. In this study, a microteaching workshop in a professional development program for 78 elementary school science teachers was investigated. The results showed that the effectiveness of microteaching was negatively affected by participants' perception bias due to social categorization. Moreover, it was indicated that the participants' perception of the in-group and out-group, classified by the degree of the individuals' science knowledge, fostered social categorization. Participants tended to experience perception conflicts caused by their inability to see personal faults, and a typical perception bias of "seeing one's own strengths and seeing others' shortcomings" was more frequently recognized in the out-group. These results converge to highlight the importance of social categorization in perception bias relevant to microteaching.

AB  - The short-stories I have chosen to discuss here are "A Worn Path" (1941) by Eudora Welty and "The Artificial Nigger" (1955) by Flannery O'Connor. They are complementary - as I hope to prove - illustrating two versions of a one-(grand) parent family tale. The white grandfather in O'Connor's story and the black grandmother in Welty's story have to cope with ever more difficult tasks in terms of truth(telling/teaching) and (self-)discovery. For truth - at least personally, if not philosophically - may mean facing all dangers as an ancient grandmother, for the sake of her sick grandson; it can mean coming to terms with one's own old self - in both stories; it may mean facing qualms of conscience and merciless loneliness - for both young and old.

AB  - In today's society where there is an abundance of accessible, complex, and often false information, critical thinking (CT) is an essential skill so that citizens in general and students in particular can make complex decisions based on scientific evidence, rather than on prejudices, biases, and pre-established beliefs. In this context, the purpose of this study is to discover whether Active Learning (AL) methodology, using different technologies, contributes to improving the CT of the student body, applying it to the Digital Gender Divide (DGD). Three questionnaires were used to collect information, using both a quantitative and a qualitative approach. Open-ended questions are included for fuller answers, which are complemented by content analysis of the recordings and virtual presentations made. The results show that the AL methodology favours the development of CT in the DGD in a remarkable way. Likewise, the various technologies implemented in the methodology (e.g., the Google Applications Site, online round table discussions, role-plays, virtual presentations, and forms) are relevant to improving CT in DGD. It concludes by recommending the implementation of AL with CT as in the one carried out, to help prepare better professionals and raise awareness of how to reduce the DGD.

To address the cultural gap in today's classroom, many people highlight the need to improve the intercultural competence of teachers. The focus of this article is to summarize the shifting demographics of American society, its impact on K-12 education, and how one California physical education teacher education (PETE) program is preparing pre-service teachers for the multicultural classroom. The article also outlines recommendations for PETE programs to address intercultural competence.

AB  - In this issue, Williams (p. diamond diamond diamond ) responds to my 2017 critique in this journal of the scientific status of the microaggression research program (MRP). In some cases, she presents helpful data that partially address several of my recommendations for enhancing the MRP's rigor. Nevertheless, because she appears to misconstrue many of my arguments regarding the MRP, many of her rebuttals are not relevant to my criticisms. Furthermore, her assertions notwithstanding, Williams does not effectively address my concerns regarding the (a) excessively fuzzy boundaries of the microaggression construct, (b) psychometric hazards of relying exclusively on subjective reports when detecting microaggressions, and (c) hypothesized causal impact of microaggressions on mental health. In other cases, Williams appears to draw causal inferences from correlational data and conflate within-group with between-group differences. Although several of Williams's recommendations for MRP research are worth considering, I contend that some others are unlikely to be conducive to a scientific approach to microaggressions. The MRP remains a promising but provisional research program that would benefit from greater openness to outside criticism. I conclude with a discussion of areas of potential common ground in microaggression research and application.

AB  - Documenting the relationship between Agreeableness and political conservatism has proven elusive. We address this anomaly by showing that two aspects of Agreeableness - politeness and compassion - have countervailing relationships with political conservatism through right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO). To test this, we analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of New Zealanders (N = 4,553). Politeness was positively, but compassion was negatively, correlated with political conservatism. Consistent with the differential mediation hypothesis derived from the dual process model of ideology and prejudice, these opposing relationships were differentially mediated by RWA and SDO. This attenuated the bivariate relationship between the higher-order trait of Agreeableness and political conservatism. These results demonstrate the complex relationship between personality and political orientation.

AB  - This article explores the effectiveness of legal interventions to promote healthier eating/drinking and exercise in responding to obesity. Undue emphasis on weight loss and prevention of excess gain have largely been failures and have fueled prejudice against fat people. A major challenge lies in shifting norms: away from stigmatization of the obese and towards more nutritious eating/drinking and increased activity with acceptance of bodies in all shapes and sizes. Part of the enormity of this challenge lies in the complex effects of law and its relationship with norms, including unintended consequences of regulation. To illustrate such complications, the paper examines two interventions and the actual effects that they have produced (or could under differing conditions): junk food taxes, particularly on SSBs (sugar sweetened beverages), and restriction of advertising to children, especially the ban in Quebec.

AB  - Venous malformations are frequently localized in the head and neck region. However, a cervical localization with an endocranial extension is rather a very uncommon occurrence. We present a case of a 4-year-old child who presented with a large posterior cervical mass evolving for a year, firm and painful at palpation. Imaging was required, revealing a posterior cervical mass with an extension to adjacent structures, a destruction of the occipital bone and an endocranial extension. A macrobiopsy of the mass showed numerous irregular vessels. A surgical treatment was performed due to the extension of the mass, the esthetic prejudice it caused and the uncertain diagnosis. Venous malformation diagnosis was confirmed by a histological examination of the resected piece. Surgical management was not associated with the mass recurrence in our case. Here, we aim at identifying the clinical and radiological features of venous malformations, and at describing the different therapeutic features of this condition.

AB  - Perspective taking is conceptualized as the ability to consider or adopt the perspective of another individual who is perceived to be in need; it has shown mixed results in stereotype reduction and intergroup attitude change across many social science disciplines. The inconsistent results raise concerns about the robustness of the perspective-taking phenomenon. The present study usesp-curve analysis to examine whether evidential value existed among two sets of published experimental studies where perspective taking was operationalized in two different paradigms. Despite low statistical power, we found that both sets of studies revealed some evidential value of the effects of perspective taking. The theoretical and methodological implications of perspective-taking studies are discussed as well.

AB  - Purpose The regulations for qualitative genetically modified (GM) food labeling do not effectively eliminate the information asymmetries pertaining to the consumption of GM products. China's GM food labeling law requires the presentation of certain categories of GM products on GMO labels on packages. Such information is invaluable for understanding whether the disclosure of more information on GM foods can help alleviate information asymmetry while reducing consumer fear and risk perceptions of GM foods, and thus cause changes in their behaviors. The purpose of this paper is to explore the heterogeneity of consumer preferences for enhanced GM food labeling, how consumer preferences are influenced by labeling information, and how these preferences vary in different consumers. Design/methodology/approach Both descriptive statistics and econometric techniques, including the multivariate ordered Probit model, were applied to a sample of 566 urban consumers in the Yangtze River Delta region of China. All respondents were divided into two groups: people who would definitely not buy GM foods before selecting enhanced labeling information ("consumer group 1", sample size 282) and people who would definitely not object to buying GM foods before selecting enhanced labeling information ("consumer group 2", sample size 274). Findings The findings suggest that urban consumers have a preference for different types of enhanced labeling information about GM foods, that such a preference significantly influences their willingness to pay for GM foods, that there exists a large difference in the preferences of different consumer groups, and that enhanced GM food labeling information has a greater impact on those consumers who would not accept GM foods. Originality/value This research identifies the GM information disclosures that most affect consumer preferences and how these preferences vary across different segments of consumers, which is a current gap in the literature. The study has demonstrated that enhanced labels of GM foods with diverse information would not alter a consumer's WTP for GM foods who does not perceive the value of information from the enhanced labels, but change positively consumers with uncertainty willingness to pay before disclosure.

AB  - Courts rarely allow defendants to take discovery of absent class members after class action certification. However, if a court does permit such discovery and some absentees fail to respond, should the court sanction the nonresponsive absentees? Under what circumstances should the court dismiss the nonresponsive absentees? When considering whether and what sanctions to impose, courts make a decision about the rights and role of absentees in class actions.
   This Note examines postcertification absentee discovery sanctions through a discussion of group litigation. Next, it analyzes the reasoning of courts that have dismissed absentees, declined to dismiss absentees, and imposed other sanctions on absentees. Finally, this Note concludes that courts should generally dismiss opt-out absentees without prejudice, and dismiss opt-in absentees with prejudice.

AB  - The current transnational climate (British Council, 2014) in Europe is likely to continue to generate institutional and classroom situations which dictate that difference and otherness be the norm rather than the exception. Unfortunately, in the 1960's, Black and minority ethnic (BME) migrants from the former British colonies had less-than-favorable educational experiences in Britain due to prejudice and stereotyping mainly arising from cultural differences. Since then there have been a plethora of studies, policies, and reports regarding the perpetuation of discrimination in educational institutions. Today, British higher educational institutions have finally begun to recognize the need to reduce progression and attainment gaps. However, their focus tends to only consider the student "Black and Minority Ethnic attainment gap" with almost no attention being given to educators', or more specifically there is a distinctive lack of thought given to the female BME educators' progression and attainment in British HEIs. As such, this paper draws theoretically and conceptually on critical cultural autoethnography, to illustrate the value of conducting research into a female's BME educators' personal and professional experiences, and "gives voice to previously silenced and marginalized experiences" (Boylorn and Orbe, 2014, p. 15). In doing so, I highlight how higher educational institutions underutilisation of such competencies and contributions have and continue to perpetuate BME underachievement. I conclude the paper by questioning the accountability of providing support for BME educators progression and attainment, challenge educational leaders to consider the value and utilization of cultural knowledge, and implore all educators to reflect on how their personal experiences influence their professional identity.

KW  - EPISTEMIC INJUSTICE
AB  - This article explores the relationship between hermeneutical injustice in religious settings and religious trauma (RT) and spiritual violence (SV). In it I characterize a form of hermeneutical injustice (HI) that arises when experiences are obscured from collective understanding by normatively laden concepts, and I argue that this form of HI often plays a central role in cases of religious trauma and spiritual violence, even those involving children. In section I, I introduce the reader to the phenomena of religious trauma and spiritual violence. In section II, I describe the role normatively laden concepts play in shaping our social experience. I then elucidate how they can contribute to HI. In section III, I provide a brief overview of the history of some significant identity prejudices in the history of Christianity and argue that children can properly be understood as victims of HI within some religious communities. I then return in section IV to the examples of religious trauma and spiritual violence offered throughout the article and demonstrate that HI plays an important causal role in each of them. HIs sometimes constitute spiritual and religious harms; at other times they create an epistemic environment conducive to spiritual abuse.

AB  - Purpose - The authors conceptually aim to replicate and update an early stream of research to find the key dimensions used by today's audiences. They also show that the dimensions are directly related with attitude toward the ad, product attitude change and product recommendation and test the moderating impact of FCB Grid product type.
   Design/methodology/approach - Across two studies, the authors survey a nationally representative sample of 1,223 US adults.
   Findings - Consumers evaluate commercials using the dimensions: Dislikable, Meaningful, Ingenious and Warm. The latter three are positively related with ad attitude, attitude change and recommendation, whereas Dislikable is negatively related. Furthermore, results show that High and Low Involvement Think products moderate the relation between all four dimensions and all three outcomes. Only Meaningful affects the outcomes for High Involvement Feel products, whereas only Ingenious affects Low Involvement Feel product outcomes.
   Research limitations/implications - The research is limited to TV commercials, limiting generalizability to other media. Furthermore, the sample is limited to the USA.
   Practical implications - The paper provides a parsimonious four-dimension model for advertiser use. These dimensions also predict ad attitudes, product recommendation, and attitude change. The results further show that for emotionally driven products with high involvement, commercials should focus on meaningfulness. For emotionally driven products with little involvement, ads should emphasize creative elements.
   Originality/value - Addressing the paucity of replications in marketing, this paper replicates and extends a stream of research to reveal dimensions consumers use to evaluate commercials and demonstrates their practical applications.

AB  - Background: Speech-language pathologists provide infant feeding assessment and intervention; their training in breastfeeding management is highly variable.
   Research aim: The purpose of this study was to evaluate student attitudes toward breastfeeding and self-identified factors in attitude change.
   Methods: Before and after their course in pediatric dysphagia, two cohorts of graduate students in speech-language pathology (N = 36) completed an assignment designed to capture qualitative and quantitative data on changes in their attitudes toward breastfeeding. Students rated their reactions to two hypothetical breastfeeding scenarios before and after the class, which included multiple sources of information on the importance of human milk and on breastfeeding management. Additionally, they completed a postclass reflection describing the nature of any changes in their attitudes toward breastfeeding and their ideas about the factors that were responsible for these changes. Nonparametric statistical tests were used to assess quantitative results; the qualitative data were evaluated via content analysis to identify themes.
   Results: Significant positive changes in student attitudes were measured at the completion of the course. Students identified parents' stories as a particularly compelling component of their increased openness to breastfeeding.
   Conclusion: Attitudes toward breastfeeding may improve significantly over a relatively short period of time following a targeted intervention. Implications for lactation consultants and continuing education providers are discussed.

AB  - Bonino's article casts light on the realities and perceptions of ethno-religious discrimination among Muslims in Scotland, with particular reference to those living in Edinburgh, during both everyday social interaction with the indigenous Scottish community, and contact with police and security officers. Discrimination against ethnic minorities in Scotland can be traced back in history; however, it is its post-9/11 multifaceted form that has particularly targeted Muslims qua Muslims in a global climate of distrust and stigmatization. While publicly available statistics show a decrease in racist incidents in Scotland, findings from other studies illustrate a more complex situation in which prejudice and discrimination intermingle in ways that make it hard to quantify the precise extent of anti-Muslim sentiment. Qualitative data collected specifically in Edinburgh suggest that Muslims' hyper-visibility has triggered ethno-religious discrimination by some members of the non-Muslim majority. However, the daily experiences of life in Scotland, and the social relations with non-Muslims, are more heterogeneous and nuanced; they include overall positive views of, and a certain engagement with, many non-Muslims in a context of relative harmony. Contact with police and security officers at airports constitutes the main area of concern for Scottish Muslims, whose confidence, sense of equality and feelings of belonging to society are severely undermined by the securitization of their ethno-religious difference. The path towards a pluralistic Scottishness rests on sociopolitical and institutional efforts to reduce the discrimination against visible diversity, especially at loci of security, and to include the symbolic and physical distinctiveness of Muslimness within the porous Scottish cultural boundaries.

AB  - Deindividuation may be described as the situation in which individuals act in groups and do not see themselves as individuals, thereby facilitating antinormative behavior. The present article analyzes the construct deindividuation theory from its conceptualization by Le Bon to the most recent theoretical model, the Social Identity Model of Deindividuation Effects. The aim of this study is to compare theories about deindividuation and to highlight its advances, identify theoretical questions that remain and suggest future directions for the study of this issue. Recent research conducted on deindividuation may promote prosocial behavior, prevent social disturbance and prevent the development of prejudice among children. Furthermore, it may provide a feasible way to comprehend and intervene in contemporary social issues. Recent scientific techniques, such as neuroimaging and predictive mathematical models, may improve comprehension of the construct in terms of its definition and prospective effects.

AB  - Perceived public stigma regarding seeking mental health treatment can be a barrier to accessing services for young adults. While factors associating with personal stigma regarding how one would view and treat others have been identified, the discrepancies between perceived and personal stigma have received less research attention. We designed the current study to expand on previous research and examine the discrepancies between perceived public stigma and personal stigma among a sample of 386 primarily White and Asian college students. Participants completed surveys of mental health symptoms, treatment experience and attitudes, perceived public, and personal stigma. Overall, participants generally reported greater perceived public stigma than personal stigma; an effect that was particularly evident for women and those with mental health symptoms. The majority of participants disagreed with items assessing personal stigma. Negative attitudes toward treatment and anxiety symptoms associated with perceived public stigma, while male gender, Asian ethnicity, and negative attitudes toward treatment associated with personal stigma. Findings have implications for interventions and marketing programs to help change perceptions about mental health stigma to encourage utilization of services for those young people who could benefit from care.

AB  - Objective: To understand adolescents' experiences and attitudes toward yoga, with a particular focus on acceptability and feasibility of a yoga intervention for depressed adolescents.
   Design: Qualitative analysis of data from three focus groups and eight individual interviews, for a total of 22 teen participants.
   Setting: Outpatient setting in a psychiatric hospital in the U.S. Main outcome measures: Teens were asked about their own and their peers' attitudes toward, and experiences with, hatha yoga; reactions to a study-created yoga video; and opinions on class logistics.
   Results: Teens had both positive and negative attitudes toward, and experiences with, hatha yoga. They commented on "who does yoga;" many responses suggested a limited group (e.g., moms; people with money and time). Participants agreed that yoga could be potentially beneficial for depressed or stressed teens. Selfconsciousness while being in a yoga class was a major concern. Overall, teens reacted favorably to the studycreated yoga video. Teens had varied opinions about class logistics including class duration and size. Teens cited barriers to class, such as transportation, as well as barriers to home yoga practice.
   Conclusions: Key points for developing a yoga class that might be appealing to depressed or stressed teens include: creating a class with variety that teens will find interesting; taking concrete steps to decrease teen selfconsciousness; incorporating messages relevant for teens and consistent with yoga philosophy; and actively countering stereotypes about who practices yoga. Limitations of this study include the lack of data from male teens.

AB  - The presence of adolescents with immigrant backgrounds in Spain is a structural phenomenon with major implications and challenges for intergroup coexistence. The purpose of this study is to analyse the possible existence of psychosocial profiles in these adolescents. Using latent class cluster models (LCCM), profiles were identified where these adolescents can be situated according to their responses to variables related to acculturation (preferences, perceptions, identity) and adaptation (life satisfaction and school adjustment), using sex, ethnocultural group, place of birth and perceived discrimination as covariates. Participants were 683 adolescents with immigrant backgrounds between the ages of 12 and 19 (56% girls) enrolled in public secondary schools in five provinces in Spain. The results show the existence of three psychosocial profiles (bicultural, ethnic and national), with national being the least common. Even though the bicultural profile (orientation towards both cultures) is the most adaptive, positive results were found with all three profiles, which indicates a moderate adaptive acculturation process.

AB  - Despite recent shifts in societal attitudes toward same-sex relationships, women who have sex with women face a variety of barriers to optimal health, including a history of negatively perceived interactions in clinical settings that lead them to delay or avoid health care. Women who have sex with women may be at disproportionate risk of obesity, tobacco use, substance use, mental health issues, intimate partner violence, sexually transmitted infections, and some cancers. Disparities can exist throughout the lifetime. Lesbian and bisexual adolescents are vulnerable to bullying, family rejection, and risky sexual behavior that may lead to sexually transmitted infections or unintended pregnancy. Sexual minority stress, which is a response to stigmatization, prejudice, and internalized homophobia, contributes to many of these conditions. Family physicians should foster trust and communication to provide a nonjudgmental, welcoming environment supportive of culturally competent health care and optimal outcomes. When indicated, clinicians should refer women who have sex with women to culturally sensitive community resources and legal advisors for assistance with medical decision making, hospital visitation, conception, and legal recognition of nonbiologic parents.

AB  - The paper combines insights from social identity theory and organizational network theory to specify the conditions under which social capital can induce negative attitudes in global virtual teams. The structural configuration of social capital has crucial implications for the socio-cognitive processes causing individuals to adopt negative attitudes to out-group members. The paper evaluates both the negative implications of structural configurations on out-group perceptions, which are important precursors to successful intergroup interaction in global virtual teams. We collected data from 160 actors across 40 global virtual teams embedded within three separate organizations. 34 social identity groups were detected and ties between and within the groups were investigated. Our analyses provide insights on the roles of social identity groupings and social capital as well as in-group brokerage and interactions on (negative) perceptions of other group members in global virtual teams.

AB  - Objective This project was directed at examination of the potential reciprocal relationship between empathy and social dominance orientation (SDO), with the purpose of testing the predictions from Duckitt's highly influential dual process model of prejudice, and further examining the validity of the mere effect view of social dominance orientation. Method To examine this relationship, the authors employed cross-lagged structural equation modeling with manifest variables across two studies using large samples from different parts of the world. Study 1 consisted of data from two waves of 389 (83% female) Belgian university students, with each wave separated by 6 months. Study 2 consisted of two waves of data from a national probability sample of 4,466 New Zealand adults (63% female), with each wave separated by a 1-year interval. Results Results supported our expectation of a reciprocal longitudinal relationship between empathy and SDO. Moreover, the results also revealed that SDO's effect on empathy over time tended to be stronger than empathy's effect on SDO over time, countering the predictions derived from the dual process model. Conclusions These results represent the first time the possible reciprocal effects of empathy and SDO on one another have been examined using panel data rather than less appropriate cross-sectional analysis. They suggest the need to reexamine some key assumptions of the dual process model and further question the mere effect view of SDO.

AB  - Objectives An invitation to cancer screening with a single (fixed) appointment time has been shown to be a more effective way at increasing uptake compared with an invitation with an open (unscheduled) appointment. The present study tested whether offering more than one fixed appointment could further enhance this effect or be detrimental to people's intention. Design Experimental online hypothetical vignette survey. Methods 1,908 respondents who stated that they did not intend to participate in Bowel Scope Screening (BSS) were offered either one, two, four or six hypothetical fixed BSS appointments (all of which covered the same time of day to control for individual preferences). Results Participants who were given more than one appointment to choose from were less likely to intend to book an appointment despite multiple appointments being perceived as more convenient. Conclusions These results suggest that when it comes to offering people appointments for cancer screening, less (choice) is more, at least if alternatives fail to serve an inherent preference.

AB  - Recent research has found that mentally simulating positive out-group contact experiences can promote tolerance and more positive intergroup perceptions. We investigated two ways of enhancing this imagined contact effect. In Study 1 we found that asking participants to generate more detail in their imagined encounter led to expectations of their having a greater number of out-group acquaintances in the future. In Study 2 we found that instructing participants to close their eyes during an imagined encounter led to heightened intentions to engage in future actual contact. These findings add further support to the notion that imagining intergroup contact may be a valuable addition to existing interventions aimed at improving intergroup relations.

AB  - In the era of eLearning 4.0, many researchers have suggested that multimodal input helps to enhance second language (L2) vocabulary learning. However, previous studies on the effects of multimodal teaching have failed to yield definitive conclusions. Furthermore, only few studies on the multimodal input of vocabulary learning have aimed at junior high school students and have focused on explicit vocabulary instruction in class. To explore the effects of multimodal input on English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' vocabulary learning and summarize effective methods, this study adopts a mixed-method approach. Based on dual coding theory and cognitive load theory, the teaching materials in this study were designed using the resources provided by the multimodal corpus iWeb and other websites. A total of 60 junior high school students who learned EFL and had a similar English proficiency level were divided into an experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG). Target words were selected through questionnaire I. During the experiment, the CG learned from monomodal materials while the EG received multimodal input, and an immediate post-test was delivered to the two groups. Questionnaire II was distributed in the EG, and five students of the EG were randomly selected for an interview. One week later, a delayed post-test was conducted on the EG and CG. The results showed that the EG performed better in the post-test but did worse than the CG in the delayed post-test. The results of the questionnaire and the interview suggest that students held both positive and negative attitudes toward the multimodal input approach in vocabulary learning. The study concludes with some implications for choosing a multimodal input approach in vocabulary learning, along with a number of suggestions on how to optimize its positive influence and minimize its negative effects.

AB  - Objective: The home birth rate in Sweden is less than 1 in 1000, and home birth is not included within the health care system. This study describes women's experiences concerning reactions to their decision to give birth at home.
   Design and setting: A nationwide survey (SHE - Swedish Homebirth Experience) in Sweden was conducted between 1992 and 2005 whereas 735 women had given birth to 1038 children. Of 1038 questionnaires 1025 were returned.
   Measurements: In the questionnaires an open-ended question asked women to report their experience of reactions to their decision to give birth at home The question was answered by 594 women, and data were analysed using content analysis.
   Findings: The analysis yielded one overarching theme; "To be faced with fear for life and death'' including being exposed to reactions about risks. This describes attitudes of professionals and family towards life and death and suggests perceptions of risk and fear of unexpected events. Four main categories were identified; Seen as an irresponsible person, Met with emotional arguments, Exposed to persuasion and Alienation.
   Conclusion: Women who plan for a home birth were confronted with negative attitudes and persuasion to make them change their mind. This made them feel alienated, and they searched for support among like-minded. Negative attitudes from health care professionals may erode their confidence in conventional health services and turn them towards other options.
   Implication for practice: Women who want to give birth at home should be given evidence-based information about risks and benefits. Enhanced knowledge among public and professionals about home births would improve the options for respectful encounters. (C) 2011 Australian College of Midwives.

AB  - In this article, economists Kevin Lang and Ariella Kahn-Lang Spitzer take up the expansive issue of discrimination, examining specifically how discrimination and bias shape people's outcomes. The authors focus primarily on discrimination by race, while acknowledging that discrimination exists along many other dimensions as well, including gender, sexual orientation, religion, and ethnicity. They describe evidence of substantial racial disparities in the labor market, education, criminal justice, health, and housing, and they show that in each of these domains, such disparities at least partially reflect discrimination.
   Lang and Kahn-Lang Spitzer note that the disparities we see are both causes and results of discrimination, and that they reinforce each other. For instance, harsher treatment from the criminal justice system makes it more difficult for black people to get good jobs, which makes it more likely they'll live in poor neighborhoods and that their children will attend inferior schools.
   The authors argue that simply prohibiting discrimination isn't effective, partly because it's hard to prevent discrimination along dimensions that are correlated with race. Rather, they write, policies are more likely to be successful if they aim to eliminate the statistical association between race and many other social and economic characteristics and to decrease the social distance between people of different races.

This study aimed to elucidate public attitudes toward people who stutter at work.
   Methods: A web-based questionnaire survey of 730 adults drawn from the general public throughout Japan was conducted. It gathered information on respondents' demographics, contact experience with people who stutter, knowledge of stuttering, and attitudes and experiences toward stuttering at work, using a Likert-type scale. To investigate the factors associated with their attitudes and experiences toward stuttering at work, respondents' demographic information and contact experience were entered into a multivariable model using ordinal logistic regression analysis.
   Results: We analyzed the data of 671 respondents, of whom 77.2 % were company employees; 41.3 % knew a person who stutters at their workplace, among their friends, and/or in their family, and 34.7 % had been in the position of hiring any individual. Respondents perceived the employment of people who stutter to be somewhat positive overall. Regression analysis revealed that only the factor of workplace contact experience to be significantly positively associated with the respondents' attitudes toward stuttering. That is, knowing a person who stutters in one's workplace was significantly associated with more positive attitudes.
   Conclusion: Previous studies have reported widespread negative public attitudes toward stuttering. Our results can supplement this literature, especially regarding attitudes in the workplace. Our findings suggest that the main factor that is associated with people's positive attitudes is their contact experience with people who stutter in their workplace.

AB  - Teachers play an important role in students' educational trajectories. As a consequence, their approach to diversity in the classroom might contribute to an unfavorable educational position for ethnic minority students. The current study tested whether teachers in Dutch primary schools differed in their interventions towards ethnic minority students compared to ethnic majority students for the same kind of misbehavior and whether this difference was related to their multicultural attitudes and their abilities to recognize and interpret emotions. Teachers responded to scenarios depicted in vignettes, describing student misbehaviors, by providing the frequency with which they would engage in various intervention strategies. Our results yielded no significant differences in teachers' intervention strategies to student misbehaviors based on student ethnic background. A notable finding was that teachers' multicultural attitudes were related to their intervention strategies: an increase in teachers' positive multicultural attitudes predicted an increase in relatively tolerant (e.g., discussing the misbehavior) as opposed to more dismissive intervention strategies (e.g., sending the student out of class). This finding may suggest that demonstrating positive attitudes towards multiculturalism reflects an awareness of and comfort with cultural diversity, as well as general understanding of individual differences between students and their behaviors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the relationship between knowledge, attitude and perception regarding environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and smoking among Malaysian adolescents living in states with complete or partial smoke-free legislation (SFL).
   METHODS: A total of 898 respondents aged 13-14 years were randomly selected from 21 secondary schools. The Malay version of the modified Global Youth Tobacco Survey questionnaire was used. Hierarchical logistic regression was performed in examining predictors of smoking attempt among adolescents.
   RESULTS: Participants exposed to ETS >5 h/day were more likely to have smoked compared to those exposed to ETS <1 h/day (OR 4.1, 95%CI 1.03-16.0). Living in a state with partial SFL was associated with a two-fold increase in self-reported smoking attempts (OR 1.95, 95%CI 1.10-3.43) compared to living in a state with complete SFL. Negative attitudes and perceptions towards smoking and ETS exposure were linked to lower smoking attempts in states with complete SFL.
   CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with limited ETS exposure who lived in a state with complete SFL were less likely to attempt smoking compared to those exposed more regularly to ETS and living in a state with partial SFL. Preventing adolescents from becoming smokers is the key to reducing national prevalence rates in smoking. There is a need to implement comprehensive smoke-free legislation nationally across Malaysia.

AB  - The affective news extended model (Knobloch-Westerwick et al., 2020) demonstrated that narratives with a suspense-inducing format, a linear compared to inverted pyramid format, led to attitude change across four political topics. Given the lack of narrative persuasion research which considers the audio modality, the present research seeks to extend this model by using audio clip stimuli to (1) investigate whether the findings of Knobloch-Westerwick et al. (2020) will extend to the audio modality and (2) compare persuasive mechanisms and outcomes between the textual and audio modalities to understand the unique impact of suspense on narrative persuasion. Results demonstrated that (1) suspense did not differ by format, nor did it mediate the relationship between format and attitude change in the audio modality. (2) Comparisons between textual and audio modalities revealed that when exposed to the audio modality, participants were persuaded by transportation, feelings of being mentally and emotionally involved in the narrative. Future research and implications for the ANEM, audio narratives, and persuasion are discussed.

AB  - Psychological explanations of group genesis often require population heterogeneity in identity or other characteristics, whether deep (e.g., religion) or superficial (e.g., eye color). We used agent-based models to explore group genesis in homogeneous populations and found robust group formation with just two basic principles: reciprocity and transitivity. These emergent groups demonstrated in-group cooperation and out-group defection, even though agents lacked common identity. Group formation increased individual payoffs, and group number and size were robust to varying levels of reciprocity and transitivity. Increasing population size increased group size more than group number, and manipulating baseline trust in a population had predictable effects on group genesis. An interactive demonstration of the parameter space and source code for implementing the model are available online.

AB  - Ageism within the context of care has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Similarly, autonomy has developed into a prominent concept within health care law and ethics. This paper explores the way that ageism, understood as a set of negative attitudes about old age or older people, may impact on an older person's ability to make maximally autonomous decisions within health care. In particular, by appealing to feminist constructions of autonomy as relational, I will argue that the key to establishing this link is the concept of self-relations such as self-trust, self-worth and self-esteem. This paper aims to demonstrate how these may be impacted by the internalisation of negative attitudes associated with old age and care. In light of this, any legal or policy response must be sensitive to and flexible enough to deal with the way in which ageism impacts autonomy.

AB  - We examined whether media reports linking criminal behaviour and autism spectrum disorder foster negative attitudes towards individuals with autism spectrum disorder. In a between-subjects design, participants were exposed to (a) a media story in which a murderer was labelled with autism spectrum disorder (media exposure condition) or not labelled with any disorder (control) and (b) an autism spectrum disorder-education condition attacking the myth that people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder are likely to be violent criminals or a no-autism spectrum disorder-education condition. Participants attitudes towards three different crime perpetrators (one with autism spectrum disorder) described in separate vignettes were probed. The media exposure linking crime and autism spectrum disorder promoted more negative attitudes towards individuals with autism spectrum disorder, whereas the positive autism spectrum disorder-related educational message had the opposite effect.

AB  - Honor is an important concept that has a vital value in Turkey and affects many women's lives and even causes death. It is of utmost importance to know and scientifically demonstrate the value judgments of the academics that lead and pioneer the society in our country where honor culture is adopted. Therefore, in Turkey, where thousands of women are exposed to violence every year, 877 academics participated in this descriptive study to determine the attitudes of academics toward violence against women in the name of honor. The data were collected using The Scale for Attitudes Towards Violence Against Women in the Name of Honor (SAVWNH) in the form of electronic questionnaires through email addresses of the academics working at different faculties of the university in the official website of the university in September 1 to October 1, 2015. In our study, academics' attitudes towards violence against women in the name of honor were found low. That is, academics had negative attitudes toward the verbal or physical violence against women in the name of honor and opposed to the punishment of women for this reason. Nevertheless, the attitudes of those who were males; those who were not professors, associate professors, and assistant professors; those who were single; those who had lived in the district/village for a long time; those who had arranged marriages; those who used any kind of violence; and those who considered violence as a solution were found somewhat more conventional. These results showed that, for some academics, the traditional beliefs of the Turkish patriarchal society continued to be valid although they were included in university academic cultures. In fact, it is revealed here that social values, traditions, and customs are very effective and important on the formation of personality in socialization process.

AB  - Aims and objectives. The study aimed to examine the experiences of patients and meanings attached to treatments of sexual deviations, which included homosexuality and transvestism, in the UK (19491992), exploring reasons for such treatments, experiences and how individual lives were affected.
   Background. Male homosexuality remained illegal in England until 1967 and, along with transvestism, was considered an antisocial sexual deviation that could be cured. Homosexuality remained classifiable as a mental illness until 1992. Nurses were involved in administering treatments to cure these individuals; however, there is a paucity of information about this now-discredited mental health nursing practice.
   Design. A nationwide study based on oral history interviews.
   Methods. Purposeful and snowball sampling was utilised when selecting participants for the study. Participants were recruited via adverts in gay establishments/media. All participants gave signed informed consent. Face-to-face oral history interviews were conducted and transcribed for historical interpretation.
   Results. Seven former male patients made contact, aged 65-97 years at interview. All reported that the treatments had been unsuccessful in altering their sexual desires or behaviour. Most sought treatment owing to unsupportive and negative attitudes from friends, family and wider society. Others selected treatments instead of imprisonment. Most eventually found happiness in same-sex relationships. However, all were left feeling emotionally troubled by the treatments they received.
   Conclusion. Defining homosexuality and transvestism as mental illnesses and implementing what could be argued to be inefficient treatments to eradicate them appears to have had a lasting negative impact on the patients who received them.
   Relevance to clinical practice. Nurses who care for older gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender patients need to be mindful of their potential past treatment by healthcare services and ensure that they are non-judgmental and accepting of their sexual orientation and current gender.

AB  - The study aims to investigate the effect of identify and status in the field of global mobility and expatriate management. It conceptualizes perceived prejudice towards low-status expatriates (LSE) though the social identity theory (SIT) lens and examines the effect it has on two state self-esteem domains, that is, performance self-esteem and social self-esteem. The study also highlights that the moderation roles education level and age of expatriates play towards their adaptability. In doing so, it seeks to expand the expatriate management domain by investigating the negative side associated with expatriation. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to analyze responses from 373 LSE working in China. The results provide evidence indicating the significance attached to status and identity, thus indicating that perceived prejudice significantly affects expatriate's self-esteem negatively and that age and education level mitigate these effects by moderating the relationship. Age and education level attained by the expatriates are found to be significant moderators in this relationship. The study therefore proposes the use of SIT as a powerful theoretical lens for understanding LSE.

AB  - Despite the fact that most developing countries now generally welcome multinational companies, political risk still represents a huge concern for international business. In fact, multinational companies today probably face a much broader array of risks than during the nationalization wave of the 1960s and 1970s. To substantiate this claim, a theoretical framework is presented herein which outlines the key causal relationships in the political risk landscape. It is explained why a discernible attitude change in the developing and emerging world does not necessarily equal a reduced overall level of political risk. To illustrate the framework and the complexity of the political risk phenomenon, a number of recent case examples are presented from the international bauxite and aluminium industry an industry whose wide-ranging value chain, international focus, global significance, and natural exposure to risks make it very suitable for analysis. The conceptual discussion and the empirical examples presented in this article suggest that political risk is now surely a highly complex, multidimensional phenomenon. This trait poses major challenges for the global business community, particularly in terms of accurately assessing these risks. (C) 2010 Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

AB  - This research refined the notion of attitude based on the reasoned action perspective of organ donation research at both the conceptual and the operational levels in the Chinese context. In Study 1, a multidimensional attitude scale was developed based on the salient beliefs of the Chinese toward registering to become an organ donor, and the scale's reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity were established. The results of Study 1 indicated that the attitudes toward registering to become an organ donor consisted of two statistically independent dimensions, namely, positive and negative attitudes. In Study 2, the predictive validity of the multidimensional attitude scale was confirmed, and the results indicated that negative attitudes, positive attitudes, and subjective norms significantly impacted behavioral intention, which, in turn, predicted organ donor registration behavior.

AB  - The popularity of science education is decreasing in certain parts of the world and negative attitudes toward science are common in learners from various cultures. Learners' interest in science and the effectiveness of their memory can be enhanced by utilizing modern concepts of an evolutionary-based approach in psychology. Survival-relevant information is, according to a number of authors, better retained than survival-irrelevant information. It is, however, unclear as to which degree the information retention is influenced by visual signs associated with danger. We experimentally manipulated danger information (genuine/ false information) and type of information (survival-relevant/survival-irrelevant) in a sample of 12-16 year old Slovak children. Information concerning dangerous animals was retained better than information about non-dangerous animals and survival-relevant information was retained better than survival-irrelevant information. The information itself, however, did not enhance memory scores, because false information about non-dangerous animals (i.e., presented as dangerous) led to lower scores than false information about dangerous animals (i.e., presented as non-dangerous). These results suggest that children adaptively retain survival-relevant information, but information retention is influenced by visual signs of danger. Utilisation of the evolutionary-based approach in science education is discussed.

AB  - In divided societies, the promotion of cross-cultural contact through the education system has been central to efforts to improve intergroup relations. This approach is informed by an understanding of the contact hypothesis, which suggests that positive contact with a member of a different group should contribute to improvements in attitudes towards the group as a whole. While a substantial body of research provides support for contact theory, critics have argued that its emphasis on harmonious encounters can result in the neglect of group differences and associated issues of conflict and discrimination during contact. The research discussed in this article explores this tension with reference to two shared education projects in Northern Ireland. Research data, gathered primarily through interviews with pupils, confirms that divisive issues are rarely addressed during contact and explores several influences on this: the nature of pupils' relationships, the programme structure, and the prevailing social norms of avoidance.

AB  - This study intends to show the external perception that Primary Education students have of their schoolmates with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and the perception of the student who has being diagnosed with ADHD himself/herself in order to analyse the differences between both perceptions. For that purpose, a questionnaire was e elaborated ad hoc, and the main results shown point to the fact that the external perception of the Primary Education student is more positive than the perception of the diagnosed student. Moreveover, the perception of the schoolmates of students diagnosed with ADHD tends to worsen in superior courses.
   This discovery invites us to reflect on and understand the more frequent attitudes and behaviours that develop in interaction situations as well as investigate those conducts related to social prejudice associated to their clinical characteristics and prevalent syntoms (attention deficit, hyperactivity and impulsivity), which develop an increase of the negative perception towards the student with ADHD.

AB  - Legumes are a traditional healthy staple food in Latin America, with great potential for use in diet-related chronic disease prevention interventions. This study aimed to investigate attitudes about legume consumption and associations with dietary intake. Adult participants from the Puerto Rico Assessment of Diet, Lifestyle, and Diseases, who completed a validated food frequency questionnaire and a legumes questionnaire (n = 229) were included. A 25 item Likert scale was used to assess agreement with stated attitudes regarding legumes consumption. Exploratory factor analysis produced 3 factors: (1) taste and perceived benefits; (2) barriers and negative attitudes; and (3) social support and cultural beliefs. A combined attitudes scale was computed, with higher scores indicating more positive attitudes toward legumes. Adjusted linear regression models examined associations between each factor and the combined scale with legumes intake, rice intake, and ratio of legumes to rice intake. Significant positive associations were observed for the taste and perceived benefits factor (beta = 0.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07-0.21) and the social support and cultural beliefs factor (beta = 0.14; 95% CI, 0.07-0.22) with legume intake. The social support and cultural beliefs factor was also associated with a higher ratio of legumes to rice intake (beta = 1.59; 95% CI, 0.04-3.14). A 3-unit increase in the combined attitudes scale (corresponding to 1 additional positive attitude) was associated with a 0.03 (95% CI, 0.01-0.05) higher servings/day legume intake. The barriers and negative attitudes factor was inversely associated with rice intake (beta =-0.10; 95% CI,-0.02 to-0.17) and positively associated with ratio of legumes to rice intake (beta = 1.55; 95% CI, 0.03-3.07). Nutritional programs to increase legume intake as a healthy staple food among Puerto Ricans and Hispanic/Latino populations should emphasize building positive attitudes, especially those related to taste, perceived benefits, social support, and cultural beliefs, while diminishing barriers and negative attitudes.(C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background
   Medical students may be in an ideal position to identify patients with substance use disorders (SUDs) and provide them with information about harm reduction and treatment options. Specific education regarding opioid use disorder (OUD) and naloxone during undergraduate medical training may help students identify these patients and decrease their own negative attitudes toward patients with OUD. To plan for curriculum development, this study aimed to understand baseline knowledge and attitudes among students entering medical school. Methods: During orientation, all first-year medical students (Class of 2023) were asked to complete a survey that explored their previous experiences in healthcare and with SUDs as well as their attitudes toward opioid overdose and patients with SUDs. We administered the Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale (OOKS), Opioid Overdose Attitudes Scale (OOAS), Medical Conditions Regard Scale (MCRS), and Naloxone Related Risk Compensation Beliefs (NaRRC-B). Results: 266 students (89.6% of the class) completed the survey. Generally, these students were relatively proficient in opioid overdose knowledge, but did not feel they were competent enough to respond to an overdose. Attitudes toward patients with SUDs were mixed. Approximately half of the students thought naloxone distribution should be unrestricted, but many were uncertain whether naloxone receipt would deter individuals from seeking treatment or increase opioid use. Students' previous experiences in healthcare (e.g., employment) results in significantly different knowledge and attitudes toward opioid overdose response. Conclusions: These incoming medical students have greater healthcare experience and level of opioid overdose knowledge than the general population, but still harbor significant misinformation and stigma toward patients with SUDs. These findings provide a foundation upon which to tailor didactic efforts, starting early in medical school, so that graduating physicians can be adequately prepared for clinical care.

AB  - Purpose: Epilepsy is a major public health problem worldwide. There are many misconceptions about people's knowledge and attitudes about epilepsy, which influence people's behavior towards patients with epilepsy.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study in Sohag University, a public Egyptian University, in Upper Egypt. We used an Arabic language designed questionnaire to assess people's knowledge about epilepsy and their attitudes towards patients with epilepsy. We included a total of 920 students in the study.
   Results: 12.4% of study respondents had never heard of or read about epilepsy. Moreover, there was much misunderstanding about the etiology of epilepsy, as 68.2% of epileptic and 74.5% of nonepileptic respondents believe epilepsy is caused by evil spirits and evil eyes or due to psychiatric disorders. There were also many people who held negative attitudes towards patients with epilepsy in regards to major life milestones such as marriage and having children. Among nonepileptics, 54.5% believe epileptics should not marry and 49.9% believe they should not have children. Among patients with epilepsy, these percentages are 27.3% and 36.4% respectively.
   Conclusions: Knowledge about epilepsy is insufficient and should be increased. The attitudes towards patients with epilepsy are negative and should be changed in Upper Egypt.

AB  - Despite decades of research, no scholarly consensus has been achieved regarding the potential impact of video games on youth aggression or other public health concerns. In recent years, hypotheses have been raised that scholarly opinions on video games may resemble past moral panics, with attitudes reflective of generational conflicts. These hypotheses are tested in a sample of 175 criminologists, psychologists, and media scholars, examining both overall negative attitudes about video games and perceived linkages with youth assaults specifically. Results reflected continued lack of scholarly consensus on the issue of video game influences with only 15.3% of scholars endorsing the view that violent video games contribute to youth assaults. As hypothesized, older scholars endorsed more negative views of video games generally, although this appeared to be related to experience with games rather than age per se. Scholars with more negative attitudes toward youth themselves were also more negative about games. Criminologists and media scholars were more skeptical of violent video games contributing to youth assaults than were psychologists. These results are discussed in relation to Moral Panic Theory.

AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Action Plan on Physical Activity recommends adopting a systems approach to implementing and tailoring actions according to local contexts. We held group model-building workshops with key stakeholders in the Caribbean region to develop a causal loop diagram to describe the system driving the increasing physical inactivity in the region and envision the most effective ways of intervening in that system to encourage and promote physical activity. We used the causal loop diagram to inform how the WHO Global Action Plan on Physical Activity might be adapted to a local context Although the WHO recommendations aligned well with our causal loop diagram, the diagram also illustrates the importance of local context in determining how interventions should be coordinated and implemented. Some interventions included creating safe physical activity spaces for both sexes, tackling negative attitudes to physical activity in certain contexts, including in schools and workplaces, and improving infrastructure for active transport. The causal loop diagram may also help understand how policies may be undermined or supported by key actors or where policies should be coordinated. We demonstrate how, in a region with a high level of physical inactivity and low resources, applying systems thinking with relevant stakeholders can help the targeted adaptation of global recommendations to local contexts.

AB  - Objectives Physiotherapy phone based, "Physio Direct" (PD) musculoskeletal triage and treat services are a relatively new phenomena. This study explored Physiotherapist and GP attitudes towards PD services.
   Design Online national survey via cascade e-mail initiated by study leads.
   Participants 488 Physiotherapists and 68 GPs completed the survey.
   Outcome measures The survey asked three negatively worded and three positively worded Likert scale questions regarding PD services. It also collected demographic data and more global attitudes including a version of the friends and family test.
   Results Overall both Physiotherapists and GP's have positive attitudes towards PD services. There was global agreement that PD triage was a good idea but in both groups the majority of respondents who expressed a definite opinion thought that patients would still eventually need to be seen face to face. The vast majority of all respondents also thought patients should be given a choice about first accessing PD services. Physiotherapists with experience of PD services had more positive and less negative attitudes than those without experience. More detailed results are discussed.
   Conclusions Relevant clinical stakeholders have generally positive attitudes towards PD services, but more so when they have experience of them. Counter to research findings significant proportions of respondents believe patients accessing PD services will still need to be seen face to face. The significant majority of respondents believe patients should be given a choice whether they access PD services in the first instance or not. (C) 2016 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Despite the development of medical interventions, being infertile is still deemed a shameful and humiliating experience and perceived as a failure. The aim of the study was to investigate university students' attitudes towards infertility in terms of socio-demographic variables and risky behaviors in Turkey.
   PARTICIPANTS AND PROCEDURE
   It was a cross-sectional study with a self-administered scale. A total of 9693 university students (5002 female, 4691 male) from 12 statistical regions of Turkey participated in the study.
   RESULTS
   According to the findings of the study, 26.99% of the Turkish university students believed that lives of couples without a child are incomplete. 49.00% stated that they would not marry again if their partner was infertile, and 70.05% did not agree that women who do not have a child are faulty. Like the limited studies done before, male students reported more negative attitudes towards infertility than female students. Students who received sexual health education and knew someone infertile in their social network had more positive attitudes.
   CONCLUSIONS
   The results of the study indicated that university students' attitudes towards infertility are relatively positive. Gender differences in attitudes towards infertility indicate that psycho-education programs about infertility including gender role issues can be developed and applied for Turkish university students.

AB  - The present research examined how life history and resistance against interethnic mating were related to positive and negative attitudes towards cousin marriages among young people aged between 15 and 25 from a rural area in the Mexican state of Oaxaca. The sample included three ethnic groups: Mestizos (people of mixed Spanish and indigenous descent, n=84), indigenous Mixtecs (n=83), and Afro-Mexicans (n=33). In general, respondents reported more negative than positive attitudes towards cousin marriage. Among the Mestizos, but not in the other ethnic groups, women reported more negative attitudes than men did. The main objections against marrying a cousin were that it might lead to family conflict and might result in genetic defects of one's offspring. The main positive aspect of cousin marriage that participants mentioned was that one would marry someone with the same values. The ethnic groups did not differ in their attitudes towards cousin marriages. A slower life history was related to a more negative (but not a less positive) attitude towards cousin marriages, whereas resistance against out-group mating was related to a more positive (but not a less negative) attitude towards cousin marriages. The implications of the results are discussed in the context of life history theory, the benefits of in-group marriage, and the potential positive and negative effects of cousin marriages.

AB  - The Decisional Balance Scale (DBS) was developed to assess older adults' attitudes related to driving and includes both intra- and inter-personal motivations for driving. The current study examines the DBS in a sample of older drivers from Australia (n = 257). Longitudinal evaluation of the DBS subscales revealed that changes in attitudes covary with changes in self-regulatory driving practices across 6 annual assessments. Specifically, negative attitudes related to inter-personal motivations for driving (con-other) were associated with participants' scores on the Situational Driving Frequency (SDF) scale. Negative attitudes related to intra- personal motivations for driving (con-self) were associated with participants' scores on the Situational Driving Avoidance (SDA) scale. These findings highlight the importance of considering attitudes in understanding older drivers' decisions to regulate their driving practices.

AB  - Despite a growing body of research outlining the harms of thirdhand smoke (THS), the public remains generally unaware of risks and exposure routes. This project built on past tobacco prevention campaigns and the tenants of McGuire's input-output model to implement and evaluate a seven-month Facebook-disseminated campaign seeking to improve THS awareness among California adults (n = 1087). Multilinear regression showed that THS-related knowledge (chi(2)[6] = 19.31, p < .01), attitude (chi(2)[6] = 13.88, p < .05), and efficacy (chi(2)[6] = 13.81, p < .05) significantly increased by the campaign's end, with messages highlighting children's health (r = .110, p < .05), pets (r = .145, p < .01), and dust reservoirs (r = .144, p < .01) as the most persuasive. Path analysis modeling found campaign recall to be associated with changes in knowledge (beta = .161, p < .01), which predicated attitude change (beta = .614, p < .001) and, in turn, behavior change (beta = .149, p < .05). Findings suggest social media campaigns should continue to educate diverse populations about new tobacco risks and that tobacco control advocates should consider integrating educational THS messages.

KW  - Transsexuality
KW  - Homosexuality

KW  - Young Adult literature
AB  - This article explores the representation of the figure of the effeminate boy in two contemporary adolescent novels written in Chinese which break the silence in addressing alternative gender and sexual identities. In A Beautiful Heart, the transsexual and homosexual tendencies evinced by an effeminate boy are treated as forms of sexual perversion to be cured through professional psychotherapy. The narrative's tensions and contradictions, however, call into question the reductive discourse of pathology. Such questioning unsettles, but does not subvert, the text's explicit conservatism, nor does it attribute legitimacy to queer identities. The Dream of A Beautiful Lad, on the other hand, sets out expressly to interrogate and shatter the monopoly of received opinions about boyhood, gender, maturity and adulthood. In presenting cases of gender nonconformity, however, the text reveals its own complicity in binarism, carrying with it strong traces of androgynous humanism which, in its intention to validate queer existence, is inevitably coloured by heteronormative and heterosexist prejudices. It is concluded that the various forms of gender-crossing and trans-phenomena represented as accompanying queer boyhood do not necessarily entail transcendence or subversion. The figure of the effeminate boy is nonetheless a welcome presence in children's and adolescent literature, unleashing possibilities for resistance and intervention in a rigidly gender-defined society.

AB  - Despite bisexual individuals being at increased risk for mental health and substance use problems, clinicians' ability to provide affirmative and competent care to bisexual clients is limited by their lack of bisexual-specific training. To address this common gap in training this article provides a brief review of bisexual health disparities and the factors that influence them. Then, we describe a multi-level approach for improving the health and well-being of bisexual individuals. This approach addresses factors that influence health at the micro-level (e.g, strategies that clinicians can use to help bisexual clients cope with stigma-related stressors), mezzo-level (e.g., adaptations to clinical environments and training programs that promote bisexual-affirmative care), and macro-level (e.g., advocating for political change and implementing strategies to reduce prejudice against bisexual individuals at the population-level). Specifically, we describe how clinicians can adapt evidence-based interventions to tailor them to the needs of their bisexual clients. Additionally, we discuss the need for bisexual-affirmative clinical training and provide recommendations for how clinical training can be adapted to prepare clinicians to work effectively with bisexual clients. Finally, we describe how population-level interventions can be used to reduce prejudice against bisexual individuals in order to reduce bisexual health disparities. Given the striking health disparities affecting bisexual individuals, there is a critical need to develop, test, and disseminate interventions to improve the health of this population and to prepare clinicians to provide bisexual-affirmative care.

AB  - The scientific novelty of the study consists of the unique, organic, integrative, synchronous and diachronic approach ofthis topic in the Romanian academic space after 1990. The author uses a diverse scientific methodology - inductive, deductive, cartographic, historical, statistical-mathematical, and analytical - from the intersection of political geography, geopolitics, geoeconomics, geostrategy, geo-culture and history. From the beginning of the book, he reveals an interdisciplinary vision, presenting his perspective through the complicated kaleidoscope of the main schools of geopolitics (American, German, French, British). Following in parallel, chronologically and thematically, the relations between post-totalitarian Romania and the USA, Germany and Russia, the author builds his conceptual, scientific and methodological edifice on a series of pillars, present in all five chapters: frontier, history, geopolitics, geostrategy, geoeconomics, geoculture. Benefiting from an impressive bibliography, the author offers an original and surprising view of the Romanian, American, German, and Russian geopolitical realities, managing to detach himself from prejudices, taboos, stereotypes, and leaving the sphere of official, formal and dull language, so often used in the Romanian space by politicians, journalists, and by some pseudo-specialists in geopolitics, security, etc.

AB  - This article investigates whether the perceived threat of terrorism explains the support for right-wing Eurosceptic parties and Euroscepticism above and beyond other relevant variables, including perceived economic and immigration threats. We first examined the entire Eurobarometer samples of 2014 and 2015, and then conducted survey experiments in four European Union (EU) countries, that is, United Kingdom (N = 197), France (N = 164), Italy (N = 312), and Romania (N = 144). Our findings suggest that the perceived threat of terrorism has a small effect on the negative attitudes toward the EU above and beyond the effect of immigration and economic threats and other basic control variables. The relationship between these variables varies across countries and it is less linear than we might expect.

AB  - Barack Obama's first autobiography, Dreams from My Father (1995), explores themes of race and identity up to the late 1980s in the life of the first African American president. The book emphasizes Obama's personal struggle as the son of an interracial couple, and the social and environmental context that shaped his growth and transformation. Using the tools of critical race theory, Freeman illustrates how Obama's autobiography can be used in the classroom to explore an individual's developing racial consciousness in the 1970s and 1980s, and as a prism through which students can understand what it means to live in the post-civil-rights-movement era. Obama's life history illuminates how the ideas and meanings of racial progress in the United States are contested and struggled over on a daily basis at both the micro and macro level.

AB  - Objectives: At the end of 2019, an outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia, called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-2), was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It subsequently spread throughout China and elsewhere, becoming a global health emergency. In February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) designated the disease coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The objective of this study was to investigate the degree of knowledge of young Italians about COVID-19 and their current attitudes toward the SARS-CoV-2 and to determine if there were prejudices emerging toward Chinese.
   Methods: An online survey was conducted on February 3, 4, 5, 2020, with the collaboration of Italian website "Skuola.net". Young people had the opportunity to participate by answering an ad hoc questionnaire created to investigate knowledge and attitudes about the new coronavirus, using a link published on the homepage.
   Results: A total of 5234 responses were received, of which 3262 were females and 1972 were males. Most of the participants showed generally moderate knowledge about COVID-19. Male students, middle school students, and those who do not attend school, should increase awareness of the disease; less than half of responders say that their attitudes toward the Chinese population has worsened in the last period.
   Conclusions: Global awareness of this emerging infection should be increased, due to its virulence, the significant risk of mortality, and the ability of the virus to spread very quickly within the community.

AB  - Reducing the burden of epilepsy in low- and middle-income countries requires understanding of the cultural aspects of epilepsy. This cross-sectional study among individuals attending a clinic in an urban setting in Paramaribo, Suriname aimed to obtain information on the knowledge of and attitudes towards epilepsy and epilepsy treatment, comparing people with epilepsy (PWE) to those without epilepsy. This study also explored the help-seeking behavior and experience of having epilepsy in PWE.
   While the results of interviews with 49 PWE and 33 controls compared favorably to studies conducted in similar countries, a significant minority of PWE still rely on traditional remedies. Prejudices regarding social roles, schooling, and occupational choices of PWE also remain prevalent. Currently, the major source of information for both groups is the media, but there could be opportunities for the local epilepsy association to play a larger role.
   These findings, despite some selection bias, could be useful in bringing conventional medical treatment strategies to more PWE in Suriname, as well as empower patient organizations in designing stigma-reducing interventions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Suicide is a major clinical and public health issue, especially in people with disabilities. However, research on the acceptability of suicide in people with disabilities has not directly compared the relative acceptability of suicidality in people with and without disabilities.
   Method: An online sample of five hundred American adults read five pairs of vignettes about individuals who were experiencing suicidal ideation following a life stressor. Each pair contained a disability and no-disability condition; a sixth pair of vignettes discussed suicidal ideation in an elderly individual and contained physical and cognitive disability conditions. Participants completed questions regarding the relative acceptability of suicidality for each vignette as well as demographic items and measures of suicidality, depressive symptoms, and attitude towards disability.
   Results: In all vignette five pairs, suicidality was seen as significantly more acceptable in the disability condition; this was true even when the participants themselves had disabilities or friends or family members with disabilities. Suicidality, depressive symptomology, and more negative attitudes towards disability predicted greater acceptability in both conditions; no factors predicted greater differences between the two conditions.
   Limitations: The vignettes in this study focused primarily on individuals in their 20s and most did not compare two disabling conditions.
   Conclusions: The greater social acceptability of suicidality in people with disabilities may be taken by individuals with disabilities who are suicidal as implicit permission to end their lives. The potential impact of such social influences should be assessed and addressed by clinicians and suicide prevention advocates. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction This study aims to describe the attitudes of primary care physicians towards mental health patients in Hong Kong, especially to examine the doctors' views on schizophrenia and depression, and the influence of their demographic variables. Methods A questionnaire developed by the research team was sent to members of Hong Kong College of Family Physicians. Potential respondents were allocated on equal basis to one of the two sets of questionnaire, set 1 for clinical vignette of schizophrenia and set 2 for depression. Results A response rate of 37% (500 of 1,360) was achieved. There were 255 and 245 returned questionnaires for set 1 and set 2, respectively. Comparing the two clinical vignettes, there were large differences in their willingness to have the patient on practice list for mental issues (40.0% for schizophrenia versus 71.5% for depression) and to deal with the patient's needs (37.0% versus 60.9%). Multiple ordinal logistic regression analysis showed that doctors with the following demographic factors tended to have more worries or stigma on mental health patients: having longer years of practice, being female, working in hospital, employed in public sector, and not having a relative/friend with mental health problems. Discussion Our study shows that two-thirds of primary care doctors are prepared to look after patients with depression, which is substantially higher than that for schizophrenia. In contrast with the Australian findings, the experienced doctors in Hong Kong have more negative attitudes towards mental health patients than the younger ones.

AB  - Impact Statement The You're Not Alone initiative trained front-line, community stakeholders in trauma-informed practice and psychological first aid principles to respond to escalating distress and create safe, welcoming spaces for refugee and immigrant families affected by the current sociopolitical climate. This study demonstrates that trainings swiftly developed and disseminated were well-received and improved knowledge about trauma and refugee and immigrant experiences, attitudes toward immigrants, and utilization of universal mental health promotion strategies.
   Cumulative traumatic migration experiences are compounded by escalating chronic distress related to the current sociopolitical climate for refugee and immigrant children and families. The aim of this open trial was to conduct a preliminary evaluation of You're Not Alone, a rapidly mounted, strengths-based, community-focused capacity building training initiative for stakeholders interacting with refugee and immigrant children and families in the Chicago area. Trainings, based on Trauma-Informed Care (TIC) and psychological first aid frameworks, adapted education and universal health promotion strategies for population-specific chronic traumatic stress. Two groups of participants (N = 948), who attended either mandatory (n = 659 educators) or voluntary (n = 289 community stakeholders) trainings, completed surveys at pretraining, post-training, and 6-week follow-up. Outcome indices included participant satisfaction, acceptability of training model, and changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Over 90% of participants reported satisfaction and acceptability of trainings. For educators, hierarchical linear modeling analyses demonstrated significant increases in trauma knowledge, refugee and immigrant-specific knowledge, positive attitudes toward TIC over time, and a decrease in negative attitudes toward immigrants. Over 95% of participants indicated that they learned and intended to use new strategies to help serve refugee and immigrant children and families. At follow-up, over 80% of those who completed the survey had utilized at least one strategy, and over 55% indicated that they were using resources that they learned about in the training. This study demonstrates that capacity-building trainings swiftly developed and disseminated to community stakeholders can produce positive change in knowledge, attitudes, and practices.

AB  - This article introduces this Themed Issue, Linguistic Diversity as a Challenge to Legal Policy, and reports a small, peer-reviewed study of the integration of research about language issues in legal contexts in Australian legal education. The article explains that interdisciplinary law and linguistics research has emerged to better understand potential inequalities and injustices. This research speaks to concerns shared across many legal systems because both multilingualism and inter-lingual prejudice are common phenomena across nations. The Themed Issue's eleven contributions draw scholarly attention to specific, current problems in legal contexts which relate to language practices and/or policies about language, arranged around the familiar three branches of the state (legislature, executive, judiciary). The Themed Issue is aimed at endowing readers with motivation and basic knowledge to tread new, language-aware routes towards solutions based on collaborative research and policy reform. In regards to integrating such research into legal education, our NSW and ACT study found few course offerings which focus on an intersection of linguistic and legal scholarship. We therefore suggest the development of electives or the inclusion of such material in core subjects (timely given the 'Priestly 11' compulsory subjects are under review at the time of writing).

AB  - Few studies have examined to what extent commonly held stereotypes reflect real intergroup differences in motivational goals. Taking a values perspective (Schwartz et al., 2012), the study examines value preferences among Jews and Russians in Russia, to assess the extent to which commonly held stereotypes reflect values of group members. Results showed that Jews reported substantially higher levels of universalism-tolerance, benevolence (both caring and dependability), and tradition values, and lower levels of power (both dominance and resources), and universalism-nature values, than Russians. Results indicated that the widespread Jewish stereotypes of power, achievement, and rootlessness/cosmopolitanism are ungrounded, while the stereotypes of liberalism and particularism are upheld by the reported differences in the value preferences between Jews and the majority population in Russia. The present study underscores the importance of value comparisons between ethnic minority and majority groups for understanding their motivational goals and thus fighting prejudices and discrimination.

AB  - Background: Most countries have started to educate students with special educational needs (SEN) in mainstream schools, but it remains unclear how inclusive attitudes towards students with SEN can be promoted.
   Aims: This study investigated the role of adolescents' friendships and socio-moral competencies for their attitudes towards the inclusion of students with SEN. Specifically, we studied whether adolescents without SEN would develop more inclusive attitudes if they had close friendships with SEN students and if they expressed negative emotions about social exclusion.
   Methods: Adolescents' inclusive attitudes and their emotions were gathered from survey data of 1225 Swiss students aged 11-13. Social network data were collected to assess adolescents' friendship relationships. Results: The results indicated that adolescents' friendship closeness with SEN students positively related to their inclusive attitudes. However, this was only true for adolescents who anticipated more negative than positive emotions if a student with SEN was excluded.
   Implications: These findings highlight the role of friendship relationships between adolescents with and without SEN and adolescents' socio-moral experiences for their attitudes towards the inclusion of peers with SEN. Thus, inclusive education may benefit from promoting friendships among students with and without SEN as well as adolescents' sociomoral competencies. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As in other advanced industrial democracies, tax and welfare policies in Australia over the last few decades have tended to preserve benefits for some groups of citizens while the safety net for others is weakened. Young people, including children, are among those bearing increased social risks which tend to be exacerbated rather than ameliorated by redistributive policies. There is little evidence of discontent about the overall redistributive policy context, suggesting it broadly aligns with public opinion. The research described in this paper set out to explore the factors underpinning the attitudes of young adult and senior Australians towards redistributive policy, whether there were differences between the two age groups, and if there was any support for policy reform. The results suggest that the young participants' habituation to neo-liberal policy settings, particularly their adherence to individualistic norms, made them less likely than the seniors to express negative attitudes towards existing policy settings or to advocate reform.

AB  - Background: Communication skills (CS) learning is a core skill in medical and dental education. The comparison of attitudes towards CS between dental and medical students based on the taught curriculum (problem-based learning vs. traditional teaching) in Saudi Arabia awaits investigation. Aims: (1) To assess the attitudes of both undergraduate dental and medical students towards communication skills (CS) learning and (2) to compare the attitudes towards CS between Medical and Dental students in relation to sociodemographic and education-related characteristics. Methods and Materials: A cross-sectional study, using an online survey, invited 260 conveniently sampled Taibah university medical and dental undergraduate students. The survey collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, education-related factors, and CS using Communication Skills Attitude Scale (CSAS) that assess positive and negative attitudes (PAS, NAS). Data analysis included descriptive statistics and the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Of the distributed questionnaire 91% responded (145 dental and 91 medical students). There were, overall, non-significant scores' differences between medical and dental students on PAS (Medicine Median 51 vs. Dentistry Median 50, p = 0.059) and NAS (Medicine Median 32 vs. Dentistry Median 32, p = 0.596). Older medical students, those at clinical levels and those who reported they need to improve their communication skills and student whose parents were not doctors, tended to score statistically significantly (p = 0.032, 0.017, 0.034, and 0.004, respectively) on PAS compared with dental students; on the other hand, medical students with doctor parents scored significantly high in NAS compared to dental students (p = 0.015). Conclusion: Demographic and education-related characteristics underpinned medical student positive attitude towards CS compared to dental students. Although medical and dental students showed no differences in self-rating their attitudes towards (CS). Different factors influence medical and dental students' attitudes towards CS learning.

AB  - When seeking information, Internet users often find multiple communicators co-presenting and expressing their opinions. This study examined how people judge message senders' credibility in a multi-source environment based on system-generated cues, the consensus among multiple sources, and the effect of receiver's familiarity with the online platform. Moreover, this research examined the mediating role of source credibility in attitude change in an online consumer-review community. Results indicated that users familiar with a platform were more likely to use system-generated cues for their judgment of credibility along with consensus heuristics, and the combination of heuristics influenced attitude through credibility. However, unfamiliar users relied on consensus heuristics but not system-generated cues. These findings and their theoretical implications are discussed.

AB  - We conducted a qualitative study aiming to understand the process of diagnosis disclosure in a group of HIV-infected adolescents/young adults, aware of their serological 'status', and among their caretakers, as well as its possible consequences. Data collection were carried out through semi-structured interviews with 40 adolescents/young adults, and with the caretakers of the patients under 18 years old, in a referral hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in 2016. Results signalized that the HIV diagnosis disclosure was made usually by a close relative. Most of the adolescents/young adults claimed that they feel 'normal', despite the difficulties in sharing the diagnosis outside the family, and report feelings of rejection and social prejudice. The caretakers' points of view coincided with the adolescents' observations. We suggest that the diagnosis disclosure should not be postponed, since patients who underwent an adequate process of disclosure may more likely complied to treatment and experienced a better social insertion.

KW  - fairness
KW  - alienation
KW  - ORGANIZATIONAL JUSTICE
KW  - STUDENTS EVALUATIONS
AB  - Problem Statement: The phenomenon of justice, which is defined as conformity to what is right and legal, is conceptualized into three aspects: distributive justice, procedural justice and interactional justice in educational organizations. The more students perceive their learning environment to be fair, the more they enjoy their school life. Otherwise, they experience dissatisfaction and alienation. Having such components as powerlessness, normlessness, isolation, and meaninglessness, the concept of alienation refers to a situation where the student is indifferent to the place he is in, i.e. the school.
   Considering that all educational activities mainly aim to intentionally change learner behaviors, it is apparent that any negative attitudes like a feeling of alienation towards the school will considerably obstruct the educational organizations' ability to achieve their goals. Therefore, it is important for schools to identify the school-related factors underlying the students' feelings of alienation at the school and to alleviate their adverse effects. Some of the factors causing the feeling of alienation stem directly from the procedures in educational organizations. It is believed that the perception of fairness regarding the learning environment is one of the factors.
   Purpose of Study: The purpose of this study was to determine the students' level of alienation and to investigate the relationship between their levels of alienation and their perceptions of a fair learning environment.
   Methods: This survey study was conducted on 952 student teachers, of whom 509 were female and 443 were male. The researcher investigated both the correlation between students' perceptions of a fair learning environment and the actual, experienced alienation, and whether these variables differ significantly in terms of gender, type of program, grade and time of program. The data were collected using the "Personal Information Form," the "Fair Learning Environment Questionnaire" and the " Student Alienation Scale."
   Finding and Results: Results indicated that students' perceptions of fairness and their level of alienation differ significantly in terms of gender, type of program, grade and time of program. Perception of fairness is a significant predictor of their feelings of alienation.
   Conclusions and Recommendations: Based on the research findings, it can be suggested that creating a fairer learning environment may decrease the feeling of experienced alienation. Involving students in administrative decisions, arranging events to increase student-faculty interaction, as well as extensively using objective measurement and evaluation procedures may improve students' perceptions of fairness regarding the learning environment. Improving students' perceptions of fairness can be said to have a positive impact on their feelings about school.

AB  - Following the Digital Revolution, we are witnessing an increase in the number of manipulated sources of information. For this reason, virtual environments can be a breeding ground for the proliferation of prejudices and stereotypes, resulting from the spread of racial fallacious news, known as 'racial hoaxes'. Adolescents may be more susceptible due to the tense and complicated relationship between their experience with digital platforms and the development of their relatively limited critical thinking. In this landscape, in order to explore the features of disinformation in adolescence, the research involved 41 Italian adolescents between 13 and 16 years old, balanced by gender and school education. The teenagers took part in the focus group discussions on the topic of online information preferences, fake news and racial hoaxes, which were analyzed by means of content analysis. The answers given by participants show a so-called adolescents' perception of 'misinformation invulnerability' that can influence their credulity in fake news, since they are aware of fake news but they are not so able to recognize or remember it.

AB  - The objective of this study was to explore the beliefs and attitudes toward menopause, depressive symptoms and sexual function in both premenopausal and postmenopausal Mexican women. The Beliefs about and Attitudes toward Menopause Questionnaire, the Female Sexual Function Index and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale were answered by 253 women between the ages of 46 and 59years. Negative attitudes toward menopause were associated with a more depressive symptomatology, but there was no association between positive attitudes and depressive symptomatology. Among sexually active women (92% premenopausal and 70% postmenopausal), positive attitudes were associated with better sexual function, while negative attitudes were associated with worse sexual function. Our findings suggest that besides biological factors, psychosocial factors may also play an important role in middle-aged women's sexual functioning and in their psychological adjustment.

AB  - Recent research has demonstrated that mentally simulating positive intergroup encounters can promote tolerance and more positive intergroup attitudes. We explored the attributional processes underlying these effects. In our study participants who imagined intergroup contact subsequently reported greater intentions to engage in future contact, a relationship that was mediated by participants' attribution, to themselves, of a more positive attitudinal orientation towards outgroup contact. Consistent with this attributional account, the perspective taken when imagining the encounter qualified this effect. Participants who imagined the encounter from a third-person perspective reported heightened intentions to engage in future contact relative to control participants, while this was not the case when the encounter was imagined from a first-person perspective. These findings suggest that attributional processes are key to observing the benefits that accrue from imagining intergroup contact. We speculate that these attributions may distinguish the approach from extended and actual forms of contact and help researchers to further capitalize on the benefits of mental imagery for improving intergroup relations.

AB  - Despite persistent stigmatization of people living with HIV (PLHIV) across the globe, group identification among these individuals may serve to counteract the detrimental effect of prejudice and discrimination associated with the stigmatized identity. Drawing on resilience theory and social identity theory, this study examined how multiple dimensions of group identification (i.e., in-group ties, in-group affect, and centrality) function to buffer and neutralize the negative impact of HIV stigma. A total of 281 PLHIV were recruited from the only community-based public HIV clinic in Hong Kong to participate in this study. The results revealed a protective effect of in-group affect, which moderated the relationship between HIV stigma and mental health, such that HIV stigma was not associated with mental health among people with higher positive in-group affect. In addition, a positive compensatory effect of in-group ties was found in people with higher HIV identity centrality. Given the protective effect of in-group affect, it is important to re-story the lives among PLHIV by challenging their maladaptive beliefs about being PLHIV and building a positive sense of identity in their personal narratives. Community-based interventions should be provided to individuals with higher HIV identity centrality by offering peer support groups and engaging them in community work.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to examine the prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), as well as the relationships between emotion dysregulation, negative attitudes towards the body, and NSSI, within a sample of college students. We administered self-report measures to 143 diverse college students. Results revealed an NSSI prevalence rate of approximately 27%. Those who identified as a racial/ethnic minority were no more likely to endorse NSSI than those who identified as White/European American. There were no significant differences in emotion dysregulation between participants who endorsed NSSI and those who did not, yet negative bodily attitudes were significantly related to NSSI. Based upon the results, it is argued that negative attitudes towards the body should be considered an important risk factor in NSSI engagement among diverse college students.

AB  - Background: Russia has a substantial HIV epidemic which is poised to escalate in the coming years. The increases in prevalence of HIV will result in increased healthcare needs by a medical system with limited experience with HIV. A healthcare provider's attitude towards a patient plays a significant role in determining the patient's health-related behaviours and medical outcomes. Previous studies have identified negative attitudes of medical students towards people living with HIV. Studying the prevalence of such attitudes is of particular interest, as medical students represent the future workforce and also as the schooling years present a unique opportunity to nurture bias-free healthcare providers. The study measures prevalence of prejudicial attitudes towards HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients who belong to marginalized subgroups.
   Methods: The cross-sectional survey was conducted among medical students of a Russian medical university. Of 500 students surveyed, 436 provided sufficient data to be included in the analysis. Prejudicial attitudes were defined as reluctance to provide medical care to a specified hypothetical patient. Nine hypothetical HIV-positive and HIV-negative patients were proposed: physicians, injecting drug users, commercial sex workers, men who have sex with men and a patient HIV-positive due to blood transfusion. A log-binomial regression solved using generalized estimating equations was utilized to identify factors associated with reluctance to treat.
   Results: Prevalence of reluctance to provide medical care to HIV-positive patients in marginalized subgroups was high (ranging from 26.4% up to 71.9%), compared to a maximum of 7.5% if a patient was an HIV-negative physician. Students in their clinical years reported more negative attitudes than preclinical students. In general, female students were less willing to provide care than their male counterparts.
   Conclusions: Prejudicial attitudes about HIV-positive patients and those in marginalized subgroups of the population are prevalent among medical students in Russia. Given the increasing prevalence of HIV in the country, reasons for this hesitance to treat must be identified and addressed. Educational programs for healthcare providers are urgently needed to eliminate bias in the delivery of critically needed medical care. These targeted interventions should be coupled with other programs to eliminate structural barriers to care.

AB  - Background Many primary care patients receive both medical and chiropractic care; however, interprofessional relations between physicians and chiropractors are often suboptimal which may adversely affect care of shared patients. We surveyed Canadian family physicians in 2010 to explore their attitudes towards chiropractic and re-administered the same survey a decade later to explore for changes in attitudes. Methods A 50-item survey administered to a random sample of Canadian family physicians in 2010, and again in 2019, that inquired about demographic variables, knowledge and use of chiropractic. Imbedded in our survey was a 20-item chiropractic attitude questionnaire (CAQ); scores could range from 0 to 80 with higher scores indicating more positive attitudes toward chiropractic. We constructed a multivariable regression model to explore factors associated with CAQ scores. Results Among eligible physicians, 251 of 685 in 2010 (37% response rate) and 162 of 2429 in 2019 (7% response rate) provided a completed survey. Approximately half of respondents (48%) endorsed a positive impression of chiropractic, 27% were uncertain, and 25% held negative views. Most respondents (72%) referred at least some patients for chiropractic care, mainly due to patient request or lack of response to medical care. Most physicians believed that chiropractors provide effective therapy for some musculoskeletal complaints (84%) and disagreed that chiropractic care was beneficial for non-musculoskeletal conditions (77%). The majority agreed that chiropractic care was a useful supplement to conventional care (65%) but most respondents (59%) also indicated that practice diversity among chiropractors presented a barrier to interprofessional collaboration. In our adjusted regression model, attitudes towards chiropractic showed trivial improvement from 2010 to 2019 (0.31 points on the 80-point CAQ; 95%CI 0.001 to 0.62). More negative attitudes were associated with older age (- 1.55 points for each 10-year increment from age 28; 95%CI - 2.67 to - 0.44), belief that adverse events are common with chiropractic care (- 1.41 points; 95% CI - 2.59 to - 0.23) and reported use of the research literature (- 6.04 points; 95% CI - 8.47 to - 3.61) or medical school (- 5.03 points; 95% CI - 7.89 to - 2.18) as sources of knowledge on chiropractic. More positive attitudes were associated with endorsing a relationship with a specific chiropractor (5.24 points; 95% CI 2.85 to 7.64), family and friends (4.06 points; 95% CI 1.53 to 6.60), or personal treatment experience (4.63 points; 95% CI 2.14 to 7.11) as sources of information regarding chiropractic. Conclusions Although generally positive, Canadian family physicians' attitudes towards chiropractic are diverse, and most physicians felt that practice diversity among chiropractors was a barrier to interprofessional collaboration.

AB  - International conventions acknowledge the right of refugees and of disabled people to access quality inclusive education. Both groups struggle to assert this right, particularly in the Global South, where educational access may be hindered by system constraints, resource limitations and negative attitudes. Our concern is the intersectional and compounding effect of being a disabled refugee in Sub-Saharan Africa. Disabled refugees have been invisible in policy and service provision, reliable data is very limited, and there has been little research into their experiences of educational inclusion and exclusion. This article makes the case for research to address this gap. Three country contexts (South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Uganda) are presented to illustrate the multi-layered barriers and challenges to realizing the rights for disabled refugees in educational policy and practice. These three countries host refugees who have fled civil unrest and military conflict, economic collapse and natural disaster, and all have signed the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. None has available and reliable data about the numbers of disabled refugees, and there is no published research about their access to education. Arguing for an inclusive and intersectional approach and for the importance of place and history, we illustrate the complexity of the challenge. This complexity demands conceptual resources that account for several iterative and mutually constituting factors that may enable or constrain access to education. These include legislation and policy, bureaucracy and resource capacity, schools and educational institutions, and community beliefs and attitudes. We conclude with a call for accurate data to inform policy and enable monitoring and evaluation. We advocate for the realization of the right to education for disabled refugee students and progress toward the realization of quality inclusive education for all.

AB  - The article focuses on the formation of cultural and social self-identification of an ethnic minority within a multicultural society as well as on the establishment and functioning of a state as a conglomerate of various ethnic constituents. Nowadays this subject is vital, as many European countries have found themselves in a situation under which they have to host numerous migrants and assimilate them. It should be emphasized that minorities, their way of life, language they speak and education their children get always reflect general trends existing in the society as well as the official policy towards minorities, prejudices or lack of prejudices in the society. In this study, the authors investigate the possibility of integration and assimilation as well as the historical and social conditions necessary for assimilation in a society and for understanding its importance within a community. Integration means acceptance of a new culture, language and traditions, better understanding of a new religion and ethnic characteristics in order to be a part of a hosting society. It is the history of the Jewish community in Russia, which is analyzed in the article. Since the aim of the present study is the understanding of self-identification, i.e. personal self-perception of an individual in the society, of great value are the memoirs as sources of information and their textual analysis. The objectives of the research are to study the main aspects of social life: religion, education, language. Based on the exact results, the conclusion may be regarded as universal and generally applicable when forming ways of integration of minorities into a single public space.

AB  - Background: Adolescents in developing countries face a range of sexual and reproductive health problems. Lack of health care service for reproductive health or difficulty in accessing them are among them. In this study we aimed to examine health care workers' attitudes toward sexual and reproductive health services to unmarried adolescents in Ethiopia.
   Methods: We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional survey among 423 health care service providers working in eastern Ethiopia in 2010. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests and logistic regression were performed to drive proportions and associations.
   Results: The majority of health workers had positive attitudes. However, nearly one third (30%) of health care workers had negative attitudes toward providing RH services to unmarried adolescents. Close to half (46.5%) of the respondents had unfavorable responses toward providing family planning to unmarried adolescents. About 13% of health workers agreed to setting up penal rules and regulations against adolescents that practice pre-marital sexual intercourse. The multivariate analysis indicated that being married (OR 2.15; 95% CI 1.44 - 3.06), lower education level (OR 1.45; 95% CI 1.04 - 1.99), being a health extension worker (OR 2.49; 95% CI 1.43 - 4.35), lack of training on reproductive health services (OR 5.27; 95% CI 1.51 - 5.89) to be significantly associated with negative attitudes toward provision of sexual and reproductive services to adolescents.
   Conclusions: The majority of the health workers had generally positive attitudes toward sexual and reproductive health to adolescents. However, a minority has displayed negatives attitudes. Such negative attitudes will be barriers to service utilization by adolescents and hampers the efforts to reduce sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies among unmarried adolescents. We therefore call for a targeted effort toward alleviating negative attitudes toward adolescent-friendly reproductive health service and re-enforcing the positive ones.

AB  - Social affiliation in humans is ubiquitous and adaptive, albeit bounded. For example, crowding is experienced as aversive, and fosters reticent behaviors to mitigate contact with potentially threatening conspecifics. Given the integral role of physical proximity in disease transmission, crowd salience could activate pathogen-avoidant motives in response to personal space violations from others. Three preliminary studies investigated how crowd salience heightens pathogen-avoidant motives and shapes interpersonal perceptions. Crowd salience heightened preferences for good genes cues (facial symmetry; Study 2), but not aversion to bad genes cues (obesity; Study 1). Crowd salience was additionally unrelated to anti-immigration attitudes (Study 3). Although crowd salience elicited no significant differences in pathogen-avoidant motives in Studies 1 and 2, it significantly heightened perceived infectability. but not germ aversion, in Study 3. Study 4 was a preregistered, high-powered replication and demonstrated crowd salience heightened both state levels of perceived infectability and germ aversion, necessitating consideration for subtlety in detecting state-level differences. We discuss potential bases for inconsistencies in the findings while offering recommendations for future research.

AB  - This paper investigates causes and consequences of the prejudice towards extramaritally born infants. The main rationale for such defamation seems to have been religious teachings. However, rather than a matter of sexual morals, "illegitimacy" became an economic issue when infants were maintained on taxpayers' money. Under most civil laws, "bastards" could not inherit. In German-speaking states, they were excluded from the guilds, which deprived them of professional training. They found refuge in "dishonest" professions and life in poverty. In the Late Middle Ages, a third of the population was probably born extramaritally. From 1400 to 1600, the illegitimacy ratio dropped markedly, but from 1650 to 1850, it seems to have gradually risen from around 5 to 9% in most European states. French authorities did not search for the putative father but offered the mother the possibility to abandon her child in a foundling asylum. In 1990, the term "illegitimacy" was replaced by "born out of wedlock." After an extramarital birth, the infant mortality rate was elevated by 40-50% above that of maritally born infants. After 1960, effective contraception changed sexual morals, but marital fell more than extramarital fertility. Paternity was no longer uncertain. The Catholic church's influence decreased; and legal reforms protected the infant. Today, half of all infants in Europe are born out of wedlock; that is no longer a proxy for poverty.

AB  - Background: Communication is a core skill and a prerequisite for dietitians clinical competence. It is generally acknowledged that communication skills can be taught and learned. There is a paucity of published work identifying dietetic students attitudes towards learning communication skills, and understanding this is important. Methods: The present cross-sectional study aimed to address this issue using an adapted version of the Communication Skills Attitude Scale (CSAS), which was designed to capture information concerning positive and negative attitudes to learning communication skills. An online questionnaire was sent to all undergraduate and post-graduate dietetic programmes in the UK. Results: Of the students solicited for enrolment in the study, 33.4% (n = 300) completed the questionnaire. A one-way analysis of variance showed attitudes to learning communication skills differed significantly between years of study on both subscales of the CSAS. Subsequent analyses indicated that first-year students attitudes to learning communication skills were significantly more positive than those of fourth-year students (P = 0.042). Third-year students had significantly more positive attitudes to learning communication skills than fourth-year students (P = 0.028). Negative attitudes were also linked to the year of study with fourth-year students having significantly more negative attitudes than third-year students (P = 0.046). Sex, practice placement experience and parental occupation did not significantly influence attitudes to learning communication skills. Conclusions: These findings indicate that efforts are required to maintain positive attitudes to learning communication skills. Further longitudinal studies are recommended in this respect.

AB  - Health professionals caring for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) show poor or negative attitudes because of fear of contagion. Therefore, it is important to know the attitudes of midwives' and nurses' towards people living with HIV/AIDS. The aim of this descriptive and cross-sectional study is to assess the attitudes of Turkish midwives and nurses working at hospitals to people living with HIV/AIDS and to identify factors that affect these attitudes. A group of 46 midwives and 192 nurses working in hospitals were included in the study. Data were collected through AIDS Attitude Scale. Age, professional experience, number of children and marital status influenced the attitudes of the participants towards people living with HIV/AIDS. We concluded that higher level of education appear to positively influence the attitudes of the participants. Education programmes including evidence-based nursing implications might be planned to improve positive attitudes and to prevent stigmatization of people living with HIV/AIDS.

AB  - Previous research has largely ignored the relationship between sexual orientation judgement accuracy, confidence, and attitudes toward homosexuality. In an online study, participants (N=269) judged the sexual orientation of homosexual and heterosexual targets presented via a series of facial photographs. Participants also indicated their confidence in each judgment and completed the Modern Homonegativity Scale (Morrison & Morrison, 2002). We found that (1) homosexual men and heterosexual women were more accurate when judging photographs of women as opposed to photographs of men, and (2) in heterosexual men, negative attitudes toward homosexual men predicted confidence and bias when rating men's photographs. Findings indicate that homosexual men and heterosexual women are similar in terms of accuracy in judging women's sexuality. Further, especially in men, homophobia is associated with cognitive biases in labeling other men but does not have a relationship with increased accuracy.

AB  - Background: Negative attitudes towards patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) may affect their treatment. We aimed to identify attitudes toward patients with BPD.
   Methods: Clinicians in four psychiatric hospitals in Israel (n = 710; psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and nurses) were approached and completed questionnaires on attitudes toward these patients.
   Results: Nurses and psychiatrists reported encountering a higher number of patients with BPD during the last month, and exhibited more negative attitudes and less empathy toward these patients than the other two professions. The whole sample evaluated the decision to hospitalize such a patient as less justified than the decision to hospitalize a patient with Major Depressive Disorder. Negative attitudes were positively correlated with caring for greater numbers of patients with BPD in the past month and in the past 12 months. Nurses expressed the highest interest in studying short-term methods for treating patients with BPD and a lower percentage of psychiatrists expressed an interest in improving their professional skills in treating these patients.
   Conclusions: The findings show that nurses and psychiatrists differ from the other professions in their experience and attitudes toward patients with BPD. We conclude that nurses and psychiatrists may be the target of future studies on their attitudes toward provocative behavioral patterns (e.g., suicide attempts) characterizing these patients. We also recommend implementing workshops for improving staff attitudes toward patients with BPD.

KW  - BIG-5 PERSONALITY
AB  - This paper explores the impact that increased exposure to China during the two and a half weeks of the Beijing Olympics had on American attitudes towards China. A large N longitudinal survey revealed a significant increase in negative attitudes towards China from the beginning to the end of August 2008. Statistical analysis revealed no dominant explanation for this change, however. Instead, personality (openness), ideology (social dominance orientation and right wing authoritarianism), and media exposure each had a small impact on changing attitudes. Further research (including a follow-up experiment manipulating the valence of media coverage of China) suggested both the possibility of an 'efficiency effect', whereby China's very success in both hosting and competing in the Olympics generated increased American anxiety about China, and a 'cheating effect', whereby stories about underage Chinese gymnasts and deception (e.g. lip synching while another child actually sang during the Opening Ceremonies) diffused broadly through social networks, uniformly and negatively impacting American attitudes towards China.

TI  - Building a Barometer of Gay Rights (BGR): A Case Study of Uganda and the Persecution of Homosexuals
T2  - HUMAN RIGHTS QUARTERLY
LA  - English
AB  - Few countries in the world actually embrace homosexuals as valuable members of their society and even fewer bestow full human rights on their homosexual citizens. The Barometer of Gay Rights (BGR) attempts to systematically quantify how rights protective and respective a country really is. This article will apply the BGR methodology to the Ugandan case study to measure the degree to which Uganda is an "active persecutor" of homosexuals. The BGR measures the constitutional protections afforded homosexuals, their civil, political, and socioeconomic rights, the presence and efficacy of gay rights organizations, and the degree of societal persecution.
   It is not called the partial declaration of human rights. It is not the sometimes declaration of human rights. It is the Universal Declaration, guaranteeing all human beings their basic human rights-without exception. Violence will end only when we confront prejudice. Stigma and discrimination will end only when we agree to speak out. That requires all of us to do our part, to speak out-at home, at work, in our schools, and communities-to stand in solidarity.

AB  - Transgender individuals challenge the traditional assumption that an individual's gender identity is permanently determined by their assigned sex at birth. Perceiving ambiguity surrounding indeterminate gender identities associated with transgender individuals may be especially disturbing for those who generally dislike ambiguity and have preference for order and predictability, that is, for people scoring higher on Need for Closure (NFC). We tested the associations between NFC and transphobia in two studies using community samples from the United Kingdom (n = 231) and Belgium (n = 175), and we examined whether right-wing ideological attitudes and traditional gender role beliefs mediated these relationships. Confirming our expectations, we found that NFC was significantly associated with transphobia through both stronger adherence to social conventions and obedience to authorities (i.e., right-wing authoritarianism) and stronger endorsements of traditional gender roles in the UK and Belgium, as well as through stronger preferences for hierarchy and social inequality (i.e., social dominance orientation) in the UK. Our results suggest that transgender individuals are more likely to be targets of prejudice by those higher in NFC at least partly due to the strong preference for preserving societal traditions and the resistance to a perceived disruption of traditional gender norms. Hence, attempts to reduce transphobia might be especially challenging among those high in NFC. Nevertheless, prejudice-reducing interventions could incorporate techniques that satisfy epistemic needs for predictability, certainty, and simple structure which may have higher chances of success among high NFC individuals.

AB  - Significant debate exists regarding whether different diversity ideologies, defined as individuals' beliefs regarding the importance of demographic differences and how to navigate them, improve intergroup relations in organizations and the broader society. We seek to advance understanding by drawing finer-grained distinctions among diversity ideology types and intergroup relations outcomes. To this end, we use random effects meta-analysis (k = 296) to investigate the effects of 3 identity-blind ideologies-colorblindness, meritocracy, and assimilation-and 1 identity-conscious ideology-multiculturalism-on 4 indicators of high quality intergroup relations-reduced prejudice, discrimination, and stereotyping and increased diversity policy support. Multiculturalism is generally associated with high quality intergroup relations (prejudice: rho = -.32; discrimination: rho = -.22; stereotyping: rho = -.17; policy support: rho = .57). In contrast, the effects of identity-blind ideologies vary considerably. Different identity-blind ideologies have divergent effects on the same outcome; for example, colorblindness is negatively related (rho = -.19), meritocracy is unrelated (rho = .00), and assimilation is positively related (rho = .17) to stereotyping. Likewise, the same ideology has divergent effects on different outcomes; for example, meritocracy is negatively related to discrimination (rho = -.48), but also negatively related to policy support (rho = -.45) and unrelated to prejudice (rho = -.15) and stereotyping (rho = .00). We discuss the implications of our findings for theory, practice, and future research.

AB  - Hate crime victimization is harmful for victims and those who share the victim's identity. It may also be harmful for the broader community. Yet, few studies focus on the ripple effects of hate. This paper examines how secondary exposure to hate crime in the neighborhood, through witnessing or hearing about hate crime, influences individual perceptions of ethnic minorities, which in turn can harm social relations. Findings reveal that those who witness hate crime express greater anger towards ethnic minorities. Those who rely on second-hand information about hate crime in the community are more likely to anticipate rejection on the basis of their ethnicity, hold negative attitudes towards ethnic migrants and intend to take actions to exclude new migrants from their communities when compared to those who do not have such information. These findings have implications for community cohesion in multi-ethnic neighborhoods.

TI  - Making the most of missing transverse energy: Mass reconstruction from collimated decays
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW D
LA  - English
AB  - At hadron colliders invisible particles chi can be inferred only through observation of the transverse component of the vectorial sum of their momenta-missing E-T or missing transverse energy (MET)-preventing reconstruction of the masses of their mother particles. Here we outline situations where prior prejudice about the event kinematics allows one to make the most of MET by decomposing it into its expected sum of transverse contributions, each of which may be promoted to a full four-momentum approximating the associated chi. Such prejudice arises when all chi in the event are expected to be light and (anti-)parallel to a visible object, due to spin correlations, back-to-back decays or boosted decays. We focus on the last of these, with boosted semi-invisibly decaying neutralinos widely motivated in supersymmetry (in the presence of light gravitinos, singlinos, photini or pseudo-Goldstini), and demonstrate our simple method's ability to reconstruct sharp mass peaks from the MET decomposition.

KW  - workplaces
KW  - organizational culture
AB  - An ideal of involved fatherhood has become popular in the developed countries, but even countries like Finland that have introduced an individual father's quota to parental leave are far from gender equality in parents' leave practices. Lack of support and negative attitudes at workplaces or pressure at work are among the obstacles to fathers' leave take-up. The study used survey data from fathers and interviews at workplaces to explore the role of work and workplaces among the many aspects related to fathers' possibilities of taking leave. The results showed that fathers' income and workplace characteristics were associated with taking leave. Few fathers mentioned employers' objection as a hinder. Father's recent unemployment and anticipated difficulty of taking a long time off played a more important role. At workplaces, the obstacles to taking long leave were related to fathers' ideals about a committed worker and to the nature and organizing of work. Additionally, the leave exceeding fathers' quota might not be understood as 'for fathers'. The spouse's situation and fathers' gendered perceptions about parental responsibilities were also important for leave practices. The findings suggest that policy development towards a longer father's quota could make fathers' care responsibilities visible also at workplaces.

AB  - This study explores deriving minimal features for a robotic face to convey information (via facial expressions) that people can perceive and understand. Recent research in computer vision has shown that a small number of moving points/lines can be used to capture the majority of information (95 %) in human facial expressions. Here, we apply such findings to a minimalist robot face design, which was run through a series of experiments with human subjects (n = 75) exploring the effect of various factors, including added neck motion and degree of expression. Facial expression identification rates were similar to more complex robots. In addition, added neck motion significantly improved facial expression identification rates to 100 % for all expressions (except Fear). The Negative Attitudes towards Robots (NARS) and Godspeed scales were also collected to examine user perceptions, e.g. perceived animacy and intelligence. The project aims to answer a number of fundamental questions about robotic face design, as well as to develop inexpensive and replicable robotic faces for experimental purposes.

AB  - Aims: This study aimed at determining the prevalence of unwillingness to use insulin and its associated attitudes amongst participants with Type 2 diabetes in Saudi Arabia. A further aim was to investigate whether demographic characteristics such as age, gender, educational level and duration of diabetes are associated with unwillingness to use insulin among these participants.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted among participants with Type 2 diabetes using a self-administered questionnaire. The study sample consisted of 408 insulin-naive participants with Type 2 diabetes who were recruited between May and August 2014 from the primary care outpatient clinics at King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
   Results: Unwillingness to commence using insulin was common in about one third (34.6%) of Saudi participants with Type 2 diabetes. Negative attitudes most frequently raised by participants towards commencing insulin therapy were: keeping insulin as a last resort (57.1%), restriction of lifestyle (48.8%), problematic hypoglycemia (45.1%), perception of failure to care for diabetes previously (44.6%), and weight gain worries (40.7%). In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, after adjustment for a participant's age, gender, educational level, location and duration of diabetes, participants with tertiary education were 48% less likely to be willing to initiate insulin therapy as compared to those who had only a primary education (OR = 0.52, 95% CI = 0.30-0.91, P = 0.023). However, there were no significant associations between unwillingness to commence insulin and other study variables.
   Conclusions: Participants have several negative attitudes concerning initiating insulin therapy. Exploring the reasons for participant reluctance to commence insulin can help address his or her specific concerns and beliefs, and promote the future uptake of insulin.

AB  - Research exploring whether health predicts self-perceptions of aging (SPA) has mostly focused on single predictors and has been hampered by short observational intervals. We examined whether 20-year changes in cognitive functioning, physical and mental health predict SPA. We used data of 103 German participants who remained of a sample of 500 participants born in 1930-1932 enrolled in the Interdisciplinary Longitudinal Study of Adult Development (ILSE) in 1993/1996 (mean age at fourth measurement wave = 82.5 years). Health indicators included six cognitive tests, objective and subjective physical health, and self-reported depression. We used a new and multidimensional (awareness of age-related gains and losses) and a well-established (attitudes toward own aging) measure of SPA. Linear regression analyses showed that, among the cognitive tests, decline in information processing speed (Digit Symbol) predicted less awareness of age-related gains and more awareness of age-related losses but not attitudes toward own aging. Decline in subjective but not objective physical health, predicted more awareness of age-related losses and negative attitudes toward own aging, but not awareness of age-related gains. Increase in depressive symptoms predicted more awareness of age-related losses and negative attitudes toward own aging, but not awareness of age-related gains. The size of associations suggests that objective cognitive decline has limited influence on older adults' SPA and, if so, only when the decline is related to mental slowing. Similarly, perceived physical and mental health, but not objective health, have a small-to-moderate influence on awareness of age-related losses and attitudes toward own aging.

AB  - The present study proposes a new threat-benefit theoretical model explaining attitudes of local people toward immigrants. Based on the theory of human values and extending Integrative Threat Theory, the threat-benefit model suggests that the local population perceives immigrants as both threatening and beneficial for the receiving society. The model assumes that appraisal of an immigrant group as threatening or beneficial for the receiving society influences opinions regarding immigration policy related to the immigrant group. The study assessed the new model investigating attitudes toward asylum seekers in a representative sample of 283 social workers in Israel. Results of the study support a conceptualization of immigrant appraisal involving four types of threats (economic, physical, social cohesion, and modernity) and four types of benefits (economic, physical, cultural diversity, and humanitarian), which represent different types of realistic and symbolic threats and benefits. Findings showed that appraisal of asylum seekers as beneficial or threatening to the receiving society mediated the connections between personal preferences for values of universalism, power, social security, and tradition and support for immigration policy directed either at defending immigrants' rights or defending the receiving society. Application of the model for understanding attitudes toward different minorities as well as for creation of value-based interventions and programs aimed at reducing negative attitudes toward various stigmatized groups in society are discussed.

AB  - This article explores how the GDR dealt with intellectual remigrants, in particular 'bildungsburgerlich Marxist intellectuals', who had survived the Third Reich in Western exile. It analyses the political biographies of three such remigrants, namely the journalist Hermann Budzislawski, the publisher and author Wieland Herzfelde, and the journalist and party functionary Hans Teubner. In the late 1940s and 1950s, these three men were appointed to professorships at the Faculty of Journalism at Leipzig University, a future training school of party journalists, and thus filled important strategic positions at the intersection of higher education, mass media, and politics. However, their biographies testify to more than just individual success stories. They point to the difficulties of returning Communists in adapting to the political realities of the GDR in the 1950s, marked by widespread distrust and coercion. Behind the scenes, the remigrants in question here were put under enormous pressure to bow to Party command. As Budzislawski and Herzfelde were Jewish, the article also discusses to what extent their problems were related to antisemitic prejudices in the Stalinist period of the GDR. Regardless of individual differences, this article demonstrates that one of the central hopes of the remigrants, that is, to erase the scars of emigration, remained unfulfilled.

AB  - Background: Despite the adverse health outcomes of holding negative attitudes toward aging, little attention has been paid to these attitudes' role in mental health among the aging population. Objectives: Drawing on the stress coping theory, this study examines whether negative attitudes toward aging and low levels of active coping are associated with greater depressive symptoms, and whether active coping attenuates the increased risk of depression caused by negative aging attitudes. We also investigate how these associations differ in middle-aged and older adults. Methods: A nationwide sample of 500 Koreans aged 55 or above was analyzed. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed separately by age groups to investigate the independent effects of attitudes toward aging and active coping as well as their interactive effects on depressive symptoms. Results: Our findings showed that more negative attitudes toward aging were related to higher levels of depressive symptoms. There were age group differences in the independent and moderating effects of active coping. For the middle-aged, those with higher levels of active coping had fewer depressive symptoms, while no such significant association was found among older adults. On the contrary, active coping buffered the adverse effects of endorsing negative aging attitudes on depressive symptoms only for the older adult group. Limitations: A causality cannot be inferred by our findings due to the cross-sectional design. Conclusions: The findings provide some of the first insights into how one's aging attitudes and coping style may protect against the risk of depression and how it differs by age group.

AB  - Combining media coverage data from approximately 17,000 unique media outlets with the full population of CEO appointments for U.S. publicly traded firms between 2000 and 2016, we investigate whether female CEO appointments garner more public attention compared with male appointments, and if so, whether this increased attention can help make sense of the previously reported negative market reaction to these events. Contrary to prior reports, our data do not indicate that the appointments of female CEOs elicit overly negative market reactions, on average. Our results do highlight an important moderating role of public attention, however. We demonstrate that greater attention-even when exogenously determined-contributes to negative market reactions for female CEO appointments but positive market reactions for male CEOs, all else held constant. Additionally, female CEO appointments that attract little attention garner significant positive responses in the market, compared with both male CEOs drawing similarly limited levels of attention and female CEOs drawing high levels of attention. Our results help to reconcile contrasting empirical findings on the effects of gender in executive leadership and parallel recent work on anticipatory bias and second-order discrimination in alternative empirical contexts. Implications for research on attention, gender bias, and executive succession are discussed.

AB  - Outgroup members are often perceived as threating and untrustworthy, and this is particularly true for judgments of outgroup males. As race influences perceptions of group membership, male racial outgroup faces (MROFs) are judged as less trustworthy than male racial ingroup faces (MRIFs). Neurologically, this effect is mediated by amygdala activation, a brain region central to the processing of fear-related stimuli, threat detection, vigilance regulation and facial trustworthiness. As acute stress up regulates amygdala activity and promotes hyper-vigilance towards threatening stimuli, we hypothesised that acute stress would result in increased vigilance and lower trustworthiness judgements towards MROFs. In contrast, we expected that stress would have no effect on MRIFs. Using a within-subjects design, White-Dutch male participants rated the perceived trustworthiness of White males (ingroup) and Arab males (outgroup) under stress and during the absence of stress (baseline). Stress significantly reduced trust towards racial outgroup members, whilst trust towards racial ingroup members was maintained. Understanding the mechanisms by which stress differentially affects social behaviors towards outgroups is of theoretical and practical relevance to our understanding of the biological basis of ethnocentrism and xenophobia.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to examine the prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), as well as the relationships between emotion dysregulation, negative attitudes towards the body, and NSSI, within a sample of college students. We administered self-report measures to 143 diverse college students. Results revealed an NSSI prevalence rate of approximately 27%. Those who identified as a racial/ethnic minority were no more likely to endorse NSSI than those who identified as White/European American. There were no significant differences in emotion dysregulation between participants who endorsed NSSI and those who did not, yet negative bodily attitudes were significantly related to NSSI. Based upon the results, it is argued that negative attitudes towards the body should be considered an important risk factor in NSSI engagement among diverse college students.

AB  - How inclusive are European national identities of Muslim minorities and how can we explain cross-cultural variation in inclusiveness? To address these questions, we draw on large-scale school-based surveys of Muslim minority and non-Muslim majority and other minority youth in five European countries (Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey [CILS]; Belgium, England, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden). Our double comparison of national identification across groups and countries reveals that national identities are less strongly endorsed by all minorities compared with majority youth, but national identification is lowest among Muslims. This descriptive evidence resonates with public concerns about the insufficient inclusion of immigrant minorities in general, and Muslims in particular, in European national identities. In addition, significant country variation in group differences in identification suggest that some national identities are more inclusive of Muslims than others. Taking an intergroup relations approach to the inclusiveness of national identities for Muslims, we establish that beyond religious commitment, positive intergroup contact (majority friendship) plays a major role in explaining differences in national identification in multigroup multilevel mediation models, whereas experiences of discrimination in school do not contribute to this explanation. Our comparative findings thus establish contextual variation in the inclusiveness of intergroup relations and European national identities for Muslim minorities.

AB  - Under what conditions are a country's residents likely to express favorable or unfavorable attitudes toward the United States? I discuss this question using survey data from 38 countries, focusing on the possible impacts that the active approach by the United States toward security threats has on the psychology of countries' residents. The results show that the larger the U.S. military presence in a country, the more likely that its residents are to express negative attitudes toward the United States. Meanwhile, citizens who feel threatened by specific types of global actors that the U.S. government actively confronts as security threats are less likely to express negative attitudes toward the United States, and particularly less likely to do so the larger the U.S. military presence in their country. These findings contribute significantly to understanding the shifts in the socio-political dynamics of regions such as the Asia-Pacific, where the United States has long implemented an active approach.

AB  - In the literature about bisexuality few studies consider bisexual people's beliefs about bisexuality and none examine essentialist beliefs about bisexuality. In the present study 244 participants (bisexual n=58, lesbian/gay n=54 and heterosexual n=132) from the UK were asked via online questionnaire about their attitudes towards bisexuality, homosexuality and heterosexuality, and how stable they perceived bisexuality, homosexuality and heterosexuality to be. They were also asked about their essentialist beliefs towards bisexuality. Bisexual respondents viewed bisexuality as significantly more stable than lesbian, gay and heterosexual respondents. Analysis also showed that less belief in the discreetness of bisexuality predicted more positive attitudes towards bisexuality, as did positive beliefs towards homosexuality and heterosexuality. Belief in the immutability of bisexuality did not, however, predict attitudes towards bisexuality. Therefore, discreteness appears to be an especially problematic essentialist belief about all sexual minorities, as it is consistently associated with negative attitudes. However, beliefs about the immutability of sexuality are not consistently associated with negative attitudes for all sexual minorities.

AB  - In 2014 approximately 14.4% of Americans ages 18 to 24 had some type of disability. Compared to their peers without disabilities, disabled emerging adults typically have more difficulty dating and finding romantic and sexual partners. One way that they may escape disability stigma and smaller dating pools is through online dating. However, little is known about their experiences seeking romantic and sexual relationships online, and even less is known about the experiences of emerging adults with disabilities who identify with sexual orientations and have gender identities that are not heterosexual or cisgender. In the present study 27 LGBTQ+ emerging adults with various disabilities, genders, and sexual orientations completed 47 item online surveys before COVID in which they described their experiences with online dating and starting and sustaining romantic relationships. Results from qualitative data analyses suggest that rather than being neutral spaces that exist separately from stigma and social prejudice, dating apps and web sites typically perpetuate normative ideas of ableism, sexuality, and gender and stimulate questions of timing of disability disclosure. Despite challenges, however, online dating also offers opportunities to interact with multiple interested daters and appears to offer LGBTQ+ emerging adults with disabilities an often beneficial though sometimes vexing venue for relationship development.

AB  - Sustainable tourism has become an increasingly important topic in tourism development research. This study attempts to identify a set of sustainability issues that negatively affect residents' attitudes toward tourism development. This study extends the importance-performance analysis (IPA) into the "adverse-impact and serious-level analysis" (AISLA) to evaluate sustainability issues in tourism development. A survey was carried out with 430 residents in Macau. According to the results of AISLA, the government was recommended to take "concentration" actions to reduce the levels of impacts of some economic (including inflation, urban service charge, and housing price) and environmental (including noise pollution and destruction of natural landscapes) issues. Furthermore, the government of Macau should take "keep down" actions for most of the socio-cultural issues. This work provides a new perspective for the government to develop sustainable tourism.

AB  - Background Studies indicate that women with intellectual disabilities (ID) face various personal and socio-environmental barriers in their sexual lives. This study aimed to identify the concerns and sexual health needs experienced by women with ID. Method A systematic review of relevant qualitative articles was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science Scopus and PsycINFO databases from June 2018 to August 2018. We designed our search strategy according to two main foci: (1) sexuality; and (2) women with ID. In the study, searches were limited to articles published from January 2000 to December 2017. In this review, studies on women ages 16 and over were included. Results Within the four databases, the search found 274 unique articles. After three steps of screening (title, abstract and full text), 22 studies were included in the final review. The articles mentioned difficulties with lack of sexual experience, negative experiences with sexuality, negative attitudes towards sexuality by nondisabled individuals, limited cognitive capacities to understand sexual identity, difficulty with finding the right partner, lack of access to sexual health information, lack of school-based sexuality education, violence and sexual abuse, lack of support from families and caregivers about sexuality, fear of sexual acts and unwanted pregnancy, shyness in expressing sexual desires, and limited knowledge of sexual behaviors. Conclusion Our findings indicate that women with ID need to be provided with school-based sexuality education tailored to the level of understanding needed to attain the requisite knowledge to form relationships, understand sexual and romantic relationships, and practice safe sex when they choose this option. Families along with education and healthcare systems should provide opportunities for women with ID to talk about their sexual needs and make their own choices.

AB  - Fake news, which contains false information to deceive audiences, may potentially influence inter-Korean relations. Two studies probe into South Koreans' experience of and reaction to fake news exposure, and their ability to distinguish fake news from real news. Study 1 reveals that people have negative attitudes for fake news and perceive its impact to be greater on others than on themselves. Study 2 tests hypotheses based on the third-person effect (TPE) and the first-person effect (FPE), discovering that South Koreans display the TPE on North Korea-related fake news and advocate fake news censorship. It also examines Korean citizens' ability to identify North Korea-related fake news and finds that most people fail to do so accurately despite considering that fake news will have a relatively small impact on themselves. We conclude that different agents should cooperate to reduce the negative impact of fake news.

AB  - We examine mental illness stigma in a university context using well-established measures of public stigma. We compare our results to those found in cross-national adult samples. We also examine whether public mental illness stigma differs by students' diagnosis status or acts as a deterrent to treatment-seeking. Findings indicate the students in our sample hold relatively low levels of endorsement for most common public stigma components, but the public stigma components they endorse reflect the global core of public prejudice associated with mental illness. Endorsement differences by diagnosis status are also found. Additionally, associations are found between public stigma and treatment use in the form of exclusionary sentiments, perceived danger to others, and traditional prejudice. We conclude universities have the potential to serve as an innovative context of change related to mental illness stigma, and we offer suggestions for addressing stigma on university campuses.

AB  - Despite their training, psychiatrists have been found to have negative attitudes towards people with mental illness, including the patients they treat. Similarly, studies focused on service users have identified psychiatrists as a source of stigma. Even though negative attitudes in psychiatrists have been identified in different countries and settings, in Mexico the attitudes of these professionals have never been assessed. Because of this, we invited psychiatric trainees from a hospital in Mexico to participate in individual interviews to describe their opinions regarding mental health-related stigma, to evaluate their attitudes towards people with mental illness and to identify factors that could be influencing their attitudes. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. A total of 29 trainees participated in the study. The results suggested that trainees recognised psychiatrists can have negative attitudes towards people with mental illness, such as poor empathy, judgement and labelling, and mainly towards patients considered difficult and with borderline personality disorder. Participants recognised these attitudes can influence their relationship with patients, and considered it is necessary to develop interventions to improve their own attitudes and reduce mental health stigma. From this study we concluded Mexican psychiatrists are not free from stigma towards people with mental illness. However, Mexican psychiatric trainees are interested in improving their attitudes and reactions towards their patients.

AB  - Education plays an important role in bridging divisions and promoting positive intergroup relations. A number of initiatives aimed at improving relations in conflict-affected societies have been based on the contact hypothesis. However, very little attention has been devoted to the potential of such interventions to reduce social distance between groups. Moreover, the voices of the young people involved in such programmes have rarely been taken into consideration. This paper tries to address these gaps using a qualitative methodology. It presents the views and experiences of post-primary pupils involved in planned educational contact encounters in two countries that have experienced interethnic violence: Northern Ireland and the Republic of North Macedonia. The findings suggest that planned contact can be effective in reducing social distance. However the programmes need to provide opportunities for more frequent meetings, more personalized communication between pupils, and the sensitive exploration of contentious issues to ensure long-lasting changes.

AB  - Research shows that direct and indirect intergroup contact reduces levels of prejudice towards immigrants. However, no research so far has explored the association of these different forms of contact with attitudes towards refugees. The present study analyses the relationship between the frequency and valence of direct intergroup contact with people with a migration background, the frequency of indirect contact with news on refugees, and the perception of realistic and symbolic threat, and attitudes towards refugees among adults in four European countries (Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Sweden). Data were collected in 2017 via online questionnaires (N= 6,000). Using structural equation modelling, findings indicate that interethnic contact is positively related to attitudes towards refugees. Moreover, valence of direct contact is found to be more important to attitude formation than its frequency. Regarding indirect contact, exposure to news on refugees and public news consumption are positively related to attitudes, while commercial news consumption is negatively related to attitudes.

AB  - Greenwald, Banaji, and Nosek (2015) present a reanalysis of the meta-analysis by Oswald, Mitchell, Blanton, Jaccard, and Tetlock (2013) that examined the effect sizes of Implicit Association Tests (IATs) designed to predict racial and ethnic discrimination. We discuss points of agreement and disagreement with respect to methods used to synthesize the IAT studies, and we correct an error by Greenwald et al. that obscures a key contribution of our meta-analysis. In the end, all of the meta-analyses converge on the conclusion that, across diverse methods of coding and analyzing the data, IAT scores are not good predictors of ethnic or racial discrimination, and explain, at most, small fractions of the variance in discriminatory behavior in controlled laboratory settings. The thought experiments presented by Greenwald et al. go well beyond the lab to claim systematic IAT effects in noisy real-world settings, but these hypothetical exercises depend crucially on untested and, arguably, untenable assumptions.

AB  - Popular belief holds that eye contact increases the success of persuasive communication, and prior research suggests that speakers who direct their gaze more toward their listeners are perceived as more persuasive. In contrast, we demonstrate that more eye contact between the listener and speaker during persuasive communication predicts less attitude change in the direction advocated. In Study 1, participants freely watched videos of speakers expressing various views on controversial sociopolitical issues. Greater direct gaze at the speaker's eyes was associated with less attitude change in the direction advocated by the speaker. In Study 2, we instructed participants to look at either the eyes or the mouths of speakers presenting arguments counter to participants' own attitudes. Intentionally maintaining direct eye contact led to less persuasion than did gazing at the mouth. These findings suggest that efforts at increasing eye contact may be counterproductive across a variety of persuasion contexts.

AB  - Stigmatized psychosocial perception poses a serious challenge and source of discrimination which impedes epilepsy patients from attaining a satisfactory quality of life. The present study was aimed to obtain information on knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of epilepsy patients in Delhi and compare with the published data from India. We included 120 people with epilepsy (PWE) attending the Neurology outpatient services of the Institute of Human Behavior and Allied Sciences (IHBAS), Delhi. Demographic details and responses to a questionnaire assessing the knowledge, attitude and practices were recorded. Although majority of the patients belonged to low socioeconomic strata, the literacy rate was reasonably high (70%). A large majority (94%) of PWE had heard about epilepsy and 91% knew that epilepsy can be treated with modern drugs. Positive attitude was observed with respect to allowing a child with epilepsy to study (80%), not objecting children to play with a child with epilepsy (95%), marriage (89%) and having children (92%). Negative attitude was reflected in the belief that epilepsy is due to supernatural powers (16%) and sins committed by patient or ancestors (21%). Analysis of Indian data revealed regional differences in KAP which could be attributed to local factors, such as literacy, awareness about epilepsy, and practice of different systems of medicine. Some of the differences can also be attributed to category of study population whether it included patients or non epilepsy individuals, since the former are likely to have less negative attitudes than the public. There is a need to create awareness about epilepsy on a nation-wide basis to dispel the misconceptions and stigma through effective and robust programs with the aim to lessen the disease burden.

AB  - In this paper, I explore how the US-based Religious Right and white nationalist movements are both organized around a similar politics of gender rooted in defending the patriarchal family. While the broader meanings of the family differ in each framework-either providing the foundation for the racial nation or the religious order-there is surprising agreement across these movements around understanding the family as a heterosexual and patriarchal institution that is under attack. Based on long-term ethnographic research in both movements, I show how defending the heteropatriarchal family provides valorized gendered identities for their participants along with a moral justification for prejudice, particularly through a discourse of defending women and children from feminism and queerness. This analysis shows how contemporary right-wing and authoritarian movements rally around this family-modern, classed and raced, and patriarchal-as an anchor of stability in a time of increasing economic and social change.

AB  - Objective Substance use disorders (SUDs) are stigmatized conditions in medicine, with negative attitudes toward patients with SUDs beginning to form in medical school. Only a few studies with small samples show that attending an Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meeting may help decrease addiction stigma. This study examined whether attending an AA meeting impacts medical student attitudes toward patients with SUDs and any gender and age group differences within these attitudes. Methods As part of their psychiatry clerkship, 138 third-year medical students attended an AA meeting and wrote reflection essays discussing expectations before the meeting, feelings while there, and thoughts on how these feelings might affect patient care. The authors performed a thematic analysis to identify themes andttests to compare theme frequency by gender and age group. Results A primary theme in student responses was a reduction in stigmatizing attitudes, which was broken down into three subthemes: complexity of addiction (46%), diversity of people with addiction (37%), and practical applications (66%). Practical applications comprised compassionate care (53%) and intention to address SUDs clinically (35%). While no gender differences were found in theme frequency, younger students showed significantly higher frequency of all themes. Conclusions Attending an AA meeting can challenge medical students' stigmatizing attitudes about addiction and increase flexibility of thinking. Younger students' biases may not be as solidified, stressing the importance of early exposure to patients in recovery during medical school. Attending an AA meeting and reflecting on the experience may be one way to decrease addiction stigma among medical students.

AB  - Objective: To explore the views of senior doctors on mental illness within the medical profession.
   Background: There has been increasing interest on the issue of doctors' mental health. However, there have been few qualitative studies on senior doctors' general attitude towards mental illness within the medical profession.
   Setting: Large North London teaching hospital.
   Participants: 13 hospital consultants and senior academic general practitioners.
   Methods: A qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews and reflective work. The outcome measures were the themes derived from the thematic framework approach to analysis.
   Results: Four main themes were identified. (1) 'Doctors' attitudes to mental illness'-doctors felt that there remained a significant stigma attached to suffering from a mental illness within the profession. (2) 'Barriers to seeking help'-doctors felt that there were numerous barriers to seeking help such as negative career implications, being perceived as weak, denial and fear of prejudice. (3) 'Support'-doctors felt that the use of support depended on certainty concerning confidentiality, which for occupational health was not thought to be guaranteed. Confiding in colleagues was rare except among close friends. Supervision for all doctors was raised. (4) 'General Medical Council (GMC) involvement'-doctors felt that uneasy referring colleagues to the GMC and the appraisal and revalidation process was thought not to be thorough enough in picking up doctors with a mental illness.
   Conclusions: Owing to the small size of this study, the conclusions are limited; however, if the findings are confirmed by larger studies, they suggest that greater efforts are needed to destigmatise mental illness in the profession and improve support for doctors. Additional research should be carried out into doctors' views on occupational health services in managing doctors with mental illness, the provision of supervision for all doctors and the effectiveness of the current appraisal and revalidation process at identifying doctors with a mental illness.

AB  - This paper examines employment-related gender discrimination during the initial stages of a hiring process. It specifically focuses on recent college graduates in China. By examining firms' responses to fictitious resumes with randomly generated information on gender and other key attributes of applicants (e.g., school reputation, student's academic achievement, and leadership experiences), this study is able to separate the effect of gender on a student's potential for getting an on-site interview from the confounding effects of other factors. The findings reveal that, with all other factors remaining constant, female applicants, on average, are less likely to be invited by hiring firms to on-site interviews as compared with their male counterparts. Furthermore, gender discrimination in computer and mathematics, architecture and engineering, and sales occupations appears to be driving the results of this study. The qualitative evidence based on interviews with firm recruiters suggests that the findings of this study are generally consistent with the role congruity theory of prejudice in psychology literature. While the finding that the quality of a job candidate (academic achievement and leadership experience) does not reduce gender discrimination offers some evidence to support a taste-based discrimination view, we do not have enough evidence to support a statistical discrimination view.

AB  - We integrated models of discrimination of immigrants by combining established approaches to prejudice and discrimination towards immigrants (proximate explanations) using assumptions of Evolutionary-Coalitional Theory (ultimate explanations). Based on this perspective, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and multicultural ideology (MCI) were considered as sociofunctional motives for attitudes towards immigrants. We examined relationships between individual differences in beliefs about the social world (dangerous worldview and competitive worldview) as more distal antecedents, and RWA, SDO, and MCI as more proximal antecedents, and the endorsement of discrimination of immigrants in the socioeconomic domain by Russian majority group members as the outcome. Data were collected among 576 participants from 33 regions in Russia, using online social media. MCI predicted endorsement of discrimination of immigrants by Russian majority group members better than did RWA and SDO. SDO predicted only economic aspects of the endorsement of discrimination. The results are discussed within the Russian context, with its ethnically diverse composition of the population and high migration rates.

AB  - The practice of the online learning system in Algeria is novel. However, with the spread of Covid 19, Algerian universities have been compelled to undertake remote and digital teaching. The University of Dr. MoulayTahar in Saida has arbitrarily hastened in implementing E-learning as an alternative teaching measure to maintain both positive educational outcomes and keep students safe and healthy. This research purports to examine how the University of Dr. MoulayTahar in Saida has used Moodle platform to facilitate the teaching process during the Covid 19. This paper, therefore, stresses the issues of distance e-learning that challenge both teachers and students alike. The researchers attempt to answer the following question: What are the affective attitudes of EFL students towards distance learning assisted with Moodle Platform during the Coronavirus? To supply an adequate answer to the raised question, the researchers have selected a sample of 157 participants. The researchers collected data through a questionnaire and delivered copies to the participants. The findings revealed that both the teachers and the learners were not well prepared for an online learning experience. That there are more disadvantages than advantages. The results of the research conveyed that the technical skills, the teachers' lack of experience as well as the social situation of the students have made E. learning a complex process. The analysis also revealed that Master students have negative attitudes towards e-learning, and they would prefer face-to-face interaction in the classroom and handouts more than virtual learning.

AB  - Public Significance Statement Mental health provider stigma and discrimination, including from clinical psychologists, detrimentally impacts people who experience mental distress. Recovery-oriented and service user-led teaching is key to countering stigma and discrimination, evidencing attitude change in clinical psychology students. It is time for clinical psychology to recognize the importance of contact-based and recovery-focused education in training for clinical psychologists.
   Stigma and discrimination from mental health professionals, including clinical psychologists, detrimentally impacts people who experience mental distress. Including service user-led teaching with an emphasis on recovery as part of the education and training of health professionals is key to countering healthcare provider stigma and discrimination. However, to date, service user-led and recovery-oriented teaching in clinical psychology is minimal, and robust methods such as control groups have not been used to evaluate this teaching. This study evaluated attitude change after service user-led teaching of mental health recovery in 142 postgraduate students in a prerequisite clinical psychology course at a university in New Zealand, compared with a control group of 126 students. Two-month follow-up data were available for 68 students who received the teaching and 62 in the control group. Compared with the control group, improved attitudes toward recovery and reductions in stigma were observed after the teaching to a moderate to large extent and were maintained after 2 months. Attitudes to recovery were improved in 79% of the tutorial group at posttest and 73% at follow-up, and 62% showed reductions in stigma after the teaching and 63% at follow-up. Statistically and practically important attitude change is possible in clinical psychology training, and it is critical that this sector of the mental health workforce enacts recovery-oriented training and practice as is mandated in policy around the world.

AB  - News use via social media has been linked to pro-democratic political behaviors. However, most people use social media for non-political purposes, like connecting with friends and browsing news feeds. Recent research indicates these behaviors may also have democratic benefits, by means of political expression in social media. Drawing on panel data from a nationally representative sample, this study extends this line of research by exploring how social interaction and news-seeking behaviors on social media lead to diverse networks, exposure to dissenting political opinion, and ultimately reconsidering and changing one's political views. Social media are a unique communication platform, and their attributes might influence exposure to political information. The tendency for users to build and maintain friend networks creates a potential deliberative space for political persuasion to take place. Consistent with prior literature, news use leads to political persuasion. More interestingly, apolitical, but social interactive uses of social media also lead to political persuasion. These relationships are partially mediated through network and discussion attributes.

AB  - It is impossible to consider the impact of anti-discrimination law on persons with mental disabilities without a full understanding of how sanism permeates all aspects of the legal system - judicial opinions, legislation, the role of lawyers, juror decision-making - and the entire fabric of society. For those unfamiliar with the term, I define "sanism" as an irrational prejudice of the same quality and character as other irrational prejudices that cause and are reflected in prevailing social attitudes of racism, sexism, homophobia, and ethnic bigotry,(1) that permeates all aspects of mental disability law and affects all participants in the mental disability law system: litigants, fact finders, counsel, and expert and lay witnesses.(2)
   Notwithstanding over two decades of anti-discrimination laws(3) and, in many jurisdictions, an impressive corpus of constitutional case law and state statutes,(4) the attitudes of judges, jurors and lawyers often reflect the same level of bigotry that defined this area of law half a century ago.(5) The reasons for this are complex and, to a great extent, flow from centuries of prejudice - often hidden prejudice, often socially acceptable prejudice(6) - that has persisted in spite of prophylactic legislative and judicial reforms, and - at least superficially - an apparent uptick in public awareness. I have railed multiple times about the "irrational," "corrosive", "malignant" and "ravaging" effects of sanism, but its "pernicious power" still poisons all of mental disability law.(7)
   The recently-ratified Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) is the most revolutionary international human rights document - ever - that applies to persons with disabilities. The Disability Convention furthers the human rights approach to disability and recognizes the right of people with disabilities to equality in most every aspect of life. It firmly endorses a social model of disability - a clear and direct repudiation of the medical model that traditionally was part-and-parcel of mental disability law. It calls for "respect for inherent dignity" and "non-discrimination." Subsequent articles declare "freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment," "freedom from exploitation, violence and abuse," and a right to protection of the "integrity of the person."
   In this paper, I consider the impact that the Convention is likely to have on sanism. First, I will briefly discuss both our sanist past and our sanist present. Then, I will consider how the CRPD has the greatest potential for combating sanism, and for changing social attitudes. In this latter inquiry, I will also draw on the tools of therapeutic jurisprudence. Then, I will offer some brief and modest conclusions.

AB  - Across 12 studies (N= 31,581), we examined how concerns about the rise of automation may be associated with attitudes toward immigrants. Studies 1a to 1g used archival data ranging from 1986 to 2017 across both the United States and Europe to demonstrate a robust association between concerns about automation and more negative attitudes toward immigrants. Studies 2a, 2b, 2c, and 3 employed both correlational and experimental methods to demonstrate that people's concerns about automation are linked to increased support for restrictive immigration policies. These studies show this association to be mediated by perceptions of both realistic and symbolic intergroup threat. Finally, Study 4 experimentally demonstrated that automation may lead to more discriminatory behavior toward immigrants in the context of layoffs. Together, these results suggest that concerns about automation correspond to perceptions of threat and competition with immigrants as well as consequent anti-immigration sentiment.

AB  - Background and ObjectivesPsychiatry residents provide care for individuals diagnosed with co-occurring mental illness and substance use disorders (SUDs). Small studies have shown that clinicians in general possess negative attitudes towards these dually diagnosed individuals. This is a serious concern, as clinicians' stigmatizing attitudes towards individuals with mental illnesses may have a particularly potent adverse impact on treatment. The goal of this study was to examine the attitudes of psychiatry residents towards individuals with diagnoses of schizophrenia, multiple SUDs, co-occurring schizophrenia and SUDs, and major depressive disorder.
   MethodsA questionnaire was sent to psychiatry residents (N=159) around the country. It was comprised of two sections: (i) demographic information, which included information about level of training; and (ii) the 11-item Medical Condition Regard Scale (MCRS) for individuals with the four different diagnoses.
   ResultsPsychiatry residents had more stigmatizing attitudes towards individuals with diagnoses of SUDs with and without schizophrenia than towards those individuals with diagnoses of schizophrenia or major depressive disorder alone. Senior residents possessed more negative attitudes towards individuals with SUDs than junior residents.
   Discussion and ConclusionsThe attitudes of psychiatry residents' towards individuals with SUDs with and without schizophrenia were negative and were worse among senior residents. There were many potential reasons for these findings, including repeat negative experiences in providing care for these individuals.
   Scientific SignificanceThe negative attitudes of psychiatry residents towards individuals with SUDs are worrisome. Future work is needed to better understand these attitudes and to develop interventions to improve them. (Am J Addict 2017;26:75-79)

AB  - After a decade of steady growth in the acceptance of the existence of climate change and its anthropogenic causes, opinions have polarized, with almost one third of Americans, mostly Republicans, denying that the climate is changing or that human activity is responsible. What causes Americans to change their minds on this issue? Using a large panel data set, we examined the impacts of direct experience with weather anomalies, ideology, relative prioritization of environmental conservation in comparison to economic development, and motivated reasoning that adjusts individual opinion to align with others who share one's party identification. A generalized ordered logit model confirmed the importance of political ideology, party identification, and relative concern about environmental conservation and economic development on attitude change. The effect of party identification strengthened with attentiveness to news and public affairs, consistent with the logic of motivated reasoning. Recent experience with hot summers, warm winters, droughts, and natural disasters had only a minimal impact on attitude change.

AB  - Introduction: People with disabilities often identify professionals' stigmatic views as significant barriers to accessing mainstream services. This study aimed to examine differences in stigmatic attitudes held by social workers toward individuals with intellectual disabilities ( ID), mental illness ( MI), or dual diagnosis ( DD) of ID and MI. Methods: One hundred and fifty-eight social workers responded to three versions of a structured questionnaire. Participants were provided, in random order, with vignettes describing an individual with ID, MI, and DD, after which they completed the Attribution Questionnaire. Results: Results revealed a significant effect of disability type, so that individuals with MI were perceived to be more responsible for their condition than were individuals with ID or DD. Individuals with MI and DD were perceived as more dangerous than those with ID, and social workers endorsed more coercive and segregating behaviors toward individuals with MI and DD than toward those with ID. No differences were found in helping and avoidant behaviors in relation to disability type, and correlations between stigma constructs were found across all three disabilities. Conclusions: Findings are discussed in light of social workers' obligation to assist individuals to realize their rights to full social and civil inclusion. Given these obligations, they are expected to set aside their personal views and provide help to all their clients regardless of their diagnosis.

AB  - Beliefs surrounding the practice of eating animals are widely held, and have been argued to constitute an ideology named carnism (Joy, 2009). We developed and validated the novel Carnism Inventory to measure two positively related components of carnistic beliefs: carnistic defense and carnistic domination. We anticipated that carnistic defense would legitimate the practice of eating animals, while carnistic domination would support the killing of animals for their meat. The Carnism Inventory showed the hypothesized two-dimensional structure as well as good internal consistencies and stability (N = 302, Study 1). We also demonstrated the convergent and discriminant validity of the Carnism Inventory (N = 781, Study 2a). As expected, carnistic defense predicted meat consumption, while carnistic domination was a significant predictor of having slaughtered an animal (N = 478, Study 2b). Both scales were significantly related to sociopolitical beliefs, including right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation, but only carnistic domination was related to symbolic racism and sexism (N = 373, Study 3). Taken together, our findings highlight the utility of the two-dimensional conceptualization and measurement of carnistic beliefs and offer new insights into one of the most common human behaviors: Eating animals is not only a gustatory behavior, as widely believed, but also an ideological one.

AB  - Participants read a crime news story featuring two perpetrators. Building on subjective group dynamics, we predicted that a perpetrator would be evaluated differently depending on the partner's ethnicity and participants' prior media use. Results show that heavy news consumers were more likely to (a) give a harsher sentence to a white perpetrator acting with a white (vs. Latino) partner, and (b) develop more negative attitudes toward Latinos when members of that group were portrayed in intergroup criminal partnerships. The implications of intergroup portrayals for perceptions of the ingroup, as well as the outgroup, and the moderating effects of news viewing on such effects, are discussed.

AB  - In order to bridge the psychological and physical divide between different groups, researchers have harnessed the positive elements of the Internet to improve intergroup contact. One new and effective Internet strategy is Electronic- or E-contact. Unlike other contact approaches, E-contact is an experimental intergroup intervention that uniquely accommodates Allport's contact theory and recategorisation processes, to create a structured, cooperative, synchronous and goal-directed online text interaction between members from different groups. E-contact has been found to successfully improve intergroup relations between Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland and Muslims and Catholics in Australia; and reduce bias against lesbian women and gay men, people with schizophrenia, Indigenous Australians, and transgender individuals. This paper discusses the unique engineering and advantages of E-contact interventions in comparison to existing contact strategies, identifies the theories that guide E-contact interventions, provides meta-analytic evidence of its effects, and discusses the strengths, limitations and future directions for E-contact research.

AB  - Customary international law as a source of general law is given a primary place in Article 38 of the ICJ Statute. However, it is historically a concept created by legal doctrine. The very idea of custom supposes legal persons are natural persons living in a dynamic, evolving community. This was the assumption of the historical school of law in the 19th century when the concept of custom was developed. Now the dominant notion of legal personality is the State as an impersonal corporation and international legal theory (Brierly and D'Amato) can see well that the death of the historical school of law has to mean the death of the concept of custom. What should replace it? Two steps need to be taken in sequence. Firstly, following the Swedish realist philosopher Haegerstrom, we have to ascertain the precise constellations of the conflictual attitudes the populations of States have to the patterns of normativity which they project onto international society. Secondly, we should follow the virtue ethics jurisprudence of Paul Ricoeur and others, who develop a theory of critical legal doctrinal judgement, along the classical lines of Aristotle and Confucius, to challenge and sort out the prejudices of peoples into some reasonable shape, whereby these can be encouraged to understand and respect one another.
   Then one will not have to endure so many silly interpretations of international law such as the one declaring that there are only rocks in the South China Sea and not islands. Such interpretations have nothing to do with the supposedly ordinary legal language analysis of a convention and the State practice surrounding it. They have to do entirely with a continued lack of respect by Western jurists for non-Western societies and nations.

(2012) Journal of Nursing Management similar to 20, 640-647 Staff attitudes towards older patients with cognitive impairment: need for improvements in acute care Aim To explore the attitudes held by staff working in acute care units towards patients aged 70 years or older with cognitive impairment, and to explore factors associated with negative attitudes. Background Hospital staff attitudes towards older patients with cognitive impairment are of concern as older people are the main hospital users, and because staff attitudes influence care quality and uptake of evidence-based care. Method A cross-sectional survey design was used to collect data from staff (n = 391). Results Staff attitudes were not explicitly negative. However, higher perceived strain in caring for older patients with cognitive impairment, higher perceived prevalence of these patients in the ward, being younger and working as an assistant nurse were associated with negative attitudes. A majority of staff reported that these patients received the best possible care, but few reported formally assessing cognitive status or working with evidence-based care protocols. Conclusion Staff characteristics associated with negative attitudes were described and staff perception that patients received best hospital care, despite limited cognitive assessments and care guidelines, indicate areas for improvement. Implications for nursing management Supporting young staff and assistant nurses, and implementing cognitive assessments and evidence-based guidelines can promote positive attitudes and best practice.

AB  - Stigmatizing attitudes towards mental illness can impede help-seeking and adversely affect treatment outcomes, especially if such attitudes are endorsed by medical personnel. In order to help identify targets for anti-stigma interventions, we comprehensively examined negative attitudes towards mental illness displayed by Sri Lankan doctors and medical students and compared these with equivalent UK and other international data.
   A self-report questionnaire originally developed in the UK was completed by medical students (n = 574) and doctors (n = 74) from a teaching hospital in Colombo. The questions assessed the presence and intensity of stigmatizing attitudes towards patients with schizophrenia, depression, panic disorder, dementia and drug and alcohol addiction.
   The study revealed higher levels of stigma towards patients with depression, alcohol and drug addiction in this Sri Lankan sample compared to UK data but attitudes towards schizophrenia were less stigmatized in Sri Lanka. Blaming attitudes were consistently high across diagnoses in the Sri Lankan sample. Sri Lankan medical students displayed more negative attitudes than doctors (P < 0.001). Overall stigma was greatest towards patients with drug addiction, followed by, alcohol addiction, schizophrenia, depression, panic disorder and dementia.
   Sri Lankan doctors and undergraduates endorse stigmatizing attitudes towards mental illnesses and are especially prone to see patients as blameworthy. As such attitudes are likely to affect the engagement of patients in treatment and specific interventions that modify negative attitudes towards people with mental illnesses are needed. Ensuring that medical students have contact with recovered patients in community psychiatry settings may be one way of decreasing stigmatizing attitudes.

AB  - Purpose - Prevalence of HIV/AIDS infection in the South African construction industry exceeds that of most other economic sectors. Voluntary counselling and testing is pivotal in combatting the spread of the disease. Little is known about the attitudinal fear of testing among construction workers, and the determinants thereof. The purpose of this paper is to address these shortcomings.
   Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual integrated model of fear of testing is proposed. Demographic characteristics and behavioural and cognitive factors are posited to explain attitudinal fear of testing. Regression analysis and structural equation modelling are used to test the model, using data gathered from 512 site-based participants in a questionnaire survey.
   Findings - Prejudice and lifestyle risk are the terminal predictors of fear of testing. Prejudice is determined by education level and HIV/AIDS transmission knowledge. Knowledge is predicted by education level and ethnicity. Lifestyle risk is determined by age, gender, harmful substance use, and knowledge. Harmful substance use is determined by age, gender, ethnicity, and employment type. The inter-relationship between knowledge about HIV/AIDS, prejudice towards HIV+ persons, and fear of testing is complex and nuanced.
   Practical implications - Intervention strategies by firms should positively address attitudinal fear of testing. Employers should ensure that effective communication is established with workers. Interventions relating to harmful substance use by employees need particular attention. Awareness campaigns should be sensitive to ethnic and cultural values, and to inter-generational differences.
   Originality/value - Harmful substance use and knowledge about HIV/AIDS transmission are indirect predictors of fear of testing. Education and ethnicity are critical dimensions of knowledge. The complex inter-relationship between knowledge, prejudice, lifestyle risk, and fear of testing is highlighted, providing guidelines for intervention management.

AB  - The Netflix documentary Making a Murderer made national headlines by chronicling the conflict between Steven Avery and the Manitowoc County legal system. After spending 18 years in prison for a wrongful conviction, Avery was arrested again and found guilty of the murder of Teresa Halbach. Due to the controversial nature of the case, and the popularity associated with the documentary, this event was used to evaluate several variables that may influence judgment on decisions of a defendant's guilt or innocence. Participants (N = 905) were recruited online via several social media platforms and included in the study if they acknowledged watching the documentary. They then completed an online survey containing questionnaires related to demographics (e.g., gender, ethnicity), perceptual (e.g., punitive attitudes), and psychosocial characteristics (e.g., posttraumatic stress symptom severity). The majority of participants rated both Avery and his nephew, Brendan Dassey, also convicted in association for the crime, as innocent. Female participants reported higher ratings of guilt than males. Lower ratings of guilt were associated with lower levels of socioeconomic status, greater religious involvement, higher posttraumatic stress symptoms, and greater negative attitudes toward the judicial system. Race and political beliefs were unrelated to ratings of guilt. These results support previous research suggesting psychological and demographic variables may influence jurors' judgments of guilt in murder trials. Implications concerning maintaining impartiality among jury peers and preventing implicit biases are discussed.

TI  - Pessimistic futures generation for pessimistic future generations? The youth has the future but the older has the authority
T2  - FUTURES
LA  - English
AB  - In this paper the German-Hungarian international representative comparative youth surveys have been used as basic reference points (15-24 years old youth, 1984/1985). The social changes in the last decade have had a dramatic effect on both the Hungarian and German societies, which are represented by university students' opinion as well (1985 2000). The civilization theory of Margaret Mead proved to be a useful principle in interpretation of the common European youth cultural style. At the radical social changes, common high pessimistic characteristics can be found in the relation of the future-orientation and generations' attitude scale of German and Hungarian youth. In the 10-15 year period after the political system change significant difference can be observed in the future-orientation of German and Hungarian youth attitude. In this paper we discuss in detail the connection between the pessimistic youth attitude and its effect on sustainable development. We argue that sustainable development can be imagined only if the optimistic youth attitude has effect on the negative demographical changes in Europe. Our goal was to discover new life sentiments which can be detected from the opinions of today's Hungarian youth. According to our hypothesis, young people experience the enlarging process of EU as peripheral participants representing that both the optimistic and pessimistic youth attitudes equally refuse to grow up more children in family, which suggest that the sustainable development is not in the focus of their future orientation.

AB  - Multiculturalism and polyculturalism are two lay theories of culture that have been associated with some similar intergroup attitudes and behaviors. But other than the studies of Rosenthal and Levy in the United States, there have been no studies that directly distinguish between these two lay theories. In this study, we use confirmatory factor analysis procedures to show that multiculturalism and polyculturalism represent two distinct latent constructs among our 1,730 participants in six Asian cultural groups (China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macau, Malaysia, the Philippines). Moreover, we show that essentializing race is associated with endorsement of multiculturalism (but not polyculturalism) in five cultural groups (except Hong Kong). The results provide strong cross-cultural empirical evidence for the distinction between the two lay theories and, more importantly, point to aspects of the lay theory of multiculturalism that relate to why it is sometimes associated with stronger stereotyping and prejudice toward minority cultural groups.

AB  - A brief intervention aimed at buttressing college freshmen's sense of social belonging in school was tested in a randomized controlled trial (N = 92), and its academic and health-related consequences over 3 years are reported. The intervention aimed to lessen psychological perceptions of threat on campus by framing social adversity as common and transient. It used subtle attitude-change strategies to lead participants to self-generate the intervention message. The intervention was expected to be particularly beneficial to African-American students (N = 49), a stereotyped and socially marginalized group in academics, and less so to European-American students (N = 43). Consistent with these expectations, over the 3-year observation period the intervention raised African Americans' grade-point average (GPA) relative to multiple control groups and halved the minority achievement gap. This performance boost was mediated by the effect of the intervention on subjective construal: It prevented students from seeing adversity on campus as an indictment of their belonging. Additionally, the intervention improved African Americans' self-reported health and well-being and reduced their reported number of doctor visits 3 years postintervention. Senior-year surveys indicated no awareness among participants of the intervention's impact. The results suggest that social belonging is a psychological lever where targeted intervention can have broad consequences that lessen inequalities in achievement and health.

AB  - Low-fit brand extensions, while often presenting profitable opportunities for existing brands, are known to meet with varying levels of consumer acceptance. This research identifies conditions in which low-fit extensions can succeed. Specifically, the authors show that the extent to which consumers consider the context in forming judgments (i.e., they are context dependent) determines their acceptance of low-fit extensions. Across four studies, the authors examine the combined effects of context (in)dependence and type of information. Context-dependent consumers form their evaluations on the basis of the type of brand extension information provided, such that providing benefit-based information enhances the evaluations of low-fit extensions, whereas providing attribute-based information leads to a reliance on extension fit and subsequent unfavorable evaluations of low fit extensions. In contrast, context-independent consumers are more likely to base their judgments on extension fit regardless of whether they receive attribute- or benefit-based information. Acceptance of high-fit extensions is unaffected by context (in)dependence and type of information. These findings provide a two-step strategy (i.e., sensitize consumers to context and providing benefit-based extension information) to managers for launching low-fit extensions and leveraging existing parent brand equity.

AB  - Transgender people suffer from others' negative attitudes in many situations. The university context is one environment where further progress has to be made to ensure the inclusion of transgender people. In this study, a sample of 376 undergraduate students was collected and their attitudes towards transgender people were analyzed. A comparison was made between number of years in university, and a sample from the general public. In addition, comparisons were made by gender, since the literature shows more negative attitudes toward transgender people in men than in women. The results show relatively positive attitudes toward transgender people among higher education students, but they have little knowledge of transgender identity. In turn, researchers found significant differences between different years in the university and between genders. These results support the need to expand knowledge about transgender people in the university environment.

AB  - There is an increasing focus on improving the pro-environmental attitudes, behaviour and habits of individuals, whether at home, in education, travelling, shopping or in the workplace. This article focuses on the workplace by conducting a multi-disciplinary literature review of research that has examined the influence of organization-based behaviour change initiatives. The review includes only research evidence that measured actual environmental performance (e.g. energy use) rather than solely using self-reported methods (e.g. questionnaires). The authors develop an 'employee pro-environmental behaviour' (e-PEB) framework, which contains individual, group, organizational and contextual factors that have predictive relevance across different behaviours and organizations. The review shows that the strongest predictors are environmental awareness, performance feedback, financial incentives, environmental infrastructure, management support and training. A key finding from this review is that attitude change is not necessarily a pre-requisite for behaviour change in the workplace. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment

AB  - Skin tone research often addresses the effects of skin tone on prejudice and discriminatory practices. Empirical research has persistently investigated skin tone and its effect on prejudice, discriminatory practices, and sentencing outcomes. Using college students as raters, the present study examined the relationship between skin tone, trustworthiness, and innocence. A total of 139 college students at a Southern University observed 417 photos of capital murderers of varying skin tones to determine whether they appeared to be trustworthy and innocent. The study results revealed that college student raters, regardless of race, were more likely to rate dark-skinned individuals higher on both the trustworthiness and innocence scales than light skin individuals. The current study demonstrated that college students, in comparison to other groups, may respond less negative to skin tone variations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This research aimed to quantitatively assess the general public's awareness, attitude and perception of polio and its vaccination in Peshawar KPK, Pakistan.
   METHODS: We conducted a survey-based study to understand the surge in polio cases from 2015 to 2019 in the Peshawar city of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), Pakistan. A pre-tested questionnaire-based study was conducted in 2019 to assess the attitude and general perception of residents of Peshawar KPK towards polio vaccination.
   RESULTS: Out of 241 country-wide polio cases, 63 (26.1%) polio cases were reported in Peshawar city from 2015-2019. The questionnaire revealed that individuals between 18-30 years of age had sufficient knowledge (65.1%) about polio. Male and female participants had equal awareness (similar to 43%). Participants with higher education (45.9%), those with better financial status (49.5%), individuals with children < 5 years of age (46.4%), and those who had experience of a polio patient (63.1%) had better knowledge. Participants inhabiting the central city were better aware (50.5%) of polio than individuals living in the outskirts.
   CONCLUSION: The data indicated that poor knowledge and negative attitudes of people towards polio vaccination are the main causes of the polio eradication program's failure. Moreover, religious beliefs, unchecked migration between the Pak-Afghan border, and lack of knowledge about polio vaccination are identified as critical barriers to polio eradication.

AB  - The rationale for this study was to contribute to the surprising paucity of research on the topic of shared housing among young adults and particularly the explanations and justifications involved in selecting new flatmates. The study aimed to develop greater understanding of the required discrimination involved in choosing acceptable people for the intimacy of shared living, which conflicts with current taboos against openly discussing prejudice. Data were drawn from interviews with experienced house sharers in New Zealand, recently involved in the selection of new housemates. The analysis examines how people with mental or substance abuse problems are discursively constructed as acceptable or unsuitable. Stigma, stereotyping, and discrimination were evident but rejection was framed in terms of safety, economic concerns, social harmony, and past bad experiences. Mental illness was acceptable providing it was unproblematic and invisible. While recreational soft drug use was condoned, hard drugs and frequent use were not.

AB  - Pain management is an important issue which impacts the prognosis of neonates in neonatal intensive care units. Evidence has shown that professionals' knowledge and attitudes regarding pain management can impact the quality of their practice. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of neonatal professionals regarding neonatal pain management. A cross-sectional study was performed involving neonatal physicians and nurses, using a research questionnaire to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of professionals as well as to assess their practice of pain management. Research found an apparent discrepancy between the knowledge levels of neonatologists and nurses regarding pain assessment and management, with nurses displaying weaker professional knowledge and more negative attitudes toward pain management than did neonatologists. Additionally, research revealed a lack of knowledge and negative attitudes among participants regarding the provision of sufficient opioid analgesics to sick infants during invasive procedures and even for dying neonates. There is an urgent need for continuing education regarding neonatal pain management with the goal of empowering neonatal professionals; further research is needed into the question of how to translate education into more reliable practice. Conclusion: This research provides useful information regarding the knowledge, attitudes, and clinical practice of neonatal pain management among neonatologists and nurses and points out some differences in the knowledge levels of these two groups.What is Known:center dot Neonates can perceive and respond to pain stimuli by showing their biological signals similarly to children and adults.center dot Untreated or insufficient pain management for high-risk neonates has short-term.negative effects and may also induce long-term negative effects.What is New:center dot The level of knowledge, the attitudes, and the practices regarding neonatal pain in intensive care are different among neonatal professionals.center dot There is an urgent need to provide interdisciplinary continuing education to improve the knowledge of neonatal professionals and encourage them to more highly prioritize neonatal pain management.

AB  - Recruiting and retaining nurses in mental health practice settings have long been problematic: A situation which is not helped by student nurses being exposed to negative attitudes about mental health nursing or poor clinical experiences. A pilot program in which student nurses were mentored on the mental health clinical placement was initiated at an Australian School of Nursing. A qualitative study was undertaken to explore the value of this program for the student mentee and the registered nurse mentor. A questionnaire containing six questions was distributed to all participants before and after the clinical experience. The questions were open format seeking data on (a) the perceived advantages or disadvantages of mentoring, (b) perceptions of whether mentoring contributes to professional development, and (c) whether mentoring contributes personally to the participant. The data were subjected to inductive thematic analysis. The registered nurse mentors found that time diverted from clients was a barrier to mentoring students; however, they experienced reciprocity through nurturance of self, students, and the profession. The student mentees found that they experienced a richer and deeper learning environment. Mentoring provides a satisfying learning environment for both parties if carefully implemented and supported.

AB  - Word embeddings provide quantitative representations of word semantics and the associations between word meanings in text data, including in large repositories in media and social media archives. This article introduces social psychologists to word embedding research via a consideration of bias analysis, a topic of central concern in the discipline. We explain how word embeddings are constructed and how they can be used to measure bias along bipolar dimensions that are comparable to semantic differential scales. We review recent studies that show how familiar social biases can be detected in embeddings and how these change over time and in conjunction with real-world discriminatory practices. The evidence suggests that embeddings yield valid and reliable estimates of bias and that they can identify subtle biases that may not be communicated explicitly. We argue that word embedding research can extend scholarship on prejudice and stereotyping, providing measures of the bias environment of human thought and action.

AB  - Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), its existence and treatment, is a contentious matter. The dominant view in medicine considers that ADHD is a psychiatric disorder. My position is to challenge this from a social relational orientation. I explore here a critique of the psychiatric disease model of causation and treatment, particularly the use of medication. A series of prejudices based on a political and social constructionist orientation are offered to address the ethics, politics and practice implications of the practitioner critical of the biomedical model of diagnosis and treatment especially the use of medication. This device is employed in order to invite critical reflection and further debate in a field dominated by the medical and genetic arguments in support of ADHD as a psychiatric disease. The implications of more open debate are explored, together with directions for more politically and ethically informed practice with children and their families.

AB  - Studies that focus on measurement invariance are of significant importance in proving the validation of high-stake tests, and in order to provide fairness from the results of these exams for special needs students. The aim of this study is to examine the measurement invariance of the "Central Examination for Secondary Education Institutions" in Turkey according to participant disability status. A focus group comprised of 369 visually impaired students was formed. An equal number of non-visually impaired peers were randomly selected as a reference group. Mantel-Haenszel, logistic regression, Breslow-Day, and standardization methods of classical test theory were used in order to detect items with differential item functioning (DIF). DIF analysis results proved that 16 (17.78%) of the 90 test items indicated DIF, and that ten of the DIF detected items (62.5%) represented a disadvantage for visually impaired participants. A total of 17 experts were consulted in order to investigate item bias. As a result of the collective expert opinion, five items were found to be "biased" in the Turkish (n = 1), English (n = 2), and in Science (n = 2) subtests. Close agreement was obtained between the experts that the "biased items" favored non-visually impaired participants. Use of visuals/graphics, complex/lengthy texts and response options, the need for rereading questions, and the negative attitudes of readers/coders were pointed out as sources of item bias.

AB  - This exploratory study examined changes in intergroup attitudes and interpersonal relationships between members of virtual groups from diverse and conflicting backgrounds in an intergroup contact program. Seventy-six students took part in a collaborative online course during one academic year connecting Jews and Arabs in Israel. They marked their perceived distance to their team members at the beginning and end of the course using the novel Team Circles tool. Initially both Arab and Jewish students felt closer to their in-group team members. However, perceived distances decreased significantly over time with Arab students reporting equal perceived distances to their in-group and out-group members after the course. The results from the Team Circles test were combined with repeated measures of intergroup attitudes using Implicit Association Tests. Although no significant changes in intergroup attitudes were observed, greater reduction in perceived distances to out-group team members resulted in lower levels of prejudice toward the out-group as a whole after the course.

AB  - Despite having outlawed the caste system and the concept of untouchability in 1947, caste identity remains a cornerstone of social, political and economic life in India. Like other social institutions, educational institutions are the reflection of caste prejudices and discrimination. The recent inclusion of lower castes through the reservation system (affirmative action) has changed the nature of higher education. Based on an ethnographic account of a university campus and students' perceptions about caste issues, the authors suggest that the structure of higher education in India is designed in a manner that exacerbates, instead of ameliorates, tensions of class and caste. Using Bourdieu's notion of cultural capital, the paper defines the existing campus culture as a 'caste culture'. The text concludes that elite institutions do not yet guarantee the capability to overcome existing caste prejudices and stereotypes, regardless of structural attempts at reform.

AB  - This paper investigates negative attitudes toward vaccines in Italy, where anti-vaccination movements have gained significant momentum in recent years. Considering the substantial health risk to herd immunity the issue poses, particularly after the sudden outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, it has become increasingly urgent to study the prevalence and diffusion of anti-vaccination beliefs. Using data from the 2016 European Social Survey's (ESS) country specific questions for Italy, the prevalence of anti-vaccination attitudes is examined along with how they are influenced by demographic, attitudinal and value-oriented determinants. The results show that 15 percent of the Italian public strictly hold negative views toward vaccination, and the prevalence of anti-vaccination attitudes is most commonly found among those who are less educated and aged between 25 and 34. While religiosity and political conservatism do not have an effect on antivaccination beliefs, our results indicate a strong positive link between anti-vaccination attitudes and distrust in the country's health-care systems and political institutions.

AB  - In producing arguments against minority groups that are designed to avoid accusations of prejudice, speakers routinely deploy two discursive strategies. One strategy of "inoculation" seeks to ward off such accusations, while the other strategy of "attention deflection" directs attention away from the potential target group. Where despite use of one or both strategies accusations arise, the result is a puzzle that needs to be resolved through explanation. Here, in a discourse analysis of online discussions as to whether "blacking up" is to count as racism, we see contributors contest (a) whether absence of intention to offend inoculates individuals from accountability for potentially racist actions, (b) whether "blacking up" depicts toys/characters rather than people, and (c) whether attempted explanations of accusations of racism work to resolve the apparent puzzle that has arisen. Contributors do not reach any consensus. These findings point to the difficulties in attempting to challenge potential racism.

AB  - Our goal was to investigate the relation between religiosity and oppression. We examined, in two multinational samples taken from pre-existing data, how national oppression - measured by an index of lack of liberty and by the number of refugees originating from the country - related to religiosity (e.g., belief in God, prayer frequency). We also examined how oppression related to authoritarianism and exclusivity, measures of conservatism often correlated with religiosity. Oppression's relation to religiosity depended on what was controlled in the analysis: without additional controls, the relation was modestly positive; when controlling for human development and other demographic variables, the relation was modestly negative. In a separate student sample, participants at an ethnoculturally heterogeneous urban college who were primed with questions measuring religiosity were less supportive of oppression and militarization than if unprimed or primed with questions measuring authoritarianism. These findings offer preliminary evidence that religion and oppression are potentially in tension with each other.

AB  - This study examined the effects of information technology (IT) on policy decision-making processes, especially in the stages of goal setting and choosing among policy alternatives. It used survey data collected in 1998 and 2005 from the metropolitan areas of Seoul and Busan in Korea. The survey results showed that there has been a positive change in the perception of the effects of IT on policy decision-making processes among government users. These changes could be made possible by strong leadership and e-government initiatives in central and metropolitan governments, not just due to the diffusion of technology and technologically capable staff members in organizations. The empirical results also showed that barriers to information sharing had increased in 2005 because of environmental changes, including requirement of authorization for providing information, complicated data management, and negative attitudes to information sharing. It suggests that city governments need to provide policy remedies for overcoming obstacles in information sharing in the areas of protection of privacy, network security, and official authorization processes for providing individual information. This study may contribute to the school of e-government and IT policy research as it helps decrease the gap between theory and practice.

AB  - Currently, during the pandemic, the forced transition to distance learning carries a number of problems. These problems affect various aspects of education, including the study of students' attitudes to distance learning. The purpose of this research is to study the features of the subjective attitude of schoolchildren and students to distance learning. This research involved 140 secondary school students (average age M = 10.7, SD = 7.2 (66.3% men)) and 30 university students (average age M = 22.5, SD = 2.4 (20% men)). The methods used were a questionnaire, Chi-square test and Criterion phi*. Fisher angular transformation. The study showed that schoolchildren do not intend to continue studying in the distance form if they choose, with a generally positive attitude towards distance learning. The self-assessment of motivation to study in a distance format has not changed, both among schoolchildren and students. Students are more likely to have a positive attitude to distance learning than schoolchildren. The variety of choices of advantages and disadvantages of distance learning is greater among students than among schoolchildren. The perspective of this study is thus to study the factors that determine the positive and negative attitudes to distance learning.

KW  - bilingualism
AB  - National language policy which is implemented from the top is perceived as official legislation designed to influence people's linguistic lives. In the Castilian-dominated Galician linguistic landscape, this paper examines the impact of last thirty years' top-down language policies on the "linguistic culture" (SCHIFFMAN, 1996) of the Galicians and analyses the role of grassroots level actors or agents who play a significant role in interpreting and implementing language policy on the ground. Linguistic culture, as Schiffman (2006, p. 112) describes it, is the "sum totality of ideas, values, beliefs, attitudes, prejudices, myths, religious strictures, and all the other cultural 'baggage' that speakers bring to their dealings with language from their culture". This will inevitably lead us to an examination of the essential macro level linguistic and non-linguistic variables such as socio-political, socioeconomic, socio-cultural, sociolinguistic factors present in the Galician society influencing the ideological construct and revitalisation practices of the community. Concurrently, this article offers a brief overview of the sociolinguistic history of Galician, as a means of contextualising existing debates related to language policies since the outset of the Galician Autonomy. It starts with a discussion on the significance of the 1983 Linguistic Normalisation Act, the immediate effects it had on Galician and on its public visibility which will be further related to the various understandings of notions such as linguistic normalisation and societal bilingualism which have been an integral part of LPP discourse over the course of last three decades. To conclude, the chapter will also offer a critical account of the recent developments in grassroots level Galician language activism such as the creation of Galician medium pre-primary immersion schools through co-operative mobilisations and crowd-sourcing; these schools came about as a reaction to the contemporary state-imposed language policies from the present centre-right wing government (2009-present).

AB  - A series of policy decisions beginning in 1965 produced an exclusionist climate in the United States. Lyndon Johnson sought to eliminate prejudice from the nation's immigration system but inadvertently curtailed opportunities for legal entry from Mexico that created a large undocumented population. In waging the Cold War, Ronald Reagan launched an intervention in Central America that displaced many more thousands who also became undocumented residents. The Wars on Crime and Drugs of Presidents Nixon and Reagan created a prison industrial complex that imprisoned blacks and Hispanics. George Bush's War on Terror unleashed a rising tide of deportations swept Latino migrants into the immigrant detention system. Finally, President Trump transformed a humanitarian problem affecting Central American families and children into a manufactured immigration crisis for the nation as a whole. The result is among the most repressive and exclusionist context of immigrant reception in American history.

AB  - There is increasing scientific and public support for the notion that some foods may be addictive, and that poor weight control and obesity may, for some people, stem from having a food addiction. However, it remains unclear how a food addiction model (FAM) explanation for obesity and weight control will affect weight stigma. In two experiments (N = 530 and N = 690), we tested the effect of a food addiction explanation for obesity and weight control on weight stigma. In Experiment 1, participants who received a FAM explanation for weight control and obesity reported lower weight stigma scores (e.g., less dislike of 'fat people', and lower personal willpower blame) than those receiving an explanation emphasizing diet and exercise (F-(4,F-525) = 7.675, p = 0.006; and F-(4,F-525) = 5.393, p = 0.021, respectively). In Experiment 2, there was a significant group difference for the dislike of 'fat people' stigma measure (F-(5,F-684) = 5.157, p = 0.006), but not for personal willpower weight stigma (F-(5,F-684) = 0.217, p = 0.81). Participants receiving the diet and exercise explanation had greater dislike of `fat people' than those in the FAM explanation and control group (p values < 0.05), with no difference between the FAM and control groups (p > 0.05). The FAM explanation for weight control and obesity did not increase weight stigma and resulted in lower stigma than the diet and exercise explanation that attributes obesity to personal control. The results highlight the importance of health messaging about the causes of obesity and the need for communications that do not exacerbate weight stigma.

AB  - This paper reflects on the concept of insecurity defined as 'the capacity to hurt'. It begins by considering asylum seekers and refugees as hyper-precarious groups that have experienced bodily, material and psychological 'hurt' in the UK. At the same time, the paper considers how these hyper-precarious groups are perceived to have the capacity to hurt (bodily, materially, psychologically and spatially) the majority population. Having drawn out two understandings of the capacity to hurt-both the ability to be or feel hurt and the act of hurting others, we argue that a shared recognition of what it means to feel hurt (co-suffering or suffering together)-albeit to very different extremes and with very different consequences-and an understanding of the processes which drive this might be mobilised politically to challenge the act of hurting others. In doing so, we argue for a group politics of compassion to respond to increasingly insecure times.

AB  - The exponential growth of communication facilities and social networks has been radically changing human habits and influencing the interaction processes, such as purchasing products, reading, knowing new friends, teaching and, more recently, voting in democratic elections or plebiscites. This scenario has led the society to concerns on increase in dishonest activities and spreading of lies and their consequent contribution to polarization of views, disharmony and prejudice. The first important case surfaced with the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal and there have since been many speculations about the influence of fake-news, transmitted through social networks in several elections, such as those in USA, Brazil and Nigeria. Consequently, checking the veracity of news propagated through social networks has become indispensable, and this responsibility must be borne by the social networks firms; accordingly, they have begun developing and operating rigorous electronic verifying algorithms. This is a microscopic approach toward the fake-news problem, and can be complemented with a macroscopic approach using some compartmental models that are commonly employed in epidemiology and rumor propagation. Specifically, the Daley-Kendall (DK) model, which appears to be a realistic compartmental model in rumor spreading and viral marketing, is suitable to describe fake-news propagation and can be equipped with a veracity checking compartment of population. In this study, the DK model is adopted to address the fake-news propagation problem, and the influence of the newly included veracity checking compartment on attenuating fake news is studied.

AB  - OBJECTIVE-We investigated the perceptions of diabetes care and diabetes in patients followed long-term by group or usual care.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-Three open questions were administered to 120 patients (43 with T1DM and 77 with T2DM) who had been randomized at least 2 years before to be followed by group care and 121 (41 T1DM and 80 T2DM) who had always been on usual care. The responses were analyzed by propositional analysis, by identifying the focal nuclei, i.e., the terms around which all sentences are organized, and then other predicates, according to their hierarchical relationship to the nuclear proposition. Specific communicative units were arbitrarily classified into three categories: attitudes, empowerment, and locus of control.
   RESULTS-Patients on group care showed more positive attitudes, higher sense of empowerment, and more internal locus of control than those on usual care. In addition, they expressed a wider and more articulated range of concepts associated with the care received and made less use of medical terminology (P < 0.001, all). Higher HbA(1c) was associated with negative attitudes (P = 0.025) and negative empowerment (P = 0.055).
   CONCLUSIONS-Group treatment reinforces communication and peer identification and may achieve its clinical results by promoting awareness, self-efficacy, positive attitudes toward diabetes and the setting of care, an internal locus of control, and, ultimately, empowerment in the patients.

AB  - The paper deals with the application of concept mapping in teaching mathematics at the primary level of education (ISCED 1), as well as the experimental verification of its qualitative contribution to the process of education. The authors present results obtained in a sample survey aimed at monitoring possibilities of influencing pupils' relationship to teaching and mastery of mathematics using digital concept maps within the process of pedagogical intervention. The authors tested the degree to which digital concept maps influence changes in the pupils' opinions and attitudes to mathematics (subject popularity, interest in the subject, easiness of understanding, fear and apprehension of mathematics) while explaining and fixating the curriculum of selected mathematics topics in the third grade of a primary school. The results of the experiment did not confirm that teaching supported by concept maps contributes to reducing pupils' negative attitudes towards subjects, particularly in mathematics at the primary level (ISCED 1). Due to the pedagogical intervention of concept mapping, no statistically significant changes occurred in the pupils' attitudes to the observed factors of mathematics. However, the authors have come up with research findings that may be notable in the field of branch didactics of mathematics and digital technologies.

AB  - The prevalence of companion animal caregiving was estimated, and demographic and psychosocial factors that predict sterilization behaviors in caregivers in Thailand were identified. Thai nationals (n = 494) were recruited by random for the Culture and Human-Animal Interactions (CHAI) telephone survey. The results showed 74% of respondents had a cat and/or a dog (60% dogs, 23% cats); 22% of dogs and 19% of cats were sterilized. Logistic Regression analyses revealed positive attitudes toward desexing, and the perception that important others would endorse this practice best predicted sterilization practices. For caregivers with unsterilized companions, Hierarchical Multiple Regression analyses revealed perceived capability to sterilize, positive attitudes toward desexing, and perceived normative pressure to sterilize accounted for 35% and 45% of the variance in intentions to sterilize dogs and cats, respectively. Culturally sensitive initiatives targeting negative attitudes, enhancing normative pressure, and increasing perceived personal agency to sterilize may improve sterilization rates in Thailand.

AB  - In the face of growing pressure placed on the natural environment, the study on which this article is based considered the effectiveness of interpretive provision in mitigating the harmful effects of tourism on the environment. The aim of this research was to determine whether guided or non-guided interpretation is most effective in reaching the stated goals of interpretation. The four key goals of interpretation, namely visitor satisfaction, knowledge gain, attitude change and modification of behaviour intent, were used in the assessment of the relative effectiveness of guided and non-guided interpretation in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Through comparing responses to questionnaires from post-visit samples and observing both guided and non-guided interpretation, the research found that guided interpretation was only marginally more effective in reaching the four key goals of interpretation than the non-guided interpretive media. Guided interpretation was found to be more effective in terms of visitor satisfaction, whilst guided and non-guided interpretation had only marginal differences in effectiveness in relation to knowledge gain, attitude change and intent to modify behaviour.

AB  - Background: Although the World Health Organization has called for mental health services to be integrated into primary care, mental health remains in most countries, and especially in low- and middle-income countries, one of the most neglected topics in the training curriculum of frontline health workers. As a result, primary healthcare professionals leave medical and nursing schools with insufficient knowledge, and often with negative attitudes towards mental disorders.
   Aim: We investigated the effect of a brief training intervention on schizophrenia and depression conducted among general practitioners and nurses in Armenia.
   Methods: Training interventions were one-day, face-to-face, interactive workshops, including didactic presentations and discussions of case studies. We used a quasi-experimental design of the before/after type, to compare data on knowledge, attitudes and practices collected before and after the training sessions.
   Results: Mean scores for knowledge, attitudes and practices increased significantly (p < 0.001) among both nurses and GPs for both schizophrenia (111 GPs and 167 nurses) and depression (459 GPs and 197 nurses).
   Conclusions: Our experience suggests that a brief training intervention can result in significant improvements in knowledge, attitudes and practices among primary healthcare workers and could help improve mental health services.

Tracing the discourses of religious and secular attitudes towards Jews, the piece shows how resilient certain stereotypes are, and how assumptions about citizenship continue to undermine the respect of difference in Italy. With a reflection that is meant to be personal and scholarly at the same time, this contribution has the aim of facilitating a broader reflection, that spans instances of anti-semitism among the anti-racist Left, the correlation between unresolved anti-Jewish prejudice and widespread racist, anti-immigrant discourses, the challenges of a politicised memorialisation of the Holocaust, and also the role Jewish communities may play in this unsettling context.

TI  - Assessment of the prevalence and factors influencing adherence to exclusive breast feeding among HIV positive mothers in selected health institution of Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
T2  - ETHIOPIAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH DEVELOPMENT
LA  - English
AB  - Background: Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) offers an affordable, culturally accepatable and effective means of reducing mother to child transmission of HIV while maintaining the bed-its of breastfeeding. Despite its benefits, the practice of EBF among HIV positive mothers is low in Ethiopia.
   Objective: This study is intended to assess factors influencing adherence to exclusively breast feeding among HIV positive mothers in selected health institutions of Addis Ababa.
   Methods: A facility based cross-sectional study design supplemented by a qualitative method was conducted among 384 HIV positive mothers drawn from purposively selected 3 hospitals and 10 health centers with ART and PMTCT service in Addis Ababa City from January 1 to February 30, 2012. Data were collected using a pre-tested structured questionnaire and entered into a computer and Analyzed using the SPSS software version 16.
   Results: The prevalence of EBF adherence and non-adherence were (73.0%) and (27.0%) respectively. Among mothers who did not adhere to EBF, the commonest reasons mentioned were family opposition and infant illness in 44.0% and 19.0% of mothers respectively. The major determinants identified were inadequate ANC follow up, negative attitude towards EBF and maternal illnesses. Accordingly mothers who attended more than or equal to four ANC follow-ups were 1.9 times more likely to adhere to EBF than those who attended less (AOR=1.04; 95% CI=1.04-3.4). Likewise, mothers who experienced illnesses were 74% less likely to adhere to EBF than those who had no illnesses (AOR=0.26; 95%CI; 0.13-0.53) and those mothers who had negative attitudes towards EBF were 68% less likely to adhere to EBF than their counterparts (AOR=0.32; 95%CI= 0.16-0.63).
   Conclusions: Although the majority of mothers adhered to EBF, still more actions that focus on the importance of ANC follow-up and strengthening of the mother support group in each health facility are necessary. Other important actions are to change the negative attitudes of mothers towards EBF through BCC and continuously advising them to get timely treatment whenever they experience illnesses.

TI  - A Wanderer in a Distant Place: Tibetan Exile Youth, Literacy, and Emotion
T2  - INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION
LA  - English
KW  - LANGUAGE
AB  - Among Tibetans living in exile in India, expressions of longing and sadness for family, friends and places in Tibet are not uniformly shared across members of the community. Time and distance have faded and idealized their homeland in the memories of long-term exiles. Yet, for a segment of this community called New Arrivals, who have only relatively recently left Tibet, people and places "back home" are real and immediate. The immediacy of these ties to Chinese Tibet, however, often engenders perceptions of New Arrivals as Sinicised, backward and uneducated. This paper focuses on these New Arrivals in the enclave of McLeod Ganj, India, home to the Tibetan exile government and approximately 7,000 Tibetan exiles. In this predominately Tibetan area, the division between long-term exiles and New Arrivals constitutes the dominant social boundary among McLeod Ganj Tibetans, a division that is most prominent among McLeod Ganj's Tibetan youth. Drawing from community discourses, social networks and practices, and educational institutions, I analyse everyday written forms (e.g., poetry, letters, diary entries) to suggest that through these writings, New Arrival youth are constituting and reconstructing their marginalized position within the community. In an exile community where resources are limited, improving the position of New Arrivals can be challenging. Here, I suggest two approaches to the difficulties these youth face. First, re-educating the larger Tibetan community in order to breakdown the prejudices that exist toward these new exiles. Second, refashioning the existing educational institutions for New Arrivals to better prepare them for employment in the Tibetan communities or elsewhere in India.

AB  - In the current work, we experimentally examined the effect of exposure to a narrative of nonviolent resistance on third-party attitudes toward and support for a disempowered group involved in asymmetric conflict. Across three experiments, we found that Americans exposed to a brief video about Palestinian nonviolent resistance consistently registered more favorable attitudes toward Palestinians than people who watched a film trailer either unrelated to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or a trailer to a Palestinian-made film about sympathetic Palestinians violently opposing Israelis. Americans' attitudes toward Palestinians and behavior supporting Palestinian collective action persisted weeks after exposure to nonviolent resistance and were mediated by decreased perceptions that Palestinians are inherently violent. Importantly, positive attitudes toward Palestinians did not result in increased negativity toward Israelis. These data show that exposure to nonviolent resistance can have lasting effects on third-party attitudes and behavior toward an underdog/disempowered group, without driving partisanship.

AB  - Background: People with Dementia (PwD) are frequently admitted to hospital settings. The lack of proper dementia knowledge, poor communication skills, negative attitudes toward dementia, and lack of confidence affects the quality of care, thus development of dementia trainings has increased. Nevertheless, literature regarding the effectiveness of training implementation is limited.
   Objective: The aim of this narrative synthesis is to 1) identify the characteristics of training programs and 2) explore the effectiveness of these training programs in everyday clinical practice.
   Methods: A systematic search in PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Cochrane was conducted, including qualitative and quantitative peer-reviewed studies. Holton's evaluation model with its three outcome levels (learning, individual performance, and organizational results) was adopted. 14 studies were included.
   Results: The synthesis of the results was divided into two parts: 1) to describe the characteristics and content of trainings 2) to evaluate the effectiveness of training programs according to the three outcome levels of Holton's model, taking into consideration its construct domains: ability, motivation, and environment. Learning outcomes were assessed in all selected studies: 13 studies observed changes in individual performance, four studies reported changes within the organizational level, and only five showed sustainable changes over time.
   Conclusion: Person-centered care (PCC) approaches, interactive and varied teaching methods, supporting conditions like champions, action plans, and setting care policies, are all characteristics of effective trainings. Successful programs should be sustainable over time, demonstrating positive outcomes across the organization. Based on current findings, there is a lack of adequate evaluation with regard to training programs on the organizational level.

TI  - Metacognition and Meta-Affect in Young Students: Does It Make a Difference in Mathematical Problem Solving?
T2  - TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA  - English
AB  - Mathematical problem solving is one of the most valuable aspects of mathematics education and the most difficult for elementary school students. Cognitive and metacognitive difficulties in this area cause students to develop negative attitudes and emotions as affective reactions, hampering their efforts and achievements. These metacognitive and meta-affective reactions are fundamental aspects of self-regulated learning (SRL), a non-innate process that requires systematic, explicit student training. This study investigated the impact of two self-regulation programs among young students (Grade 5)-metacognition (n = 64) and meta-affect (n = 54) versus a control group (n =53)-on enhancing achievements in mathematical verbal problem solving and a novel transfer task, as well as metacognitive and meta-affective regulation processes of a focus group during a thinking-aloud solution. Mixed methods indicate that students who participated in the metacognitive and meta-affective intervention programs presented similar but higher achievements than the control group. Additionally, during the thinking-aloud solution, students from each group broadly implemented the self-regulation processes they were trained in, while consistently referring to all the self-regulation phases. The current study makes an important contribution to practical implications for students with diverse abilities.

AB  - Mental illness is not uncommon among young adults, but negative attitudes towards mental disorders and lack of parental support might be associated with hesitancy in seeking professional help. This study aimed to examine the relationships of parental support, beliefs about mental illness, and mental help-seeking among young adults in Saudi Arabia. This quantitative cross-sectional study included a convenience sample of 236 young adults (ages 18-25) with the majority of the total (86.4%) being female. Data were collected via three self-administered questionnaires: The Perceived Parental Support Scale, Beliefs toward Mental Illness scale, and Mental Help Seeking Attitude Scale. Results indicated that the participants had a moderately negative attitude toward mental illness, a moderately positive attitude toward parental support, and a highly positive attitude toward mental help-seeking. No significant relationships were found among the study variables. The study highlights that despite young adults' positive attitude toward mental help-seeking and parental support, they have negative views toward people with mental illnesses. Educational programs in schools and media are needed to improve attitudes and enhance readiness to interact with people with mental illness.

AB  - Internalized homonegativity results from the acceptance of negative attitudes about one's same-sex orientation, which has negative consequences for the health of gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBM). We translated the 7-item Reactions to Homosexuality Scale (RHS) to Brazilian Portuguese and assessed its factor structure, validity and reliability. The first step included the translation, back-translation, evaluation, peer review, and pre-testing of the scale. Then, we piloted the scale in two convenience samples of adult Brazilians recruited online during October 2019 and February to March 2020 through advertisements on Grindr and Hornet, respectively. The largest sample was randomly split into two groups for exploratory factor analysis (EFA) then confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Criterion and construct validity were assessed via correlations between scale scores and study variables. A total of 5573 GBM (sample 1: 218; sample 2: 5355) completed the RHS. EFA (N = 2652) yielded two eigenvalues greater than one (Factor 1: 3.5 and Factor 2: 1.1). A one-factor solution provided the most interpretable model based on examination of scree plot and item factor loadings (chi 2(14) = 1373.1, p < 0.001; CFI = 0.89; TLI = 0.84; RMSEA = 0.19; SRMS = 0.09). Though one-factor CFA showed moderate fit, freeing errors terms to covary, based on item content and interpretation, significantly improved model fit (chi 2(12) = 309.1, p < .001; CFI = 0.97; TLI = 0.96; RMSEA = 0.09; SRMR = 0.02). As hypothesized, men who did not self-identify as gay (mean score 17.9 compared to those self-identifying as gay: 11.8) and men who reported no sex with men in the past 6 months (mean score 12.6 compared to those who reported sex with men: 10.6) scored higher reflecting higher internalized homonegativity. The RHS was effectively translated and validated in Brazilian Portuguese and can be used to evaluate the role of internalized homonegativity on GBM's health, as well as its impact on the uptake of HIV prevention technologies.

AB  - Background: Nodding Syndrome is a debilitating disorder of yet unknown etiology that has affected children and adolescents aged 3 - 18 years in parts of sub Saharan African countries including Uganda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Liberia.
   Objective: To identify stereotypes and negative attitudes held by primary care health workers about nodding syndrome.
   Method: Of one hundred health workers invited by the Uganda Ministry of Health for training on nodding syndrome from the three most affected districts of Pader, Lamwo and Kitgum forty were interviewed using a predesigned tool. Content and thematic analysis was applied.
   Results: There were 22 females. The median age was 33 years (range 23-54 years). The participants included Psychiatric Clinical Officers, Medical Clinical Officers, Laboratory Technicians, Midwives, Registered and Enrolled Nurses. Overall, four broad categories of negative stereotypes were identified; Nodding syndrome is 1) an incurable disease, 2) is associated with evil spirits and curses, 3) is disabling, making the patient a burden to society and 4) is a fatal illness.
   Conclusion: Primary health care workers who lead the care of patients with nodding syndrome have several negative stereotypes that may potentially impact negatively on the quality of care they provide.

AB  - Many social workers practice in settings serving people with mental illnesses, but social work education in the United States has given minimal attention to helping students understand the systemic nature of prejudice and discrimination experienced by this population. Some courses address prejudice (stigma) toward people with mental illnesses, but a critical consideration of systemic oppression appears to be lacking. We explain how an oppression framework used to understand the systemic nature of racism, sexism, and other forms of oppression is useful in illuminating experiences related to (perceived) mental health status. We offer suggestions for incorporating content into courses that focus on diversity and oppression with the goal of preparing students to engage in antioppressive practice with people who have mental illnesses.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neuroimaging studies have documented differences in neural responses to food cues in obese versus lean samples but little is known about weight status differences in responsiveness to other key features of obesogenic environments, particularly cues reflecting physical activity. To address this gap, patterns of activation related to visual depictions of sedentary activities and vigorous physical exercise were assessed in overweight (O-W) and average weight (A-W) samples via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).
   METHODS: Thirteen O-W and 13 A-W Chinese women were instructed to imagine engaging in 90 physical exercise activities and 90 sedentary activities and to watch 90 landscape images presented during three runs of an fMRI scan within a cross-sectional design.
   RESULTS: Behavioral results indicated O-W women endorsed more negative attitudes toward physical activity than A-W did. Imaging analyses indicated that body mass index had a significant negative association with activation of the right putamen and a positive correlation with activation in the right medial frontal gyrus, specifically Brodmann Area 10 in the exercise-sedentary image contrast condition. For the sedentary-control contrast, significantly less activation in an insula area related to negative affect was observed for the O-W group. Finally, for the exercise-control contrast, O-W women also displayed comparatively weaker activation in a cingulate gyrus area implicated in kinesthetic memory of body movements and the re-experiencing real events.
   CONCLUSION: Together, results supported contentions that exposure to depictions of physical exercise corresponds to reduced activation of reward centers and heightened activation in regions associated with negative affect regulation among O-W women compared with leaner peers.

AB  - Background: People who inject drugs have experienced stigma around the world. Stigma has been found to have negative consequences for individuals in relation to health-service use, psychological wellbeing and physical health; and for populations in terms of health inequalities. Indonesia has experienced a rapid growth in injecting drug use and HIV and little is known about drivers of HIV risk among Indonesian women who inject drugs. The purpose of this paper is to describe and consider the multiple impacts of stigmatization of injecting drug use on injecting behaviors among women who inject drugs in Java.
   Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 19 women who inject drugs in Java. Mean age was 25 years, all but one was employed or at college. The interviewers were Indonesian women.
   Result: Significant stigma around women's drug use was reported from multiple sources in Java including family, friends and health services, resulting in feelings of shame. To avoid this stigma, most of the study participants hid their drug use. They lived away from family and had few friends outside their drug-injecting circle, resulting in isolation from mainstream society and harm-reduction services. Sharing of injecting equipment was restricted to a small, closed circle of trusted friends, thus limiting possible HIV transmission to a small number of injectors.
   Conclusions: The stigmatization of drug use, particularly of drug use by women, in Indonesia appears to have contributed to significant shame, isolation from mainstream society and high rates of sharing injecting equipment with a small group of trusted friends (particularly the partner).

AB  - Based on comparative qualitative research in five local authority areas, this article argues that local context is key to understanding the roots of the U.K.'s crisis of political trust and the result of the 2016 E.U. referendum. The competing cultural and economic causes of discontent suggested by the literature were found to be deeply intertwined when analyzed from a local perspective. The sense of political disempowerment and negative attitudes toward migration were ingrained in and reinforced by locally specific socio-economic and political trajectories. These experiences were articulated and amplified by dominant discourses, which channeled frustration against the political elite and the E.U. These populist narratives, promoted by the Leave campaign and the tabloid press, became dominant in certain areas, decisively shaping citizens' voting behavior. Overall, the article highlights the value of studying how local experiences and interpretations mediate the interplay of cultural and economic causes of discontent and political distrust.

AB  - Introduction: The global human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic disproportionately affects sub-Saharan African countries, including Ethiopia. Provider-initiated HIV testing and counseling (PITC) is a tool to identify HIV-positive pregnant women and an effective treatment and prevention strategy. However, its success depends upon the willingness of pregnant women to accept HIV testing.
   Objectives: To describe the level of acceptance of PITC and associated factors among pregnant women attending 8 antenatal care clinics in Adama, Ethiopia.
   Methods: Trained nursing students and employees from an HIV clinic conducted face-to-face structured interviews in private offices at the clinics from August to September, 2016.
   Results: Among the 441 respondents, 309 (70.1%) accepted PITC. Women with more antenatal care visits (odds ratio [OR] = 2.59, 95% CI: 1.01-6.63), reported better quality of the PITC service (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.19-3.08), and higher level of knowledge on mother-to-child transmission (OR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.03-3.20), were more likely to accept PITC, while women who were older in age (OR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.19-0.74) and perceived negative attitudes from their partners toward HIV-positive results (OR = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.10-0.94) were less likely to accept the PITC service.
   Conclusion: About one-third of pregnant women are not willing to accept PITC. When designing intervention program to improve the acceptance of PITC, we should take into consideration the personal factors, HIV-related knowledge, and attitude of women as well as institutional factors.

AB  - Aims and method Schizophrenia is a psychotic disorder that is stereotypically stigmatised as untreatable and associated with violence. Several authorities have suggested that changing the name, for example to psychosis, would reduce such stigmatisation. We aimed to compare attitudes to schizophrenia and psychosis on Twitter to see if psychosis was associated with less negative attitudes. Tweets containing the terms 'schizophrenia', 'schizophrenic', 'psychosis' or 'psychotic' were collected on www.twittercom and were captured with NCapture. On NVivo, tweets were coded into categories based on user type, tweet content, attitude and stigma type by two independent raters. We compared the content and attitudes of tweets referring to schizophrenia/schizophrenic and psychosis/psychotic.
   Results A total of 1120 tweets referring to schizophrenia/schizophrenic and 1080 referring to psychosis/psychotic were identified over two 7-day periods; 424 original tweets for schizophrenia and 416 original tweets for psychosis were included in the analysis. Psychosis was significantly more commonly included in tweets expressing negative attitudes (n=131, 31.5%) than schizophrenia (n=41, 9.7%) (chi(2) = 237.03, P < 0.0001). Of the personal opinions or dyadic interactions, 125 (53.4%) in the psychosis data set were stigmatising, compared with 33 (24.6%) of those in the schizophrenia set (chi(2) = 44.65, P < 0.0001).
   Clinical implications The terms psychosis/psychotic are associated with a significantly higher number of tweets with negative content than schizophrenia/schizophrenic. Together with other evidence, this suggests that changing the name of schizophrenia to psychosis will not reduce negative attitudes toward the condition.

AB  - Domestic violence and refuge services in Australia
   In Australia and internationally, domestic violence is a major cause of homelessness for women and children and yet provision for accommodation for this user-group is not well documented or understood. When designing emergency accommodation, the concerns, preferences, and perspectives of individuals who access refuge services must be sought in order to create spaces that are conducive to the needs of this diverse and vulnerable group. An empathic 'lens' can provide meaningful insights that can inform the design of refuge services specifically targeted at addressing these needs. This paper describes an authentic interdisciplinary learning experience for nursing, architecture and landscape students at a university in Sydney, Australia, and presents the results of a study designed to measure the impact of this initiative on participants' empathy towards women and children who access refuge services as a result of homelessness and/or domestic violence. Empathy levels were measured using the Comprehensive State Empathy Scale, a validated measurement tool.
   An authentic interdisciplinary learning experience
   The learning experience consisted of collaborative meetings with stakeholders from the refuge sector, fieldwork, individual research, exchanging ideas and problem-solving in teams. Students then developed design guides for refuges that demonstrated their emerging understanding of the specific needs and perspectives of the issues faced by women and children who had experienced violence and found themselves homeless. Pre-post Comprehensive State Empathy Scale results indicated that the empathy levels of nursing and landscape students increased and those of architecture students decreased, however, these results were not statistically significant.
   Building empathy in teaching and learning
   The significance of the results from this study include an ability to compare the changes in empathy in students working collaboratively on a project and to ascertain possible reasons for this using a validated measurement tool. As empathy is one of the strongest negative correlates of prejudice, authentic teaching and learning activities, such as the one described in this paper, have the potential to positively impact the lived experience of women and children leaving situations of domestic violence.

AB  - Objective: HIV testing is necessary to curb the increasing epidemic. However, HIV-related stigma and perceptions of low likelihood of societal HIV testing may reduce testing rates. This study aimed to explore this association in South Africa, where HIV rates are extraordinarily high.
   Methods: Data were taken from the Soweto and Vulindlela, South African sites of Project Accept, a multinational HIV prevention trial. Self-reported HIV testing, stigma, and social norms items were used to study the relationship between HIV testing, stigma, and perceptions about societal testing rates. The stigma items were broken into 3 factors: negative attitudes, negative perceptions about people living with HIV, and perceptions of fair treatment for people living with HIV (equity).
   Results: Results from a univariate logistic regression suggest that history of HIV testing was associated with decreased negative attitudes about people living with HIV/AIDS, increased perceptions that people living with HIV/AIDS experience discrimination, and increased perceptions that people with HIV should be treated equitably. Results from a multivariate logistic regression confirm these effects and suggest that these differences vary according to sex and age. Compared with people who had never tested for HIV, those who had previously tested were more likely to believe that the majority of people have tested for HIV.
   Conclusions: Data suggest that interventions designed to increase HIV testing in South Africa should address stigma and perceptions of societal testing.

AB  - People often view certain ways of classifying people (e.g., by gender, race, or ethnicity) as reflecting real distinctions found in nature. Such categories are viewed as marking meaningful, fundamental, and informative differences between distinct kinds of people. This article examines the development of these essentialist intuitive theories of how the social world is structured, along with the developmental consequences of these beliefs. We first examine the processes that give rise to social essentialism, arguing that essentialism emerges as children actively attempt to make sense of their environment by relying on several basic representational and explanatory biases. These developmental processes give rise to the widespread emergence of social essentialist views in early childhood, but allow for vast variability across development and cultural contexts in the precise nature of these beliefs. We then examine what is known and still to be discovered about the implications of essentialism for stereotyping, inter-group interaction, and the development of social prejudice. We conclude with directions for future research, particularly on the theoretical payoff that could be gained by including more diverse samples of children in future developmental investigations.

AB  - Political confidence scores have been attributed to two sources: one structural, the other situational. To reverse a loss in political confidence, New Zealand chose a structural remedy and changed its electoral system to include the election of Members of Parliament on the basis of proportional representation. This paper examines the impact of electoral reform on confidence by tracking a panel of individuals surveyed before, during, and after the implementation of proportional representation. We employ a hybrid-effects model to explore the importance of electoral system change and find that both structural reform and situational factors orthogonally shaped political confidence. Interaction terms indicate that the influence of electoral reform is moderated by considerations of party control of government, ideological commitment, and perceptions of economic conditions. Opinion change over time is much more evident at the aggregate than at the individual level. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Infant feeding education forms a key element in undergraduate midwifery education in the UK. Students must be prepared to provide women with support and information to make appropriate health choices for themselves and their infants. However, student midwives may already have developed opinions about infant feeding prior to commencing a midwifery education programme. The education literature suggests that existing attitudes may present a barrier to learning for some students. This particularly applies to learning in relation to sensitive or emotionally laden subjects. A review of the literature was undertaken to identify potential teaching approaches which might help students to overcome barriers to learning. Following this the evidence was utilised at a UK university to develop activities which prepare student midwives for effective learning around infant feeding. Students enrolled in the midwifery education programme were introduced to a number of activities aimed at encouraging them to accommodate unfamiliar ideas or 'alien knowledge'. These included placing students in situations which challenged their ideas, as well as engaging in group discussions and reflective exercises. The impact of these educational interventions was identified through formative and summative assessment, and through evaluation of the teaching strategy at the end of the programme. This demonstrated that, amongst those students with previously negative attitudes towards infant feeding, there was a move towards more positive attitudes and a greater confidence in providing evidence based information to parents.

AB  - Background:
   Mass media depictions of people with mental illness have a strong influence on public attitudes, to the extent that changes in these depictions can reduce public stigmatization of people with such illness. Journalists' mental health may influence their depiction of those with mental illness, but little is known about this.
   Aims:
   To investigate mental illness among journalists in five key areas: (1) journalists' mental health status; (2) journalists' personal attitudes towards mental illness; (3) attitudes and support journalists expect or have experienced from colleagues when they have a mental health problem; (4) effect of journalism's professional culture on the course of mental illness; and (5) effect of journalism's professional culture on mass media depictions of people with mental illness.
   Methods:
   We performed a systematic screening of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library regarding the study aims.
   Results:
   We identified 19, 12, seven and four studies for aims 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. No articles were found for aim 5.
   Conclusions:
   The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among journalists is higher than that among the general population. Journalists have positive personal attitudes towards mental illness, but there are perceived workplace disincentives to disclose mental health problems.

AB  - Negative attitudes towards people with mental health disorders have been widely studied and identified in the general population, and even within health care professionals. Moreover, studies focused on service users have also identified mental health professionals, including psychiatrists, as a source of stigma. However, in Mexico and Latin America few studies have been conducted addressing this issue. To explore mental health service users' perceptions of stigma by members of the general population and by psychiatrists in Mexico, service users at a psychiatric hospital in Mexico were invited to participate in either focus groups or individual interviews, which were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. A total of 47 service users participated in this study. The results suggested that participants were not only aware of the possible consequences of mental health related stigma, but they have also experienced stigmatisation for having a mental illness. Participants also considered psychiatrists can hold negative attitudes towards people with mental illness, something that can represent a barrier for them to have optimal quality of care. Therefore, participants agreed that these attitudes should be addressed to improve the care they received from these professionals. This study suggests that, like members of the general population, psychiatrists are also considered as a source of stigma by people with mental illness in Mexico. These findings not only add to previous work conducted in Mexico and other countries, they also confirm the importance of addressing negative attitudes in this group of health professionals.

AB  - This qualitative study aimed to examine how abortion clients in Nigeria perceive abortion and explore the role their beliefs and fears play in their care-seeking experiences and interactions with providers. Abortion is severely legally restricted in Nigeria but remains common. We conducted in-depth interviews with 25 people who obtained abortion services through three distinct models of care. We coded interview transcripts and conducted thematic analysis. Clients perceived negative attitudes toward abortion in their communities, though clients' own beliefs were more nuanced. Clients recounted a range of fears, and nearly all mentioned worrying that they might die as a result of their abortion. Despite their concerns, clients relied on social networks and word-of-mouth recommendations to identify providers they perceived as trustworthy and safe. Kind and non-judgmental treatment, clear instructions, open communication, and reassurance of privacy and confidentiality by providers alleviated client fears and helped clients feel supported throughout their abortion process. Within restrictive contexts, the mobilization of information networks, provision of high-quality care through innovative models, and personalization of care to individual needs can assuage fears and contribute to reducing stigma and increasing access to safe abortion services.

AB  - In a world characterized by divisive rhetoric, heightened xenophobia, and other forms of prejudice, it is increasingly important to find effective ways of promoting functional intergroup relations. Research on the relationship between intergroup contact and individual differences substantially contributes to achieving this goal. We review research considering the role played by individual differences in moderating the relationship between contact and prejudice and predicting contact, but also as an outcome of contact. We then outline potential directions for future research, including identifying underlying mechanisms, examining the role of context at an intergroup and societal level, and considering how positive-negative contact asymmetry may be influenced by individual differences. We then call for a broader range of individual difference and contact outcomes to be explored and encourage utilization of new methodological advances in the study of intergroup contact.

KW  - EUROPE
AB  - How pervasive is labor market discrimination against immigrants and what options do policymakers and migrants have to reduce it? To answer these questions, we conducted a field experiment on employer discrimination in Sweden. Going beyond existing work, we test for a large range of applicant characteristics using a factorial design. We examine whether migrants can affect their employment chances by adopting citizenship, acquiring work experience, or signaling religious practice or whether fixed traits such as country of birth or gender are more consequential. We find little systematic evidence that immigrants can do much to reduce discrimination. Rather, ethnic hierarchies are critical: callback rates decline precipitously with the degree of ethno-cultural distance, leaving Iraqis and Somalis, especially if they are male, with much reduced employment chances. These findings highlight that immigrants have few tools at their disposal to escape ethnic penalties and that efforts to reduce discrimination must address employer prejudice.

AB  - In prior literature, intergroup contact has been associated with better attitudes toward outgroups, but intergroup anxiety mediates this relationship. Higher anxiety is associated with less-favorable outgroup attitudes. We hypothesized that this meditational association would be moderated by frequency of mindfulness and contemplative practices. Study 1 surveyed Christian, Hindu, and Muslim college students in India regarding their frequency of practices, intergroup contact, intergroup anxiety, and attitudes (i.e., favorability and trait ratings) about primary and secondary outgroups. Study 2 measured these same variables with White/European, African, and Hispanic American adults. The results showed that participants that reported higher intergroup anxiety reported more negative outgroup attitudes. This relationship, however, was moderated by mindfulness-type practices: among participants who frequently engaged in these practices, this association was reduced compared with those who reported little or no mindfulness-type practices. The findings suggest that mindfulness and contemplative practices may help people regulate feelings of intergroup anxiety, which may in turn reduce the likelihood that intergroup anxiety exacerbates negative attitudes toward outgroups.

AB  - The populations of many nations are aging rapidly. This trend is happening against a background of research indicating that ageism is the most commonly experienced form of prejudice. The present research used intergroup contact theory as a framework to explore young people's attitudes and behavioral intentions towards the elderly. Regression analyses confirmed that quality but not frequency of intergenerational contact was positively associated with young people's attitudes and behavioral intentions towards the elderly. These associations were mediated by intergroup anxiety, whereas aging anxiety did not have a mediational role. Discussion focuses on the importance of the findings for strategies aimed at tackling ageism.

AB  - Implementing an Emerging Technology (ET) is a difficult task due to people lacking ET-related knowledge and skills or having skeptical and negative attitudes towards the ET. As learners construct their understanding about an ET and develop related skills by actually passing through the ET Innovation Process (IP) stages (Awareness, Acceptance and Adoption), it could be useful to provide them with training that imitates certain IP stages. Using Artificial Intelligence Enhanced Robotics (AIER) as the example ET, we designed a two-day workshop to lead learners (n = 16) through the AIER IP Awareness stage, and a six-week training course with eight contact days to simulate the AIER IP Acceptance stage to learners (n = 10). Using online surveys and quantitative content analysis methods we confirmed that the workshop format increased the AIER-related self-confidence and general knowledge in 78% of participants, while the training course helped more than half of the participants to construct usable knowledge about a specific AIER and to see its possibilities in their specific work-place contexts. This paper is the pilot of using the Technology-Enhanced Learning Innovation Process (TELIP) model, first tested on a STEAM innovation, outside the educational context, for developing appropriate training approaches for specific ET IP stages.

AB  - We provide insights into pack composition and den site parameters of the Himalayan wolf Canis (lupus) himalayensis based on observations of free-ranging wolves in three study areas in Nepal. We combine this with a social survey of the local Buddhist communities regarding human-carnivore conflict, to draw inferences for conservation practice in the Nepalese Himalayas. We recorded eight wolf packs (with an average composition of two adults and three pups), and found five home sites in high-altitude shrubland patches within alpine grasslands at 4,270-4,940 m altitude. There was a spatial-temporal overlap of wolf home sites and livestock herding during spring and summer, which facilitated human-wolf conflict. The litters of three out of five wolf packs found in Dolpa during 2016 were killed by local people in the same year. In Nepal compensation is offered for depredation by snow leopards Panthera uncia, with associated lowering of negative attitudes, but not for depredation by wolves. We recommend the implementation of financial and educational conservation schemes for all conflict-causing carnivores across the Himalayan regions of Nepal.

AB  - Research has shown that women on average express more positive attitudes towards out-groups than men. We hypothesize that, because of differences in the social climate that this gender gap produces, people who spend more time in female-dominated groups are likely to develop more positive attitudes towards out-groups than people who spend more time in groups that are dominated by men. We corroborate our argument with evidence from two unique Swedish data sets. On the basis of the first data set, we show that students who attend female-dominated school classes are more tolerant of immigrants' rights than students attending male-dominated school classes. On the basis of the second data set, we show that adults who work at female-dominated workplaces are more tolerant of immigrants' rights than adults who work at male-dominated workplaces. Overall, our findings demonstrate that group gender composition is important for understanding the formation of attitudes towards out-groups.

AB  - Oral cancer is the sixth most common malignancy worldwide with more than 263,000 patients diagnosed in 2008. Nonspecialists' negative attitudes and poor working knowledge of oral cancer significantly contribute to suboptimal detection of early-stage disease which leads to delays in diagnosis. We aimed to assess the working knowledge and views associated with oral cancer prevention among medical students in Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey of 4th, 5th, and 6th year undergraduate medical students was undertaken. Questions included knowledge of oral cancer, risk factors, and opinions on oral cancer prevention. The overall response rate was 82 % (137/167). Mean score of cancer knowledge was 57.8 % which was below the expected standard of 70 %. Only 53 % correctly answered all questions related to oral cancer. This result had no association with either the academic year (p = 0.23) or gender (p = 0.37). Interestingly, 72 % of the respondents did not feel confident in performing an oral examination. Sixty-three percent of the medical students believed it to be beyond their role to aid patients in smoking cessation measures or to take part in other disease preventative strategies. This study demonstrates a dearth of knowledge relating to the diagnosis and management of oral cancer among clinical students within an established Saudi medical school. An immediate refinement of current medical curricula to address these deficiencies is warranted.

AB  - The efficacy of opioids for cancer pain has been proven and the World Health Organization (WHO) three-step ladder has been recommended for cancer pain relief. However, undertreatment of cancer pain has still been reported in Thailand. Identification of barriers to opioid use by the physicians and policy makers/regulators, and their level of knowledge and attitudes concerning its use are influential factors for cancer pain management (CPM). This study was performed to assess the knowledge and attitudes physicians and policy makers/regulators have regarding use of opioids for CPM. Barriers to opioid availability were also studied. A self-administered questionnaire was mailed to 300 physicians and distributed to 58 policy makers/regulators from September to October 2011. A total of 219 physicians and 47 policy makers/regulators completed the questionnaire. Of the physicians 62.1% had inadequate knowledge and 33.8% had negative attitudes. Physicians who did not know the WHO three-step ladder were more likely to have less knowledge than those having used the WHO three-step ladder (OR = 13.0, p < 0.001). Policy makers/regulators also had inadequate knowledge (74.5%) and negative attitudes (66.0%). Policy makers/regulators who never had CPM training were likely to have more negative attitudes than those having had training within less than one year (OR = 35.0, p = 0.005). Lack of training opportunities and periodic shortages of opioids were the greatest barriers to opioid availability for physicians and policy makers/regulators, respectively. The strengthening of ongoing educational programs regarding opioid use for CPM, and cooperation among key groups are needed.

AB  - This paper describes a novel concept of customer discrimination in the housing market, neighbor discrimination. We develop a matching model with ethnic externalities in which landlords differ in the number of apartments they own within the same building. Larger landlords are more likely to discriminate only if some tenants are prejudiced against the minority group. Observing that minority tenants are less likely than majority group tenants to live in a building with a single large landlord is thus evidence of neighbor discrimination. We show empirically that African immigrants in France are significantly less likely to live in a building owned by a single landlord. This increases the probability that African immigrants live in public housing in localities with more single-landlord private apartment blocks.

AB  - HIV discrimination has served as a barrier to addressing the HIV epidemic and providing effective HIV treatment and care. Measuring HIV discrimination, particularly covert HIV discrimination, has proven to be complex. Adapted from a previous scale, we developed a perpetuated HIV microaggressions scale to assess covert forms of discriminatory beliefs among HIV-negative/unknown HIV status individuals. Factor analysis resulted in three subscales, explaining 73.58% of the scale's variance. The new scale demonstrated both convergent validity (HIV prejudice, HIV stereotypes) and discriminant validity (alcohol use, depressive symptomology). Perpetuated HIV microaggressions were significantly associated with HIV conspiracy beliefs, HIV prejudice, and HIV stereotypes. This new scale can serve as an important tool in evaluating perpetuated HIV microaggressions among HIV-negative individuals.

AB  - This paper examines how digital technologies might be used to improve ethical attitudes towards nonhuman animals, by exploring the case study of nonhuman apes kept in modern zoos. The paper describes and employs a socio-ethical framework for undermining anti-ape prejudice advanced by philosopher Edouard Machery which draws on classic anti-racism strategies from the social sciences. We also discuss how digital technologies might be designed and deployed to enable and enhance rather than impede the three anti-prejudice strategies of contact and interaction, enlightenment, and individualization. In doing so, the paper illuminates the broad potential and limitations of digital technology to both harm and benefit animals via its effects on human ethical attitudes. This examination provides guidance for future projects and empirical work on using digital technologies to promote moral respect for a range of nonhuman animals in different settings.

AB  - In North Bihar, mud ensures prosperity for farmers, but also materially signals the lower status from which their wives try to raise the family, even at the cost of risking their own and their children's lives. This article provides a semiotic analysis of mud, an ambiguous material in its physical combination of land and water, a substance with specific gendered and class dimensions, and a symbolic marker whose presence on bodies indexes their socio-political identity. The sensuous relationships that revolve around mud and the prejudices it indexes illuminate meanings of dirt within processes of environmental knowledge and risk. By attending to the semiotic processes through which we understand nature, this article suggests that mud naturalizes the discrimination at the origin of dirtiness. Historical and political circumstances, such as the progressive loosening of the links between caste and occupation, show that mud is not dirt, but it becomes dirt when other kinds of dirt lose their meaning.

AB  - Purpose: This study investigated changes in attitudes toward marriage and childbearing assuming a BRCA1/2 mutation carrier status among healthy, unmarried individuals in Korea.
   Methods: A nationally representative sample of healthy, unmarried individuals aged 20-39 years was surveyed. A questionnaire on marriage and childbearing intentions was administered to the participants before and after providing them with information on BRCA1/2 mutation carriers' breast and ovarian cancer risks and their autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The participants were asked about their attitudes toward childbearing through preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD).
   Results: Of the participants who initially wanted to marry, the assumption that they or their partners had BRCA1/2 mutation caused 25.3% to no longer want to get married and 36.2% to change their attitude from wanting to bear children to no longer wanting them. Females were more likely than males to change their attitudes toward marriage and childbearing. The participants who had negative attitudes toward genetic testing were more likely to change their attitudes regarding marriage and childbearing than those who were favorable toward both disclosure and testing. More than 50% of the participants who did not want children were willing to bear children through PGD when it was assumed that they were BRCA mutation carriers.
   Conclusion: On the assumption of being carriers, general, young, and healthy females were more likely than males to negatively change their attitudes toward marriage and childbearing. Public education on the implications of living with mutation carriers and reproductive options may be required.

AB  - The Zero Tolerance for Barbaric Cultural Practices Act (2015) targets immigrants suspected of engaging in polygamy. While polygamy is already illegal in Canada and non-immigrant polygamous arrangements exist within Canadian borders, the framing of polygamy as a foreign practice portrays this familial arrangement as a threat to Canadian national values. Effects on women and children have traditionally provided a convincing argument for state regulation of polygamy; however, the combination of state underand overenforcement suggests that relying solely on a harm framework inadequately captures the complexities of state treatment. In this paper, I argue that the state's primary motivations for defending monogamy are not necessarily rooted in the avoidance of harm but in the preservation of a particular type of citizenship.
   Resume La Loi sur la tolerance zero face aux pratiques culturelles barbares (2015) cible les immigrants soupconnes de pratiquer la polygamie. Alors que la polygamie constitue deja une pratique illegale au Canada et que des arrangements polygames visant des non-immigrants existent a l'interieur des frontieres canadiennes, l'encadrement de la polygamie en tant que pratique etrangere depeint cet arrangement familial comme une menace aux valeurs nationales canadiennes. Les effets sur les femmes et les enfants ont fourni un argument convaincant en faveur d'une reglementation de la polygamie par l'Etat ; toutefois, la combinaison d'une application de la loi, << insuffisante >> d'une part et << excessive >> de l'autre, suggere que le fait de miser uniquement sur un argument de prejudice cerne de facon insuffisante les complexites du traitement de l'Etat. Dans cet article, j'avance que les motivations premieres de l'Etat pour la defense de la monogamie n'ont pas necessairement pour fondement d'eviter tout prejudice, mais la preservation d'un type particulier de citoyennete.

AB  - Objective: to understand healthcare experiences from the perspective of women who are or were pregnant while in homelessness. Methods: qualitative study based on Heideg-gerian phenomenology adapted to the field of health. There were ten participants. The technique of phenomenological interview and a semi-structured instrument were used. The comprehensive analysis methodically followed the stages of phenomenological reduction, construction, and destruc-tion. Results: the existence of pregnant homeless women represents difficulties, discrimination, violence, prejudice, racism, and vulnerability. It is a violation of human dignity, revealing specificities and nuances of the triad women-ma-ternity-street. Conclusion: the research made it possible to understand that healthcare, from the perspective of women who are pregnant while homeless, offers risks both to the mother and to the child. Both the self-care and the healthca-re offered by health workers and services is precarious and has weaknesses, being different from any type of care that could be understood as solicitous, zealous, and concerned.

AB  - Science museums can be excellent learning environments for engaging citizens in the complex societal issues of our timesuch as climate change, fishery collapse, social prejudice, and wealth inequitiesby fostering experimentation and metacognition about visitors' own social behaviors. The authors studied a low-cost metacognitive toolQuestion Askingin exhibit labels through a within-subjects, quasi-experimental research design with 59 randomly selected adult and teen dyads. Results indicated that the inclusion of an exhibit-specific question increased the proportion of time visitors spent in metacognitive conversations by at least a factor of three. Following that specific question with a more generally applicable real-world question maintained the already elevated proportion of time spent in metacognitive talk but did not boost that proportion further. The authors recommend including an exhibit-specific question at social science exhibits (and potentially adding another, broader real-world question as well) to prompt or enhance users' metacognitive responses to exhibit content.

AB  - Article 531 of the Turkish Commercial Code grants the right to request corporate dissolution for just causes to shareholders representing at least 10% of the capital in joint stock companies, and 5% in publicly traded companies. In addition to dissolution, the court can order purchase of the claimant's shares at real value (buy-out remedy) or adopt a different solution. This article conducts an economic analysis of the buy-out remedy against minority oppression and compares Turkish law with Swiss and English legislation. The buy-out remedy is supposed to provide an ex post control on the controller's conduct, and it is expected to function as a put option conditional upon oppression. However, the current provision does not provide the expected incentives. Addressing this issue, I suggest that: (1) the relief sought by the claimant should be taken into account; (2) the purchaser of the claimant's shares should be the oppressive controller, rather than the company in question; (3) the standard of 'just cause' to be proven should not be equal for each remedy, and thus, the courts should be able to give a buy-out order even if the facts do not justify corporate dissolution; (4) dissolution orders should not be given in cases where there is a going-concern value to protect; and finally, (5) the valuation of the claimant's shares should, in principle, be made on a going concern and pro rata basis, and any depreciation of the claimant's shares due to the controller's abusive conducts should be taken into account.

AB  - The literature on intergroup contact has mainly focused on how the majority group members reduce negative stereotypes and prejudice toward minority groups, also exploring the dynamics of intergroup contact in Western countries. The purpose of this study is to explore the dynamics of intergroup contact and interactions from the perspective of Western immigrants, and to understand how they interact with host individuals in South Korea. Using a constructivist grounded theory, three themes were identified associated with intergroup contact: (a) experiencing cultural growth and cultural conflicts, (b) reducing ethnocentric behaviors, and (c) experiencing cultural distance and boundaries. This study suggests that participants experienced the dynamics of intergroup contact with the host individuals.

AB  - The political divide between liberals and conservatives has become quite large and stable, and there appear to be many reasons for disagreements on a wide range of issues. The current research sought to explain these divides and to extend the Uncertainty-Threat Model to intergroup relations, which predicts that more dispositional, perceived-threat and uncertainty-avoidance will be related to more political conservatism. Given that conservatism is also often related to more negativity to low-status groups such as immigrants, the relationship between political ideology and negative attitudes toward immigrants may be mediated by more threat and uncertainty-avoidance. Study 1 tested this mediational hypothesis in a correlational design and showed that both uncertainty-avoidance and perceived realistic and symbolic threat significantly mediated the relationship between political ideology and attitudes toward immigrants, and that perceived threat was the more influential mediator. Study 2 extended threat management to perceived threats from unspecified outgroups, as opposed to the immigrant outgroup, and it replicated all significant mediations. Study 3 replicated the mediations observed in Studies 1 and 2 for political ideology to attitudes toward immigrants with uncertainty-avoidance and perceived threat from immigrants as mediators; it further replicated the mediations to the negative attitudes measure that had been used in Study 2 and it extended it to an objective and indirect bias measure [i.e., Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP)]. Overall, almost all of the results supported the idea that perceived threat and uncertainty-avoidance both mediate the relationship between political ideology and attitudes toward immigrants, and that threat management, as opposed to negativity bias, may be a central concern separating liberals and conservatives. Within all three studies, we also observed more evidence for the Uncertainty-Threat Model predictions than we did for the alternative Extremity Hypothesis, which predicted a quadratic relationship between political ideology and threat and uncertainty, and between political ideology and attitudes toward immigrants.

AB  - Until 2030, the United Nations' (UN) agenda for sustainable development (SD) comprises of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) each one of which includes the environment, economy and society dimension of SD. This paper aims to better depict SDGs' targeting to the communication and awareness of SD to the public. Network analysis techniques were used to streamline the UN diagram of SDGs by linking each one of them to the classic three-pillar Venn diagram of SD, according to the public's understanding. The UN's description of SDGs seems to be clearly multidimensional in these three pillars, as the public rated them almost the same. SDG agenda has fulfilled its good communication goal. But was revealed that a simple form of SDG diagram like the Venn diagram of three pillars of SD could help to deeper understanding and changing attitudes of SDGs. Thus, the SDG agenda is communicative for the public in wording, but a better communication diagram is a necessity for the future of SD implementation to various stakeholders.

AB  - Implicit theories structure the way people understand and respond to various human actions. Typically, people believe attributes are either fixed (entitists) or malleable (incrementalists). The present study aimed to examine (a) whether attitudes toward sexual offenders differ depending upon one's implicit theory about human nature and sexual offenders, and (b) whether implicit theories are associated with judgments made about different types of child abusers. A sample of 252 community participants was recruited. Their attitudes, implicit theories, and political orientation were assessed via self-report. One of three vignettes describing an incidence of child sexual abuse was then presented. The cases were identical except the perpetrator was either an adult male, an adult female, or a male juvenile. Participants then made judgments about the offender's deserved sentence and moral character. Entitists (across both domains) held more negative attitudes than incrementalists, although the magnitude of the difference was greatest when examining implicit theories about sexual offenders. Compared with those with an incremental theory of sexual offenders, entity theorists judged sexual offending to be more (a) indicative of the perpetrator's moral character and (b) deserving of punishment. However, scores were greater toward the adult male relative to the adult female and juvenile. The findings suggest that implicit theories about sexual offenders are domain specific. They also indicate that judgments made by those with an entity theory (about sexual offenders) are affected by whether a case is representative of a stereotypical sexual offender. Implications of the findings are discussed, along with limitations and future research.

AB  - Following the American Civil War, a Dutch-American immigrant soldier returned to his home in Holland, Michigan, with a freed slave whom he had adopted. The adopted child, named Siras, was then raised in a Dutch immigrant household where he learned the Dutch language and the tenets of Dutch Calvinism. Although Siras was clearly well regarded by locals, he could not escape the racial stereotypes and prejudices of the Midwest and spent his entire adult life working as a hotel porter. Siras remained the only black man among the Dutch and a challenge for what it meant to be both Dutch and American. A micro-history of Siras, rooted in primary sources, sheds light on a larger discourse of Dutch-American ethnic and national identity. Dutch American immigrants of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries generally avoided contact with blacks, expressed implicit racial superiority, and defined themselves in reference to black as an 'other'.

AB  - Non-autistic adults often hold explicit and implicit biases toward autism that contribute to personal and professional challenges for autistic people. Although previous research indicates that non-autistic adults with higher autism knowledge and familiarity express more inclusionary attitudes, it remains unclear whether training programs designed to promote autism acceptance and understanding affect subsequent implicit and explicit biases toward autism. In this study, non-autistic adults (N = 238) completed an autism acceptance training featuring factual information and engaging first-person narratives, a general mental health training not mentioning autism, or a no-training control, then responded to surveys assessing their autism knowledge, stigma, and impressions of autistic adults, and completed a novel implicit association task about autism. Non-autistic adults in the autism acceptance training condition reported more positive impressions of autistic adults, demonstrated fewer misconceptions and lower stigma about autism, endorsed higher expectations of autistic abilities, and expressed greater social interest in hypothetical and real autistic people. However, training had no effect on implicit biases, with non-autistic adults associating autism-related labels with unpleasant personal attributes regardless of training condition. These findings suggest that the autism acceptance training program in this study, designed to increase autism knowledge and familiarity among non-autistic people, holds promise for reducing explicit but not implicit biases toward autism.
   Lay abstract
   Autistic adults face prejudice from non-autistic people. They are often judged unfairly and left out of social activities because of their differences. This can make it difficult for autistic people to make friends and find jobs. Some training programs have tried to teach autistic people to act more like non-autistic people to help them gain acceptance. Fewer have focused on teaching non-autistic people how to be more autism friendly. In this study, we used a short training video that teaches people about autism. The video was created with the help of autistic adults and included clips of real autistic people. We found that non-autistic people who watched this video had better knowledge about autism and showed more autism-friendly attitudes than those who watched a video about mental health or those who did not watch any video. They were more open to having a relationship with an autistic person and had more positive beliefs about autism. However, our video did not affect people's unconscious attitudes about autism. People in our study connected autism with unpleasant traits, even if they had watched the autism training video. This suggests that teaching non-autistic people about autism may promote more autism-friendly attitudes, but some beliefs may be harder to change.

AB  - BackgroundSkeletal dysplasias are rare disorders often leading to severe short stature. This study aimed to gain new comprehensive information about functioning and equality in people affected by skeletal dysplasia compared to matched controls without skeletal dysplasia.MethodsFunctioning was assessed by questionnaire, which was formed by operationalizing International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) core set's categories into the items according to the ICF linking rules, using primarily Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System PROMIS (R) - items.ResultsAltogether 80 subjects with skeletal dysplasia and 55 age-, gender- and place of residence -matched controls participated. People with skeletal dysplasia experienced more pain (p<0.001) and the pain interfered more their daily lives (p=0.037) compared to the controls. They had more problems related to musculoskeletal functions and exercise tolerance, difficulties in mobility, used more assistive products and technology and were more affected by climate and seasonal changes (p<0.001). They met challenges in self-care, acquisition of goods and services and household tasks (p<0.001) and in participating in close social relationships, leisure time activities (p<0.001) and associations and organizational services (p=0.007). They felt less satisfied with remunerative work (p=0.003), felt more inequality (p=0.008), met more negative attitudes of others (p<0.001) and felt having less support given by family and friends (p=0.022). They used more social and health services and experienced more dissatisfaction with those.ConclusionsOur study indicates that skeletal dysplasias restrict functioning extensively and significantly affect daily living. By building accessible environment and improving equal services, functioning could be improved.

AB  - Knowledge about aging (KA) and empathy affect nursing students' attitudes toward older adults. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon from an integrated, person-centered perspective. The purposes of the present study were (1) to identify empathy profiles based on the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) among Chinese nursing students and (2) to explore whether these latent empathy profiles moderate the association between KA and attitudes toward older people. A cross-sectional survey design was used, and a battery of questionnaires - including those on demographic information, the Chinese version of Palmore's Facts on Aging Quiz (C-FAQ), the Chinese version of Kogan's Attitude Toward Older People Scale (C-KAOP), and the IRI - was filled in by 622 Chinese nursing students (M-age 21.76; SD = 1.33). The mean total scores on KAOP and C-FAQ were 164.96 +/- 18.32 and 10.436 +/- 3.015, respectively, indicating relatively positive attitudes toward older people but low KA among Chinese nursing students. Latent profile analysis was used to identify a three-profile solution characterized by distinct levels of four dimensions of empathy, namely average empathy (AE, n = 399), high empathy (HE, n = 42), and low empathy (LE, n = 181). Subsequent linear regression analysis revealed that the LE rather than the HE profile predicted positive attitudes toward older adults. It is worth noting that the LE profile played a remarkable moderating role in associations between KA and negative attitudes toward older adults after controlling for covariant variables. Both the identification of distinct empathy profiles and the interplay between the LE profile and KA are of significance in reducing negative attitudes toward older adults among Chinese nursing students. Nursing educators should combine improving nursing students' levels of KA and fostering greater empathy to reduce negative attitudes toward older adults. Such training should give priority to nursing students with LE.</p>

AB  - The literature regarding mixed-orientation relationships (MORs) focuses on individual and relationship aspects. Our study, informed by the social construction of reality theory, illuminates social aspects by examining social attitudes toward MORs as they are experienced and perceived by individuals of MOR. Within the scope of this study, we focused on self-identified non-straight men (gays, bisexuals, or men who have sex with men) who are in a relationship with self-identified straight women. Based on the phenomenological paradigm, we conducted 38 interviews with men and eight with women currently in MOR. The findings show that individuals of MOR primarily encounter negative attitudes from people in society regarding themselves and the nature of their relationship. Participants perceived that others viewed their relationships in terms of conflict, impossibility, or transitional stage. Social attitudes individuals of MOR encounter affect the degree of closeness of these couples to others in their social environment, resulting in constant tension between the participants' desire to be open to and close to others and the need to conceal and keep a distance. We argue that the dialectical tensions between disclosure-concealment and autonomy-closeness are related to the marginalization of these couples as a social category.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to discuss how social psychology might go about studying social hostility in public life that goes beyond mere disagreement on political matters. The paper addresses the case of online misogyny against women active in public life. In the context of a profound coarsening of political debate in Britain and elsewhere, women who are active in public life come regularly up against a barrage of abuse and intimidation online. The paper argues that manifestations of misogyny cross ideological lines and takes an array of forms. Misogyny is a specific class of prejudice that harms the dignity of women by calling into question women's (human) rights to participation in public life, freedom of expression, and personal safety. In order to fully understand the intricacies of online misogyny, social psychologists need to draw upon more directly on communications and media theories of mediated communication and connective action.

AB  - A brief mindfulness intervention diminished bias in favor of one's in-group and against one's out-group. In the linguistic intergroup bias (LIB), individuals expect in-group members to behave positively and out-group members to behave negatively. Consequently, individuals choose abstract language beset with character inferences to describe these expected behaviors, and in contrast, choose concrete, objective language to describe unexpected behaviors. Eighty-four participants received either mindful attention instructions (observe their thoughts as fleeting mental states) or immersion instructions (become absorbed in the vivid details of thoughts). After instruction, participants viewed visual depictions of an imagined in-group or out-group member's positive or negative behavior, selecting the best linguistic description from a set of four descriptions that varied in abstractness. Immersion groups demonstrated a robust LIB. Mindful attention groups, however, exhibited a markedly tempered LIB, suggesting that even a brief mindfulness related instruction can implicitly reduce the propensity to perpetuate stereotypical thinking through language. These results contribute to understanding the mechanisms that facilitate unprejudiced thinking.

AB  - Young people today are immersed in digital culture: often considered savvy navigators of online ecosystems and adept at using everyday technologies to share, create and express. These technologies are often seen as social and personal tools instead of spaces for meaningful participation. This paper shares the results of an investigation in young people's attitudes towards popular social communication modalities - memes and hashtags - for civic purposes. The study employs Emerging Citizens: a suite of digital literacy tools and accompanying learning content that teach people of all ages how to critique and create hashtags and memes. This inquiry explores how young people perceive memes and hashtags as relevant avenues for civic expression, and the impact that a digital literacy intervention can have on youth attitudes. An analysis of the student experience using the Emerging Citizens tools and reflection of their creations finds that digital literacy interventions impact young people's perceptions of popular social modalities for civic impact.

AB  - The present study examined whether individuals without strong national identity (i.e., low nationalism) would be susceptible to temporarily elicited essentialism to alter their mental representations of ethnic boundaries, and thus increase interethnic bias. To test these ideas we experimentally induced essentialist beliefs among Japanese subjects about the boundary between Japanese and Chinese ethnicities, while measuring the strength of nationalism as an individual variable. The results were generally consistent with predictions, suggesting that the activation of essentialist beliefs can strengthen interethnic biases among people without strong nationalism.

AB  - Objective: Faecal immunochemical tests (FITs) are increasingly being used in population-based colorectal cancer-screening programmes. Uptake of FIT is lower in men than women; however, the reasons for this are not well understood. We aimed to explore gender differences in influences on decisions to participate in FIT screening.
   Methods: This is a qualitative study using in-depth face-to-face interviews of four groups of screening invitees (male and female screening users and male and female screening non-users), purposively sampled from the database of a population-based FIT screening programme. Recruitment continued until saturation was reached. Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis using the framework approach was employed with the theoretical domains framework guiding analysis.
   Results: Forty-seven screening invitees were interviewed. Six theoretical domains influenced screening uptake: 'environmental context and resources', 'beliefs about capabilities', 'beliefs about consequences', 'emotions', 'social influences' and 'knowledge'. Male non-users were often fatalistic, less knowledgeable and misinformed about cancer and FIT screening compared with other groups. Female non-users expressed negative attitudes, beliefs and emotions towards FIT screening, cancer, social influences and the medical profession and were over-confident about their health.
   Conclusions: Negative attitudes and emotions to screening dominated non-user decision-making but differed by gender. Opportunities to improve uptake in men and women exist. Greater national discussions on the benefits of FIT screening, and development of screening materials tackling negative attitudes and beliefs while recognising male/female differences, may improve screening uptake.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the attitudes of older people living in institutions and their caregivers to ageing. Recent outcomes showed prevailing negative social stereotype to ageing in CR.
   Methods: The Attitudes to Ageing Questionnaire (AAQ-24) was used in two waves of data collection to measure attitudes of 400 randomly selected residents of 19 Senior Residential Homes. The reduced sample of 220 seniors and 276 professional carers employed at twelve Senior Residential Homes completed 12 items of general form (AAQ-12). All respondents expressed their agreement or disagreement with the statements presented in the questionnaire regarding positive or negative attitudes to ageing.
   Results: The AAQ total score proved significant influence of gender, having children, self-perceived health, depression, and quality of life. Subscale scores (psychosocial losses, physical changes, psychological growth) were significantly influenced by gender, age, activities limitations, having own children, depression, self-perceived health status, and quality of life. Globally, the attitudes of professional caregivers to ageing were more positive compared to the attitudes of older people living in institutions. Older adults showed higher agreement with negative statements about ageing. There was no difference between professional caregivers and older people in the positive attitudes to ageing expressed as the growth potential. Physical activity, wisdom, better ability to cope with life and contacting young generation were effective in the positive attitudes of both groups.

AB  - Social essentialism consists of the commonly held belief that certain ways of categorizing people (e.g., gender and race) reflect meaningful, fundamental distinctions found in nature-that some kind of category "essence" (e.g., something in their blood or their DNA) explains why groups of people (such as boys and girls) are different from one another. Yet as common as they are, essentialist beliefs can give rise to adverse consequences, including stereotyping and social prejudice. In this chapter, we examine the development of social essentialism. To begin, we briefly address the evidence that these beliefs are the result of developmental processes that unfold beginning in early childhood (and not something innate that children are born with). Then, we consider the nature of those processes; specifically, how basic processes underlying conceptual development give rise to different components of essentialist beliefs. We then address how different essentialist beliefs might be integrated into a coherent essentialist view of a category, and finally into a coherent essentialist view of a domain.

AB  - Stereotypes are tools of social perception that attribute a superficial uniformity to individuals within a social group, providing an instrument to assess individuals and groups. The stereotype content model (SCM) provides a framework for understanding these dynamics. SCM explores how groups are stereotyped on competence and warmth. This research utilizes the SCM to study India, a heterogenous society with diverse social groups. The purpose of this paper is to study caste stereotypes using SCM within India while also comparing two distinct regions of the country - the north and the south. This study is unique because (a) earlier studies have not explored stereotyping while recognizing the regional variations "within" India and (b) it applies SCM to caste. We also include how caste perceptions are further defined for groups that fall under the affirmative action program. Using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, we recruited subjects who responded to questions that assessed stereotypes of different social groups. The results indicate the presence of more ambivalent stereotypes and higher belief in karmic ideology in the four southern states compared to the northern states. Possible explanations discussed.

T2  - POLICING-A JOURNAL OF POLICY AND PRACTICE
LA  - English
KW  - STRESS
AB  - This study seeks to examine the relationship between antilocution and trust in the workplace by reflecting on the perceptions of police officers who are undertaking the new Higher Education (HE) pathway into the policing profession in England and Wales. This relationship is considered through . 'The Nature of Prejudice. New York, NY: Perseus' concept of antilocution and the lens of trust in the workplace, to understand how new police students think they are regarded by their policing colleagues and its impact on practice. Utilizing a survey of police students from five different forces in England and Wales, indicative results suggest that, whilst broadly supportive of new police officers, there may be some division regarding their education and training pathway through higher education, engendering levels of prejudice and bias towards the new recruits. Police student responses indicate that many of them feel that more is expected of them and that they are under closer supervision because they have undertaken the Higher Education route. Arguably, this prejudice and bias have an adverse effect on trust within the workplace, a concept which is front and centre of policing which ultimately can have a negative impact on public safety and security. The results of this study indicate that the interaction between new recruits (out-group) and established colleagues (in-group) is complex and not straightforward, and suggested implications for police practice are presented.

AB  - The stereotype that older adults are forgetful is pervasive and leads to age-related prejudice and discrimination. We aimed to explore the influence of ego-depletion on forgetful stereotyping of older adults. Our participants were 65 adult college students (females = 23, mean age = 21.5 years, SD = 0.19 years). They engaged in ego-depletion/non-depletion tasks and stereotype self-report measures successively. Using a Stroop mismatch test and task measuring the level of stereotyping the older adults as forgetful, our findings following t-test between group comparison indicated individuals in a state of ego-depletion would judge the older adults as more forgetful than those not in this state. This result suggests that ego-depletion is related to increased stereotyping of the older adults as forgetful.

AB  - HIV testing is an important HIV prevention strategy for young men who have sex with men (YMSM) in the United States, but the relationships between community- and individual-level aspects of sexuality-related stigma and HIV testing among YMSM are unknown. Data froma cross-sectional surveyincluded 334 HIV-negative YMSM in Detroit. Multinomial logistic regression was used to determine if place-based community prejudice perceptions, internalized homonegativity, and sexuality-related discrimination were associated with HIV testing. Increased perceptions of community prejudice were associated with lower odds of never testing, while increased internalized homonegativity was associated with greater odds of never testing. Experiences of discrimination had no association with HIV testing. Understanding the influence of sexuality-related stigma (and especially place-specific, community-level stigma) on HIV testing could help improve public health messaging to increase HIV testing among YMSM.

AB  - A central tenet of the health professions is that of equitable access to health care. However, disparities in equitable healthcare provision continues to be a challenge in many societies due to prejudices against the LGBTQ community. This study was aimed at exploring the attitudes of medical students toward LGBTQ patients in Malaysia. A qualitative approach was adopted to seek depth of understanding of clinical year medical students' perceptions and attitudes toward LGBTQ patients. Data were collected in 2018 through individual interviews and focus group discussions with a total of 29 participants, using a semi-structured question guideline. Purposive sampling comprised representation from the three major ethnic groups in Malaysia. Thematic analysis using NVivo highlighted three main themes i.e., neutrality, in compliance with the Professional Code of Conduct; implicit biases and tolerance of an Odd Identity; explicit biases with prejudices and stereotyping. The lack of knowledge and understanding of the nature and issues of sexuality is problematic as found in this study. They are primarily biases and prejudices projected onto marginalized LGBTQ patients who must contend with multiple jeopardies in conservative societies such as in Malaysia. With some state policies framed around Islam the concern is with the belief among Malay/Islamic students for LGBTQ individuals to go through conversion 'therapies' to become cisgender and heterosexual.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a novel approach to exploring the destimgatisation process, an agent-based model called the destigmatization model (DSIM). In the DSIM, we demonstrate that, even if individual interactions (intergroup contact) are based on rules of the self-fulfilling prophecy, it can lead to destigmatisation. In a second study, we empirically verify a prediction that there is a positive relationship between minority group size and perceived stigmatization. Finally, we confirm that DSIM successfully implements Allport's (1954) four moderators, in turn decreasing the level of perceived stigma of the minority group. Interestingly, however, some of Allport's moderators influence the speed of destigmatisation, rather than having a lasting impact on the process of prejudice reduction. The findings suggest that moderators of 'intergroup contact' can function in one of two ways, either by improving how much contact helps to reduce stigmatization or by improving how quickly destigmatization can occur.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the combined influence of gender stereotypes, sexism, and homophobia on attitudes toward bullying and bullying behavior. A total of 1,500 Spanish adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age (49.3% girls and 50.7% boys) completed a questionnaire that included measures of bullying, attitudes toward bullying, gender-stereotyped personality traits (instrumentality and expressiveness), hostile and benevolent sexism, and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. First, the findings demonstrated that boys scored significantly higher on all the variables assessed except on benevolent sexism. Two similar models were obtained for both sexes. Benevolent sexism and, in boys, more positive attitudes toward gay men predicted more negative attitudes toward bullying when mediated by more expressive gender traits. An inverse pattern was also observed: Hostile sexism predicted more favorable attitudes toward bullying when mediated by instrumental gender traits. Attitudes toward bullying were highly correlated with bullying behavior. The five-predictor variables (including attitudes toward bullying) explained 58% of the variance of bullying behavior in girls and 37% of such variance in boys.

AB  - Despite rapid social change that has influenced the social status of older adults, expectations about their behaviour and whether such expectations differ across generations remain unexplored in Korea. Based on ageing theories of activity, disengagement and modernisation, this study investigated age norms among Koreans conceptualised as shared expectations of appropriate behaviours of older adults. Competing perspectives in intergenerational relations and prejudice toward older adults were examined to test if they influenced age norms and if such associations varied across different age groups. Data were analysed from a survey of 1,445 individuals aged 20 and above who resided in.. administrative districts of Korea. Comparisons of age norms across age groups indicated that the older adult group (age 65+) held more restrictive attitudes about social participation and engagement in various behaviours in old age than the middle-aged adults (ages 45-64) and younger adults (ages 20-44). Respondents with more prejudice towards older adults tended to place more restrictions on the behaviour of older adults. A significant interaction indicated that respondents whose views were in line with a generational conflictive perspective, assessed as reporting more competitive perspectives between young and old people and being less supportive of intergenerational programmes, had a more restrictive view about older adults' behaviours among the middle-aged group but less restrictive attitudes in determining acceptable behaviour in later life among the older adult group.

AB  - Sexual concurrency may increase risk for HIV/STIs among youth. Attitudes about gender roles, including power balances within sexual partnerships, could be a driver. We examined this association among Baltimore youth (N = 352), aged 15-24. Data were collected from February, 2011 to May, 2013. We examined whether index concurrency in male-reported partnerships (N = 221) and sex partner's concurrency in female-reported partnerships (N = 241) were associated with youth's attitudes towards relationship power. Males with more equitable beliefs about power were less likely to report index concurrency. Females with more equitable beliefs were more likely to report sex partner's concurrency. The relationship was significant in main and casual partnerships among females and main partnerships among males. The strongest associations were detected among middle-socioeconomic status (SES) males and low-SES and African American females. Implementing interventions that recognize the complex relationship between socioeconomic context, partner dynamics, gender, and sexual behavior is an important step towards reducing HIV/STI risk among youth.

AB  - Our study investigates the relationship between health care providers' personal value preferences and their attitudes toward people living with HIV (PLWH). The study was conducted among nurses (n = 38) and physicians (n = 87) working in HIV Centers in Kazakhstan. Significant relationships were found between the providers' personal value preferences and their attitudes toward PLWH: higher preferences for tradition and power values and lower preferences for benevolence values were associated with more negative attitudes toward PLWH. In addition, more years of experience working with PLWH was associated with more positive attitudes toward this population. Age, gender, family status, religiosity, occupation, and number of years working in health care were not related to the health care providers' attitudes toward PLWH. Theoretical and practical implications of the results obtained are discussed. Copyright (C) 2013 Association of Nurses in AIDS Care

AB  - Introduction
   This article explores the short- and long-term outcomes of the Postgraduate Overseas Specialists Training (POST) Program. This program, based at St. Vincent's Mental Health (Melbourne) facilitates short-term clinical placements in collaboration with the Department of Psychiatry, University of Melbourne for mental health workers from the Asia-Pacific. The program aims to contribute to capacity development in the region's mental health workforce.
   Methods
   A total of 164 Fellows from 15 countries participated in the POST Program from 2001 to 2008. From mid-2006 to mid-2008, all POST Fellows (n=71) were asked to complete an evaluation survey on the last day of their placement. Six to 12 months after returning to their home countries, these same Fellows were sent a further survey to report on the long-term outcomes of their POST placement. The quantitative and qualitative data collected from the returned questionnaires were used as the basis for this evaluation.
   Results
   The short-term evaluation surveys indicate that the majority of POST Fellows were very satisfied with the training program and their training supervisors. Service developments and improvements, enhanced clinical leadership, attitude change and broad peer education emerged as potential long-term outcomes.
   Discussion
   The POST Program, as an out-of-country clinical training program, may play a unique role in contributing to building capacity of mental health clinicians in the Asia-Pacific region. However, further evaluation is required to ascertain the longer term impact of such professional training program.

AB  - In three experiments we investigated the impact that exposure to counter-stereotypes has on emotional reactions to outgroups. In Experiment 1, thinking about gender counter-stereotypes attenuated stereotyped emotions toward females and males. In Experiment 2, an immigrant counterstereotype attenuated stereotyped emotions toward this outgroup and reduced dehumanization tendencies. Experiment 3 replicated these results using an alternative measure of humanization. In both Experiments 2 and 3 sequential meditational analysis revealed that counter-stereotypes produced feelings of surprise which, in turn, elicited a cognitive process of expectancy violation which resulted in attenuated stereotyped emotions and an enhanced use of uniquely human characteristics to describe the outgroup. The findings extend research supporting the usefulness of counter-stereotype exposure for reducing prejudice and highlight its positive impact on intergroup emotions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Communicators often tune their message about a target to the audience's attitude toward that target. This tuning can shape a communicator's own evaluation of the target, which reflects the creation of a shared reality with the audience. So far, evidence for shared-reality creation has been confined to one specific target. In two experiments, we examined whether and when a shared reality would generalize to other targets. In Experiment 1, shared-reality creation about an ambiguous sexist target generalized to the evaluation of a new ambiguous sexist target for which no audience attitude was provided. However, this happened only when there was high (vs. low) commonality with the audience regarding previous judgments. In Experiment 2, we investigated conditions for the temporal persistence of generalization. One week after message tuning to a high-commonality audience, a shared reality generalized to a new ambiguous sexist target when participants recalled the shared-reality creation about the initial target, but it did not generalize in conditions without such recall. Also, no generalization occurred for non-ambiguous or non-sexist targets. Results suggest that shared reality generalization depends on perceived commonality with the audience, recollection of shared reality at time of judgment, and similarity between new and initial targets.

AB  - Latina women at risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) have lower awareness, knowledge, and use of genetic counseling and testing services (GCT) than non-Latina Whites. Few interventions have been developed to reduce these disparities among at-risk Latinas. This pilot study assessed the impact of a culturally targeted narrative video developed by our team. The study included 40 Latina immigrants living in the United States who were at risk of HBOC, including affected and unaffected women. We assessed pre-post differences in psychosocial outcomes. Participants were 47.35 years old on average (SD = 9.48). Most (70%) were unaffected with cancer, had an annual income of $40,000 or less (65%), an education of High School or less (62.5%), and were uninsured (77.5%). The video significantly enhanced knowledge (p < 0.001), positive attitudes (p < 0.05), anticipatory positive emotions (p < 0.05), and intentions to participate in counseling (p < 0.001). Importantly, the video also significantly reduced negative attitudes (p < 0.05), and attitudinal ambivalence (p < 0.001). The culturally targeted video shows preliminary evidence in improving psychosocial outcomes related to GCT uptake in Latinas at risk for HBOC. This intervention is a promising easily-disseminable strategy to address disparities in GCT utilization.

AB  - We report correlated Si, and Ti isotopic compositions and elemental concentrations of 238 presolar SiC grains from the Murchison CM2 meteorite. Combined with measurements of the C and N isotopic compositions of these 238 grains, 220 were determined to be of type mainstream, 10 type AB, 4 type Y and 4 type Z. SiC grains of diameter greater than or similar to 2.5 mu m, to ensure enough material to attempt Ti measurements, were randomly chosen without any other prejudice. The Ti isotopic compositions of the majority of the grains are characterized by enrichments in Ti-46, Ti-47, Ti-49, and Ti-50 relative to Ti-48, and show linear isotopic correlations indicative of galactic chemical evolution and neutron capture of the grains parent stars. The variability in the observed Ti signal as a function of depth in most of the grains indicates the presence of distinct subgrains, likely TiC that have been previously observed in TEM studies. Vandium-51 concentrations correlate with those of Ti, indicating V substitutes for Ti in the TiC matrix in many of the grains. No isotopic anomalies in Cr-52/Cr-53 ratios were observed, and Cr concentrations did not correlate with those of either Ti or V. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Previous studies have found that a variety of mental health professionals hold negative attitudes towards clients diagnosed with a personality disorder. These negative attitudes may lead to clients receiving a lower quality of service. Specialist training has been found to improve attitudes towards personality disorders but no empirical studies in Australia have examined this among clinical psychologists. In this study, the attitudes of 81 clinical psychologists towards clients with personality disorders were examined. We were specifically interested in investigating the relationship between recency of specialist training and clinician's attitudes as well as the influence of percentage of personality disorder clients on the clinician's caseload. Results demonstrated that both recency of specialist training and percentage of clients seen were associated with more positive attitudes; however, a higher caseload of clients with personality disorders was the most important predictor of positive attitudes. The implication is that recent participation in specialist training for personality disorders appears to be valuable in improving clinician's attitudes but that more positive attitudes are associated with seeing a greater number of individuals with personality disorders.

AB  - Young athletes are engaging in sports in an ever-evolving environment where larger discourses and public opinion polls suggest that attitudes toward sexual and gender minorities (SGM) are becoming more tolerant and affirming. In this mixed-methods study, we examined 151 heterosexual college student athletes' perceptions of the sports climate for SGM athletes and their own self-reported intervention in SGM-related prejudice in sports. Consistent with studies with SGM-identified athlete samples, participants reported high levels of SGM-related bias in the collegiate sporting context. Although participants reported fairly high levels of personally accepting attitudes toward SGM people, few reported intervening in SGM-related bias. Athletes' affirming personal beliefs about SGM populations were associated with a greater likelihood of intervening in SGM-related bias, whereas perceptions of a heterosexist sports climate were associated with a lower likelihood of intervening.

AB  - Non-adherence was more frequent in male than in female psychiatric patients. This multi-center study in China examined the gender difference with regard to attitude towards antipsychotic medications and its associations with socio-demographic variables, insight, and psychopathology. Patients' basic socio-demographic and clinical data were collected. Psychopathology and insight were measured with the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) and the Insight and Treatment Attitudes Questionnaire (ITAQ), respectively. Their attitudes towards antipsychotic medications were assessed by two standardized questions. Nearly 39.6% (109/275) males and 31.1% (70/225) females reported negative attitudes towards anti psychotic medications. Binary logistic regression revealed that in males single marital status (OR=2.9, 95% CI=1.3-6.4), rural residence (OR=0.4, 95% CI=0.2-0.7), longer duration of schizophrenia (OR=1.0, 95% CI=1.0-1.1), knowledge of medication (OR=1.5, 95% CI=1.3-1.6) and the SCL-90 hostility subscale (OR=0.9, 95% CI=0.9-1.0) were contributors to negative attitudes. In female patients, knowledge about medications (OR=1.4, 95% CI=1.3-1.6), the SCL-90 somatization (OR=0.8, 95% CI=0.8-0.9) and anxiety (OR=1.1, 95% CI=1.0-1.2) subscales were contributors to negative attitudes. The study suggested that different psychosocial and clinical factors accounted for the negative attitude towards antipsychotic treatment in male and female patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Most individuals are stigmatized at some point. However, research often examines stigmas separately, thus underestimating the overall impact of stigma and precluding comparisons across stigmatized identities and conditions. In their classic text, Social Stigma: The Psychology of Marked Relationships, Edward Jones and colleagues laid the groundwork for unifying the study of different stigmas by considering the shared dimensional features of stigmas: aesthetics, concealability, course, disruptiveness, origin, peril. Despite the prominence of this framework, no study has documented the extent to which stigmas differ along these dimensions, and the implications of this variation for health and well-being. We reinvigorated this framework to spur a comprehensive account of stigma's impact by classifying 93 stigmas along these dimensions. With the input of expert and general public raters, we then located these stigmas in a six-dimensional space and created discrete clusters organized around these dimensions. Next, we linked this taxonomy to health and stigma-related mechanisms. This quantitative taxonomy offers parsimonious insights into the relationship among the numerous qualities of numerous stigmas and health.

AB  - Introduction: The stigma of epilepsy continues to negatively impact people with epilepsy (PWE) in many Arab Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia. Socioreligious, cultural, and philosophical ideas prevalent in the region may contribute to the underpinnings of stigma toward PWE, but this has not been sufficiently studied.
   Materials and methods: This study recruited a convenience sample of people without epilepsy from clinic waiting rooms and through social media. Participants completed a questionnaire with questions about demographics, mind-body dualism (MBD), supernatural beliefs (SB), attitudes toward epilepsy (ATE), and religiosity.
   Results: A total of 210 participants were recruited. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant difference in the mean total ATE scores, indicating better ATE with higher education (p < 0.001). Despite the relatively high level of education and a high proportion of participants with medical training, only slightly more than half rejected the possibility that demonic possession may be a cause of epilepsy. Attitudes toward epilepsy were correlated with MDB and SB but not with religiosity. Mind-body dualism and religiosity correlated significantly with negative attitudes toward PWE (p < 0.05). A linear regression model using ATE as the dependent variable and MDB, SB, and educational level as independent variables significantly predicted ATE (F = 15.6, p 0.001, R2 = 0.24), although SB dropped out as a predictor of ATE in that model. Another regression used SB as the dependent variable, and MBD, religiosity, and educational level as independent variables were also significant with all three variables predicting SB (F = 64.0, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Mind-body dualism was related to the cognitive process leading to supernatural misconceptions about epilepsy and negative attitudes toward PWE in Saudi Arabia. Although misconceptions that supernatural possession was the cause of epilepsy (justifying treatment by religious healing) and was likely derived from prevalent religious beliefs of the region, religiosity was not associated with negative attitudes toward PWE. The merits and efficacy of an intervention focused on reducing the negative effects of MBD and SB on ATE warrants further investigation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gender studies have often been criticized for undermining family and religious values. In this paper, we argue that these criticisms exhibit the characteristics of conspiracy theories. We define gender conspiracy beliefs as convictions that gender studies and gender-equality activists represent an ideology secretly designed to harm traditional values and social arrangements. In two studies conducted among Catholics in Poland (Study 1 N= 1019; Study 2 N= 223), we examined the prevalence of gender conspiracy beliefs and their psychological concomitants. We hypothesized that gender conspiracy beliefs should be associated with a defensive identification with one's religious group, captured by religious collective narcissism. In both studies, Catholic collective narcissism was demonstrated to be a robust predictor of gender conspiracy beliefs. We additionally demonstrated that Catholic collective narcissism predicted outgroup hostility, and this effect was mediated by gender conspiracy beliefs. We discuss the implications for gender-based prejudice.

AB  - Obesity stigma largely remains a socially acceptable bias with harmful outcomes for its victims. While many accounts have been put forward to explain the bias, the role of obesity etiology beliefs has received little scrutiny. The research examined the effect that beliefs about the psychological etiology of obesity have on the expression of obesity stigma and the mechanisms underpinning this effect. Participants (N=463) were asked to evaluate a target person with obesity after reading one of three possible etiologies: psychological, genetic, or behavioral. The presentation of a psychological etiology of obesity elicited less prejudice compared to behavioral causes but greater prejudice compared to genetic causes; observed differences were found to be a function of the agency ascribed to the target's obesity and empathy expressed for the target. The findings highlight the impact that communicating obesity in terms of psychological causes can have for the expression of obesity stigma.

AB  - Historic patterns of racialized oppression, discrimination, and prejudice have been linked to contemporary levels of racialized inequality. Such patterns are thought to be created and maintained through a series of institutions aimed at limiting access to resources for some while opening doors for others. It is expected that patterns of historical racialized inequality are the by-product of a historical lack of investment in the cultural capital of the local community, which later manifests itself in the form of low levels of human development, both in relational and absolute terms. In order to test this pattern in the American South, this link is tested using historical and contemporary data from the US Census Bureau, the National Institute for Literacy, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Center for Disease Control, the Historical American Lynching Project, and the Negro Participation Survey. Spatially-centered nested regression models provide support for this thesis through the identification of links to persistent patterns of underdevelopment in counties with a history of low levels of non-white education, school desegregation, racialized group mobilization, agricultural means of production, and a history of oppression through lynchings.

AB  - Increasing economic inequality adversely affects groups with low socioeconomic status (low-SES). However, many people are opposed to wealth redistribution policies. In this context, we examined whether dehumanization of low-SES groups has a role in this opposition. In the first study (N = 303), opposition to wealth redistribution was related to denying human uniqueness (e.g., intelligence and rationality) and having negative attitudes toward low-SES groups, more than denying human nature (e.g., emotionality and capacity to suffer) to low-SES groups. Mediation analyses indicated that this effect occurred via blaming low-SES groups for their plight, after controlling for participants' SES and negative attitudes towards low-SES groups. In the second study (N = 220), manipulating the human uniqueness of a fictitious low-SES group affected support for wealth redistribution measures through blame. These results indicate that animalizing low-SES groups reduces support for wealth redistribution via blaming low-SES groups for their situation.

AB  - Introduction: In sub-Saharan Africa, a paucity of data exists in respect of the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of patients on maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) regarding the dietary adaptations they should make. Methods: In a descriptive, cross-sectional study, conducted in 2017, questionnaires were administered during structured interviews with 75 participants in five MHD-units in Bloemfontein to assess socio-demographics and KAP regarding the 'renal' diet. Results: The median age was 50.5 years; 70.7% of participants were male. Overall, 49.4% scored low (< 50%) on knowledge regarding restricted foods, food content of restricted minerals, and phosphate binders; 60.0% reported negative attitudes towards the diet, and 61.4% reported poor adherence practices. Participants with tertiary education (28.0%) had significantly higher knowledge scores than participants with only primary school education (6.7%) (95% CI 3.9%; 73.5%), or those who had only partially completed secondary school (17.3%) (95% CI 6.3%; 64.0%). Only 21.0% reported having received written, and 30.7% verbal, nutrition education in their home language, while 24.0% reported never receiving nutrition education in either their home or second language. Having received nutrition education in a home language and/or second language was associated with significantly higher knowledge scores (95% CI 3.7%; 49.5%). Most (77.3%) reported zero to one consultation with a dietitian per MHD year (NKF-K/DOQI recommends at least three/MHD year). Conclusion: This population on MHD presented with poor KAP regarding the 'renal' diet, and inadequate involvement of dietitians in their treatment. Receiving nutritional education in a first or second language significantly increased knowledge of, and insight into, the required dietary adaptations.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic brought along with it concerns about anxiety, racial bias, and pushback against public health recommendations, all of which are intensified by the news and social media. This study investigated the effects of constructive journalism in the context of this crisis, by randomly assigning 492 subjects to view simulated social media news updates with different headlines and images. The results showed positive and constructive headlines led to less anger and anxiety than negative headlines. The sanitization of graphic images decreased anger, anxiety, COVID-19 risk perceptions, and anti-Chinese sentiment-a relationship that was mediated by anger and anxiety. These findings suggest constructive journalism can be useful in times of crisis, and that its visual aspect warrants more scholarly attention. Further, these results shed new light on the effects of news exposure via social media in times of crisis, and how this impact depends on specific attributes of the headlines and images of the content being shared. The findings are discussed in relation to the theory of affective intelligence and recent concerns about how news and social media influence the public in times of crisis.

AB  - Background: Pain neuroscience education (PNE) programs have become popular among clinicians and are widely promoted through social and mainstream media.Purpose: To test the hypothesis that people with persistent pain are likely to express negative attitudes to PNE statements and compare their responses to other social media user groups.Methods: A total of 1319 respondents completed an online survey and were directed into four groups: persistent pain, healthcare professionals with persistent pain, pain-free healthcare professionals, and pain-free controls. The survey included ten statements of popular PNE concepts. Feedback was invited by offering seven attitudinal response categories (three positives, three negatives, and one neutral). A two-step hierarchical regression model was used to assess the likelihood of reporting negatively.Results: Compared to controls, respondents from the persistent pain group were more likely to report negatively towards all statements (OR 1.6-2.16), except for two statements (#3 and #5). Healthcare professionals were less likely to report negative attitudes for 4 out of 10 statement (OR 0.35-0.58). Health care professionals living with persistent responded to most statements like the pain-free controls (besides statement #2, OR 0.59).Conclusion: People living with persistent pain are more likely to express negative attitudes to PNE statements on social media, unlike healthcare professionals who were less likely to express negativity. Healthcare professionals living with persistent pain responded to most PNE statements like the pain-free control group. The study's main weaknesses include the lack of psychometric information of the questionnaire used, selection bias, small samples of the healthcare professionals and the overrepresentation of young social media users.

AB  - One population that shares both similar and different characteristics with traditional college-age students is the U.S. Military. Similarities include a high concentration of 18- to 26-year-olds dealing with new found independence, peer pressure, and the presence of social norms that support violence and hypermasculinity. Sexual violence is a major public health problem in the United States, and because of the similarities in the age group of college and military populations, the problems regarding sexual violence in both constituencies have been well-documented. In the current pilot study we seek to add to both current knowledge about and promising practices of translating prevention strategies from one target audience to another. We describe how we translated, administered, and evaluated a bystander intervention social marketing campaign focused on sexual assault prevention that had been found to significantly affect attitude change on a college campus for a U.S. Army installation in Europe. In addition to demonstrating the process of translating prevention strategies across target audiences, findings from this pilot study contribute to the evaluation data on the effectiveness of sexual violence prevention strategies implemented with members of the U.S. Military. From our analysis, we see that research participants indicate that the degree to which the images resonate with them and the familiarity of the context (i.e., social self-identification) significantly effect the participants' personal responsibility for reducing sexual assault, confidence in acting as a bystander, and reported engagement as a bystander.

AB  - Patients with rare diseases are often disadvantaged, particularly those with rare liver diseases. Reasons for disadvantage include delayed or overlooked diagnosis, lack of local expertise and high-quality care, poor scientific understanding of the disease process and limited therapeutic options. In adult liver disease this can be compounded by prejudices towards patients with liver disease in general, because of a perception (incorrect for all rare liver diseases) that liver disease is lifestyle related and thus "selfinflicted". In paediatric rare liver diseases, such as biliary atresia, optimising outcomes requires a particularly timely diagnosis. Irrespective of patient age, the scientific and medical community must rise to the challenge of advancing our understanding of rare liver disease, searching for more effective and specific therapies, and providing the infrastructure to provide the best care for all patients, infants, children, young and older adults. The European Reference Network for Rare Liver Diseases is an important step in this direction. (C) 2017 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

   Study design: Commentary.
   Methods: Narrative review.
   Results: In this Short Communication, we consider the significance of societal perspectives of skin colour, glocalized whiteness, efforts to attain self-esteem and social mobility through skin lightening practices, and the role of cosmetic products in fuelling this phenomenon.
   Conclusions: Addressing the inadvertent (or indeed conscious) vehicles of systematic racism and sustaining of skin colour prejudices and stereotypes of fair skin beauty by cosmetic companies is warranted.

AB  - Research that has explored the attitudes of cisgender people toward transgender people has identified gender differences, with cisgender men commonly reporting more negative attitudes than cisgender women. However, little research has explored whether such differences exist among mental health professionals. This brief report outlines findings from 3 studies focusing on attitudes toward transgender people among 3 samples of Australian cisgender psychologists or psychology trainees. The first explored attitudes toward transgender people among psychology undergraduates in an Australian university. The second 2 explored attitudes toward transgender people among Australian mental health-care professionals (with the specific focus of this brief report being upon participants in each study who were psychologists). The findings from each study suggest that cisgender men reported more negative attitudes than did cisgender women. This brief report concludes by considering the broader context that potentially shapes cisgender men's attitudes and advocates for further research that examines the impact of gender ideology upon attitudes and awareness raising so as to improve service outcomes for transgender people.

AB  - Background Ageist and helping attitudes among undergraduate homecare students are a concern for educators, healthcare professionals and home care workers due to their potential to increase the marginalisation of older people and negatively impact quality of care.
   Objectives The current study evaluated the effect of extended contact with community-dwelling older adults on the ageist and helping attitudes of home care students.
   Methods Fifty-five students attending a public university in Turkey were randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 27) or control group (n = 28). The intervention group received positive theoretical education and had extended contact with community-dwelling older adults, while the control group only received positive theoretical education. Before and after the intervention, the students' ageist attitudes were evaluated with Kogan's Attitudes towards Old People scale (KAOP) and helping attitudes were evaluated with the Helping Attitude Scale (HAS).
   Results There were statistically significant differences between pre- and post-test mean KAOP total, positive ageism and negative ageism subscale scores in the intervention group (p < 0.05) and in KAOP negative ageism score in the control group (p < 0.05). HAS scores showed no significant post-intervention change in helping attitudes in either group.
   Conclusion Extended contact with community-dwelling older adults had a favourable influence on undergraduate health students' ageism attitudes. These results suggest that contact with older adults may be an effective strategy to reduce ageism but may not increase helping behaviours.
   Implications for practice Positive contact experiences with community-dwelling older adults can be used to reduce ageism in home care students.

AB  - We investigated the content of survey items to assess whether and how racist and sexist stereotypes are woven into the fabric of research on attitudes about abortion in the United States. We collected and analyzed a comprehensive set of survey items (456 items from 80 studies) used in peer-reviewed research published from 2008 to 2018 in representative and nonrepresentative studies of U.S. respondents. Our analysis was guided by historical narratives that have been influential in shaping representations of women and reproduction in the United States (e.g., the Moynihan Report). With this background, we developed three themes pertaining to how individuals' attitudes about abortion are measured: we found that items rely on (1) moral, (2) sexual, and (3) financial evaluations of women seeking abortion care. These themes highlighted implicit and explicit judgments of women, including representations of them as unwilling to partner with men and as fiscally and sexually irresponsible. We argue that survey items meant to objectively assess abortion attitudes draw on negative racial and gender stereotypes and that these stereotypes then travel widely under the veneer of scientific objectivity. Critical methods, such as the item bank analysis described in this study, are crucial to discern how inequality, prejudice, and discrimination can be reproduced in the fabric of research methods. In our discussion, we offer suggestions for researchers to reduce these and related forms of bias in survey-based abortion research.

AB  - This study reviewed the effects of the Student Team Achievement Divisions (STAD) cooperative learning strategies model compared to the traditional method of communication skills in economic subjects among secondary school students in Aceh. The study aims to identify the relationship between attitude change and communication skills that are influenced by family income. Besides, this research also investigates the relationship between communication skills with student achievement in the economic subject. The quasi-experimental designs with a pre-test and post-test used to collect data in this study. After fourteen weeks of treatment for the experimental group, both groups performed the Post-Test. The findings of the T-test showed a significant difference in student communication skills in economic subjects between the experimental group and the control group. The method of data analysis used analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed performance was higher on the post-test experimental group compared to the control group. This finding indicates that the use of the STAD cooperative learning strategies model during the review period can increase student achievement in the economic subject. The implications of this study show that the STAD Cooperative Learning model can be a model for teaching and learning in economics to improve communication skills among students in Aceh.

AB  - The US Food and Drug Administration is tasked with communicating information to the public about the harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke. Our study used eye tracking method to test the effectiveness of messages about the harmful chemicals in cigarettes smoke among adult smokers. A sample size of 211 current cigarette smokers viewed four communication messages that included: Health effects of a chemical in cigarette smoke and an image depicting the health effect. The messages focused on arsenic, formaldehyde, uranium, and general health. Eye tracking recorded the length of time participants viewed the text and the image. After each message, the participants were asked about the messages' effectiveness in changing attitudes towards smoking. We analyzed the data using multilevel modeling, and of the 211 smokers, 59.7% were female, 36.5% were Black, and 21.3% had a high school degree or less. Compared to the general message, the messages about formaldehyde and uranium were more discouraging to smoking (p < 0.05). Messages about formaldehyde were more believable and made participants want to quit more than the general messages. Increasing message dose was significantly associated with discouraging participants from smoking and made participants want to quit (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that anti-smoking messages, containing chemical information, can successfully increase negative attitudes toward smoking cigarettes and potentially encourage quitting.

AB  - A four-wave survey on a national probabilistic sample (N = 17,399) tested novel predictions about how positive and negative contact with racial out-groups predicts warmth and anger toward those groups. Three competing hypotheses were tested: (a) that negative contact will outweigh positive contact when predicting both emotions ("bad is stronger than good"); (b) that negative and positive contact will similarly predict each emotion; and (c) that negative contact will have a disproportionately large association with anger (a negative emotion), whereas positive contact will have a disproportionately large association with warmth (a positive emotion)-a phenomenon known as affect matching. The data revealed clear evidence for affect matching: Negative contact was associated with high levels of anger more than low levels of warmth, whereas positive contact was associated with high levels of warmth more than low levels of anger. Results suggest that positive and negative feelings about out-groups may be tied to qualitatively distinct contact experiences.

TI  - Use of Social Mobilization and Community Mobilizers by Non-governmental Health Organizations in Malawi to Support the Eradication of Polio, Improve Routine Immunization Coverage, and Control Measles and Neonatal Tetanus
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
LA  - English
AB  - Seventy-five percent of children aged 12-23 months in Malawi have received all eight basic vaccinations-still leaving many children at risk. The Malawi Expanded Program on Immunization comprehensive Multi-Year Plan 2016-2020 reveals several challenges impeding immunization and disease surveillance efforts, such as the fact that non-governmental health organizations (NGHOs) and communities are minimally included in the planning, implementation, and monitoring of these activities. This article examines the extent to which NGHOs are promoting the use of social mobilization (SM) and community mobilizers (CMs) for sharing health information related to the eradication of polio, the importance of routine immunization, and the control of measles and neonatal tetanus. Data collection involved document analysis and interviews with 11 organizations in Malawi whose work contributes to the eradication of polio and control of measles and neonatal tetanus. Content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data, whereas descriptive statistics were used to analyze the quantitative data. Non-governmental health organizations use a variety of approaches for SM, including mass media campaigns (radio and printed booklets), local skits and dramas, and home visits. Most NGHOs use training workshops and opinion leaders to impart knowledge and skills to CMs on immunization to eradicate polio and to control measles and neonatal tetanus. Major challenges faced by the NGHOs include negative attitudes toward campaigns and demotivation of CMs due to lack of financial incentives. The article concludes with a discussion of approaches to strengthen SM and the role of CMs by NGHOs.

AB  - This study investigated how Indian Christian low-wage migrant workers in Singapore responded to the text of Exodus 1-3 in light of their real-life experiences, through a dialogic methodology of contextual bible reading based on Gerald West's approach of 'reading with' marginalized groups. The migrant workers responded well to this methodology and were able to articulate unusual and counter-hegemonic readings. They tacitly read against the ideological grain of the narrative of Exodus 1-3, by problematizing the underlying ideology of difference that legitimizes nationalism and violence against the Other. They also highlighted the presence of inter-ethnic and inter-religious prejudice and violence in Singapore, even within the migrant worker community, and the discrimination they suffered as low-wage foreign workers. Their reading suggests that if Exodus is to be read for liberation in the Singaporean context, it can begin by calling people to be liberated from their prejudice and violence against the Other.

AB  - The analysis we propose aims at identifying those limitations of the acts of knowledge that have emerged under the pressure of bureaucracy and politicization of institutions that administer public knowledge-the school at all levels, research centers, academies, etc. It seems of first urgency to examine without prejudice some topics such as:
   1) knowledge and the institutions that manage it. We note the institutionalization of the forms of the procedural unfolding of knowledge and the standardization of the narratives that express it. This fact has social consequences that are easy to identify: no knowledge (truth) is recognized unless it enters the circuit of the institutions that manage the knowledge networks and alternative narratives (to the standard ones) develop epistemologically relevant effects only when they arc allocated relevant expression space (the institutional mechanisms of authoritarian imposition block any attempt at non-conforming discourse).
   2) formal narratives of knowledge and their political function prove the entry of the sciences into the circuit of the economy of7mbolic goods. In social practice, the mutual negotiation between the various forms of public authority and the (compliant) education systems is transparent. Public education puts into circulation metanarratives about science that have an implicit ideological dimension.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to examine potential differences between male and female alpine ski naive young people in attitudes towards alpine skiing before and after the completion of structured alpine ski school program. We included 136 ski beginners (41 women and 95 men) who anonymously filled out a previously validated 26-item Lickert scale-type questionnaire related to their attitudes towards skiing just before and at the end of the skiing course. Alpine ski course program positively affected attitude change in favor of alpine skiing for the overall group of participants (p=.00) as well as when the scores were analyzed separately for the male (p=.00) and female ski beginners (p=.01). Although male participants had initially a more positive attitude towards skiing than their female counterparts (p=.03), upon completion of the alpine ski course program both the women and men changed their attitude in a positive direction and the statistical significance between genders was lost. The findings confirm that the structured program of alpine ski course can improve attitude towards alpine skiing. Moreover, when ski instructors are familiar with the attitudes and expectations of their ski beginners in advance, they can adjust instruction program to increase interest in alpine skiing.

AB  - This paper discusses investigations in science education addressing the nonlinear dynamical hypothesis. Learning science is a suitable field for applying interdisciplinary research and predominately for testing psychological theories. It was demonstrated that in this area the paradigm of complexity and nonlinear dynamics have offered theoretical advances and better interpretations of empirical data. Research showed that besides linear modes of behavior, sudden transitions occur in cognitive performance and this has questioned basic theoretical and epistemological assumptions. The neo-Piagetian framework and motivational theories offering constructs for serving as predictors in various model are the local theories which are embraced by the CDS meta-theory. Sudden transitions are modeled by catastrophe theory (CT) the analyses of which reveal the crucial role of certain variables, namely the bifurcation factors. Beyond a critical value of the bifurcation factor, the state variable splits into two-attractor regions and becomes bimodal. The bifurcation effect induces uncertainty and unpredictability in the system, which oscillates between two states entering the regime of chaos. Then in state variables such as learning outcomes and achievement, sudden transitions from success to failure are expected. Catastrophe theory explains unexpected phenomena associated with school failure, dropouts, illicit behaviors, sudden attitude change, and creativity. Moreover CT could contribute in elucidating theoretical debates and conflicting empirical evidences.

AB  - This study examined determinants of attitudes toward mental health services with a sample of American Indian younger-old-adults (aged 50-64, n = 158) and American Indian older-old adults (aged 65 and older, n = 69). Adapting Andersen's behavioral model of healthcare utilization, predisposing factors, mental health needs, and enabling factors were considered as potential predictors. Female and those with higher levels of social support tend to report more positive attitudes toward mental health services. Culture-influenced personal belief was associated with negative attitudes toward mental health services among American Indian younger-old -adults. Age and higher chronic medical conditions were significantly related to negative attitudes toward mental health services. Health insurance was positively associated with positive attitudes toward mental health services in the American Indian older-old adults. Findings indicate that practitioners should engage how culture, social support, and chronic conditions influence the response to mental health needs when working with older American Indians.

AB  - Using mixed design analysis of variance, this paper examines the effect of body art on job applicant hireability ratings. It employs the literatures on the social psychologies of stigma and prejudice, as well as aesthetic labor, to frame the argument. The results indicate that photos of tattooed and pierced job applicants result in lower hireability ratings compared to the control faces. The negative effect of body art on employment chances is, however, reduced for job applicants seeking non-customer-facing roles. In customer-facing roles, the tattoo is associated with lower hireability ratings than the piercing. The results suggest that visible body art can potentially be a real impediment to employment.

AB  - Transgender youth are at risk for poorer oral health and may have a more difficult time accessing health care. Pediatric dentists should be aware of risk factors that impact care in the dental office and operating room settings. Medical care avoidance is common and can be reinforced when patients feel unsupported or misunderstood when receiving care. Intentional or unintentional environmental indignities, which communicate negative attitudes toward transgender patients, may occur from unknowing providers. Identified here are best practices and opportunities for improvement when providing care for these patients. Dental care for the transgender patient requires a welcoming and inclusive environment that encourages continuous comprehensive care for these individuals.

AB  - Three studies examined whether animality is a component of low-SES stereotypes. In Study 1a-c, the content of "white trash" (USA), "chav" (UK), and "bogan" (Australia) stereotypes was found to be highly consistent, and in every culture it correlated positively with the stereotype content of apes. In Studies 2a and 2b, a within-subjects approach replicated this effect and revealed that it did not rely on derogatory labels or was reducible to ingroup favoritism or system justification concerns. In Study 3, the "bogan" stereotype was associated with ape, rat, and dog stereotypes independently of established stereotype content dimensions (warmth, competence, and morality). By implication, stereotypes of low-SES people picture them as primitive, bestial, and incompletely human.

AB  - Does the public expression and performance of shock, distress, anger, frustration and ideological disapproval of particular sorts of politics constitute a form of collective political expression from which individuals can learn about being citizens? When it comes to the expression of feelings of racial and other types of prejudice, has political correctness led to a deepening of entrenched racist beliefs with no channel for discussion? This article engages with such questions through a case study of YouTube responses to "My Tram Experience" a commuter-uploaded mobile-phone video of a racist diatribe on a tram in the UK. Using qualitative content analysis and thematic analysis, it describes how these performed, networked and distributed moments of citizen angst demonstrate a limited but interesting range of civic engagements with and positionings towards racism, immigration, class and nationalism. For one reason or another these are not allowed to occur in other public for a such as the mainstream media or schools. The article argues that these vlogs are both a wide-ranging potentially therapeutic resource for those needing validation for their racist or anti-racist views, or for those who wish to express and garner solidarity for discomfort and pain caused by racism; they are also a significant though currently uncurated resource for citizenship education both formal and informal because of their engagements with technology, social context, emotional context and political rhetoric.

AB  - Leprosy is a contagious infectious disease caused by the bacillus Mycobacterium leprae. This microorganism was discovered by Dr. Gerhard Hansen, and the illness was then baptized as Hansen's disease. For a long time, Hansen's disease was thought to be hereditary-a curse or a punishment from God. The disease affects skin and nerves and can cause severe damage. Due to its destructive effects, leprosy has caused fear, segregation, and prejudice in all societies since Biblical times. Patients with Hansen's disease have not been treated humanely around the world throughout the ages. This article is a summary of curious and interesting facts about the history and cultural aspects of Hansen's disease, which has chastised humanity for centuries. These facts are about the discovery of the disease, its propagation, the evolution of treatments, and the prejudice of society towards patients.

AB  - Objectives Material well-being, beliefs, and emotional states are believed to influence one's health and longevity. In this paper, we explore racial differences in self-rated health, happiness, trust in others, feeling that society is fair, believing in God, frequency of sexual intercourse, educational attainment, and percent in poverty and their association with mortality. Study designs Age-period-cohort (APC) study. Methods Using data from the 1978-2014 General Social Survey-National Death Index (GSS-NDI), we conducted APC analyses using generalized linear models to quantify the temporal trends of racial differences in our selected measures of well-being, beliefs, and emotional states. We then conducted APC survival analysis using mixed-effects Cox proportional hazard models to quantify the temporal trends of racial differences in survival after removing the effects of racial differences in our selected measures. Results For whites, the decline in happiness was steeper than for blacks despite an increase in high school graduation rates among whites relative to blacks over the entire period, 1978-2010. Self-rated health increased in whites relative to blacks from 1978 through 1989 but underwent a relative decline thereafter. After adjusting for age, sex, period effects, and birth cohort effects, whites, overall, had higher rates of self-rated health (odds ratio [OR] = 1.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.63, 2.16), happiness (OR = 2.05; 1.77, 2.36), and high school graduation (OR = 2.88; 2.34, 3.53) compared with blacks. Self-rated health, happiness, and high school graduation also mediated racial differences in survival over time. Conclusions We showed that some racial differences in survival could be partly mitigated by eliminating racial differences in health, happiness, and educational attainment. Future research is needed to analyze longitudinal clusters and identify causal mechanisms by which social, behavioral, and economic interventions can reduce survival differences.

KW  - Zion Pastors
KW  - Local Illness Interpretation
AB  - The narratives on the diagnosis and causes of malaria are diverse and apparently ambiguous, being based beyond the body, on the social relations among peers, their ancestors, and nature. Based on a qualitative study and a four-year stay in Mozambique, this article analyzes the discourses of patients and biomedical practitioners on traditional health care providers, i.e., tinyanga and zion pastors, linking them to local terminology of malaria, in a rural district in southern Mozambique. In the current context of therapeutic pluralism and high mobility, the lack of solidarity and compassion attributed to tinyanga is supported by the monetization and commodification of their medicinal rituals and knowledge, as well as by competition with other providers in attracting patients. The implementation of zion churches, of Christian nature and performing therapeutic practices similar to tinyanga, is presented as a local advantageous solution due to the strong community connection, the comfort and reciprocity among the members, and the therapeutic results at low cost. In terms of health care policies and clinical practice, the invisibility of zion pastors and the subordinate role of healers is managed according to interests, based on vague ideas and prejudices from biomedical providers. The implementation of health policies that address the local diversity, the existing power relations and medical knowledge and practices can strengthen the biomedical care services and harmonize relations between the providers and the population.

AB  - During the long-term service of asphalt pavement, under the combined action of repeated loads and environmental factors, asphalt pavement will gradually appear small damage. When the damage accumulates to a certain extent, the asphalt pavement will have serious rutting deformation, resulting in poor highway flatness and greatly reducing the service life of the asphalt pavement. The traditional monitoring methods of pavement rutting deformation need high environmental detection conditions. At the same time, there are some problems, such as subjective judgment standard and unable to monitor in real time. The commonly used road surface coring detection methods will destroy the original continuous structure of the pavement and easily cause internal damage of the pavement under the action of rain and snow environment. In this study, based on the intelligent aggregate (IA) equipped with high-precision attitude sensor, a new pavement rutting deformation monitoring method was proposed. Combined with the indoor rutting experiment, the relationship model between intelligent aggregate attitude change and rutting deformation was established, and the relationship model between real pavement rutting deformation and intelligent aggregate attitude change was established by finite element method, so as to realize the rutting deformation monitoring method based on Intelligent aggregate.

AB  - Scant research has been conducted on gender in the Arab world; one explanation is due to a lack of Arabic measures on gender-related issues. To advance scientific work on gender in the Arab world, we developed the Arab Adolescents Gender Roles Attitude Scale (AAGRAS), the first known reliable and valid Arabic measure of gender-role attitudes. To develop this measure, we conducted two studies based on data collected from 776 high school students 15-19 years-old from the state of Qatar. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis produced 12 items divided equally into two subscales. One subscale assesses traditional gender-role attitudes, whereas the other measures egalitarian gender-role attitudes. Our findings indicate that young men are more likely to resist gender equality than young women are. Moreover, those who hold traditional attitudes are more likely to disapprove of women occupying positions of authority. The AAGRAS is a useful assessment tool that policymakers, researchers, practitioners, and educators can use to study gender-role attitudes in the Arab world and to develop educational and intervention programs that encourage adolescents to identify, confront, and avoid prejudice and discrimination against women and ultimately adopt more egalitarian gender roles.

AB  - Gender affirmation surgery (GAS) is sought out by approximately 20 to 40% of transgender individuals. These patients possess unique mental and physical health needs. These are compounded by prejudices and lack of education about transgender individuals within the medical system and society at large. Societal and medical barriers are associated with increased risks of violence, suicide, and sexually transmitted infections. This combination of high medical needs and barriers to accessing appropriate care may give rise to a self-perpetuating cycle of risk exposure, stigmatization, prejudice, and eventually poor health outcomes. It is imperative that plastic and reconstructive surgeons understand GAS from a public health perspective, so that they may provide the highest quality of care and help alleviate these disparities. The authors describe unique public health topics in GAS. These are specifically related to healthcare access, surgical education, cultural sensitivity, as well as mental health outcomes for patients who undergo GAS.

AB  - (1) Background: By April 2021, over 160 million Chinese have been vaccinated against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study analyzed the impact of vaccination on discrimination against recovered COVID-19 patients and the determinants of discrimination among intended vaccinated people. (2) Methods: A self-designed questionnaire was used to collect data on COVID-19 associated discrimination from nine provinces in China. Pearson chi-square tests and a multivariate ordered logistic regression analyzed the determinants of COVID-19-related discrimination. (3) Results: People who intended to be COVID-19 vaccinated displayed a high level of discrimination against recovered COVID-19 patients, with only 37.74% of the intended vaccinated without any prejudice and 34.11% displaying severe discrimination. However, vaccinations reduced COVID-19-related discrimination against recovered COVID-19 patients from 79.76% to 62.26%. Sex, age, education level, occupation, geographical region, respondents' awareness of vaccine effectiveness and infection risk, and COVID-19 knowledge score had a significant influence on the COVID-19 related discrimination (p < 0.05). (4) Conclusions: Vaccination significantly reduced COVID-19 associated discrimination, but discrimination rates remained high. Among the intended vaccinated respondents, females, the older aged, people with high school and above education level, retirees, migrant workers, and residents in central China were identified as key targets for information campaigns to reduce COVID-19 related discrimination.

AB  - Purpose: To explore the social impact of, comfort with, and negative attitudes towards robots among young, middle-aged, and older adults in the United States.
   Design: Descriptive, cross-sectional. Conducted in 2014-2015 in an urban area of the western United States using a purposive sample of adults 18 years of age or older.
   Methods: Respondents completed a survey that included the Negative Attitudes Toward Robots Scale (NARS) and two questions taken or modified from the European Commission's Autonomous System 2015 Report. Analyses were conducted to compare perceptions and demographic factors by age groups (young adults:18-44, middle-aged adults: 45-64, and older adults: > 65 years old).
   Findings: Sample included 499 individuals (n = 322 age 18-44 years, n = 50 age 45-64 years, and n = 102 age 65-98 years). There were no significant differences between age groups for 9 of the 11 items regarding social impact of robots and comfort with robots. There were no significant differences by age groups for 9 of the 14 items in the NARS. Among those items with statistically significant differences, the mean scores indicate similar sentiments for each group.
   Conclusions: Older, middle-aged, and younger adults had similar attitudes regarding the social impact of and comfort with robots; they also had similar negative attitudes towards robots. Findings dispel current perceptions that older adults are not as receptive to robots as other adults. This has implications for nurses who integrate supportive robots in their practice.
   Clinical Relevance: Nurses working in clinical and community roles can use these findings when developing and implementing robotic solutions. Understanding attitudes towards robots can support how, where, and with whom robots can be used in nursing practice.

AB  - This paper analyses impressions of Fiji in 1961, recorded by two well-known Japanese travel writers: travel journalist Kanetaka Kaoru and writer Kita Morio. Their comments on ethnic Fijians' attitudes to work and on encounters with a variety of Indigenous Fijians, including ratu (hereditary chiefs), made the observed people 'others' informing the travellers' views on post-war colonial Fiji in an era when little was known about Fiji in Japan. Differing views on colonialism underpinned the two authors' views. At the time, Kita and Kanetaka revised but replicated the assumptions of pre-war Japanese writing about Nanyo (the South Seas) and of Western travelogues on the Pacific Islands. While Kita passed blunt and prejudiced judgements, he demonstrated an awareness of colonialism's adverse effects and of concerns also felt by the colonial administration about the place of Indigenous Fijians in the modern world. Kanetaka, seemingly without awareness of her latent prejudice, praised Fiji as a near-perfect colony that benefitted from colonialism.

AB  - The Himalayan wolf Canis sp. and snow leopard Panthera uncia are found in the Nepalese Himalayas where conservation efforts target the latter but not the former. We conducted semistructured questionnaire surveys of 71 residents in upper Humla, upper Dolpa, and Kanchenjunga Conservation Area (KCA) during 2014-2016 to understand people's knowledge, perceptions, attitudes and interactions with these two carnivores. We fitted a cumulative link mixed model to predict Likert scale ordinal responses from a series of Generalized Linear Mixed Models. Overall, attitudes were more positive toward snow leopards than wolves. Livestock depredation was the main predictor of the general negative attitude toward wolves (Estimate = -1.30873; p = .029866) but there was no evidence for an effect for snow leopards (Estimate = -0.3640; p = .631446). Agropastoralists had more negative attitudes than respondents with other occupations toward both carnivores and men had more positive attitudes than women. Among our study areas, respondents in the community-owned KCA had the most positive attitudes. Our findings illustrate the need to reduce human-carnivore conflict through a combined approach of education, mitigation, and economic cost-sharing with respectful engagement of local communities. Specifically, to encourage more villagers to participate in livestock insurance schemes, they should be improved by including all large carnivores and adjusting compensation to the market value of a young replacement of the depredated livestock type. Carnivore conservation interventions should target the whole predator guild to achieve long-term success and to protect the Himalayan ecosystem at large.

AB  - This study models cross-national attitudes towards immigrants in East and Southeast Asia as a signed and weighted bipartite network of countries and evaluative reactions to a variety of political issues, or determinants. This network is then projected into two one-mode networks, one of countries and one of determinants, and community detection methods are applied. The paper aims to fill two deficiencies in the current research on attitudes towards immigrants: 1) the lack of cross-national studies in Asia, a region where migration is growing, and 2) the tendency of researchers to treat determinants as uncorrelated, despite the interdependent nature of evaluative reactions. The results show that the nine countries in the sample are a cohesive clique, showing greater similarities than differences in the determinants of their attitudes. A blockmodeling approach was employed to identify eight determinants in attitudes towards immigrants, namely views on independence and social dependencies, group identities, absolute or relative moral orientation, attitudes towards democracy, science and technology, prejudice and stigma, and two determinants related to religion. However, the findings of this survey yielded some surprising results when compared with the literature review. First, education was not found to be a significant determinants of attitudes towards immigrants, despite its strong and consistent predictive power in European models. Second, prejudice appears to be mediated in part by religion, especially in religious identification and belief in God. Group identity and prejudice also appear to be related, though only weakly. Finally, anxiety appears in clusters related to social norms, suggesting that fears regarding immigrants relates closely to expectations of others' behavior.

AB  - The Social Security Administration's Disability Insurance program encompasses a mammoth adjudicatory and appellate process, rivaling in size the entire federal judiciary. The SSDI is principally governed by validly promulgated regulations, but the SSA also uses an internal manual-"HALLEX"-to provide more detailed rules and guidance to its adjudicators and staff The circuits have split over whether HALLEX is enforceable-whether it can bind the SSA such that violations of its provisions can be grounds for district court reversal. The Ninth and Third Circuits hold HALLEX to be per se unenforceable, with the Ninth categorically refusing to examine alleged violations. The Fifth Circuit, by contrast, will review alleged violations of HALLEX for prejudice and will remand to the SSA if prejudice is present.
   The circuit split results from unclear, decades-old Supreme Court precedent on what kinds of rules under what circumstances courts can enforce to bind agencies. This Note aims to reframe the "enforceability" debate by examining more recent doctrine on internal agency guidance and by outlining how it might interact with the "Accardi principle" underlying that earlier precedent. Specifically, it suggests that typically one-way, agency-invoked doctrines like Auer and Skidmore should be understood more broadly with respect to HALLEX and similar internal guidance, where the public is often the beneficiary of gratuitous protections. This approach provides the Fifth Circuit's approach with more certain doctrinal footing; it also preserves the Fifth Circuit's prejudice test, derived from the Accardi principle, as an essential guiding inquiry. Ultimately, it would promote effective administration and fair agency adjudication.

AB  - Crimes against the historically marginalized Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SC and ST) by the upper castes in India represent an extreme form of prejudice and discrimination. In this paper, we investigate whether changes in relative material standards of living between the SCs/STs and upper castes - as measured by the ratio of consumption expenditures of SCs/STs to that of upper castes - are associated with changes in the incidence of crimes against SCs/STs. Based on the hierarchical social structure implied by the caste system, we posit that an increase in the expenditure ratio is positively correlated with the incidence of crimes committed by the upper castes against the lower castes. Using official district level crime data for the period 2001-2010, we find a positive association between crimes and expenditure of SC/ST vis-a-vis the upper castes. Further, distinguishing between violent and non-violent crimes, we find it is the violent crimes that are responsive to changes in economic gaps. Moreover, this relationship is on account of changes in the upper castes' economic well-being rather than changes in the economic position of the SCs and STs.

AB  - Background As the disease caused by the novel coronavirus has spread globally, there has been significant economic instability in the healthcare systems. This reality was especially accentuated in Ecuador where, the shortage of healthcare workers combined with cultural and macroeconomic factors has led Ecuador to face the most aggressive outbreak in Latin America. In this context, the participation of final-year medical students on the front line is indispensable. Appropriate training on COVID-19 is an urgent requirement that universities and health systems must guarantee. We aimed to describe the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Ecuadorian final-year medical students that could potentially guide the design of better medical education curricula regarding COVID-19. Methods This was a cross-sectional 33-item online survey conducted between April 6 to April 2020 assessing the knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and prognosis toward COVID-19 in Ecuadorian final-year medical students. It was sent by email, Facebook, and WhatsApp. Results A total of 309 students responded to the survey. Out of which 88% of students scored high (>= 70% correct) for knowledge of the disease. The majority of students were pessimistic about possible government actions, which is reflected in the negative attitude towards the control of COVID-19 and volunteering during the outbreak in Ecuador (77%, and 58% of the students, respectively). Moreover, 91% of students said they did not have adequate protective equipment. The latter finding was significantly associated with negative attitudes. Conclusions Although a large number of students displayed negative attitudes, the non-depreciable percentage of students who were willing to volunteer and the coexisting high level of knowledge displayed by students, suggests that Ecuador has a capable upcoming workforce that could benefit from an opportunity to strengthen, improve and advance their training in preparation for COVID-19. Not having personal protective equipment was significantly associated to negative attitudes. Providing the necessary tools and creating a national curriculum may be one of the most effective ways to ensure all students are trained, whilst simultaneously focusing on the students' most pressing concerns. With this additional training, negative attitudes will improve and students will be better qualified.

AB  - Deep canvasing is an effective organizing tactic that uses story-sharing to increase public support for equity issues. This correlational study examines 2,240 deep canvass conversations a community organization had with voters about a decarceration ballot initiative considered in Los Angeles County's March 2020 election. We analyzed the relationships between story-sharing and emotional expression on increased support for the initiative using multivariate regression. The results suggest that story-sharing does predict attitude change, but only when combined with emotional expression. This study implies that organizers may increase their efficacy by utilizing narratives to facilitate the expression of emotions about political issues.

AB  - Background: It has been reported that the majority of individuals with mental illnesses (MIs) do not seek help. Few studies have focused on correlates of a positive attitude toward professional help-seeking for MI. This study aimed to determine levels of knowledge, perception, and attitudes toward MI, determine attitudes toward mental health help-seeking, and identify sociodemographic predictors of correct knowledge and favorable attitudes among the Saudi public.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 650 Saudi adults aged >18 years who attended the Saudi Jenadriyah annual cultural and heritage festival during February 2016. The previously validated Attitudes to Mental Illness Questionnaire was used. Attitude to professional help-seeking was also assessed, using a tool retrieved from the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview part II. Multiple regression analyses were applied, and statistical significance considered at P<0.05.
   Results: The majority of the Saudi public reported lack of knowledge about the nature of MI (87.5%, percentage mean score [PMS] 45.02 +/- 19.98), negative perception (59%, PMS 59.76 +/- 9.16), negative attitudes to MI (66.5%, PMS 65.86 +/- 7.77), and negative attitudes to professional help-seeking (54.5%, PMS 62.45 +/- 8.54). Marital status was a predictor of knowledge (t=-3.12, P=0.002), attitudes to MI (t=2.93, P=0.003), and attitudes to help-seeking (t=2.20, P=0.03). Attitudes to help-seeking were also predicted by sex (t=-2.72, P=0.007), employment (t=3.05, P=0.002), and monthly income (t=2.79, P=0.005). Perceptions toward the mentally ill were not predicted by these socioeconomic characteristics (P>0.05).
   Conclusion: The Saudi public reported lack of knowledge of MI and stigmatizing attitudes toward people with MI in relation to treatment, work, marriage, and recovery and toward professional help-seeking. Sociodemographic characteristics predicted correct knowledge and favorable attitudes, while Saudi culture was the likely factor behind negative judgments about mentally ill persons. Efforts to challenge this negative publicity and stigma through antistigma campaigns and public education through schools and media are recommended.

Results suggest that working on-campus during college was positively associated with increased interactions with diverse peers for both the full student sample and for several racial/ethnic subsamples. Additionally, working off-campus was positively associated with increased interactions with diverse peers for one racial/ethnic subsample.

AB  - Given the prevalence of online media today, credibility continues to be a popular subject of empirical research. However, studies examining the effects of discrediting strategies are rare. This issue is significant given the popularity of online media and the ease of such sources to spread misinformation. Therefore, the present study examines the effects of attacking the expertise and trustworthiness of a proponent of a major social issue. Results showed that support as well specific combinations of discrediting attack strategies significantly reduced message board readers' perceptions of the proponent's credibility. In addition, attacks on either the proponent's expertise or trustworthiness resulted in a reduced likelihood of readers taking action with respect to the issue.

AB  - Objective. To analyze commercial sex work's social representations among Brazilian women who identify as transvestite or transsexual. Methods: A qualitative study with a descriptive and analytical approach based on the Theoretical Paradigm of Social Representation with a structural approach. The sample group was formed by 100 women who defined themselves as transvestite and transsexual in Santa Catarina, Brazil. The data was gathered from September to December 2016 via a questionnaire using the technique of free association of words, as well as semi-directed interviews. Results: Through both prototypical and content analysis, it was confirmed that the most likely elements that formed the core of the social representation were: violence, drugs, risk, work, sadness, prejudice, and danger. In the objectification/objectivation process of commercial sex work, the image shows a mix between daily activities in the streets - which they consider to be their battlefield - and their own feelings and experiences of vulnerability in other areas of society, starting with families, churches, schools and the like. Conclusions: By experiencing commercial sex work, female transvestite and transsexual individuals reveal how the elements that form the social representation are of paramount importance in the legitimation, legalization, and simplification of their identities.

KW  - KNOWLEDGE
AB  - Background: There is a recognised need for targeted community-wide mental health strategies and interventions aimed specifically at prevention and early intervention in promoting mental health. Young males are a high need group who hold particularly negative attitudes towards mental health services, and these views are detrimental for early intervention and help-seeking. Organised sports provide a promising context to deliver community-wide mental health strategies and interventions to adolescent males. The aim of the Ahead of the Game program is to test the effectiveness of a multi-component, community-sport based program targeting prevention, promotion and early intervention for mental health among adolescent males.
   Methods: The Ahead of the Game program will be implemented within a sample drawn from community sporting clubs and evaluated using a sample drawn from a matched control community. Four programs are proposed, including two targeting adolescents, one for parents, and one for sports coaches. One adolescent program aims to increase mental health literacy, intentions to seek and/or provide help for mental health, and to decrease stigmatising attitudes. The second adolescent program aims to increase resilience. The goal of the parent program is to increase parental mental health literacy and confidence to provide help. The coach program is intended to increase coaches' supportive behaviours (e.g., autonomy supportive behaviours), and in turn facilitate high-quality motivation and wellbeing among adolescents. Programs will be complemented by a messaging campaign aimed at adolescents to enhance mental health literacy. The effects of the program on adolescent males' psychological distress and wellbeing will also be explored.
   Discussion: Organised sports represent a potentially engaging avenue to promote mental health and prevent the onset of mental health problems among adolescent males. The community-based design, with samples drawn from an intervention and a matched control community, enables evaluation of adolescent males' incremental mental health literacy, help-seeking intentions, stigmatising attitudes, motivation, and resilience impacts from the multi-level, multi-component Ahead of the Game program. Notable risks to the study include self-selection bias, the non-randomised design, and the translational nature of the program. However, strengths include extensive community input, as well as the multi-level and multi-component design.

AB  - The current study examined the relationship between interracial anxiety and White privilege remorse among a sample of 145 White graduate students enrolled in counseling and psychology programs dedicated to multicultural training. An additive moderation model was used to simultaneously test the moderating effects of internal and external motivation to control prejudice on the link between interracial anxiety and White privilege remorse. Results suggest that in the face of interracial anxiety, mild to moderate concerns about appearing racist could be enough to hinder students' strong internal commitment to nonracist values. Implications regarding ways that training programs can support students as they work with diverse clients and navigate White privilege are discussed.

TI  - The Constitutional Challenge to Teacher Tenure
T2  - CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW
LA  - English

KW  - SCHOOLS
KW  - MATTER
KW  - RACE
KW  - EQUALITY
KW  - POVERTY
AB  - Reformers argue that ineffective teaching is the linchpin of educational inequality and failure. Starting in 2010, they successfully sought important changes in teacher evaluation systems at the state and federal levels. But tenure, a fundamental source of teachers' strength to resist more aggressive reform, remained in place. Thus, in 2012, reformers theorized a novel constitutional strategy to eliminate tenure. They argued that tenure leads to the retention of ineffective teachers, and that ineffective teaching deprives students of the constitutional right to education embedded in state constitutions. This theory immediately caught hold, with a California trial court striking down tenure in 2014 and litigation commencing in other states weeks thereafter.
   The outcome of this litigation movement will determine both the future of the teaching profession and the scope of the constitutional right to education. To date, however, no high court or scholar has thoroughly analyzed the theory. This Article offers that first analysis, concluding that the constitutional challenge to tenure raises a theoretically valid claim but lacks a sufficient empirical basis. At the theoretical level, the tenure challenge easily falls within broadly worded precedent that establishes students' constitutional right to an equal and adequate education. If ineffective teaching deprives students of equal or adequate education, state constitutions should protect against it. But in the context of school funding cases-where the relevant precedent first developed-courts have demanded that litigants precisely demonstrate multiple aspects of causation and harm. Evidence on causation and harm is lacking in regard to tenure.
   This split between theory and fact requires courts to proceed cautiously. Rejecting current tenure challenges on their face would unfairly prejudice future legal challenges to teacher quality, particularly those predicated on potential empirical advances in social science. A facial rejection would also require courts to narrow the existing scope of the constitutional right to education. This narrowing would negatively affect education rights in other important and developing contexts. The solution is to insist on more detailed evidence to support plaintiffs' causal theories and presumed remedies. By doing so, courts can validate students' constitutional right to education without venturing into unsettled policy debates.

AB  - The aim of this study is to demonstrate effectiveness of mobile game called SOS Table in the context of the subject "Tenses in English" within the framework of mobile learning tools acceptance, learning language motivation and mobile learning attitude of the students. The target group of the research consists of preparatory class students of a school of foreign languages in a state university in Turkey. The research was carried out with mixed method research. The quantitative paradigm-based section of this study was designed with a single-group pre-test and post-test model. In this model, three different scales were applied to the participants. The participants used the SOS Table mobile game developed by the researchers for 8 weeks. After the applications, semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven participants. The quantitative data of the study were analyzed with paired sampled t-Test and the qualitative data were subjected to thematic content analysis. The results of the study indicated that the mobile application named SOS Table increased both the mobile learning tools acceptance of the participants and motivation in English, and mediated the positive attitude development for mobile learning in English. The qualitative data obtained also supported these findings.

AB  - Background People with albinism (PWA) are targets of prejudice and social exclusion and have limited access to specialized medical care and resources. Our study aimed to describe the epidemiological and dermatological profile of PWA in Togo. Method We carried out a cross-sectional study of 294 medical records of PWA systematically examined during two mobile skin care clinics in 2019. Results The mean age of the patients was 22 +/- 16.5 years, and the gender ratio (M/F) was 1. A family history of albinism was reported in 27.9% of cases, and consanguinity between the parents was found in 24.1% of PWA. Dermatological lesions on physical examination were present in 95.2% of PWA. These lesions were elastosis/wrinkles (82.9%), ephelides (79.6%), actinic keratoses (60.0%), actinic cheilitis (50.0%), and cutaneous carcinomas (11.8%). The mean age of PWA with skin carcinomas was 38.6 years. Fifty-four cases of cutaneous carcinomas had been diagnosed (31 cases of basal cell carcinoma, 21 cases of squamous cell carcinoma, and 2 cases of Bowen's disease) and were located mainly in the cephalic region (61.1%) and upper limbs (27.8%). Cryotherapy and/or excisional biopsies were the treatments for premalignant and malignant lesions. All PWA were sensitized on sun protection. Conclusions This study shows the basic picture of dermatological characteristics of PWA with a high frequency of photo-induced lesions and skin cancers. The popularization and respect of photoprotection measures and regular skin examination of these PWA for early detection and management of lesions will reduce their morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Objective In a previous study, we found that patients who were offered the possibility of participation in a clinical trial had unexpressed concerns and fears that prevented them from making free or fully knowledgeable choices about their trial participation. In a selected population of patients who were offered participation in a phase I trial, we prospectively investigated whether a face-to-face discussion about their unexpressed fears might lead to a more conscious decision about whether to accept/refuse participation in the trial. Methods After the presentation of the trial, a questionnaire was administered to assess the presence of specific fears. Before the patients decided whether to participate in the trial, they discussed any fears that they had; finally, the impact of the discussion on the patients' choice to participate was evaluated. Results The majority (86%) of the patients thought that physicians conduct clinical trials for scientific interest, 13% felt exploited as 'guinea pigs' and 20% believed they were offered participation because they had no further hope for improvement. These existing fears were not elicited during the trial interview because the patients were themselves unaware of having them (28%) and because of fear of the doctors (3%). The possibility of discussing these fears was felt as an opportunity and made patients feel more conscious (92%) and freer (97%) when making their choice. Conclusions Recognising and discussing misconceptions and fears, often unexpressed, make patients freer and more aware when facing the choice of whether or not \to participate in a phase I clinical trial.

AB  - Diversity - in the nominal sense of widening access to education beyond majority group interests - is a stated objective for many institutions of higher education worldwide. However, different narratives of national and institutional identity play a role in how programmes of diversity are conceived. In recent university reforms initiated in Japan by MEXT (Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology), the drive to internationalize universities through increasing the number of foreign students, faculty and collaborations runs alongside an historical and reactionary othering of rational and critical thinking as "western learning." By contrast, for universities in the "west" the pursuit of diversity is considered an affirmation of the university as a site of civil and rational discourse, in which the welcoming of different voices is considered in terms of being both a moral imperative and institutional asset. Using Bill Readings' 1996 critique of the modern university as a bureaucratic corporation, "The University in Ruins" as a reference point, the dissonance between the policy goal of diversity and what may actually happen in a classroom is discussed here from personal experience of teaching the history of photography, and other subjects, in Japanese Universities. Modes of classroom interaction and the role of the teacher, beyond culture-specific models, are interrogated, and finally discussed in relation to a holistic view of education espoused in the teaching methodologies of Charles A. Curran and Caleb Gattegno.

AB  - Introduction Studies suggest that medical doctors can suffer from substantial levels of mental ill-health. Little is known about military doctors' mental health and well-being; we therefore assessed attitudes to mental health, self-stigma, psychological distress and help-seeking among UK Armed Forces doctors.
   Methods Six hundred and seventy-eight military doctors (response rate 59%) completed an anonymous online survey. Comparisons were made with serving and ex-military personnel (n=1448, response rate 84.5%) participating in a mental health-related help-seeking survey. Basic sociodemographic data were gathered, and participants completed measures of mental health-related stigmatisation, perceived barriers to care and the 12-Item General Health Questionnaire. All participants were asked if in the last threeyears they had experienced stress, emotional, mental health, alcohol, family or relationship problems, and whether they had sought help from formal sources.
   Results Military doctors reported fewer mental disorder symptoms than the comparison groups. They endorsed higher levels of stigmatising beliefs, negative attitudes to mental healthcare, desire to self-manage and self-stigmatisation than each of the comparison groups. They were most concerned about potential negative effects of and peer perceptions about receiving a mental disorder diagnosis. Military doctors reporting historical and current relationship, and alcohol or mental health problems were significantly and substantially less likely to seek help than the comparison groups.
   Conclusions Although there are a number of study limitations, outcomes suggest that UK military doctors report lower levels of mental disorder symptoms, higher levels of stigmatising beliefs and a lower propensity to seek formal support than other military reference groups.

AB  - Drawing from the intergroup contact model and self-categorization theory, the authors advanced the novel hypothesis of a valence-salience effect, whereby negative contact causes higher category salience than positive contact. As predicted, in a laboratory experiment of interethnic contact, White Australians (N = 49) made more frequent and earlier reference to ethnicity when describing their ethnic contact partner if she had displayed negative (vs. positive, neutral) nonverbal behavior. In a two-wave experimental study of retrieved intergenerational contact, American young adults (N = 240) reported age to be more salient during negative (vs. positive) contact and negative contact predicted increased episodic and chronic category salience over time. Some evidence for the reverse salience-valence effect was also found. Because category salience facilitates contact generalization, these results suggest that intergroup contact is potentially biased toward worsening intergroup relations; further implications for theory and policy making are discussed.

AB  - In this article I show that the form of argument put forward by the climate change denial movement in the United States (US) closely resembles that used in Nazi Germany with regard to Nazi racial definitions. Each involves a rejection of scientific method. This rejection inherently lends itself to far-right politics, which is a philosophy of prejudice. The prevalence of such a philosophy in contemporary American political culture, exemplified through climate change denial, has arguably opened the door for a president of Trump's type. Nevertheless, the US Constitution is far more difficult to suspend than that of the Weimar Republic. As a result, US institutional safeguards against a philosophy of prejudice are likely to hold against a short-term assault on environmental justice in a way that the Weimar Republic's constitutional order did not against Nazism's assault on civil rights. The greater threat to environmental protection in the contemporary US situation is the slow erosion of democratic norms by the Trump administration.

AB  - Does pre-existing preference based on skin tone, facial features, and other observable characteristics, i.e., phenotypic preference, affect immigrant voters' support for political candidates competing in their countries of origin? Do these preferences change as migrants' tenure in their host society increases? These questions are important for ethnic and racial politics in general, and particularly for the sizable foreign-born population in the United States, which includes 11 million Mexicans. Using a unique, random sample of foreign-born Mexicans in San Diego County, we employ a voting experiment to test the impact of skin tone and phenotype on vote choice among first generation immigrants. Our design allows us to distinguish responses to different phenotypic cues by exposing respondents to European, mestizo, and indigenous looking candidates competing in a hypothetical Mexican election. Migrants showed higher support for the Indigenous candidate, and evaluated the European and Mestizo candidates as more ideologically conservative. As migrants' time in the United States increases, the preference for indigenous features gives way to a preference for whiteness, which we interpret as evidence of first generation migrants adopting the dominant racial ideology of the United States. While ethnic distinctions have long been viewed as a key component of voting behavior, our research demonstrates that, even within a single ethnicity, racial differences may have profound impacts on the evaluation of and support for electoral candidates. This study contributes to the research on race and political behavior in comparative perspective, as well as the political consequences of migration.

AB  - Stigma is a substantial obstacle when caring for people with mental illness. Nursing students' negative attitudes towards people with mental illness may impact the quality of care delivered and consequentially patient outcomes. In this study, we assessed the stigmatising attitudes and beliefs of nursing students towards people with mental illness and examined its relationship with several psycho-socio-demographic variables. This was a quantitative, cross-sectional descriptive correlational study, which was developed with a non-probabilistic convenience sample of 110 nursing students. Stigmatising attitudes and beliefs were assessed using the Portuguese version of the Attribution Questionnaire AQ-27. Results show that the dimensions of stigma with higher scores were help, pity, coercion and avoidance. However, significant differences were only observed depending on the year of study (fourth-year students, who already had clinical placements in this area, are less likely to show stigma), the relationship (family is less prone to show coercion), the history of mental health treatment (students with a history of mental health treatment have more tendency to help) and whether they considered working in the mental health field (students who have considered working in this field are less prone to show anger, avoidance and think of patients as dangerous). Therefore, we conclude that education in a classroom setting alone is not enough to reduce stigma in nursing students, clinical placement in the area is required to achieve such results. It is thus essential to improve nursing curricula worldwide so that students are exposed to both psychiatric nursing theory and clinical practice in the first years of the nursing degree.

TI  - A Neo-Confucian Criticism of Daoism: Wang Fuzhi's Contradictory Remarks on the Laozi
T2  - FRONTIERS OF PHILOSOPHY IN CHINA
LA  - English
KW  - Laozi
KW  - Wang Fuzhi
KW  - Laozi Yan
AB  - Based on Zhu Xi's statement that Laozi's teachings were very cruel, Wang Fuzhi condemned Laozi as a crafty, petty person in his Confucian commentaries. Yet, he had to understand the Laozi or Daodejing sympathetically when he commented on it in Laozi Yan (Extended Commentary on the Laozi). As a result, he showed inconsistency in his criticism and evaluation of the author. Some scholars have noted this problem but have not shed ink analyzing it. This essay finds that Wang Fuzhi's ambiguous attitude toward Laozi results from his Confucian prejudice against other schools and his failure to grasp the breadth and depth of Laozi's thought. From the perspective of Heaven, Laozi promoted accommodation and non-interference in self-cultivation and governance, summed up by the maxim that "the sage manages affairs without deliberation, and spreads teachings without words." In contrast, Wang Fuzhi stuck to the distinction between Confucianism and Daoism, and tried to use humanity and ritual propriety to supplement that which Heaven does not provide; as such, he criticized Laozi as crafty and irresponsible. Wang Fuzhi's criticism neither hits the mark regarding Laozi's weakness nor maintains a concordance with his earlier sympathetic appraisal in Laozi Yan; the reason for this is that Wang Fuzhi could not fully grasp Laozi's thought from a Confucian and anthropocentric perspective.

AB  - Second couplehood in old age is a growing phenomenon alongside increases in life expectancy. Lately, a shift has occurred in that individual diversity of ageing is perceived to depend on the physical and social contexts in which older persons experience change. Thus, the purpose of the study on which this paper reports was to examine second couplehood in the context of old age and old age in the context of second couplehood using an existential-phenomenological theoretical orientation. Twenty couples were recruited using criterion-sampling: men aged 65+ and women aged 60+, with children and grandchildren from a lifelong marriage that had ended in widowhood or divorce, living in second couplehood - married or not - in separate houses or co-habitating. Forty individual semi-structured interviews were tape-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed according to phenomenological tradition. Five sub-themes emerged, demonstrating couplehood and old age intertwining: (a) enjoying life while still possible; (b) living with health-related issues; (c) relationships with adult children: autonomy versus dependency; (d) loneliness: living as a couple is better than living alone; (e) self-image: feeling young-feeling old. Findings support the existence of positive and negative aspects of old age. Our discussion suggests the need to replace perceptions of old age as either a negative burden or a positive asset towards a period of balancing between gains and losses. Furthermore, we acknowledge the role of second couplehood in older peoples' wellbeing on the personal-micro level through love, the familial-mezzo level through care-giving and the social-macro level by reducing prejudice.

AB  - It has been argued that supporting a restrictive view on the inclusion of immigrants finds its origin in a localized feeling of group identity. We test this hypothesis with a household survey in the Belgian city of Ghent (n = 3735). The results show that local and national identities are salient, but also that regional, European, and cosmopolitan identities are supported simultaneously. Especially the regional, Flemish identity is strongly associated with a restrictive, ethnic attitude toward new groups in society. A European identity was not significantly associated with this restrictive attitude. Our conclusion is that not just the geographical scale of group identity is important in explaining anti-immigrant sentiments. The specific historical connotations of every geographical level should be considered. A comparison between generations, i.e. parents and their late adolescent children, suggests that this association between specific group identities and ethnic citizenship norms is equally present among younger cohorts.

AB  - How should toymakers represent a diverse society? Surprisingly, given the force of recent debates over race and nation and over migration, multiculturalism, and the postcolonial condition of Europe and North America, there is relatively little scholarship on how the toy industry engages with these particular themes. This article seeks to remedy this by taking a single toy company, Playmobil, as a case study for exploring the politics of racial and ethnic difference in its toys and marketing materials. It argues that the company, in an effort to diversify its products without alienating wary customers, has incorporated difference through specific strategies that elide and thereby reinforce an implicitly white, majoritarian norm, following a pattern of "banal multiculturalism" (Thomas 2011). By exploring these strategies in detail and by tying them to longstanding historical patterns, this study will suggest how companies can more critically challenge their own exclusionary practices of representation.

AB  - In accord with Healthy People 2020 goals, the elimination of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQQ) health disparities will require community-level strategies to address stigma, discrimination, and prejudice linked to poor health. We explored how young sexual minority women (YSMW) define LGBTQQ community, community connection, community engagement, and community tensions because these concepts have implications for development and evaluation of health disparities interventions. A total of 30 YSMW (aged 18-24 years) from Michigan participated in semistructured, in-depth interviews. Participants varied by sexual identity, residency, and race/ethnicity. We analyzed transcribed interviews using thematic analysis and compared emergent themes across sexual identity, residency, and race/ethnicity. Women described community connection in terms of organizational involvement, participation in LGBTQQ spaces, and collective social identity. Participants noted how community connections were linked to stigma towards the LGBTQQ community. YSMW highlighted how divisive tensions exist within subgroups constituting the LGBTQQ community, hindering opportunities for social advocacy, unified policy priorities, and community-level interventions. The heterogeneity of YSMW's experiences identifying with the LGBTQQ community and engaging within LGBTQQ spaces suggest that researchers should attend to the role of community dynamics when developing health disparities interventions and policies. Efforts to reconcile tensions within the LGBTQQ community may strengthen and advance policymakers' ability to address sexuality-related disparities.

AB  - This article briefly describes how psychology, psychiatry, and the mental health professions (here collectively referred to as Psychology) treated sexual orientation differences as deficits for much of the 20th century, as well as some of the negative consequences that practice had for sexual minorities. The 1970s witnessed a remarkable turnaround when the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and the American Psychological Association called for psychologists to work to remove the stigma historically associated with homosexuality. This history illustrates not only how cultural institutions play a central role in legitimating stigma, but also how they can recognize their own complicity in this process and work effectively to undo its harmful effects. It is argued that Psychology still has an important role to play in challenging the differences-as-deficits model in contemporary policy debates.

AB  - Using data from the 2012 Survey of Public Participation in the Arts, I investigate whether education's influence on the likelihood of visual and performing arts attendance in the USA varies by race-ethnicity. The results reveal education increases the odds of attendance for both Whites and non-Whites, but it has a stronger impact upon the former than the latter. Unlike Whites, education's affect on attending visual and performing arts activities for non-Whites is insignificant for high school diploma recipients when compared to their counterparts with some college education. These findings suggest a racial-ethnic bias in visual and performing arts attendance net of education that connects to the European roots of "legitimate" art in modern western society and the history of US racial discrimination. European Americans have dominated the USA's social institutions for centuries and have held prejudices against minorities' artistic capabilities since the colonial era. Consequentially, they could determine which arts genres provide valuable cultural capital. Conversely, minority art communities have only recently acquired the resources for self-sustainability. This likely limited their ability to develop formal institutions within their own communities to support the arts.

AB  - Objective: This study explored the attitudes to, and experience of, menopause among Macedonian women living in Australia, including attitudes and responses to hormone therapy (HT) and complementary therapies, as well as related psycho-sexual, relationship and other midlife issues.
   Methods: Using qualitative methodology, the study was based on seven unstructured, nondirective group discussions. Natural social groups were recruited, meeting wherever each group felt most at home. A total of 81 participants ranged in age from 45 to 75 years. The women included both first-generation immigrants and women born in Australia to Macedonian parents. A bilingual Macedonian researcher conducted the fieldwork.
   Results: Participants typically claimed they lacked information about menopause in their native language, and their knowledge of HT was highly variable. Some women only felt comfortable approaching Macedonian doctors. Others reported an easing of symptoms when they revisited their homeland. Deeply religious participants claimed their faith helped them through this phase of life, and that they were as likely to consult a priest as a doctor. A recurring theme was that Macedonian men tended to regard their wives differently after menopause, sometimes treating them as "non-sexual.'' Women regarded this shift in male attitudes as a precipitating factor in domestic violence, extramarital affairs and divorce. Symptoms such as hot flashes and mood swings were associated with negative attitudes toward menopause.
   Conclusions: Culturally determined attitudes appear to affect the perception and experience of menopause. Other influencing factors include migration, women's roles, marital status, religion, use of herbal and traditional remedies, social situation, access to information, knowledge and experience of menopausal symptoms.

KW  - Attitude
KW  - Media
KW  - Medical students
KW  - Mental illness
KW  - Stigma
AB  - Background: Society's attitude towards patients with mental illness has been evolving over the past century and the speed of this evolution has particularly accelerated since the advent of modern ways of communication and media. As with other areas of development, attitude change may be expected to be slow-paced in our country but local evidence is lacking in this regard.
   Objective: To measure the level of stigma towards mental illness in medical students along with its association with their prior exposure to Psychiatry.
   Method: This is across-sectional study conducted between May to August 2019 at a private medical college. Consecutive sampling was used to include a total of 247 (71% female and 29% male) students of the fourth and final year MBBS after written informed consent. A specially designed form was used to collect relevant socio-demographic details along with data regarding exposure to Psychiatry. The scores from self-reported Mental Illness: Clinicians' Attitudes scale (MICA)were also recorded. Chi-Square test was used to assess the association of exposure to psychiatry to stigmatizing attitudes. Data were analyzed using SPSS20.
   Results: Prior exposure to mental illness in family or friend was reported by 60.5% of the students, 70% described an exposure through media and only 32% had undergone a clinical psychiatry rotation. Average stigma scores on MICA were found in 41% of our sample, while 32% had above-average scores and 27% had lower than average stigma. Pearson' schi-square test showed that the previous exposure to mental illness via media sources was found to be significantly associated with lower levels of stigma in medical students (p= <0.05).
   Conclusion: A significant proportion of medical students hold negative views about psychiatric illness. Familiarity with mental health issue through media sources is linked to lower stigmatizing attitudes.

AB  - Ancient rhetorical theorists described figured speech (oratio figurata) as a strategy for expressing criticism safely, through a screen of ambiguity. I argue that Cicero's Pro Balbo can be read as figured, communicating criticism of Pompey. Cicero's panegyric to Pompey in this speech would have appeared to be factually accurate and commendable to pro-Pompeian members of the audience, but factually wrong or even insincere to anti-Pompeians. Multiple readings of Cicero's intentions are latent as possible interpretations of the speech because of political divisions and divergent prejudices at the time of its delivery.

TI  - Language revitalization, video, and mobile social media: A case study from the Khroskyabs language amongst Tibetans in China
T2  - LANGUAGE DOCUMENTATION & CONSERVATION
LA  - English
AB  - Technology is by no means the most important channel to maintain a language, but it is an effective mode to communicate and interact using the language. As the lives of Khroskyabs speakers continue to be modernized, fewer and fewer aspects of those lives will take place in Khroskyabs. Furthermore, Khroskyabs speakers tend to express negative attitudes towards their language, especially in comparison to the dominant national language - Mandarin - and the local prestige language - Tibetan. The Mothertongue Film on Mobile Social Media project aims to expand the Khroskyabs language into a new domain amongst its speakers by creating a series of videos in the language and sharing them on social media-WeChat. The emerging use of social media such as WeChat provides a platform for language use in the contemporary context for unrecognized and under-resourced languages like Khroskyabs. This project aimed to address these issues, of domain exclusion and negative attitudes, through the production of mobile digital media that can be freely and conveniently shared via the social media platform WeChat for consumption of people in the Khroskyabs-speaking community.

FX  - I am a native speaker of Khroskyabs, from Siyuewu Village in Rngaba Prefecture, Sichuan Province, China. I was born and raised in the village and recently graduated from the University of Oregon with a linguistics degree. I began making videos about my community whilst in high school. I would like to thank and acknowledge my community for their ongoing support. I would also like to acknowledge the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage (SCFCH) and the Northwest Indian Language Institute (NILI) at the University of Oregon for their financial and institutional support for the Mothertongue Film on Mobile Social Media Project. The writing of this article was supported by a seed-funding grant from the China Studies Research Centre at La Trobe University (Australia). In the near future, I hope to come up with many other ways to preserve Khroskyabs people's customs, culture, and language.

AB  - Based on a survey of 593 lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people in the United Kingdom, this study shows that direct anti-LGBT hate crimes (measured by direct experiences of victimization) and indirect anti-LGBT hate crimes (measured by personally knowing other victims of hate crime) are highly prolific and frequent experiences for LGBT people. Our findings show that trans people are particularly susceptible to hate crimes, both in terms of prevalence and frequency. This article additionally highlights the negative emotional and (intended) behavioral reactions that were correlated with an imagined hate crime scenario, showing that trans people are more likely to experience heightened levels of threat, vulnerability, and anxiety compared with non-trans LGB people. The study found that trans people are also more likely to feel unsupported by family, friends, and society for being LGBT, which was correlated with the frequency of direct (verbal) abuse they had previously endured. The final part of this study explores trans people's confidence levels in the Government, the police, and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in relation to addressing hate crime. In general, trans people felt that the police are not effective at policing anti-LGBT hate crime, and they are not respectful toward them as victims; this was especially true where individuals had previous contact with the police. Respondents were also less confident in the CPS to prosecute anti-LGBT hate crimes, though the level of confidence was slightly higher when respondents had direct experience with the CPS. The empirical evidence presented here supports the assertion that all LGBT people, but particularly trans individuals, continue to be denied equal participation in society due to individual, social, and structural experiences of prejudice. The article concludes by arguing for a renewed policy focus that must address this issue as a public health problem.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the factors influencing mental health nurses' attitudes towards people with mental illness. A descriptive correlation design was used. A sample of 180 Taiwanese mental health nurses was recruited from mental health-care settings. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, Pearson's product-moment correlation, Student's t-test, one-way ANOVA, and a hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Negative attitudes were found among mental health nurses, especially with respect to individuals with substance abuse compared with those with schizophrenia and major depression. Mental health nurses who were older, had more clinical experiences in mental health care, and demonstrated greater empathy expressed more positive attitudes towards people with mental illness. Mental health nurses working at acute psychiatric units demonstrated more negative attitudes towards mental illness compared with those working in psychiatric rehabilitation units and outpatient clinics or community psychiatric rehabilitation centres. Particularly, length of mental health nursing practice and empathy significantly accounted for mental health nurses' attitudes towards mental illness. Understanding nurses' attitudes and their correlates towards people with mental illness is critical to deliver effective mental health nursing care.

AB  - This study examined factors that predicted children's gender intergroup attitudes at age 5 and the implications of these attitudes for intergroup behavior. Ethnically diverse children from low-income backgrounds (N = 246; Mexican-, Chinese-, Dominican-, and African American) were assessed at ages 4 and 5. On average, children reported positive same-gender and negative other-gender attitudes. Positive same-gender attitudes were associated with knowledge of gender stereotypes. In contrast, positive other-gender attitudes were associated with flexibility in gender cognitions (stereotype flexibility, gender consistency). Other-gender attitudes predicted gender-biased behavior. These patterns were observed in all ethnic groups. These findings suggest that early learning about gender categories shape young children's gender attitudes and that these gender attitudes already have consequences for children's intergroup behavior at age 5.

AB  - In this study, the aim was to construct a significant structural measurement model comparing students' affective characteristics with their mathematic achievement. According to this model, the aim was to test the measurement invariances between gender sub-groups hierarchically. This study was conducted as basic and descriptive research. Secondary level analyses were conducted on the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2012 Turkish student questionnaire data. The sample consisted of 4,848 fifteen-year-old students from 170 schools and 12 statistical territories. For analysis techniques, regression analysis, exploratory, and confirmatory factor analyses were executed in order to construct a significant initial measurement model. Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis was executed to analyse the invariance between gender sub-groups. According to the results, taking into consideration the limitations of the model which was constructed in this study, it was observed that strong invariance between gender sub-groups was provided. This finding indicates that there are similarities of affective characteristics for fifteen-year-old Turkish students across gender sub-groups. The results can be evaluated as evidence that the possibility of bias or prejudice in students' affective characteristics toward mathematics is not high.

AB  - Aims and objectivesTo investigate the smoking behaviours, perceptions about quitting smoking and factors associated with intention to quit in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
   BackgroundSmoking causes type 2 diabetes mellitus. There has been limited research on the needs and concerns of smokers with type 2 diabetes mellitus about quitting smoking.
   DesignThe study used a qualitative design.
   MethodsPatients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had a history of smoking were recruited at the outpatient diabetic clinics of two major local hospitals in Hong Kong for a semi-structured interview (n=42), guided by the theory of planned behaviour.
   ResultsAt data saturation, 22 current smokers and 20 ex-smokers with type 2 diabetes mellitus were recruited. The current smokers reported they had not quit smoking because of satisfaction with present health status, and misconceptions about the association between diabetes and smoking, and the perceived hazards of quitting. In contrast, ex-smokers had a positive opinion about quitting smoking, accepted advice about quitting from health professionals and received more family support than current smokers. Psychological addiction and weight gain after cessation made quitting challenging.
   ConclusionsSatisfaction with health status, inadequate knowledge about the relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus and smoking, and misconceptions about quitting smoking resulted in negative attitudes toward quitting by type 2 diabetes mellitus smokers. Smoking peers, psychological addiction and post-cessation weight gain hindered the quitting process.
   Relevance to clinical practiceEducation on the causal link between smoking, type 2 diabetes mellitus and its complications is important to raise health awareness and counter misconceptions about quitting smoking. Behavioural counselling with weight control strategies should be part of a comprehensive smoking cessation intervention for type 2 diabetes mellitus smokers.

AB  - Antifat attitudes refer to stereotyping based on people's weight. A potential explanation for the strong negative attitudes toward obese individuals relates to people's emotional reactions. In this study, conducted with 373 female students, it is suggested that physical disgust, germ aversion and perceived controllability of weight play a central role in explaining the individual differences that exist in antifat attitudes. Our results showed a positive relationship between physical disgust and germ aversion. Additionally, it has been found a positive correlation between physical disgust and perceived controllability of weight. Furthermore, a positive relationship between antifat attitudes, physical disgust and germ aversion was found. Finally, perceived controllability of weight was positively related to antifat attitudes. The path analysis conducted showed the mediational effect of perceived controllability of weight in the relationship between physical disgust and antifat attitudes. Finally, it is discussed the results in the frame of antifat attitudes literature.

AB  - An extensive literature documents racial discrimination in housing, focusing on its prevalence and effect on non-White populations. This article studies how such discrimination operates, and the intermediaries who engage in it: landlords. A fundamental assumption of racial discrimination research is that gatekeepers such as landlords are confronted with a racially heterogeneous applicant pool. The reality of urban housing markets, however, is that historical patterns of residential segregation intersect with other structural barriers to drive selection into the applicant pool, such that landlords are more often selecting between same-race applicants. Using interviews and observations with 157 landlords in four cities, we ask: how do landlords construct their tenants' race within racially segmented housing markets, and how does this factor into their screening processes? We find that landlords distinguish between tenants based on the degree to which their behavior conforms to insidious cultural narratives at the intersection of race, gender, and class. Landlords with large portfolios rely on screening algorithms, whereas mom-and-pop landlords make decisions based on informal mechanisms such as "gut feelings," home visits, and the presentation of children. Landlords may put aside certain racial prejudices when they have the right financial incentives, but only when the tenant also defies stereotypes. In this way, landlords' intersectional construction of race-even within a predominantly Black or Latino tenant pool-limits residential options for low-income, subsidized tenants of color, burdening their search process. These findings have implications for how we understand racial discrimination within racially homogenous social spheres. Examining landlords' screening practices offers insight into the role housing plays in how racism continues to shape life outcomes-both explicitly through overt racial bias, and increasingly more covertly, through algorithmic automation and digital technologies.

AB  - Based on previous theory and research suggesting that a defensive motivational system (DMS) is activated in response to a specific incident of racial discrimination, prejudice, or stereotyping, we examined how prior experiences with racial discrimination increase intense psychological reactions to a recent incident of race-based rejection. Participants were 161 African American undergraduate students from a PWCU or a HBCU who initially completed a Time 1 measure about their prior experiences with racial discrimination. At Time 2, participants who reported being the target of prejudice in the previous 10 to 12 weeks completed measures of thought intrusions about the incident, negative affect about what happened, and lack of forgiveness for the perpetrator. The results indicated that prior exposure to racial discrimination was associated with an increase in thought intrusions about the incident. In turn, more thought intrusions were associated with more negative affect and lower forgiveness for the perpetrator.

AB  - Despite the continued attention on the distinct behavioral and relational outcomes of narcissism and self-esteem, limited academic research has been devoted to investigating the influences of those individual differences upon behaviors of seeking and retaining a romantic relationship concurrently in the digital environment. The present study aimed to test the role that narcissism and self-esteem play in predicting individuals' attitudes toward behaviors in current and possible romantic relationships. The results demonstrated that individuals high in narcissism showed positive attitudes toward interacting with potential romantic partners on Instagram. Furthermore, they showed positive attitudes toward current relationship-related postings on Instagram. In contrast, individuals high in self-esteem exhibited negative attitudes toward interacting with potential romantic partners, whereas they showed positive attitudes toward posting photographs taken with their current romantic partners on Instagram. This study provides empirical evidence for the associations between individual differences and attitudes toward various behaviors on social networking sites (SNSs) in relation to both potential and current romantic relationships.

LA  - English
KW  - PUBLIC-HEALTH POLICY
KW  - INEQUALITIES
AB  - CONTEXT: Despite decades of evidence-based advocacy for family planning in developing countries, research on how decision makers perceive and respond to such efforts is lacking.
   METHODS: A literature review yielded 10 peer-reviewed journal articles published between 1999 and 2012 on decision makers' needs for and experiences with health advocacy and evidence. Two sets of questions about family planning research and advocacy one for decision makers and another for advocates were developed from emerging themes and used in structured interviews with 68 key informants in Ethiopia, Kenya and Malawi.
   RESULTS: Decision makers reported understanding family planning's value and confirmed that advocacy had helped to spur recent favorable shifts in government support of family planning. Key informants stressed that advocacy messages and formats must be tailored to the needs and interests of particular audiences to be effective. Messages must also consider barriers to decision makers'support for family planning: constituents' negative attitudes; fear that increased adherence to family planning will shrink the size and influence of specific voting blocs and ethnic groups; and competing economic, social, cultural, religious and political priorities. Decision makers reported valuing the contributions of international family planning organizations and donors, but were more comfortable receiving advocacy messages from local sources.
   CONCLUSIONS: According to decision makers, sustained and strategic family planning advocacy developed and delivered by culturally attuned national actors, with support from international actors, can diminish barriers to government support for family planning.

AB  - Analyses of attempts to prevent the worsening of environmental problems on Earth often identify two key lines of critique about contemporary school curriculum: first, its role in entrenching anthropocentrism as the dominant paradigm for people-environment relations, and then, also compounding this, their combined role in furthering a loss of connection with nature. However, those who advance such critiques do not always acknowledge that teachers perceive and enact curriculum in a variety of ways, including resisting these possible outcomes or rejecting such conceptions, be that in relation to schooling in general, or environmental sustainability as a particular focus for curriculum policy and activities. In light of this, our paper focuses on the substance and significance of teachers' conceptions of anthropocentrism and related constructs to curriculum, drawing on a range of theoretically- and empirically-based insights. First, we consider the literatures of environmental ethics and eco-philosophy to examine why dominant readings of nature and anthropocentrism are contested, and how this plays out in education, including for curriculum making. Then, within this context, we present results of a quantitative study of 201 inservice and preservice teachers in Australia, drawing on responses to selected items from the BIOHEAD-Citizen' questionnaire. Our findings illustrate a range of anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric conceptions of the environment, illuminating their relation to both consistent and contrasting findings on related concepts of anthropomorphism, and attitudes towards nature and environment. As our analysis shows, the teachers' responses cluster into four groups' of conceptions, which illustrate a range of anthropocentric possibilities, typically related to negative attitudes to nature and environment, and non-anthropocentric ones, usually related to positive attitudes to nature and environment, particularly when combined with anthropomorphism. Given the links between non-anthropocentrism and pro-environmental behaviours, and the significance of educators' ecoliteracy for advancing action on unsustainability via curriculum (re)development established in previous research, we conclude our paper discussing the value and challenges of (i) fostering ecocentrism and (ii) facilitating nature experiences, via contemporary preservice teacher education.

AB  - We investigated the effects of salient shared humanity with a benevolent or hostile human norm on perpetrators of historical atrocities. Our findings suggest that a focus on benevolent superordinate humanity enables perpetrators to legitimize intergroup discrimination and preserve existing negative attitudes towards victims. In Expt 1 (N = 135), salient shared humanity with a human norm of benevolence and kindness preserved the perceived legitimacy of intergroup inequality, while exposure to a hostile norm of human nature reduced perceived legitimacy. Expt 2 (N = 51) replicated the association between exposure to a hostile human norm and reduced legitimization when perpetrator intentions were unambiguously negative. In contrast, when perpetrator intentions were ambiguous, a hostile human norm had no effect on perceived legitimacy. Our findings qualify previous research, and demonstrate that the effects of emphasizing shared humanity are not equivalent or universally positive for perpetrators and victims.

KW  - role of emotions
AB  - This paper describes a particular educational experience: a course that took place in prison involving law students and inmates. One of the co-authors was the leading instructor in the course, whereas the other played an active role during its design and implementation. Social prejudices and taboos on crime, criminals and prisons offer a simplistic, biased and altogether negative image of penal institutions and those involved in them. This picture pervades society in general, and the legal professions in particular. The course described in this paper is aimed at bridging the gap between inmates and future lawyers by bringing them together into the same classroom to think and reflect collectively. The method used was the Socratic dialogue, in which the professor acted as a "spiritual midwife" encouraging dialogue and debate around fundamental issues such as truth, fear, happiness, respect, responsibility, justice, and so on. During each session, participants explored these concepts in depth, and had the opportunity to gain a better understanding of the other's point of view. The ultimate aim was that upon completing this course both groups could have a better understanding of each other's realities. This paper is based on the personal accounts of the participants in the course, including professors and students (both law students and inmates). The methodology is qualitative and phenomenological, and its value lies in the singularity of the experience. Drawing on the theory of justice of Amartya Sen, we identify this course as a non-transcendentalist and non-institutionalist approach to justice, exploring the role that emotions play in it. In the conclusions we express our belief that by thinking together and trusting each other students and inmates can open themselves to a logic of cooperation that connects both with a broader sense of justice and the enhancement of democracy.

This study analyzes the intervention effect of labeling in wildlife conservation education and explores the underlying mechanism by targeting adolescents. Specifically, it is found that (1) the labeling in wildlife conservation education can improve teenagers' willingness to protect wildlife; (2) the environmental self-identity is highly correlated with wildlife conservation.

AB  - Prior work has established that children and adults distinguish moral norms (e.g., hitting is wrong) from conventional norms (e.g., wearing pajamas to school is wrong). Specifically, moral norms are generally perceived as universal across time and space, similar to objective facts. We examined preschoolers' and adults' perceptions of moral beliefs alongside facts and opinions by asking whether only one person could be right in the case of disagreements. We also compared perceptions of widely shared moral beliefs (e.g., whether it is better to pull someone's hair or share with someone) and controversial moral beliefs (e.g., whether it is better to help someone with a project or make cookies for someone). In Studies 1 and 2, preschoolers and adults were more likely to judge that only one person could be right in the case of widely shared versus controversial moral beliefs, treating the former as more objective or fact-like. Children were also more likely than adults to say that only one person could be right in a moral disagreement. Study 2 additionally revealed that adults were more likely than children to report preferring individuals who shared their controversial moral beliefs. Study 3 replicated these patterns using a different sample of widely shared beliefs (e.g., whether it is okay to mock a poor classmate) and controversial moral beliefs (e.g., whether it is okay to tell small, prosocial lies). While some aspects of moral cognition may depend on abundant social learning and cognitive development, the perception that disagreements about widely shared moral beliefs have only one right answer while disagreements about controversial moral beliefs do not emerges relatively early. We discuss implications for moral learning and social preferences. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Few older people benefit from advance care planning (ACP), due to several barriers related to primary care professionals, such as insufficient knowledge, negative beliefs and a lack of time. Information on overcoming these barriers is limited. We assumed primary care professionals experienced in ACP with older patients are likely to have learned how to overcome these barriers.
   To investigate how Dutch primary care professionals experienced in ACP with older patients overcome these barriers.
   A qualitative study, based on semi-structured interviews, among a purposive sample of 14 Dutch primary care professionals experienced in ACP with older people. Transcripts were thematically analysed.
   We interviewed eight general practitioners (GPs), three nurses and three elderly care physicians, experienced in ACP with older people. Respondents overcame their own insufficient knowledge and skills, as well as their negative attitudes and beliefs by gaining experience through practicing ACP in their daily practices, exchanging and reflecting on those experiences with peers, pursuing continuing education, teaching and participating in research. To overcome patients and families lack of initiative and openness to ACP, respondents prepared them for further steps in ACP. To overcome a lack of time, respondents used tools and information communication technology, delegated parts of ACP to other primary care professionals, acquired financing and systematized documentation of ACP.
   Primary care professionals can overcome barriers to ACP with older patients by practicing, reflecting on experiences and pursuing continuing education, by preparing patients and involving family and by investing in support to approach ACP more efficiently.

AB  - Background: Racism and associated discrimination are pervasive and persistent challenges with multiple cumulative deleterious effects contributing to inequities in various health outcomes. Globally, research over the past decade has shown consistent associations between racism and negative health concerns. Such research confirms that race endures as one of the strongest predictors of poor health. Due to the lack of validated Australian measures of racist attitudes, RACES (Racism, Acceptance, and Cultural-Ethnocentrism Scale) was developed.
   Methods: Here, we examine RACES' psychometric properties, including the latent structure, utilising Item Response Theory (IRT). Unidimensional and Multidimensional Rating Scale Model (RSM) Rasch analyses were utilised with 296 Victorian primary school students and 182 adolescents and 220 adults from the Australian community.
   Results: RACES was demonstrated to be a robust 24-item three-dimensional scale of Accepting Attitudes (12 items), Racist Attitudes (8 items), and Ethnocentric Attitudes (4 items). RSM Rasch analyses provide strong support for the instrument as a robust measure of racist attitudes in the Australian context, and for the overall factorial and construct validity of RACES across primary school children, adolescents, and adults.
   Conclusions: RACES provides a reliable and valid measure that can be utilised across the lifespan to evaluate attitudes towards all racial, ethnic, cultural, and religious groups. A core function of RACES is to assess the effectiveness of interventions to reduce community levels of racism and in turn inequities in health outcomes within Australia.

AB  - Bias toward individuals with overweight/obesity (OV/OB) exists among health professionals and trainees with the potential to affect the quality of healthcare interactions. Given most research is adult-focused, this study aimed to examine the influence of weight status on clinical judgments in a pediatric context. Sixteen virtual human scenes representing hypothetical medical encounters of pediatric patients and their mothers were presented to prehealth profession undergraduates (n = 92). Characteristics, or cues, of patient and mother weight status (healthy weight vs. obese) and dyad race (Caucasian vs. African American) were manipulated across scenes. Participants provided ratings for assessment questions, including perceived treatment adherence and responsibility for health, for each scene. Data were examined via idiographic (i.e., individual-level) analysis, which involved generation of separate multiple regressions per participant per assessment question to capture the influence of the cues on participants' ratings. Results represent secondary outcomes from another study published elsewhere. Current analyses revealed that 12%-22% of participants relied on cues of weight status when making assessments about patient and mother adherence and responsibility for health. The majority of these participants equated higher weight status with poorer anticipated treatment adherence and greater health responsibility. Results suggest that the weight status of pediatric patients and their mothers' plays a considerable role in prehealth profession undergraduates' clinical judgments, with the future potential to affect disparities in pediatric care. This study highlights the importance of considering child and maternal factors and utilizing a novel approach that may serve as a model for further investigation of this issue.

AB  - In this article, we consider recent advances in scholarship on homophobic bullying, and implications for policy and practice. We first consider toward whom homophobic behavior is directed, drawing attention to the nuances among LGBT youth, and the realities of homophobic bullying for heterosexual or straight youth. We review the correlates or predictors of homophobic behavior in youth, and then discuss developmental trends in homophobic attitudes and prejudice and how those collide with younger ages of coming out among contemporary LGBT youth. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of implications for policies and programs.

AB  - The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationships among the Challenges to Scholastic Achievement Scale-Revised (CSAS-R) and The School Attitude Assessment Survey-Revised (SAAS-R) items and factors to determine whether the negative scales on the CSAS-R seemed to be measuring the same constructs as those that are measured on the SAAS-R. All SAAS-R items are positively worded, and all subscales are designed to measure positive manifestations of the constructs. The CSAS-R is a complementary instrument to the SAAS-R. All items represent negative manifestations of attitudes, cognitions, or behaviors. For this study, we focused on the four constructs from the SAAS-R and the CSAS that are directly comparable and complementary: positive and negative academic self-perceptions, positive and negative attitudes toward teachers and classes, high and low goal valuation, and regulated and unregulated study behavior. This comparison of CSAS-R and SAAS-R examined alternative conceptions of the dimensionality of the positive items (from the SAAS-R) and the negative items (from the CSAS-R) in an effort to better understand whether agreeing to statements about negative behaviors or attitudes seemed to represent the polar opposite of disagreeing to statements about positive behaviors or attitudes.

AB  - Purpose: To explore barriers and pathways to the inclusion of persons with mental and intellectual disabilities in technical and vocational education and training programmes in four East African countries, in order to pave the way to greater inclusion. Materials and methods: An explorative, qualitative study including 10 in-depth interviews and a group discussion was conducted with coordinators of different programmes in four East African countries. Two independent researchers coded the interviews inductively using Atlas.ti. The underlying framework used is the culture, structure, and practice model. Results: Barriers and pathways to inclusion were found in the three interrelated components of the model. They are mutually reinforcing and are thus not independent of one another. Barriers regarding culture include negative attitudes towards persons with mental illnesses, structural barriers relate to exclusion from primary school, rigid curricula and untrained teachers and unclear policies. Culture and structure hence severely hinder a practice of including persons with mental disabilities in technical and vocational education and training programmes. Pathways suggested are aiming for a clearer policy, more flexible curricula, improved teacher training and more inclusive attitudes. Conclusions: In order to overcome the identified complex barriers, systemic changes are necessary. Suggested pathways for programme coordinators serve as a starting point.

AB  - HIV-related stigma in health facilities has been suggested as a primary target for HIV-related stigma reduction. The objective of this study was to describe negative attitudes among Thai healthcare personnel (HCP) toward PLHIV. This nationwide probability sampled survey was conducted in 2019 in 12 provinces in Thailand and Bangkok, the capital. Participants were considered to have stigmatizing attitudes toward PLHIV if they had a stigmatizing view in response to at least one of the four questions. Eighty-two percent of the 3056 respondents had at least one stigmatizing attitude. Younger HCP, ages < 30 (AOR = 1.60; 95%CI: 1.18-2.18) and 30-39 (AOR = 1.60; 95%CI: 1.21-2.12) were more likely to have stigmatizing attitudes towards PLHIV compared to those aged 50 and older. Being support staff, support-clinical (AOR = 1.89; 95%CI: 1.44-2.49) and support-nonclinical (AOR = 1.71; 95%CI: 1.24-2.36) as opposed to professional staff also increased the likelihood of having stigmatizing attitudes. Stigma was also more likely to be present in HCPs who did not work at HIV-focused clinics (AOR = 1.97; 95%CI: 1.57-2.48). HCP who had more work experience, especially related to PLHIV care, were less likely to have stigmatizing attitudes. These personnel could be good peer educators or role models for a stigma reduction campaign within their healthcare facilities.

AB  - Background & aim: Pregnant mothers with diabetes, especially in developing countries, are particularly prone to suffer from dietary imbalances due to superstitions and irrational beliefs and practices. The study aimed to explore the existing beliefs and practices related to food intake among Bangladeshi diabetic pregnant mothers.
   Material & methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 200 diabetic pregnant mothers (age in yrs, M +/- SD, 30 +/- 4), selected purposively from outpatient department of Bangladesh Institute of Research and Rehabilitation in Diabetes, Endocrine & Metabolic Disorders. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. SPSS 16.0 were used for data analysis.
   Results: About 40% mothers had uncontrolled glycaemic status. 43% mothers believed that food should not be taken during the 'call for prayer' and 91% of them practiced it. For 'eclipse' the percentage of such kind of belief was much higher (80%) and 90% of them practiced it. With varying proportion for particular fishes 44-58% respondents believed that some fishes should be avoided due to the increased movement of child, fetal malformation and disease. 93% actually practiced it. 28% had adverse beliefs about duck meat, 78% pineapple and 8% had about coconut. The corresponding percentages for practice were 82%, 99% and 50% respectively. Mentally and physically abnormal child, different kinds of child illness and threat of abortion were among the reasons for misbeliefs about those foods.
   Conclusion: There are a number of nonscientific beliefs and prejudices among this pregnant mother regarding the intake of food. (C) 2016 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Multiculturalism (i.e., the recognition and celebration of cultural differences) has many potential benefits for society, including reduced prejudice among nonminorities and increased psychological well-being among ethnic minorities. Yet nonminorities generally tend to resist multiculturalism more than do minorities and believe that it is irrelevant to them. Two studies were conducted to examine why and under what conditions this is the case. In both studies, nonminority participants were randomly assigned to mark their race/ethnicity as either "White" or "European American" on a demographic survey, before answering questions about their interethnic attitudes. Results demonstrated that nonminorities primed to think of themselves as White (versus European American) were subsequently less supportive of multiculturalism and more racially prejudiced, due to decreases in identification with ethnic minorities. Implications for how to improve nonminorities' attitudes toward multiculturalism are discussed. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Literature indicates a knowledge gap in the preparedness of teachers to deliver sexuality and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention education to learners with intellectual disabilities in Africa. This paper reports on teachers' opinions on sexuality of Nigerian learners with intellectual disabilities and awareness of their risk of HIV infection. The study utilized key informant interviews with 12 teachers to explore their views on the sexuality and risk of HIV exposure of learners with intellectual disabilities in special schools across Oyo State, Nigeria. Interview scripts were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Teachers considered learners with intellectual disabilities as 'hypersexual' and incapable of intimate relationships. Learners with intellectual disabilities were reported to be at risk of exposure to HIV infection due to sexual abuse, transactional sex and lack of sexuality and HIV education. Teachers expressed confidence to deliver sexuality and HIV education but lacked skills to communicate relevant information to learners with intellectual disabilities in accessible formats. Teachers' negative attitudes, misconception and lack of skills to deliver sexuality education to learners with intellectual disabilities have to be addressed through training. Further studies are needed to provide baseline information for developing a tailored sexuality and HIV education for Nigerian learners with different types of disabilities.

AB  - Background: Lived experience practitioners can contribute to improved outcomes for people with mental illness, supplementing traditional mental health services and reducing health care costs. However, lived experience practitioners frequently face stigma and discrimination within their work roles. Aim: To understand the impact of stigma and discrimination on the effectiveness of lived experience roles from the perspective of lived experience practitioners. Method: In-depth interviews were conducted with 13 lived experience practitioners within a grounded theory study. Results: Issues of stigma and discrimination were identified as a core category of this study. Participants described stigma and discrimination so prevalent as to be considered a "normal" part of their working life. Professional isolation and attitudinal barriers from colleagues were seen to inhibit the effectiveness of lived experience roles. Conclusions: Lived experience practitioners can provide a vital contribution to stigma reduction broadly, however, the stigma and discrimination they face within work roles must be addressed to allow this contribution to be effective.

AB  - Media representations have significant power to shape opinions and influence public response to communities or groups around the world. This study investigates media representations of Islam and Muslims in the American media, drawing upon an analysis of reports in the New York Times over a 17-year period (from Jan.1, 2000 to Dec. 31, 2016) within the framework of Critical Discourse Analysis. It examines how Islam and Muslims are represented in media coverage and how discursive power is penetrated step by step through such media representations. Most important, it investigates whether Islam and Muslims have been stigmatized through stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. The findings reveal that the New York Times' representations of Islam and Muslims are negative and stereotypical: Islam is stereotyped as the unacclimatized outsider and the turmoil maker and Muslims as the negative receiver. The stereotypes contribute to people's prejudice, such as Islamophobia from the "us" group and fear of the "them" group but do not support a strong conclusion of discrimination.

AB  - Background Childhood tuberculosis (TB) is a major global public health concern contributing to significant child morbidity and mortality. A records review of the TB notification for Chegutu District Health Information System 2 (DHIS2) showed a low childhood TB case detection rate. For 2018 and 2019, childhood TB notifications were 4% and 7% respectively against the annual national childhood 12% case detection rate. We evaluated the performance of the childhood TB program in Chegutu. Methods We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study. Sixty-six health workers (HW) participated in the study. Interviewer-administered questionnaires and checklists were used to collect data on reasons for low TB case detection, HW childhood TB knowledge, program inputs, processes, and outputs. Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats analysis was used to assess the childhood TB processes. We analyzed the data using Epi Info 7 (TM) to generate frequencies, proportions and means. A Likert scale was used to assess health worker knowledge. Results The majority 51/66(77%) of HW were nurses and 51/66(67%) of respondents were females. Reasons for the low childhood TB case detection were lack of HW confidence in collecting gastric aspirates 55/66(83%) and HW's negative attitudes towards gastric aspirate collection 23/66(35%). HW 24/66 (37%) had a fair knowledge of childhood TB notification. The district had only one functional X-ray machine for 34 health facilities. Only 6/18 motorcycles were functional with inadequate fuel supply. No desk guide for the management of TB in children for HW (2018) was available in 34 health facilities. Ethambutol 400 mg was out of stock and adult 800 mg tablets were used. Funds allocated for motor vehicle and motorcycles service ($1612USD/year) were inadequate. The district failed to perform planned quarterly TB review meetings, contact tracing and childhood TB training due to funding and COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. Conclusion The childhood TB program failed to meet its targets due to inadequate inputs, HW suboptimal knowledge and COVID-19 lockdown measures. Case detection and notification can be improved through on-job training, mentorship, support and supervision and adequate resources.

AB  - Aims and objectivesTo describe the experiences of adults who were successful in maintaining weight loss after bariatric surgery.
   BackgroundThe majority of studies examine a homogenous demographic group of postbariatric surgical patients who have gone through initial weight loss, which occurs within the first 12-24 months post surgery. Maintenance of weight loss begins 24 months after bariatric surgery; however, there is a paucity of research examining experiences during this period. The lack of conclusive research related to interactions between intrapersonal, behavioural and environmental influences suggests a need to develop a better understanding of patients' experiences related to weight loss maintenance post bariatric surgery.
   DesignBandura's Social Cognitive Theory provided the framework for the semi-structured interviews for this qualitative descriptive study.
   MethodsIn-person interviews with n=14 participants who were able to maintain weight loss at least 24months after a bariatric surgery.
   ResultsParticipants experienced an awakening and gained a new perspective on their life. They identified negative attitudes, influences and behaviours and modified their environment to support their desired healthy behaviour.
   ConclusionsTo maintain weight loss, an individual must seek out and be surrounded by positive family and peer support influences. Positive support may provide the opportunity for an individual to place personal health needs as a priority.
   Relevance to clinical practiceTherapeutic education and counselling for individuals, couples and families should occur during all phases of bariatric surgery. Communication techniques may empower clients to deflect negative comments and influences in a constructive manner. Support groups should accommodate the various phases of bariatric surgery. Clients should be prepared for how to work through emotions associated with weight fluctuations.

AB  - Repeat pregnancy may be more challenging to teenage mothers and their children because of increased socio-economic impact, as well as the influence of generally short pregnancy interval. Guided by Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory, this study explored challenges faced by teenage mothers with repeat pregnancy and support services available to them. Utilizing a qualitative research design, convenience and snowball sampling methods were used to recruit 41 participants, which consisted of 33 teenage mothers and eight health workers from Mamprobi Polyclinic, Accra, Ghana. Individual in-depth interviews and focus group discussions were utilized to gather data that were analyzed thematically. Findings showed that teenage mothers faced educational, financial, and health challenges. They also experienced psychological issues, particularly stigma. Additionally, teenage mothers did not obtain much support from their spouses and had to fend for themselves or relied on their families, neighbors, and health workers. Furthermore, teenage mothers encountered some barriers (family members rationalizing their problems, being accused of infidelity, and negative attitudes of some health professionals) when they accessed support services. Moreover, many of the teenage mothers were ignorant of available formal support services. The findings suggest the need to promote education on repeat pregnancy, family planning, and available support services.

AB  - Inadequate pain management affects the patient outcome. Pain assessment and management are fundamental in nursing care, and nurses must be equipped with adequate knowledge and a positive attitude toward pain assessment and management. This study aims to evaluate nurses' knowledge and attitudes regarding pain assessment and management at King Fahad Hospital, Al-Madinah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. A quantitative, cross-sectional survey, using a self-administered questionnaire, was conducted from January to February 2020 with 660 registered nurses working in the Emergency Department, critical care units, inpatient and outpatient departments at King Fahad Hospital in Al-Medinah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The data were analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics. Of the 660 nurses, 291 responded, resulting in a response rate of 44.09%. The participants' scores ranged from 17.7% to 100%, with a mean score 45.29%. The majority of the participants (70.1%) had a poor level of knowledge and attitudes (score < 50%). Nurses working in the outpatient department scored significantly higher than the group working in the Emergency Department and inpatient wards. Deficient knowledge and negative attitudes were found and nurses continue to underassess and undertreat pain. Nursing school curricula and in-service continuous education must equip nurses with the required knowledge and attitudes to enable them to manage pain effectively.

AB  - Purpose The authors report a field study examining the perceptions of Kenyan host-country stakeholders toward activities of Chinese businesses in their country, and the consequences of this on the legitimacy that they bestow on pertinent entities. Design/methodology/approach Interviews and observations across an eight-week period of field research revealed generally negative attitudes toward Chinese businesses, with issues pertinent to moral legitimacy prominent, notably, perceptions of corrupt practices, environmental neglect and profit expatriation. Findings The authors also find evidence that these negative attitudes spilled over to contaminate Kenyans' perceptions of their own government, which respondents associated closely with the activities of Chinese entities. Originality/value The authors extend understanding of legitimacy theory and the implications of foreign business activity by highlighting that businesses may be mistaken to believe that their international business activities are politically neutral, and while host governments may believe that the economic benefits arising from attracting foreign business activity can buttress their legitimacy, the perceived activities of these businesses, in the absence of supporting institutional frameworks, may render this counterproductive.

AB  - Background There is a high prevalence of gender-based violence (GBV) victimization among young Ethiopian women, including in universities, where female enrollment is low but growing. Understanding factors contributing to GBV in this context and students' perspectives on gender, relationships, and interpersonal violence is essential to creating effective interventions to prevent GBV and support female students' rights and wellbeing. Methods In-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) were held with male and female students (male IDI n = 36, female IDI n = 34, male FGD n = 18, female FGD n = 19) and faculty and staff (FGD n = 19) at two Ethiopian universities. Audio recordings were transcribed and translated into English. Transcripts were coded thematically to identify key factors contributing to GBV and provide narratives of students' experiences. Results GBV against female students was a salient issue, including narrative accounts of harassment, intimidation, and physical and sexual violence on the university campuses and the towns in which they are located. Reported risks for GBV included receiving academic support from male peers, exercising agency in relationship decision-making, having a negative self-concept, belief in stereotypical gender expectations, and engaging in transactional sex and/or substance use. While students recognized these risk factors, they also suggested GBV may be the result of females' "improper" behavior, attire, use of males for personal gain, or personal failure to prevent violence. Conclusions GBV is a serious issue in these two Ethiopian universities, creating a tenuous learning environment for female students. Programs are needed to address areas of vulnerability and negative attitudes toward female students in order to decrease female victimization.

AB  - Media literacy, the critical analysis and deconstruction of media messages, has the potential to promote favorable attitudes toward members of racial minority groups. This study reports on the development and implementation of two types of media literacy interventions (i.e., critical and stereotype) aimed at enhancing college students' attitudes toward Blacks and Latinos. Students from 5 sections of the same course took part in a quasi-experiment and were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 interventions or to a control group. Students' attitudes were measured at 3 different times during the study: 6 weeks before the intervention, immediately following the intervention, and 6 weeks after the intervention. Both interventions enhanced students' attitudes toward Blacks and Latinos but the stereotype intervention was more effective than the critical one, both for short- and long-term effects, as the latter disappeared in the critical condition. Attitudes of students in the control group remained the same throughout the study. Implications address how to use media literacy to enhance conversation about race relations.

AB  - Introduction: Attitudes of drug-abstinent youth considering marijuana initiation can be highly ambivalent. Invalidating pro-usage elements (i.e., opinions) of ambivalent marijuana attitudes, while leaving anti-marijuana elements intact, may create stronger, less ambivalent marijuana-resistant attitudes and lower usage intentions, while concurrently elucidating the role of ambivalence in persuasive prevention.
   Method: From an initial pool of marijuana-abstinent middle-school students (N = 538), the quintile expressing the most negative attitudes toward a marijuana prevention appeal (N = 101) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions designed to invalidate pro-marijuana opinions. Analyses then tested their susceptibility to a second marijuana prevention appeal.
   Results: Personally threatening messages were found ineffective, but appeals contesting resistant responses significantly decreased ambivalence (p <.01). Mediational analyses showed that this decreased ambivalence was associated with less favorable attitudes and lower marijuana usage intentions (both p <.001). An attribution-based manipulation increased ambivalence (p <.05), which was associated with positive usage intentions mediated through positive attitudes (both p <.001).
   Conclusion: Analyses elucidated the role of attitude ambivalence in prevention, providing a more complete understanding of potential facilitative use of ambivalence in prevention models based on prevention. Results support the further examination and use of methods that invalidate pro-marijuana opinions, thereby leading to greater susceptibility to subsequent prevention appeals.

AB  - According to the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, article 12 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities specifies that all people everywhere have a right to equal recognition before the law and that there are no circumstances in which this right may be limited. However, General Comment 1 of the CRPD Committee indicates that globally persons with cognitive and psychosocial disabilities are frequently denied legal capacity. This article sets out to explore the current situation and legal imperatives regarding the legal capacity of persons with intellectual, psycho-social or communication disabilities in traditional courts in KwaZulu-Natal. Traditional courts operate in some rural areas of South Africa and are presided over by a chief and a traditional council. These traditional courts are the closest and cheapest dispute resolution forum in rural areas and utilise restorative justice principles. The legal test for mental and legal capacity in formal courts is not applied in traditional courts. This article reports on research conducted by an NGO in KwaZulu-Natal that found evidence of negative attitudes and a lack of knowledge regarding accessibility and reasonable accommodation among traditional leaders. In these courts, persons with disabilities are not accepted as equal before the law. In some proceedings in traditional courts, an adult with a disability (male or female) is treated as a minor and is required to be represented by a parent or a male member of the family without a disability. A short summary of pertinent aspects of the Traditional Courts Bill indicates the scope for improvement in relation to full participation and equality before the law. We submit that South Africa's implementation of the relevant international and regional law obligations under the CRPD and the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is found wanting, including a lack of appropriate training of traditional court personnel and a lack of awareness of the equal recognition of legal capacity among families supporting persons with disabilities.

AB  - Using data from the World Values Surveys, this study examines changing values in Turkey and shows that rising religiosity and intolerance can be traced back to 1995 and have become more visible during the AKP's rule. Moreover, Turks are found to be the most religious of all the societies compared in the study. Findings suggest that Turkish voters are likely to continue being attracted to political parties like the AKP in the future, which would have important implications for Turkey's relations with its traditional friends in the West.

AB  - Facial electromyography (EMG) was used to gauge emotional responding towards images of slim and overweight individuals, and findings were compared with data from a series of alternative measures including two implicit attitudinal procedures, the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) and the Implicit Association Test (IAT), and explicit measures of anti-fat prejudice and discriminatory behavior. Images of slim individuals elicited EMG responses consistent with more positive affect. Data from both the IRAP and IAT indicated higher levels of bias than were revealed on the explicit measures, and the IRAP also corroborated the EMG pattern by indicating responses consistent with pro-slim rather than anti-fat bias. The IRAP was moderately correlated with both EMG and the IAT and was the only measure to predict behavioral intentions. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

KW  - CONSENSUS
AB  - In opinion dynamics, how to model the enduring fragmentation phenomenon (especially the bipartite cleavage) of social opinions has long been a central problem. It is widely known that the confidence-based opinion dynamics provide an acceptable mechanism to produce fragmentation. In this study, taking the famous confidence-based Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model, we examine the robustness of the fragmentation coming from HK dynamics and its variations with prejudiced and stubborn agents against random noise. Prior to possible insightful explanations, the theoretical results in this paper explicitly reveal that the fragmentation of HK dynamics and its homogeneous variations finally vanishes in the presence of arbitrarily tiny noise, while only the HK model with heterogenous prejudices displays a solid cleavage in noisy environment. Moreover, it is found that noise could help regularize the group to form the innate bipartite cleavage. (C) 2019 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Few studies have examined geographic variation in hypertension disparities, but studies of other health outcomes indicate that racial residential segregation may help to explain these variations. The authors used data from 8,071 black and white participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2006) who were aged 25 years or older to investigate whether black-white hypertension disparities varied by level of metropolitan-level racial residential segregation and whether this was explained by race differences in neighborhood poverty. Racial segregation was measured by using the black isolation index. After adjustment for demographics and individual-level socioeconomic position, blacks had 2.74 times higher odds of hypertension than whites (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.32, 3.25). However, race differences were significantly smaller in low- than in high-segregation areas (P-interaction = 0.006). Race differences in neighborhood poverty did not explain this heterogeneity, but poverty further modified race disparities: Race differences were largest in segregated, low-poverty areas (odds ratio = 4.14, 95% CI: 3.18, 5.38) and smallest in nonsegregated, high-poverty areas (odds ratio = 1.24, 95% CI: 0.77, 2.01). These findings suggest that racial disparities in hypertension are not invariant and are modified by contextual levels of racial segregation and neighborhood poverty, highlighting the role of environmental factors in the genesis of disparities.

AB  - This article reexamines the so-called wallpaper effect of intergroup contact, which contends that for minority group members living in areas more densely populated by majority group members, intergroup contact fails to reduce prejudice. We tested this claim in five studies, using data from five countries, two types of contexts, a range of measures, and involving different minority versus majority groups. Using multilevel cross-level interaction models, we considered whether effects of contact on outgroup attitudes were moderated by relative outgroup size. Results failed to replicate the previously reported findings, revealing, by and large, nonsignificant cross-level moderation effects; instead, we witnessed consistent positive contact effects on attitudes. Findings are discussed against the backdrop of recent research on the consequences of diversity, as well as context-based considerations regarding minority versus majority constellations. We also discuss some exceptions to our findings that emerged for some respondent groups and contexts across the five studies.

AB  - In this longitudinal study, we explored how White students' (N = 857) color-blind racial ideology (CBRI; i.e., beliefs that serve to deny, minimize, and/or distort the existence of racism) changed over time and the factors associated with these patterns of change. Specifically, we investigated whether gender, diversity attitudes (i.e., openness to diversity and interest in social issues), and college diversity experiences (i.e., diversity-related courses/activities and close interracial friendships) predicted patterns of CBRI change. Findings indicated that gender and diversity attitudes were related to initial levels of CBRI, such that women and students who were more open to diversity issues at the beginning of college were more likely to report lower levels of CBRI; gender was also related to a greater decrease in CBRI changes over the college experience. Furthermore, college diversity experiences predicted changes in CBRI over time, such that students who completed a greater number of diversity courses and activities and those who had a greater number of close Black friends showed a significantly greater decrease in CBRI over their 4 years in college; interestingly, students who reported having no Latino friends compared with having some close Latino friends showed a significantly greater decrease in CBRI over time.

AB  - Objectives
   People with epilepsy generally encounter misconceptions and negative attitudes on different aspects of the disease. They are also prone to physical injuries during seizures. Lack of awareness about first-aid measures results in taking inappropriate first-aid measures. We aimed to determine the public awareness, attitudes, and first-aid measures about epilepsy in Tehran.
   Materials & Methods
   This population-based cross-sectional survey was conducted from Dec 2016 to May 2017 in Tehran, Iran. Random stratified cluster sampling was used. Data were collected through interviews using a questionnaire. The awareness section included general awareness, causes, symptoms, seizure triggers, first-aid measures, and recommended treatments. The Likert scale was used for the attitudes section which included 20 statements. The answers about first-aid measures were categorized as helpful, or harmful.
   Results
   Overall, 833 adults participated in the survey. The level of total awareness score of 41 (4.9%) participants was very good, 194 (23.3%) good, 255 (30.6%) fair, 210 (25.2%) low, and 133(16.0%) very low. The mean (SD) score about general awareness was 4.6 (3.0), range=0 to 11; causes 5.8 (3.4), range=0 to 13; symptoms of seizures 7.0 (4.0), range=0 to 13; first-aid measures 7.5 (3.4), range=0 to 14. Among all participants, 260 (31.2%), named at least one superstitious cause for epilepsy. Attitudes were generally positive except for marriage and having kids. The level of first-aid measures score of 74(42.5) was very good, 79(45.4) good, and 21(12.1) low.
   Conclusion
   The awareness of people of Tehran about epilepsy was insufficient, attitudes were generally positive but rather conservative, and first-aid measures at the last witnessed seizure were fairly helpful.

AB  - Many transgender and gender-expansive young people live outside of mainstream society, due to structural barriers that limit access to employment, health care, education, and public accommodations, as well as prejudice and discrimination within their families and communities. These structural barriers can be understood as cisgenderism. Though a growing body of research examines lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth homelessness, gaps in knowledge about the specific experiences of transgender and gender-expansive homeless youth remain. This phenomenological qualitative investigation explored aspects of transgender and gender-expansive youth's experiences related to homelessness. This article focuses on participants' understanding of their pathways into homelessness.

AB  - Background: Little is known about how best to implement portfolio-based learning in medical school. We evaluated the introduction of a formative e-portfolio-based supervision pilot for final year medical students by seeking views of students, supervisors and graduates on use and educational effects.
   Methods: Students and supervisors were surveyed by questionnaire, with free text comments invited. Interviews were held with new graduates in their first Foundation Programme placement.
   Results: Most students used the e-portfolio (54%) and met with their supervisor (62%) 'once or twice' only. Students had more negative views: 22% agreed that the pilot was beneficial, while most supervisors thought that e-portfolio (72%) and supervision (86%) were a 'good idea'. More students reported supervision meetings benefited learning (49%) and professional development (55%) than the e-portfolio did (16%; 28%). Only 47% of students felt 'prepared' for future educational processes, though graduates noted benefits for navigating and understanding e-portfolio building and supervision. Factors limiting engagement reflected 'burden', while supervision meetings and early experience of postgraduate processes offered educational value.
   Conclusion: Final year students have negative attitudes to a formative e-portfolio, though benefits for easing the educational transition are recognised by graduates. Measures to minimize time, repetition and redundancy of processes may encourage use. Engagement is influenced by the supervisor relationship and educational value may be best achieved by supporting supervisors to develop strategies to facilitate, and motivate self-directed learning processes in undergraduates.

AB  - There is accumulating evidence that disgust plays an important role in prejudice toward individuals with obesity, but that research is primarily based on self-reported emotions. In four studies, we examined whether participants displayed a physiological marker of disgust (i.e. levator labii activity recorded using facial electromyography) in response to images of obese individuals, and whether these responses corresponded with their self-reported disgust to those images. All four studies showed the predicted self-reported disgust response toward images of obese individuals. Study 1 further showed that participants exhibited more levator activity to images of obese individuals than to neutral images. However, Studies 2-4 failed to provide any evidence that the targets' body size affected levator responses. These findings suggest that disgust may operate at multiple levels, and that the disgust response to images of obese individuals may be more of a cognitive-conceptual one than a physiological one.

AB  - Background: Common cold and influenza result in an increased number of primary care consultations, significant work/school absences and cause a socio-economic burden. Laypeople's perceptions and knowledge regarding common cold and influenza prevention is poorly understood and under-researched. Objectives: Our study explores laypeople's knowledge of prevention of common cold and influenza across three European countries. Furthermore, it investigates if there is any distinction between prevention activities focussing on reasons impacting the attitude towards influenza vaccination as well as investigating cross-country variation. Methods: In total, 85 semi-structured individual interviews were performed across three European countries (Austria n = 31, Belgium n = 30, Croatia n = 24). Qualitative thematic content analysis was performed. Results: Most participants across all three countries made no distinction between the prevention of the common cold and influenza and referenced the same preventative measures for both conditions. They mainly expressed negative attitudes towards influenza vaccination possibly effective but only intended for high-risk groups (bedridden/older people, chronic patients or health workers). There were very few cross-country differences in results. Conclusion: The perception of health risk of contracting influenza and a primary healthcare physicians' recommendation played an important role in shaping participants' decisions towards vaccination. Primary healthcare physicians are invited to assess and if necessary adjust inappropriate prevention behaviour through their everyday patient consultations as well as add to the knowledge about influenza severity and influenza vaccination benefits to their patients.

AB  - Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) are a key population that is disproportionately affected by HIV. However, few studies have explored how and why disclosure of HIV status occurs in this population. To understand disclosure in the context of other socioecological factors, we conducted a qualitative study among 24 self-identified HIV-positive GBMSM, aged 21 and above, and who were Singaporean residents. Analysis of participants' interviews revealed that disclosure of HIV status was not a binary event; rather, each type of disclosure held varying degrees of positive and negative ramifications. Disclosure and self-acknowledgement of HIV status at each time point also had different consequences for participants' quality of life. Suggested potential interventions include increasing training for medical professionals and public awareness surrounding issues relating to HIV. Findings from this study provide a framework to describe the complexities that accompany serostatus disclosure in a setting where there are prevalent "shame-based", negative attitudes towards HIV. As such, this framework can also be utilized in the future planning and organization of services for this target population in similar contexts.

AB  - Undergraduate women (N = 143) completed self-reports on exercise behavior, body orientation, body appreciation, and body-related talk. Results showed that conversations about weight loss/dieting and conversations about exercise differentially predicted body appreciation. Importantly, multiple regression analyses showed that the relationship between talk type and body appreciation was explained by the object-process dichotomy: Conversations about exercise oriented women to consider what their bodies can do which, in turn, predicted appreciation of one's body. In contrast, the relationship between conversations about weight loss/dieting and body appreciation was mediated by negative attitudes about one's body but not by an object orientation.

AB  - The emergence of an understanding of culturally responsive teaching has established new roles for teachers, and it has become important for teachers to take a role that integrates cultural differences in the teaching environment by stepping out of traditional roles. It is thought that it is important to reveal the characteristics of culturally responsive teachers and their importance in the teaching process. The research aimed to identify the characteristics of teachers within the framework of practices culturally responsive teaching. The research consists of three phases. In the first and second stages, teacher characteristics were investigated within the framework of culturally responsive teaching practices, and in the third stage, these characteristics were compared with scaling methods based on ranking judgments. Data from the study was collected from 266 teachers who served in public schools during the 2019-2020 school year. Data obtained in the study was analyzed by the scaling method with sorting judgments. As a result of the findings, being democratic in the life of culturally responsive teachers, thinking that students are different, being patient in the education and training process, knowing the student's past life, having an innovative perspective, giving importance to professional development, tending to live a loving life, it has been seen that they are listed as not being prejudiced, having universal values and being understanding towards the people around them. It has been proposed that the characteristics determined within the scope of the results obtained in the study should be acquired by teachers through in-service training, by the curriculum in teacher candidates and that teachers should be aware of practices culturally responsive teaching.

AB  - This paper aims to explore how Palestinian Arab and Jewish university students in Israel, attending a course on conflict resolution, deal with their stereotypical views of the Other and their prejudices, as well as their complex emotions of fear, hate, anxiety, and love during a period of tension and violence. On the one hand, they have a natural desire for professional partnership and friendship with their fellow students. On the other hand, they are attending this class in a Jewish university, in the heart of the Middle East, where acts of terrorism occur almost daily. This violence changes the power structure and the dynamics of their mutual relationships. Through an analysis of a specific case study the paper aims to shed light on how bridging theory and practice can generate a better understanding of complex situations, enabling reflection and developing signposts to improve coping mechanisms within peace education frameworks in times of terror.

AB  - Simple Summary Delayed death has been identified as a key welfare concern for the U.K. horse population, leading to prolonged suffering. Previous studies have identified common reasons for delaying euthanasia, including financial cost, emotional attachment, peer pressure, negative attitudes towards killing and poor recognition of behavioural indicators of equine pain and stress. The Five Freedoms is a welfare framework that can be used to assess quality of life. We used this framework to create a survey, compiling a list of hypothetical-yet common-scenarios that would have an impact on the overall quality of life of a horse. Participants were asked to indicate to what extent each scenario would have a bearing on an overall decision whether or not to euthanise a horse, or whether it would have had no bearing at all. Participants were also asked if they had had a horse euthanised and to give the reason for such a decision. We received responses from 160 participants and found that the predominant attitude was that most scenarios had no bearing on a decision to euthanise. Principal Component Analysis collected the scenarios into a series of factors that could be labeled according to their themes, the most prominent of which were "Ethology-informed Management", "Traditional Management", "Emotional issues" and "Physical Issues". Participants were most likely to consider euthanasia for physical issues and this was supported by the experiences of participants who had had their horses euthanised. Only a small number of responses also included consideration of affective and/or ethological factors, suggesting that welfare issues concerning affective state and/or behaviour are at risk of being omitted from an end-of-life decision.
   A key welfare concern for the equine population in the U.K. has been identified as delayed death, leading to prolonged suffering of horses. Reasons why some horse owners fail to have their horses euthanised include financial cost, emotional attachment, peer pressure, negative attitudes towards killing and poor recognition of behavioural indicators of equine pain and stress. The Five Freedoms framework of welfare was used to build a Likert-style survey to investigate the factors underlying attitudes of horse owners towards welfare measures in an end-of-life decision. Participants were asked to respond to hypothetical welfare scenarios and to give details of any horses they had had euthanised. The survey was conducted predominantly via equestrian Facebook groups and obtained 160 participant responses. Reliability of the scale was acceptable, with Cronbach's alpha=0.89. Principal Component Analysis was used to load the hypothetical scenarios onto seven factors containing 62.2% of the variance. The first four factors could be categorized according to "Ethology-informed Management", "Traditional Horse Management", "Emotional Issues" and "Physical Issues". Participants were more likely to consider euthanasia for physical issues, compared with issues relating to affective state and/or ethology, although it was not clear whether this was due to disregard for welfare issues relating to mental health or failure to recognise them as such. A large number of responses stated that the scenario had no bearing on whether a horse should be euthanised, again suggesting a lack of recognition of welfare issues and their implications.
   When asked to state their reasons for euthanising their horses, participants cited almost exclusively physical reasons, with the exception of those citing dangerous behaviour. Only a small number of responses also included consideration of affective and/or ethological factors, suggesting that welfare issues concerning affective state and/or behaviour are at risk of omission from end-of-life decisions.

AB  - Building on growing evidence that relative economic gratification may be associated with prejudice toward minorities, such as immigrants, the question remains when and why prosperity and wealth may enhance opposition to immigration. In a correlational study (Study 1,N= 498), we show that increased fear of falling in the future (individually or collectively) is associated with greater opposition to immigration. We then experimentally studied the effects of potential (Study 2,N= 294) and actual (Study 3,N= 166) downward mobility among the relatively wealthy, as well as of relatively stagnating wealthy in the context where an initially poorer group is quickly gaining wealth over time (Study 4,N= 151). We find that fear of falling among the wealthy is associated with more opposition to immigration, mediated by collective angst. We conclude that the anticipation that the economic future looks less rosy than the present evokes collective angst, which, in turn, fuels prejudice toward immigrants.

KW  - MOBILIZATION
AB  - Does social protest following the police killing of unarmed Black civilians have a widespread "opinion-mobilizing" effect against the police? Or, does the racialized nature of these events polarize mass opinion based on standing racial and political orientations? To answer these questions, we use a large dataset comprised of weekly cross sections of the American public and employ a regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) approach leveraging the random timing of the police killing of George Floyd and ensuing nationwide protests. We find that the Floyd protests swiftly decreased favorability toward the police and increased perceived anti-Black discrimination among low-prejudice and politically liberal Americans. However, attitudes among high-prejudice and politically conservative Americans either remained unchanged or evinced only small and ephemeral shifts. Our evidence suggests that the Floyd protests served to further racialize and politicize attitudes within the domain of race and law enforcement in the U.S.

TI  - Righting Categorical Wrongs: A Holistic Solution to Rule 8(a)'s Same-or-Similar Character Prong
T2  - UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - JOINDER
KW  - SEVERANCE
AB  - More than half of federal criminal defendants are charged with multiple of-fenses in a single indictment. These defendants are more likely to be convicted on at least one charge than defendants who receive separate trials for each charge. Joinder has been both lauded for increasing the efficiency of the federal criminal justice system and criticized for unfairly prejudicing criminal defendants. Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure 8(a) and 14 govern the joinder of offenses in the federal system. Rule 8(a) permits offenses of the "same or similar character" to be joined against a single defendant while Rule 14 allows district courts to sever the offenses if joinder "appears to prejudice a defendant." The circuit courts have taken divergent views of when offenses are of the "same or similar character" and thus properly joined together. Two general approaches have emerged among the circuits, with roughly half taking a categorical approach to Rule 8(a)'s same-or similar-character prong, which requires offenses to be simply of "like class." The remaining circuits, on the other hand, employ a holistic approach. These courts apply multifactored tests to examine the charges for similarity, including whether the offenses are connected by time or evidence and involve similar statutory elements or victims. The holistic approach's more rigorous analysis under the same or-similar-character prong results in fewer combinations of offenses joined.
   This Comment resolves the circuit split over the same-or-similar-character prong by examining the history, functions, and purposes of Rules 8(a) and 14. It argues that the holistic approach is superior to the categorical, as it better fulfills the intent of the rules' drafters, better accounts for the procedural and practical realities of the rules, and better meets joinder's efficiency goals while minimizing its risk of prejudice.

In New South Wales (NSW), Aboriginal peoples are currently negotiating with industry for the chance to participate in coal seam gas (CSG) development opportunities. Based upon research focusing on CSG development in the Northern NSW region, this paper argues that certain constructions of Aboriginality inhibit successful Aboriginal engagement with the economic opportunities provided by CSG. This paper illuminates the role of the media in facilitating dominant discourse about Aboriginality and the implications of those constructions for Aboriginal engagement with the mainstream economy. Findings demonstrate that the media are complicit in constructing Aboriginal peoples in a way that could prejudice their attempts to engage in economic opportunities that do not align with the dominant constructions of Aboriginality.

AB  - The authors of this study analyzed the economic and social advantages and limitations of working from (at) home in four countries of the Western Balkans - Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The research was carried out by applying an electronic survey on appropriate samples of 408 respondents from Serbia, 201 from Montenegro, 221 from North Macedonia and 201 from Bosnia and Herzegovina. For the research, a questionnaire consisting of 14 questions with answers in nominal form was created. The questions referred to several economic and social advantages and limitations of working from (at) home, starting with whether the respondents would recommend working from (at) home, the advantages of this work, the guidelines about establishing this type of business, whether to involve family members, what are the basic rules for a successful business from (at) home and performance evaluation, office organization, appearance and dress code, whether to engage in full-time or part-time work, the level of confidence of the owner in the business and earnings from year to year, the strategies used for this purpose, the most common problems and strategies for overcoming them, as well as practical advice to future entrepreneurs. In general, respondents from all four countries showed significantly more positive than negative attitudes toward working at (from) home, although there are noticeable and significant differences between countries. The main motives for working from home are flexible working hours and good earnings for all respondents. The respondents emphasized the importance of a well-designed business plan, but most have stereotypical strategies regarding the increase in performance. Also, they denied the importance of ergonomic rules for success, and in case of failure, they expect support and help from relatives and friends. There is a significant dose of ambivalence in business planning, making decisions about permanent or additional activities, and providing advice to others among the respondents. The main reasons should be sought in decreased and low-accumulative jobs (trade, providing of intellectual services, etc.) due to very limited initial investments. Respondents from Montenegro have the most psychosocial problems when working from (at) home and struggle with reconciling professional and family obligations with the least support from family and relatives. Respondents from North Macedonia are somewhat similar to them, although they are better positioned towards their families. The most successful and satisfied are the respondents from Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is the youngest population that is relatively mostly represented in the IT sector. Respondents from Serbia are most similar to respondents from Bosnia and Herzegovina in terms of satisfaction, as well as in closeness to family members, relatives, and friends.

AB  - In recent years, growing communities of Muslim-Americans have faced tension in a series of debates over the construction of Islamic prayer spaces in American cities. Islamic community members have found themselves fighting for representation within the political process and for their philosophical right to exist within American society. This study presents a framing analysis of the debate in five US newspapers between 2010 and 2013 as a way of examining the position of Muslims within contemporary American society. The study examines five frames: Local Regulation, Legal Authority, Political Debate, Muslim Neighbors, and Islamic Threat. The first three were episodic frames, while the other two were thematic. Some of the discourse showed evidence of Islamophobia, or indiscriminate negative attitudes or emotions directed at Islam or Muslims. Other stories showed evidence of Islamophilia, which is the stereotypical presentation of good Muslims' who are model citizens in contrast to the bad Muslims' who serve as rhetorical enemies.

AB  - Despite significant needs, people on social assistance are sometimes reluctant to consult dentists because of previous negative experience and communication barriers. They feel poorly understood by oral health professionals and sometimes complain of being stigmatized. It is thus important to know how dentists perceive poverty and this group of patients. The aim of this study was to understand how dentists perceive poverty and people on social assistance. To investigate this largely unexplored question, a qualitative study was conducted based on in-depth interviews with thirty-three dentists practicing in Montreal, Canada. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed for qualitative analysis. The study revealed two perspectives on poverty: 1) the individualistic-deficit perspective and 2) the socio-lifecourse perspective. In the individualistic-deficit perspective, which predominated among these participants, dentists explained poverty by individual factors and emphasized individuals' negative attitudes toward work and lack of capabilities. Conversely, dentists with a socio-lifecourse perspective described poverty as a structural rather than an individual process. Acknowledging individuals' distress and powerlessness, these dentists expressed more empathy toward people on social assistance. The results suggest the individualistic-deficit perspective impedes the care relationship between dentists and poor patients as well as highlighting the need to better prepare dentists for addressing issues of poverty and social inequities in clinical practice.

AB  - Background: HIV infection is a significant independent risk factor for both severe COVID-19 presentation at hospital admission and in-hospital mortality. Available information has suggested that people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) could benefit from COVID-19 vaccination. However, there is a dearth of evidence on willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination among PLWHA.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination among a national sample of PLWHA in China.
   Methods: This cross-sectional online survey investigated factors associated with willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination among PLWHA aged 18 to 65 years living in eight conveniently selected Chinese metropolitan cities between January and February 2021. Eight community-based organizations (CBOs) providing services to PLWHA facilitated the recruitment. Eligible PLWHA completed an online survey developed using a widely used encrypted web-based survey platform in China We fitted a single logistic regression model to obtain adjusted odds ratios (aORs), which involved one of the independent variables of interest and all significant background variables. Path analysis was also used in the data analysis.
   Results: Out of 10,845 PLWHA approached by the CBOs, 2740 completed the survey, and 170 had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. This analysis was performed among 2570 participants who had never received COVID-19 vaccination. Over half of the participants reported willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination (1470/2570, 57.2%). Perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination were significantly associated with willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination, including positive attitudes (aOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.09-1.12; P<.001), negative attitudes (aOR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.97; P<.001), perceived support from significant others (perceived subjective norm; aOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.46-1.61; P<.001), and perceived behavioral control (aOR 1.13, 95% CI 1.11-1.14; P<.001). At the interpersonal level, receiving advice supportive of COVID-19 vaccination from doctors (aOR 1.99, 95% CI 1.65-2.40; P<.001), CBO staff (aOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.51-2.36; P<.001), friends and/or family members (aOR 3.22, 95% CI 1.93-5.35; P<.001), and PLWHA peers (aOR 2.38, 95% CI 1.85-3.08; P<.001) was associated with higher willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination. The overall opinion supporting COVID-19 vaccination for PLWHA on the internet or social media was also positively associated with willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination (aOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.31-1.94; P<.001). Path analysis indicated that interpersonal-level variables were indirectly associated with willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination through perceptions ((3=.43, 95% CI .37-.51; P<.001).
   Conclusions: As compared to PLWHA in other countries and the general population in most parts of the world, PLWHA in China reported a relatively low willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination. The internet and social media as well as interpersonal communications may be major sources of influence on PLWHA's perceptions and willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination.

AB  - The outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in 2018 has had a massive impact on the Chinese hog industry. Finding treatments for the disease has attracted scientists worldwide working on a solution. Using genomics technology could potentially prevent hogs from getting infected with ASF. Many people, however, hold negative attitudes towards genomics technology, even though the Chinese government supports the technology. This paper attempts to determine hog farmers' motivations to adopt genomics for breeding hogs that are more resistant to the disease. In doing so we focus on the impact of their risk preferences and related peer effects that might influence potential adoption. We present a case study using face to face interviews with hog farmers from two locations in China. Results indicate that hog farmers would likely purchase semen produced with genomics technology if the semen was ASF resistant, reducing the probability of ASF by at least 60%. Most hog farmers we surveyed were risk averse. Findings suggest that more risk-averse hog farmers are more likely to delay the adoption of ASF resistant semen as compared to more risk-prone farmers. Results from social network analysis indicate hog farmers' social network status, such as, centrality, does not affect the time frame in which they would adopt genomics technology. However, the genomics adoption time frame of a particular hog farmer is positively correlated with other closely related hog farmers' time frames. This study also finds hog farmers form networks with other farmers similar to them, not only do they share a similar attitude in adopting genomics technology but they also have similar risk preferences. Overall, this case study provides implications for local governments and companies trying to promote new technologies.

AB  - Background: Ear health and hearing loss (HL) among infants has devastating outcomes. With most HL being deemed preventable, the assessment of one's knowledge and attitude regarding this impairment is important. In Saudi Arabia, the state of the general population's knowledge on infant HL remains unknown. Objectives: To determine and further elucidate the general population's knowledge and attitude with regard to HL in Saudi Arabia. Methods: This is a cross-sectional survey-based study conducted on the general population of Saudi Arabia. A predetermined questionnaire was translated into Arabic. This was distributed among the targeted participants in several provinces of Saudi Arabia (central, northern, eastern, western, and southern) by using an online survey via social media. The data were collected and analyzed via the SPSS program. Results: The knowledge with moderate, poor, and good was determined among 60.9%, 29.6%, and 9.4% of the participants, respectively. The participants with positive and negative attitudes were detected among 92.6% and 7.4% of respondents, respectively. Increasing age was associated with better attitude, while increased knowledge was directly related to higher educational attainment. Those who have a child with HL had nearly twice as poor knowledge as those who do not have a child with HL (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Although most of the respondents possessed a positive attitude toward infant HL, their knowledge about it seems to be lacking. Thus, there is a need to address these knowledge gaps regarding infant HL.

AB  - Introduction: The majority of guidelines currently recommend shared decision making for men 55 to 69 years old who are considering prostate specific antigen screening, and proceeding based on values and preferences. Qualitative studies have shown that negative attitudes toward physicians, health care and general health can influence decisions to pursue prostate specific antigen screening. We evaluated the impact of men's attitudes toward health and health insurance on prostate specific antigen screening.
   Methods: A retrospective secondary data analysis was conducted of men 55 to 69 years old without a history of prostate cancer using 2015 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data. The relationships between 4 survey statements pertaining to attitudes toward health and health insurance and prostate specific antigen screening in the last 2 years were assessed using multiple logistic regression.
   Results: The analysis sample consisted of 1,771 men which equated to 20,498,788.2 once weighted, and of these men 63.1% underwent prostate specific antigen screening. Men who agreed 1) they did not need health insurance (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47-0.95), 2) health insurance was not worth the money it costs (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56-0.99), 3) they were more likely to take risks than the average person (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54-0.98) and 4) they could overcome illness without help from a medically trained person (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.41-0.72) had significantly decreased adjusted odds of undergoing prostate specific antigen screening.
   Conclusions: Men with negative attitudes toward health and health insurance have significantly decreased odds of undergoing prostate specific antigen screening. With increased emphasis being placed on patient values, preferences and shared decision making, clinicians should assess for negative attitudes toward health and health insurance and intervene with these men to optimize the delivery of preventive care.

AB  - In order to improve the visual level of physical training and promote the optimization of sports training, the computer multimedia technology and Internet of things (IoT) are used to simulate the sports training model. Traditionally, the design complexity and control performance of the high-dimensional spatial sports training model are high, and the control performance is poor. A design method of computer multimedia simulation sports training model is proposed based on attitude change space fast exploration control, and computer multimedia simulation method is adopted to construct human body sports training and body movement mathematical model. In the physical training and kinematics model of human body, the position and pose feature information of human body is extracted quickly. Multimedia image analysis and intelligent control are used to simulate the process of human sports training and analyze the constraint parameters of motion planning in attitude change space to realize the optimal control of physical training and body motion planning. The simulation results show that the design of sports training model based on computer multimedia simulation is more controllable, the prediction error of motion attitude parameter is lower, and the multimedia control ability of sports training model is stronger, the effect of physical training is improved. In addition, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of in IoT.

AB  - Current corporate crisis literature is split on whether a good corporate reputation before a product harm crisis hurts or helps a company after the crisis. We argue that the current views on this issue miss two crucial elements: (1) the primary domain where the company's precrisis reputation lies in: corporate social responsibility contributions or corporate ability in providing quality products and services; and (2) consumers' attitude certainty developed from such precrisis reputation. Through an online experiment, our study not only provides a way to reconcile the current division in the literature but also provides insights for organizations to capitalize on their precrisis reputation when responding to the product harm crisis. Our results show that companies' precrisis reputation and consumer certainty developed from such a reputation matter more than companies' postcrisis communication in restoring consumer evaluations.

AB  - The objective of this study is to determine how students who are taking synchronous distance education classes via video conferencing perceive distance learning courses. A qualitative research approach was used for the study. Scale sampling was also used. The study's subjects consisted of a total of nine students comprised of 2(nd) and 4(th) grade students engaged in a course via synchronous distance education. For the study, the case method, a qualitative research method, was used, and research data was obtained via semi-structured interviews and observation results. Data was analyzed by means of the descriptive analysis method. Findings obtained at the study's conclusion indicate that students' perceptions of the course changed during and at the completion of the course. It was generally seen in the descriptions students made about the environment before taking synchronous distance education that they did not have advance information or that they had a prejudice due to their misinformation. It is seen in the conducted interviews that these prejudices start to be eliminated thanks to the opportunities provided by synchronous distance education through this process. It appears, from students' descriptions of the course environment prior to taking the course, that they did not have enough information or had preconceived ideas. As the course progressed, student perception changed and they were able to perceive more clearly the opportunities that synchronous distance education can provide. In this study, the most important problem in synchronous distance education was determined to be disconnection and sound problems. In this study, a significant problem was the hardware - i.e., sound, speed and connectivity issues. As well, students became bored after some time because of limited camera angles and cameras. It was concluded that this situation prevents the continuity of the course and so leads to distraction. On the other hand, it was observed that students start to get bored of the course after a while due to the fixedness of the camera angle and the small quantity of cameras. We also noticed that the fixed camera angle, small number of cameras and problems occurring in the images affected student perceptions. Besides these technical problems, the researchers observed, and the students expressed that the factors of teacher, environment, distance, course type and duration also caused the students' perceptions to change.

AB  - Individuals who have a functional or health impairment, are often in great need of conventional healthcare, social care and support, as well as help from family and friends. The use of dogs may be an important assistive support for this population. Assistance dogs are trained to assist with their owners' specific needs. The aim of this study is to explore service and hearing dog ownership from the owner ' s perspective, by examining the owner's expectations before training a dog, and experiences after having a certified dog. This study was designed as a longitudinal intervention study with pre-post design. The participants included in the study trained their own dogs to become service or hearing dogs. A number of open-ended questions were answered by the participants before the training of the dog started, three months after the dog was certified, and 1-3 years after the first follow-up. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. The participants' expectations of what the dog would contribute after being certified was high. Their perceived experiences in many ways reflected their expectations. For example, they perceived that the dog contributed to improved health status, a more active lifestyle, improved ability to feel secure, and that they had become more independent. They also felt that the dog had strengthened their social relationships. Negative experiences were also identified. Not being allowed to bring their dog into public places and negative attitudes from other people were examples of this. This study shows that individuals being supported by an assistance dog experience the dog as an invaluable help in their everyday life. By improving the owners' lives in many ways, a certified service or hearing dog is a novel and important assistive support for people with a functional or health impairment.

TI  - Suppression Orders in Criminal Trials: Still Necessary in the Digital Era
T2  - CRIMINAL LAW JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - Debate on whether or not suppression orders are futile in the digital era intensified following R v Pell. All Australian jurisdictions use a test based on necessity: that the suppression order is necessary to prevent prejudice or is in the public interest. Inherent to this test is the balance between open justice and fair trial rights; in the Australian context, the High Court has established the primacy of the latter. This article considers the purpose and historical origins of suppression orders to argue that, in criminal proceedings involving jury trials, the necessity test can be met despite the challenges of the digital era. Necessity in this context should be understood as a continuum rather than an absolute; it is not necessary that the risk of prejudice is eliminated. The strengths of the Australian approach are further illustrated by comparison with the United States where the First Amendment tips the balance in favour of open justice.

AB  - Ethnicity-based discrimination remains a persistent concern across the globe. A recent yet disparate literature focused on the role of cultural dimensions and intercultural contact in forming negative intergroup attitudes; however, these variables have yet to be included in a single study, so their unique effects cannot be estimated. Furthermore, although it is well documented that intercultural contact may reduce out-group discrimination, its influence on in-group favouritism remains relatively unexplored. The present study examines whether social dominance orientation (power distance), uncertainty avoidance, individualism/collectivism, and intercultural contact can predict neo-racism and ethnocentrism. Results from an online survey on Slovenian sample (N = 164) demonstrated that social dominance orientation was the best predictor of neo-racism and ethnocentrism, followed by intercultural contact. Findings indicate the importance of cultural context in shaping and modifying negative attitudes and increasing social tolerance. The implications for culturally-informed practices for preventing/reducing discrimination are outlined.

AB  - Most public surveys indicate that people generally hold negative attitudes toward gambling which is considered harmful, too prevalent and not sufficiently regulated by the authorities. Despite this, reported past-year adult participation rates are often 70% or higher. In this paper, we conduct a narrative review of major studies of public attitudes to gain insights into this apparent disjuncture between gambling behavior and attitudes. The paper considers three principal explanations: (a) the effects of measurement; (b) the nature of gambling populations; and, (c) the level of public knowledge about gambling. Negative attitudes, we argue, may be influenced by the wording of commonly used measures; limited public knowledge about the extent of problem gambling or harm; or, incorrect assumptions about the public's interest in gambling. For example, references to participation figures may disguise the fact that many people gamble only on lottery products and do not approve of other forms. Overall, surveys reveal public support for people's right to gamble, but also regulatory models where gambling venues are kept separate from other parts of daily life. Future research may benefit from more nuanced methodological designs that capture public gambling knowledge, experiences and appraisal of different regulatory models.

KW  - SELF
KW  - GAME
AB  - This paper presents an investigation into marginalizing racism, a form of prejudice whereby ingroup members claim that specific individuals belong to their group, but also exclude them by not granting them all of the privileges of a full ingroup member. One manifestation of this is that perceived degree of outgroup membership will covary negatively with degree of ingroup membership. That is, group membership may be treated as a zero-sum quantity (e.g., one cannot be both Australian and Iraqi). Study 1 demonstrated that judges allocate more zero-sum membership assignments and lower combined membership in their country of origin and their adopted country to high-threat migrants than low-threat migrants. Study 2 identified a subtle type of zero-sum reasoning which holds that stronger degree of membership in one's original nationality constrains membership in a new nationality to a greater extent than stronger membership in the new nationality constrains membership in one's original nationality. This pattern is quite general, being replicated in large samples from four nations (USA, UK, India, and China). Taken together, these studies suggest that marginalizing racism is more than a belief that people retain a "stain" from membership in their original group. Marginalizing racism also manifests itself as conditional zero-sum beliefs about multiple group memberships.

AB  - Those working in human services have a high susceptibility to burnout due to the counselor or clinician's feelings of responsibility for the well-being of clients. Substance abuse counselors are at a higher risk for experiencing burnout because substance abusers have the potential to be more demanding than other client groups. The current exploratory pilot study seeks to examine the multiple constructs of burnout in substance abuse counselors. Fifty substance abuse counselors completed a survey to assess their levels of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, confidence in therapeutic success and negative attitudes towards their substance abusing clients. Results showed that counselors exhibit high levels of depersonalization after continued interpersonal interactions. Results also showed that emotional exhaustion is a significant predictor of whether or not a person will choose to remain a counselor in the area of substance abuse treatment. Depersonalization, confidence in therapeutic success and negative attitudes towards clients predicted levels of emotional exhaustion. The results of this study demonstrate a need to further explore the occupationally specific dimensions of burnout for substance abuse counselors in order to protect their own mental health and well-being, and their relationships with clients.

AB  - Background
   Sexual Orientation is an enduring pattern of romantic or sexual attraction, with the attractions broadly incorporated under heterosexuality and non-heterosexuality. Societal and other factors seem to affect individuals' perception of their self-identified orientation. Thus, this study sets out to document the distribution of sexual orientation, level of self-reported satisfaction, and factors associated with sexual orientation among unmarried university students.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study involving 550 respondents sampled using a multi-stage sampling technique. Data collected via a self-administered questionnaire and analyzed via IBM SPSS version 20.0.
   Results
   Most respondents (93.6%) were heterosexuals, 4.7% bisexuals, 1.3% lesbian women and 0.40% gay men. More heterosexuals (80.4%) were fully satisfied with their self-identified sexual orientation compared to 57.2% of non-heterosexuals. Respondents who had religious upbringing and those whose parents were currently married were less likely to have sexual orientation outside of heterosexuality.
   Conclusion
   The most prevalent sexual orientation was heterosexuality, with more heterosexuals also expressing satisfaction than others. With the level of dissatisfaction expressed by those who are not heterosexuals as well as the factors associated with heterosexuality, it is plausible to conclude that societal values and/or prejudices constitute major factors in individuals self-identifying with some particular sexual orientation and the satisfaction derived therein.

AB  - American women still confront workplace barriers (e. g., bias against mothers, inflexible policies) that hinder their advancement at the upper levels of organizations. However, most Americans fail to recognize that such gender barriers still exist. Focusing on mothers who have left the workforce, we propose that the prevalent American assumption that actions are a product of choice conceals workplace barriers by communicating that opportunities are equal and that behavior is free from contextual influence. Study 1 reveals that stay-at-home mothers who view their own workplace departure as an individual choice experience greater well-being but less often recognize workplace barriers and discrimination as a source of inequality than do mothers who do not view their workplace departure as an individual choice. Study 2 shows that merely exposing participants to a message that frames actions in terms of individual choice increases participants' belief that society provides equal opportunities and that gender discrimination no longer exists. By concealing the barriers that women still face in the workplace, this choice framework may hinder women's long-term advancement in society.

To date, only a few studies have focused on union perspectives related to factors influencing the return-to-work of employees absent due to depression, despite evidence of the importance of these perspectives. The purpose of this study is to develop a better understanding of union perspectives on the factors surrounding the return-to-work of employees who were absent from work due to depression. Methods In this qualitative study, conducted in Canada (Qu,bec), 23 individuals (union representatives and peer workers) from the three largest unions (mixed industries) in Quebec took part in one of three focus groups. Results Fourteen emerging themes (e.g., work environment, attitudes toward depression) were distributed over five categories of stakeholders involved in the return-to-work of employees on sick leave (i.e., employers and immediate supervisors, co-workers, employees on sick leave due to depression, general physicians, and unions). We observed four major cross-cutting themes that arose beyond these five categories: (1) organizational culture in which mental health issues and human aspects of work are central, (2) support and follow-up during the work absence and the return-to-work, (3) lack of resources to assist the employee in the return-to-work, and (4) stakeholders' prejudices and discomfort regarding depression. Conclusions Our results clarify the factors, from a union perspective, that may facilitate or hinder the return-to-work of employees absent from work due to depression.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand how two online marketing orientations of land-based retailers in product category and price could change retail brand attitude when retail brand familiarities differ. Design/methodology/approach This paper proposes a research model with two orientations in product category and price as antecedents of retail brand attitude change and retail brand familiarity as a moderator. Empirical data were collected from 684 shoppers across three land-based retailers to test the research hypotheses. Findings Both orientations in product category and price can improve customers' retail brand attitudes. Retail brand familiarity plays a significant moderator in some of the situations. Online-offline product category congruence and online-prototypical price congruence have significantly positive effects on retail brand attitude change whether retail brand familiarity is high or low. The effect of online-offline price congruence is significant only among high-familiarity customers, while the effect of online-prototypical product category congruence is found to be significant only among low-familiarity customers. Research limitations/implications The study identifies the moderating effects of retail brand familiarity on the relationships between two online marketing orientations in product category and price and retail brand attitude change. Based on the moderating effects, this study will help researchers to better understand the effectiveness of two online marketing orientations subject to varying degrees of retail brand familiarity in a multichannel retailing context. Practical implications The findings of this study can guide land-based retailers to focus on the right orientations in product category and price to improve customers' attitudes toward the retail brand when existing or new customers are targeted. Originality/value This study provides a first study to empirically assess the change in retail brand attitude prompted by homogenous and prototypical orientations in product category and price and subject to varying degrees of retail brand familiarity. Overall, the results offer insights of how land-based retailers could manage their overall performance by designing more effective online product category and pricing strategies for existing or new customers.

AB  - Attitudes towards refugees are formed via complex interactions between socioeconomic factors, perceptions of cultural threat and personality traits. Yet despite the widespread social changes the European refugee situation has generated throughout the continent, no previous literature has adequately examined these interactions in that context. This study addressed that gap by testing the relationship between personality traits and European attitudes towards refugees in the context of the European refugee crisis by conducting an ordinal regression analysis of data obtained from online surveys that we distributed in four European countries (N = 6,000).Questions were aligned with descriptors used in the Five Factor model of personality traits and a proxy of the Honesty-Humility trait used in the HEXACO model. Our results indicate that Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, and Honesty-Humility are negatively associated with refugee prejudice. Findings about Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Conscientiousness are mixed. Moreover, our results revealed that intercultural contact has a positive impact on attitudes towards refugees and that the valence of this contact plays a more significant role than the frequency of contact. Given that attitudes towards refugees have been found to correlate with asylum policy preferences, these discoveries are of considerable value to people working in asylum policy settings, as they provide them with a more nuanced understanding of the factors influencing election results; especially during a period where refugee resettlement is a salient issue.

AB  - In January 1620, Sir George Calverley of Lea Hall, Cheshire, died intestate leaving behind him his widow, Lady Sidney Calverley, and five children. His eldest son, Hugh, aged six, was now a ward of court, the wardship falling to Prince Charles as Earl of Chester. Wardship was often problematic for widows regardless of their geographic location, but in counties where there was a particularly strong sense of community, kinship bonds and local rivalries could add an extra layer of anxiety and discord to their litigation. Lady Calverley confronted prejudice as widow, stepmother, and, being Welsh, as an outsider. Using court records and correspondence, this article examines the circumstances of Lady Calverley's case and dissects how it unfolded through and beyond Prince Charles's court of wards, an important but overlooked institution that to date has received no in-depth historical analysis. It illuminates the problems women faced in establishing themselves in close-knit communities, as well as how disadvantaged a widow could be in a patriarchal society despite the relative freedom she enjoyed as a feme sole.

AB  - Creating community awareness of reproductive tract infections (RTI), including sexually transmitted infections (STI), and how to prevent them is essential to minimize their spread. Data on people's views about RTI/STI are entirely lacking in Laos. The aim of this study was thus to explore people's perceptions, treatment-seeking behaviour and understanding of information about RTI/STI, in urban and rural communities in two provinces in Laos. Fourteen focus group discussions and 20 in-depth interviews were held with 76 women and 56 men, selected purposively to provide diversity of socio-demographic backgrounds. Qualitative content analysis was employed for the data analysis. The major finding was that both male and female participants had a variety of misconceptions about the causes and symptoms of RTI/STI and their cure, and a reluctance to seek health care, which could cause delay in appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The most common treatment-seeking behaviour was self-medication through private pharmacies, following advice mostly given by friends and drug sellers. The main reasons for not going to health facilities were fear of social discrimination or shyness of genital examination. Complaints were also made about clinicians' negative attitudes towards 'dirty disease'. Although condom use was mentioned as a way to prevent RTI/STI, an unwillingness to use condoms was commonly expressed. The main media sources of RTI/STI information were radio and television, and access to health information was more difficult in rural areas. The health messages provided were mostly understood, except for some technical terms. The findings indicate that strengthening health education and promotion through interventions at the community level is recommended to improve quality of RTI/STI management. Health education messages should be more accessible in rural areas. There is also an urgent need to improve communication between RTI/STI patients and clinicians.

AB  - Today, physical and psychological barriers can reduce opportunities for the type of direct face-to-face intergroup contact first identified by Gordon Allport. Consequently, social psychological researchers have identified, developed and tested a burgeoning array of different forms of indirect contact, including, extended contact, Electronic- or E-contact, imagined contact, vicarious contact and parasocial contact. In addition to providing a critical review of each of these forms, we argue that indirect contact is more than just a simple "replacement" for direct contact, but instead has the potential to improve intergroup relations for both minority and majority members in its own right. Relatedly, we acknowledge that indirect contact occurs within specific normative contexts embodied in legislation, institutions, and media and political contents. In fact, we recognize that indirect contact requires an integrative understanding of the role of intergroup norms and affective processes in order to effectively achieve public policy objectives to optimize effects on prejudice reduction.

AB  - Background: Weight stigma is pervasive in Western society and in healthcare settings, and has a negative impact on victims' psychological and physical health. In the context of an increasing focus on the management of overweight and obese women during and after pregnancy in research and clinical practice, the current studies aimed to examine the presence of weight stigma in maternity care. Addressing previous limitations in the weight stigma literature, this paper quantitatively explores the presence of weight stigma from both patient and care provider perspectives.
   Methods: Study One investigated associations between pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and experiences of maternity care from a state-wide, self-reported survey of 627 Australian women who gave birth in 2009. Study Two involved administration of an online survey to 248 Australian pre-service medical and maternity care providers, to investigate their perceptions of, and attitudes towards, providing care for pregnant patients of differing body sizes. Both studies used linear regression analyses.
   Results: Women with a higher BMI were more likely to report negative experiences of care during pregnancy and after birth, compared to lower weight women. Pre-service maternity care providers perceived overweight and obese women as having poorer self-management behaviours, and reported less positive attitudes towards caring for overweight or obese pregnant women, than normal-weight pregnant women. Even care providers who reported few weight stigmatising attitudes responded less positively to overweight and obese pregnant women.
   Conclusions: Overall, these results provide preliminary evidence that weight stigma is present in maternity care settings in Australia. They suggest a need for further research into the nature and consequences of weight stigma in maternity care, and for the inclusion of strategies to recognise and combat weight stigma in maternity care professionals' training.

LA  - English
AB  - This essay discusses the central role that health and disability prejudice played in the passing of the American and Canadian Chinese exclusion laws, which barred the entry of Chinese laborers from the 1880s through the 1940s. Lawmakers justified these policies in part by referring to scientific and public health reports that characterized Chinese immigrants as "feeble-minded" and prone to sickness and therefore as a threat to the health of white North Americans. Using this historical backdrop as a critical context for interpreting the literature of Sui Sin Far, a founding figure of Asian North American literature, I demonstrate the ways her writings on disease and disability challenge the racism, sexism, and health-related prejudice underlying the exclusion laws. Specifically, she reminds readers through her essays and short fiction that the living and working conditions that awaited immigrants in North America were the more genuine threats to health. Further, she critiques the imposition of white Western medical practices and standards on the bodies of Chinese immigrants, particularly women, and theorizes disability as an opportunity for non-heteronormative social formations among Chinese immigrant women.

AB  - Speciesism, like other forms of prejudice, is thought to be underpinned by biased patterns of language use. Thus far, however, psychological science has primarily focused on how speciesism is reflected in individuals' thoughts as opposed to wider collective systems of meaning such as language. We present a large-scale quantitative test of speciesism by applying machine-learning methods (word embeddings) to billions of English words derived from conversation, film, books, and the Internet. We found evidence of anthropocentric speciesism: words denoting concern (vs. indifference) and value (vs. valueless) were more closely associated with words denoting humans compared to many other animals. We also found evidence of companion animal speciesism: the same words were more closely associated with words denoting companion animals compared to most other animals. The work describes speciesism as a pervasive collective phenomenon that is evident in a naturally occurring expression of human psychology - everyday language.

AB  - In this article we shall be analysing the representations of old age and ageing made by three generations of older women with different life stories (single, married, children and childless). Our principal findings, based on a qualitative analysis of.. in-depth interviews conducted with three generations of older women (65-74, 75-84 and 85 and older), mainly reveal their reluctance and even refusal to define themselves as 'older or elderly women', largely due to persistent stereotypes linking old age to dependency, social isolation and fragility. Aware of the social prejudice regarding women and old age, they reject it unanimously. Older women represent a challenge to these homogenising preconceptions of old age, which they, on the contrary, experience in a multitude of ways, often enjoyable. Their conceptions of 'ageing well' are diverse and do not correspond to a clinical definition of ageing. Their representations of 'ageing well' and of ageing express positive values of autonomy, independence, consistency and integrity, maintenance of physical and intellectual health, and being socially active so they can 'stay in the swing of things', in the continuum of their lives and future projects, rather breaking with contemporary life or existing on the margins of society.

AB  - The relevance of examining juveniles' attitudes toward the police has been firmly established in the literature. Employing group-based trajectory modeling, the present study builds upon this previous research by estimating police attitudinal trajectories among a general sample of youths. The models produced a 5-group solution for both males and females, with four of the trajectories remaining relatively stable over the time observed and one noticeably experiencing a downward trend. Furthermore, of the items making up the police attitudinal scale, for several of the groups, the item measuring prejudice most consistently oscillated away from the trajectory profile. Policy implications are discussed.

AB  - HIV stigma among health care providers in the Arab world is understudied due to a lack of valid and reliable measures. Data from 352 Egyptian physicians was used to validate an Arabic version of the Health Care Provider HIV/AIDS Stigma Scale (HPASS). Exploratory factor analysis (n = 1 9 4) suggested a 3 -factor structure. Confirmatory factor analysis (n = 1 5 8) validated the three-factor solution with 18 items, which explained 5 3 .3 6% of the variance. All items loaded on their designated constructs, which ranged from 0 .58 to 0 .82 (prejudice) to 0 .58 to 0 .66 (stereotypes) and 0 .52 to 0 .91 (discrimination). The prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination subscales consisted of seven, five, and six items, respectively. The internal consistency (alpha = 0 .9 0) and the test-retest reliability demonstrated (r = 0 .9 5) were excellent. The cultural adaptation of the Arabic version of HPASS suggests that it is a suitable scale for assessing HIV stigma among Arab health care providers.

AB  - This contribution uses an expanded conceptualisation of intervention based on the understanding of it as an attempt to influence, negatively or positively, the political context/direction of a country/situation. It does this through the concept of 'aid intervention' in the conflict-context of the occupied Palestinian territory (OPT). Based on over 12years of research experience of aid donors in this context, this contribution compares the stated principles, as well as the methods and practices, of the main Western (USA and EU) and non-Western (Gulf Arab) states involved in providing aid. It is argued that while there are some interesting differences, there are some striking similarities, thus offering a critique and corrective to the prejudices that underpin the distinctions of 'Western' and 'non-Western', 'iberal' and 'illiberal'.

AB  - This paper aims to investigate the perceptions of prospective EFL teachers in the distance higher education system toward ICT implementation in teaching English as a foreign language. The majority of respondents who expressed negative attitudes to ICT integration found the nature, level and delivery of the training inadequate and accordingly affirmed that they do not feel sufficiently competent to use ICT in their future subject teaching without having sufficient prior knowledge of ICT dissemination. The results of the study imply that training that will enable teachers to become competent in and receptive to ICT is quite critical in distance education realms.

AB  - Higher income societies have moved from institutional to community-based care for people experiencing mental illness. However, stigma and discrimination persists and undermines help-seeking, recovery and life chances. Mental illness prevalence is higher amongst communities that face multiple prejudices and disadvantages within society, including Black and minority ethnic communities who may experience migration trauma, racism, acculturation and adverse social circumstances. This study examines beliefs, stigma and the effectiveness of existing national mental health campaigns with Pakistani, Indian and Chinese heritage communities in Scotland, UK, using community based participatory research. Community organisers were trained and supported to co-facilitate focus groups with 87 people using a range of languages. Whilst diversity within and between communities was apparent, important trends emerged. People with mental illness experience high levels of stigma from communities. Families experience significant associated stigma. This shame combines with culturally inappropriate services to reduce help-seeking from mental health services, friends and families. Existing anti-stigma campaigns have failed to reach or engage with communities due to a combination of practical issues such as the use of inappropriate language, imagery and media, but also due to assuming western medical concepts of illness. Participants suggested a new model for national campaigns placing greater emphasis upon community development, cultural events, positive contact and dialogue with families, faith leaders and youth groups. National anti-stigma programmes must develop more effective partnerships with communities or risk magnifying existing inequalities. Despite a range of national programmes to address stigma towards people with mental illness, it remains as the major barrier to social inclusion for people with mental illness living in communities. Stigma is particularly severe if people have a mental illness and are also economically disadvantaged or face multiple stigmas. By adopting community based participatory research (CBPR) approaches with three Black and ethnic minority communities in Scotland, this study makes the case that stigma can only be understood and effectively addressed with reference to its socio-cultural context.

AB  - Background: Studies have assessed attitudes toward, knowledge of, and beliefs regarding providing care for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) patients among student nurses, nurses, and nursing educators individually, but few studies have compared these aspects among these groups. Objectives: To examine the attitudes toward, knowledge of, and beliefs regarding providing care for LGBT patients among student nurses, nurses, and nursing educators in Taiwan. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Settings: The study was advertised in 8 nursing schools, 14 nursing associations, 209 nursing homes, and 2 online chatrooms in Taiwan. Participants: A total of 1150 participants were recruited: 447 student nurses, 475 nurses, and 228 nursing educators. Methods: Data were collected between August 2021 and January 2022 through a questionnaire with five sections: demographics, knowledge of LGBT health, the Knowledge about Homosexuality Questionnaire, the Attitude Toward Lesbian and Gay Men Scale, and the Gay Affirmative Practice Scale. Results: The results suggest that the participants had limited knowledge of LGBT health. The nursing educators had the lowest scores for knowledge of LGBT health and homosexuality and the most negative attitudes toward lesbians and gay men among the groups; however, they were most likely to report their beliefs regarding providing nursing care to LGBT patients than the other two groups. Conclusions: The results indicate the importance of providing nursing educators with training courses and re-sources related to culturally competent care to improve education for nursing students and care for LGBT patients.

T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
LA  - English
AB  - This study draws on communication accommodation theory, social identity theory and cognitive dissonance theory to drive a 'Citizen's Round Table' process that engages community audiences on energy technologies and strategies that potentially mitigate climate change. The study examines the effectiveness of the process in determining the strategies that engage people in discussion. The process is designed to canvas participants' perspectives and potential reactions to the array of renewable and non-renewable energy sources, in particular, underground storage of CO2. Ninety-five people (12 groups) participated in the process. Questionnaires were administered three times to identify changes in attitudes over time, and analysis of video, audio-transcripts and observer notes enabled an evaluation of level of engagement and communication among participants. The key findings of this study indicate that the public can be meaningfully engaged in discussion on the politically sensitive issue of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) and other low emission technologies. The round table process was critical to participants' engagement and led to attitude change towards some methods of energy production. This study identifies a process that can be used successfully to explore community attitudes on politically-sensitive topics and encourages an examination of attitudes and potential attitude change.

AB  - Interviewers often face respondents reluctant to disclose sensitive, embarrassing or potentially damaging information. We explored effects of priming 5 states of mind on willingness to disclose: including 2 expected to facilitate disclosure (self-affirmation, attachment security), and 3 expected to inhibit disclosure (self-disaffirmation, attachment insecurity, mortality salience). Israeli Jewish participants completed a survey including a manipulation of 1 of these states of mind, followed by questions concerning hostile thoughts and behaviors toward the Israeli Arab outgroup, past minor criminal behaviors, and socially undesirable traits and behaviors. Self-affirmation led to more disclosures of all undesirable behaviors than neutral priming, whereas self-disaffirmation led to less disclosures. Mortality salience led to fewer disclosures of socially undesirable and criminal behaviors compared to neutral priming, but more disclosures of hostile thoughts and behaviors toward Israeli Arabs. Security priming facilitated disclosure of hostile attitudes toward Israeli Arabs. However, neither security nor insecurity priming had any other significant effects.

AB  - Despite post-racial rhetoric, stereotypes remain salient for American youth. We surveyed 150 elementary and middle schoolers in Northern California and conducted case studies of 12 students. Findings showed that (a) students hold school-related stereotypes that get stronger in middle school, (b) African American and Latino students experience greater divergence between stereotype awareness about their group and endorsement than other students, and (c) students who eschewed the applicability of stereotypes to them demonstrated higher engagement and achievement in math. This study has implications for studying race in schools and mathematics, and the need for urban educators to facilitate racialized counter-narratives.

AB  - Aims To understand the working experiences and career trajectories of male nurses in China.
   Background Compared with developed countries, men were far more under-represented in the nursing profession in China. Little is known about the working experiences of Chinese male nurses and the contextual factors that contribute to their low participation rate in the nursing profession.
   Methods In-depth interviews with twenty-five male nurses and two hospital administrators were conducted. All interviews were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results Chinese male nurses had better career prospects and promotion chances compared with female nurses. The extremely low participation rate of men in nursing was related to the prejudice among the general public as well as the low professional status and salary. Two unique contextual factors influenced the career trajectories of male nurses in China: (1) the major assignment mechanism in the college entrance examination and (2) the implementation of the two-child policy.
   Conclusion Although Chinese male nurses enjoyed many advantages compared with female nurses, they also encountered many difficulties related to working in a female-dominated profession.
   Implications for Nursing Management Appropriate measures should be taken to shift public attitudes towards male nurses, improve the professionalization of nursing and promote gender diversity and equity.

AB  - Violence between police and young black men is a longstanding issue that has gained national attention in recent years due to high-profile violent encounters. We conducted 48 semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders from different groups (young black men aged 14-24 years, parents, educators, police officers, and staff in youth serving organizations). Stakeholders were asked to (1) identify causes of violent encounters between police and young black men; (2) describe police officers who serve in their communities; and (3) describe interactions between police and young black men. Data were collected and analyzed using thematic analysis and content analysis methods. All stakeholder groups except police felt that violent encounters between police and young black men were caused by officers lacking a connection with communities. Fear and distrust across stakeholder groups was also seen as a cause of violent encounters; youth feared police after having seen or heard of violent encounters, while officers feared youth due to the availability of firearms and previous assaults on officers. Several stakeholder groups recognized that racism and prejudice among police was another cause of violence between police and young black men. Positive interactions between police and youth were seen as the result of established, trusting relationships developed over time. Future efforts to prevent violent encounters between police and young black men should engage multiple stakeholder groups. One avenue for engagement is through community mobilization efforts that foster collaboration, build community trust, and encourage implementation of policies, programs, and practices that prevent future violent encounters.

AB  - Background:
   Multiple theoretical frameworks identify attitudes and expectancies as important predictors of alcohol behavior. Few studies have examined demographic predictors of these evaluative and belief-based cognitive mediators in the general population, and none have examined them in large-scale studies of Hispanics, a group at higher risk for drinking behavior and problems. This study probes the extent to which dimensions of attitudes and expectancies share common demographic predictors in a large sample of Puerto Ricans, Cuban-Americans, Mexican-Americans, and South/Central Americans.
   Methods:
   The 2006 Hispanic Americans Baseline Alcohol Survey (HABLAS) used a multistage cluster sample design to interview 5,224 individuals randomly selected from households in Miami, New York, Philadelphia, Houston, and Los Angeles. This study focused on 2,773 respondents self-identified as current drinkers. Multiple linear regression was used to identify predictors of positive and negative dimensions of attitudes and expectancies, controlling for various background variables.
   Results:
   Religious affiliation selectively predicted alcohol attitudes, with Catholics having more positive and fewer negative attitudes than other religious groups. Hispanic group selectively predicted alcohol expectancies, with Cuban-Americans having less positive and less negative expectancies than other groups. Being U.S.-born or male predicted more positive attitudes and expectancies, but birthplace and gender did not predict negative dimensions of attitudes or expectancies. Higher acculturation and more education were linked to a decreased tendency to agree with any item. Age was positively and negatively associated with negative expectancies and positive attitudes, respectively, and having never been married, higher income, and unemployment were each linked to fewer negative attitudes.
   Conclusions:
   Although there is some overlap, attitudes and expectancies are influenced by different sociodemographic variables. Positive and negative dimensions of those constructs also show distinct patterns of relations. Prevention and treatment programs targeting cognitive mediators of behavior should be mindful of these differential determinants and future modeling endeavors should incorporate them.

AB  - Contemporary views regarding masculinity have focused on the ways in which socialized masculine ideologies influence, particularly negatively, the physical and psychological lives of men. Although sport has been conceptualized as an environment in which hypermasculine ideologies (e.g., emphasis on competition and indifference to physical pain) are learned and reinforced, few studies have quantitatively explored how. or if, masculine norms and gender roles differ between athletes and nonathletes and may be related to psychological distress and help-seeking. Male collegiate athletes (n = 220) and nonathletes (n = 203) completed a series of questionnaires to assess their level of conformity to masculine norms and gender role conflicts, depression, substance use, self-stigma, and attitudes and intentions to seek help. Through a series of multivariate and mediational analyses, we found that (a) athletes reported significantly higher levels of masculine norms (e.g., heterosexual self-presentation) and role conflicts than nonathletes; (b) gender role conflicts, such as between work and family, significantly predicted depressive symptomatology, whereas masculine norms, such as risk-taking, were related to greater alcohol use; and (c) across both groups of men, self-stigma partially mediated the relationship of conformity to masculine norms to negative attitudes about, and intentions to seek, psychological help. Although athletes more strongly identified with certain masculine norms, in both groups of men, overall conformity to masculine norms, but not gender role conflict, predicted more negative attitudes about seeking help, both directly and through increases in self-stigma.

AB  - Objective: The objective was to compare weight-bias attitudes among treatment-seeking obese patients with and without binge eating disorder (BED vs. NBO) and to explore racial and sex differences and correlates of weight-bias attitudes.
   Method: Participants included 221 obese patients (169 female, 52 male) seeking treatment for weight and eating, recruited through primary care settings; of these, 168 patients met BED criteria. Patients completed semi-structured interviews and psychometrically established self-report measures of attitudes about obesity, eating pathology and depression.
   Results: Main effects for group (BED vs. NBO) and race (White vs. African American) were significant. Patients with BED had significantly higher levels of negative attitudes towards obesity than NBO patients, while African American patients had significantly lower levels of weight bias than did White patients. Greater negative attitudes towards obesity were significantly correlated with higher levels of depression and eating pathology for all patients.
   Conclusions: Endorsement of negative weight bias was related to binge eating status, race, disordered eating, and depression. Primary care providers should be aware of weight biases among their patients. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: This experimental study in a population-based sample aimed to compare attitudes towards obesity following three different causal explanations for obesity (individual behavior, environmental factors, genetic factors).
   Methods: The data were derived from an online representative sample. A random subsample of n = 407 participants was included. Two independent variables were investigated: cause of obesity as described in the vignette and cause of obesity as perceived by the participant regardless of vignette. Quality features of the vignettes (accuracy and bias of the vignette) were introduced as moderators to regression models. Three stigmarelated outcomes (negative attitudes, blame and social distance) served as dependent variables.
   Results: Inaccuracy and bias was ascribed to the social environmental and genetic vignettes more often than to the individual cause vignette. Overall, participants preferred individual causes (72.6%). While personal beliefs did not differ between the genetic and environmental cause conditions (Chi(2) = 4.36, p = 0.113), both were different from the distribution seen in the individual cause vignette. Negative attitudes as well as blame were associated with the belief that individuals are responsible for obesity (b = 0.374, p = 0.003; 0.597, p < 0.001), but were not associated with vignette-manipulated causal explanation. The vignette presenting individual responsibility was associated with lower levels of social distance (b = -0.183, p = 0.043). After including perceived inaccuracy and bias as moderators, the individual responsibility vignette was associated with higher levels of blame (emphasis: b = 0.980, p = 0.010; bias: b = 0.778, p = 0.001) and the effect on social distance vanished.
   Conclusions: This study shows that media and public health campaigns may solidify beliefs that obesity is due to individual causes and consequently increase stigma when presenting individual behavior as a cause of obesity. Public health messages that emphasize the role of social environmental or genetic causes may be ineffective because of entrenched beliefs.

AB  - Laura Makepeace Stephen, Virginia Woolf's half-sister from her father's first marriage, is a figure who has only marginally been discussed in literary criticism. The limited corpus of references that exists on her life and mental health condition gives accounts of idiocy, lunacy, schizophrenia, Asperger's syndrome and sexual abuse. Laura Stephen was probably victim to at times crude Victorian generalisations and misdiagnoses due to limited medical knowledge, poor resources and lack of scientific research and investigation. Her childhood was spent in a familial environment riddled with prejudices and sheer embarrassment about bringing up a child whose development was seen as abnormal. From early adulthood, Laura was sent to a series of mental institutions which simply kept her surviving, alleviating her family's sense of burden, but without any treatment interventions. In this paper, we hypothesise that her condition consisted of an intellectual disability and autism with a co-morbid psychosis. We consider the complexity of Laura Stephen's case by examining a number of aspects including psychological and social dimensions of her life.

AB  - VET colleges in China are positioned at the bottom of the educational hierarchy, absorbing the 'left-over' students with 'less desirable' academic records. VET students are stereotyped as 'stupid and lazy' youths suffering considerable prejudice in Chinese society. Drawing on Bourdieu's theoretical insights, this paper investigates the experiences of students in VET colleges and their teachers' perspectives on them. I explore how teachers' stereotyping habitus is practised in VET colleges and how it affects their students' learning experiences. The findings demonstrate that the teachers' pedagogic practices in class impose a designated cultural arbitrary via a hidden curriculum. The students adopted 'passing time' attitudes in class as a response to their teachers' 'misrecognition'. The paper examines how a system of unequal power relations in Chinese VET college is maintained and legitimised, which contributes to the 'transmission' and reproduction of the very culture that has shaped the standing of VET in Chinese society.

AB  - Hydrogeochemical and Health Risk Assessments of trace elements are integral to groundwater resource assessment, utilization, and human health. Investigation of groundwater chemistry and trace elemental impact on local inhabitants were attempted in Shanmuganadhi basin, Tamilnadu, India. About 60 groundwater samples were collected during the pre-monsoon period and analyzed for hydrochemical composition, including major and trace elements (Fe, Cr, Ni, Cu Pb, Mn, and As) to isolate chemical characteristics and human health risk assessment. Groundwater geochemistry is prejudiced by geochemical reactions uniting cation exchange, dissolution and precipitation, adsorption, and anthropogenic contributions. About thirty-two percent of groundwater samples recorded higher F-(>1.5 mg/L) than the prescribed limit suggests sources from rock weathering and silicate dissolution. Nitrates (>45.0 mg/L) suggest sources from agricultural influences. Water types indicate alkalis (Na+ + K+) dominating alkali earth (Ca2+ - Mg2+) and strong acids (Cl- and SO42-) looming weak acid (CO32- and HCO3-) irrespective of water samples. The geochemical stability diagram suggests precipitation of silica, carbonate, and magnesium and dissolution of sulphate minerals along the groundwater flow path. Significant correlation between major ions and trace elements (Pb, Mn, Ni, and Cu) suggests origin from rock weathering, human impacts, and cultivation practices. Non-carcinogenic human risk for trace elements was higher in children compared with adults via ingestion and dermal exposure. The carcinogenic result suggests that Cr in CHK (7.1 x 10(-2)) and HBG (4.3 x 10(-)(2)) have the most excellent chance of cancer risk. The environmental risk category attempted using Comprehensive risk factor (CRI) suggests Pb (3.2-CHK, 2.6-HBG) with potential cancer risk. The comprehensive evaluation index recommends environmental damage between mild to moderate, indicating continuous exposure of traceable elements might result in cancer cause to the inhabitants. The study suggests water quality seems to be prejudiced by various geological and anthropogenic causes and endorses counteractive measures and proper execution of existing laws to protect groundwater resources in the study area.

AB  - Since first contact with Europeans, Native American nations have strived to maintain and strengthen their sovereignty. Yet, non-Native individuals and groups, as well as federal, state, and local governments, continue to challenge this sovereignty. Despite the critical importance of sovereignty, the only academic study focused on U.S. public attitudes toward Native nation sovereignty predated the rise of Native nation gaming and relied on samples from three universities. In our study, we surveyed over 2000 White Americans from across the United States to examine attitudes toward Native nation sovereignty. Of the many factors that may influence these attitudes, we focused on three: belief in "the casino Indian" stereotype, the perception that Native American interests conflict with the interests of Whites, and the presence of Native nation gaming in participants' states. We find two significant models predicting attitudes towards Native nation sovereignty. First, greater endorsement of the casino Indian stereotype is associated with more negative attitudes toward Native nation sovereignty. This relationship is explained, at least in part, by the perception that Native American interests conflict with the interests of Whites. That is, the more White participants endorsed the casino Indian sterereotype, the more apt they were to believe that their interests conflict with Native Americans, which in turn is related to more negative attitudes towards Native nation sovereignty. The second model revealed that the presence of Native nation gaming in the participant's state has important indirect implications for attitudes towards Native nation sovereignty. Specifically, White participants living in states with Native nation gaming are more likely to endorse the casino Indian stereotype, which is related to greater perceived conflict of interest with Native Americans, and, ultimately perceived conflict of interest is associated with more negative attitudes toward Native nation sovereignty. We situate our findings relative to group position theory and discuss practical implications for Native nation sovereignty.

AB  - Objective: to know the experiences of family members of adolescents with gender incongruence. Method: this is a qualitative case study, supported by the Calgary Family Assessment and Intervention Models theoretical-methodological framework. Data collection took place through semi-structured interviews, participant observation in family groups and document analysis, with eight family members. Data analysis was performed following the precepts of content analysis. Results: with family assessment, two categories emerged: "Challenges in the face of gender transition", which highlighted the problems related to the expectations created at birth, new names, pronouns and gender fluidity and the fear of prejudice, and "Supporting aspects in the face of the possibility of gender transition", which revealed family support as a strong point. Conclusion: knowing the experiences allowed us to understand the challenges that family members face when facing physical and emotional aspects of their children's gender transition. It was noticed that the act of seeking help and offering support is important for a healthy transition. The findings provided a better understanding of family issues and provided suggestions on how nursing can develop care for this population.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to characterize the Portuguese general population's knowledge and attitudes about postpartum depression, and analyze its sociodemographic and clinical correlates.
   Design: A cross-sectional internet survey.
   Setting: Participants were recruited through advertisements on social media websites, in thematic forums and by email.
   Participants: A total of 621 people in the general population (88.1% women) participated in the study.
   Measurements: Participants were questioned about sociodemographic and clinical data, personal contact with postpartum depression, awareness of public education campaigns about postpartum depression and knowledge and attitudes towards postpartum depression (outcome variables).
   Findings: The sample presented a good level of knowledge and positive attitudes about postpartum depression despite the existence of some gaps in knowledge and some stereotypes. Personal contact with postpartum depression was associated with higher levels of knowledge (p < .001) and more positive attitudes towards postpartum depression (p < .001) and participants who assisted to public education campaigns reported higher levels of knowledge about postpartum depression (p < .001). Lower levels of knowledge and more negative attitudes about postpartum depression were found in men and older and less educated people.
   Key conclusions and implications for practice: These results show the importance of awareness-raising and education campaigns directed at the general population, particularly focusing on people who can act as the postpartum women's support network (e.g., partners, parents, in-laws), to increase the level of knowledge and to foster more positive attitudes towards postpartum depression.

AB  - Federal and state wildlife managers have endeavored to reduce populations of cormorants on Lake Champlain since 1999. These efforts have relied on the presumption of a nuisance species attitude toward cormorants shared among the public. We employed the concept of attitude strength to explore beliefs, sentiments, and intentions that different recreational groups hold toward cormorants, and to gauge the social acceptability of population control on Lake Champlain. Results confirmed that people generally agreed with the nuisance species label. Overall attitudes toward cormorants leaned toward the negative side, and respondents tended to support hazing of nesting birds, egg oiling, and even state-sponsored shooting as population control measures. Strongest objections to cormorants came from anglers and lakeshore homeowners, whereas boaters and conservation group members were more ambivalent about cormorants and population control measures. Moreover, when analyzing attitude strength dimensions, results showed that overall ambivalence about cormorants was prevalent, negative attitudes may be based in cultural differences and social class, and those with the strongest negative attitudes may be fitting knowledge to attitudes.

AB  - Objective: Distrust in vaccination is a public health concern. In responding to vaccination distrust, the psychosocial context it occurs in needs to be accounted for. But this psychosocial context is insufficiently understood. We examined how Australians' attitudes to childhood vaccination relate to broader psychosocial characteristics pertaining to two key areas: health and government.
   Design: 4370 Australians were surveyed and divided into five vaccine attitude groups. Logistic univariable and multivariable regression analyses were used to compare differences in psychosocial characteristics between these groups.
   Results: Multivariate analysis showed that, compared to groups with positive vaccine attitudes, groups with negative attitudes were more informed, engaged and independent health consumers, with greater adherence to complementary medicine, but lower belief in holistic health. They had higher distrust in the mainstream healthcare system, higher conspiracist ideation, and were more likely to vote for minor political parties. They were more likely to be male, religious, have children, and self-report better health.
   Conclusions: This research revealed HOW profiles of psychosocial characteristics differed between each of the five attitudes to childhood vaccines. Practice implications: These findings are useful for tailoring communications about vaccination-related concerns. They also show that more granular classification and measurement of vaccine attitudes may be useful. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gay and bisexual men (GBM) are more likely to attempt suicide than heterosexual men. This disparity is commonly interpreted using minority stress theory; however, specific pathways from antigay stigma to suicidal behavior are poorly understood. We aimed to estimate associations between multiple constructs of stigma and suicide attempts among adult GBM, and to measure the proportion of these associations mediated by distinct suicide risk factors, thus identifying proximal points of intervention. Data were drawn from a Canadian community-based survey of adult GBM. Structural equation modeling was used to compare associations between three latent constructs-enacted stigma (e.g., discrimination, harassment), anticipated prejudice (worry about encountering antigay/bisexual prejudice), and sexuality concealment-and self-reported suicide attempts (last 12 months). Coefficients were estimated for direct, indirect, and total pathways and evaluated based on magnitude and statistical significance. The proportion of associations mediated by depression, drug/alcohol use, and social isolation was calculated using indirect paths. Among 7872 respondents, 3.4% reported a suicide attempt in the past 12 months. The largest total association was observed for enacted stigma, and this association was partially mediated by depression and drug/alcohol use. The total association of anticipated prejudice was relatively smaller and mediated by depression and social isolation. Concealment had an inverse association with suicide attempts as mediated by depression but was also positively associated with suicide attempts when mediated through social isolation. Multiple constructs of antigay stigma were associated with suicide attempts; however, mediating pathways differed by construct, suggesting that a combination of strategies is required to prevent suicide in adult GBM.

AB  - Expressive cultural activities, such as viewing visual art, drama, or dance, are perceived as beneficial to individuals and societies, justifying public funding. However, not everyone benefits and participates equally. We intentionally sampled infrequent and frequent attendees among young adults in the Netherlands. Results indicated that infrequent and frequent attendees differed in expressive cultural activity constraints and socialization, though not on demographic background. Their cultural, social, and emotional experience through self-report and physiological data revealed no significant differences between the groups' experience of a dramatic performance. These outcomes suggest that, as an example of expressive cultural activity, a dramatic performance experience can be equally emotionally beneficial to frequent and infrequent attendees, an important prerequisite to broader appeal and intergroup contact. Implications of the use of physiological data in leisure experience research are discussed.

AB  - Stereotypes associated with Asian Americans (model minority group) are, at times, positive. Endorsement of these stereotypes (i.e., internalized racialism) might contribute to Asian's distress and their attitudes toward seeking services. The purpose of this study was to use the theory of "status-based rejection sensitivity" as a way to examine the relationship between internalized racialism (i.e., endorsement and/or internalization of positive Asian stereotypes) and psychological distress, and attitudes toward help-seeking among 291 Asian Americans. Results indicated that higher levels of endorsement of positive Asian stereotypes were related to higher levels of psychological distress and more negative attitudes toward help-seeking. No evidence was found for the moderating roles of internalized racialism in the endorsement of positive Asian stereotypes-distress/help-seeking links.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between levels of multicultural personality, the quantity and quality of intergroup contact, and positive attitudes (allophilia) toward Asian Americans among college students enrolled at a Midwestern university in the United States. Asian Americans represent the fastest growing racial/ethnic cohort in the United States, yet they continue to face oppression and racism. Although extensive research has examined the impact of intergroup contact and individual difference variables on negative attitudes toward minority groups, much less research has examined factors impacting positive outgroup (or allophilic) attitudes. Furthermore, recent research has documented that narrow personality traits (e.g., multicultural personality) are superior to broad traits (e.g., Big Five) in predicting attitudes and behavior in multicultural contexts. The authors hypothesized that the quantity and quality of contact with Asian Americans would mediate the direct relationship between multicultural personality and allophilic attitudes toward Asian Americans. A sample of 876 undergraduate students (M-age = 19.5 years, 69.4% female, 79% White) were recruited for structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses. Results largely supported the hypotheses, suggesting that quality and quantity of intergroup contact mediate the relationship between multicultural personality and allophilia. Further, using the newer procedure of exploratory structural equation modeling, the authors identified a bifactor model with a strong general factor undergirding the Multicultural Personality Inventory. Positive attitudes toward Asian Americans are predicted by multicultural personality and mediated by intergroup contact quality and quantity.

AB  - The other-race effect (ORE) in face recognition refers to better recognition memory for faces of one's own race than faces of another racea common phenomenon among individuals living in primarily mono-racial societies. In this article, we review findings suggesting that early visual and sociocultural experiences shape one's processing of familiar and unfamiliar race classes and give rise to the ORE within the 1st year of life. However, despite its early development, the ORE can be prevented, attenuated, and even reversed given experience with a novel race class. Social implications of the ORE are discussed in relation to development of race-based preferences for social partners and racial prejudices.

AB  - The history of travel writing positions the genre as a form that invents and circulates problematic image(s) of Africa. Emerging from this biased background, postcolonial African travel writing offer reimaginations regarding how to think about the continent differently. This article explores how Sihle Khumalo's Dark Continent My Black Arse, performs this reimagination through counter-travel. I interrogate Khumalo's appropriation of parody on three sites-naming, landscape, and the body-to counter the prevalent (mis) representation of the continent and propagate alternative ways of imagining Africa in travel writing. This article argues that although parody as counter-travel strategy is a poignant tool for critiquing the negative representation, authorial prejudices allow for slippages that propagate the same set of biases the form intends to critique.

AB  - If appreciate the opportunity offered by the editor to reflect on the relationship between cognitive This topic has interested me my entire professional life, because I was admitted to graduate school to study social psychology and then eventually migrated to cognitive psychology. The organization of this paper is as follows: I first relate my (somewhat puzzling) personal experiences that led me to wonder about relations between cognitive and social psychology. I suggest that for many topics, the placement of a topic of study in one field or the other is arbitrary. Next I selectively review some common historical influences oil the development of both fields, ones that have made them similar, Both grew from common seeds, which include Gestalt psychology as it became applied to a wider array of topics, experimental psychologists becoming interested in attitude change during and after World War II, and Bartlett's famous book on Remembering: A study in experimental and social psychology. Next I review some research from my lab that picked up themes from Bartlett's work and that, in some aspects, combines cognitive and social approaches. I also discuss the issue of memory conformity or the social contagion of memory, and conclude with thoughts about how social and cognitive psychologists might collaborate on an exciting new arena, creating empirical studies of collective memory.

AB  - The social world is stratified. Social hierarchies are known but often disavowed as anachronisms or unjust. Nonetheless, hierarchies may persist in social memory. In three studies (total N > 200,000), we found evidence of social hierarchies in implicit evaluation by race, religion, and age. Participants implicitly evaluated their own racial group most positively and the remaining racial groups in accordance with the following hierarchy: Whites > Asians > Blacks > Hispanics. Similarly, participants implicitly evaluated their own religion most positively and the remaining religions in accordance with the following hierarchy: Christianity > Judaism > Hinduism or Buddhism > Islam. In a final study, participants of all ages implicitly evaluated age groups following this rule: children > young adults > middle-age adults > older adults. These results suggest that the rules of social evaluation are pervasively embedded in culture and mind.

AB  - Diversity education occurs in universities and workplaces, but research has progressed in disciplinary silos. Consequently, the field of diversity training has failed to utilize theoretical and practical advances from related fields. Our research addresses these limitations. Integrating educational and social psychology theories, we develop a relational model of training that offers perspective taking as an outcome of diversity training and cross-race friendships as a relational experience that spills over to the training environment. Our first 2 studies, conducted in organizational and academic settings, confirmed the model. Pre- and postcourse assessments revealed that while participants became more aware of the value of perspective taking and their need to improve this skill, only those with close cross-race friends improved their reported perspective taking abilities. Other forms of interracial contact and racial attitudes had no effect. Supporting theoretical predictions, belief in a just world mediated this friendship effect. Given the influence of cross-race friendships, we conclude with a third study that, using an experimental design, examined the effectiveness and underlying processes of a technique that increased participants' willingness to engage in cross-race friendships and other prosocial diversity and ally behaviors at work (e.g., diversity voice). Our findings illustrate the power of relationships and offer new theoretical directions and practical applications for diversity training and education.

AB  - Black and Latina women are disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS. Despite existing research linking social networks and HIV risk among men who have sex with men (MSM) and other high-risk populations, little research has examined how ethnic/racial minority women's social networks shape HIV prevention and intervention targets. Using interviews with a sample of 165 predominantly Black and Latina-identifying women from a small city in the Western U.S., this research examines the relationship between egocentric network characteristics and HIV knowledge, attitudes, and testing history. Results reveal that network characteristics play a significant role in shaping HIV-related knowledge, prejudice, and testing intention but not HIV testing history. Individual-level factors like homelessness and perceptions of testing barriers are more salient for explaining testing behaviors than network characteristics. Intervention efforts to improve knowledge and reduce prejudice among Black and Latina women may benefit from mobilizing network ties.

AB  - Though there is evidence of an historical exclusion of trans women from lesbian feminist separatist spaces supported by radical feminist lesbian anti-trans discourse as well as modern examples of anti-trans perspectives promoted by feminists sometimes described as Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists, it remains unclear as to if there is a significant association between being a lesbian cis woman feminist and harboring negative attitudes toward trans women or alternatively, if the recent proliferation of exclusionary tactics directed toward trans women's rights (especially via social media) has been the result of loud voices among a minority who have been successful anti-trans mouthpieces as of late. The current study utilizes survey data (N = 1461 cis women; n = 331 lesbian cis women) to investigate the following research questions: (1) do lesbian cis women feminists express greater levels of negativity toward trans women than other cis women (heterosexual, bisexual, pansexual, and asexual) do? and (2) is there a relationship between feminist identity among lesbian cis women and the stigmatization of trans women (as undeserving of rights, as incapable parents/mothers, as excluded from the military, and as sexually problematic)? Results provide ample evidence of anti-trans perspectives among some lesbian cis women feminists. Overall, the findings provide a starting point to begin to understand how to dismantle the complexities embedded in the relationships between feminism, lesbian identity, and trans negativity and work toward a trans-inclusive future of feminism.

AB  - ContextSimulated patients (SPs) are extensively used in the teaching of medical communication, both for students and doctors. They occupy a unique middle ground between patients and physicians: although free from the prejudices that medical training brings, they work closely with clinical tutors to promote the principles of patient-centred consulting. Despite this, there is relatively little research around their views on what makes for good communication practice. This study aims to address this gap in the literature through a qualitative analysis of SPs' opinions, especially in the context of medical student communication.
   MethodsEighteen SPs from two medical schools, Hull York Medical School and Durham, were interviewed, using an in-depth, one-to-one, semi-structured approach. Data, transcribed verbatim, were thematically analysed.
   ResultsThree global themes were identified: (i) listening and empathy and showing it, (ii) continual human connection and (iii) information flow from the patient. These three themes, termed the communication triad, form a type of virtuous circle, each facilitating the other. Listening and empathy were facilitated through attributes, including attentive non-verbal communication, and through responding to cues, including making effective empathetic statements. Continual human connection was facilitated through successful beginnings, including preferring open questions to robotic' tick-list questions and allowing patients time to have their say. Mirroring, professional appearance, appropriate physical contact and a human approach were amongst other factors facilitating connection with patients. Information flow was encouraged by factors including showing an interest in the patient and use of silence; flow was curtailed by undesirable attributes, including interrupting, dismissive communication and making assumptions about aspects such as sexuality.
   ConclusionThis first in-depth study of SPs' views on medical consulting identifies a communication triad that both affirms and builds on the current literature base. Five novel teaching points emerge, with clear relevance for best practice communication teaching and curricula design.
   Simulated patients identify recommended medical communication attributes: listening and empathy, encouraging information flow, and striving for a continual human connection.

KW  - CONSERVATION
AB  - Although the importance of evaluating the effectiveness of conservation education programs cannot be underestimated, few evaluations of these programs and their resulting impact on the environment have been conducted. A partnership between scientists, educators, and local administrators on an evaluation program has been developed to evaluate a model of education program evaluation that includes short- and long-term evaluation of (1) knowledge and attitude change, (2) behavior change, and (3) positive biological impact. Previous work has shown short-term knowledge retention from this education program. In the current study follow-up evaluations were collected from students at 14 schools outside the Kalinzu Forest Reserve, Uganda. By comparing performance 30 days, 1 year and 2 years after the initial program we demonstrate that knowledge gain from this program is not transient. However, although knowledge is a prerequisite for appropriate conservation actions it does not guarantee appropriate behaviors will be performed. Anecdotal evidence of behavior change and positive biological impact is discussed within the context of the challenges with changing behavior and evaluating the true biological impacts of those behaviors. Ultimately, conservation professionals will need to partner with educators and social scientists to effectively measure the impact of conservation education and human-based conservation programs on primate populations and their habitat.

AB  - This study aims to present a sociocultural analysis of the linguistic experience of South Asian women who immigrate to Taiwan to marry Taiwanese men. In Taiwan, foreign wives and their husbands and children have gradually become a new multicultural, multi-ethnic social group. We argue that because of the power gap between the narrators (who write in Chinese) and the narrative subjects (who are unable to 'write back' in Chinese), language has powerfully impacted the patterns of prejudice and the construction of subjects' identities. Marriage immigrants are often subjected to the negative stereotypes created and exaggerated by language standardisation within a dominant ideology. Learning Chinese empowers them to gradually engage in social participation outside of their families in the public space. Written in Chinese, their nonfiction works represent a narrative turn in Taiwan. In this manner, a range of voices are actively resisting discriminatory acts. The foreign wives ask not only for basic rights such as legal residency and work permits but also for the right to enjoy equal and shared cultural interaction in Taiwan. This study shows that language acquisition and writing is an effective means of promoting equal exchange and dialogue between cultures within the broader transformations of globalisation.

AB  - With increasing anthropogenic pressure, interactions between humans and wildlife may become more frequent, including conflictual ones. To reduce conflicts, it is important to understand how different factors (e.g. education, previous experience, demographic variables) interplay with each other and contribute to the emergence of negative attitudes and behaviours toward wildlife in humans. To address this issue, we conducted a large-scale questionnaire in Malaysia, focusing on potential conflicts between human and other primates. We used generalized linear mixed models to assess how formal education, knowledge about primates, negative experience and potential competition affected participants' negative attitudes to primates (i.e. how humans perceive primates), their behavioural intentions (i.e. opinion on how to reduce conflicts) and behaviour (i.e. measures taken to reduce negative interactions). We found that negative experience and potential competition had a negative impact on participants' attitude and behavior (i.e. primates were more likely perceived as filthy, as negatively affecting residents' health and safety, and as an increasing problem, with participants more likely to use invasive methods, including captures). Both higher education and better knowledge of primates predicted more positive behavioural intentions (i.e. primates should be protected, non-invasive interventions should be used). Higher education, however, was also linked to more negative attitudes (i.e. primates negatively affect residents' health and safety), and partly to negative behavior (e.g. use of invasive methods). In contrast, better knowledge about primates predicted positive behaviour (i.e. exclusive use of non-invasive methods). Therefore, although better knowledge of primates had no clear effect on human attitudes, it may impact on their decisions to reduce potential conflicts with wildlife, and might be the most powerful tool to mitigate conflicts between humans and other species.

AB  - The current paradigm on the nature of viruses is based on early work of the 'phage group' (the pro-phage concept) and molecular biologists working on tumour viruses (the protooncogene concept). It posits that viruses evolved from either prokaryotic or eukaryotic cellular genes that became infectious via their association with capsid genes. In this view, after their emergence viruses continued to evolve by stealing cellular genes (the escape model). This paradigm has been challenged recently by scientists who propose that viruses pre-dated modern cells. In particular, the discovery of Mimivirus has stimulated a lot of discussions on the nature of viruses. There are two major schools of thought, those who defend the escape model, suggesting that giant viruses are giant pickpockets (chimera), and those who emphasize their uniqueness and ancient origin. Comparative genomics of Mimivirus and related viruses (nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses) have produced a lot of data that have been interpreted according to the prejudices of the authors and thus failed until now to generate a consensus. I briefly review here the history of these debates and how they lead to new proposals, such as the definition of viruses as capsid-encoding organisms or else the recognition of their fundamentally cellular nature, the virocell concept.

AB  - Background/Context: Muslim communities in the United States have increasingly been the target of the state security apparatus, virulent public discourse, and increasing cultural xenophobia. Since 2001, individuals perceived to be from Muslim backgrounds have experienced dramatically increasing numbers of racially motivated attacks. What is often called "Islamaphobia," or anti-Muslim discrimination or racism, has continued to rise in the past decade. Muslim communities face an acute political and cultural attack in which their actions and words are increasingly scrutinized and questioned. College campuses have been particular sites of contestation. This article explores how Muslim undergraduates understand their campus experiences.
   Purpose/Objective/Focus of Study: I examine how Muslim students expressed feelings of isolation and alienation on their campus community in a context of state surveillance programs targeting Muslim students and communities. In particular, I explore student narratives of being conscious of peer suspicion. Further; I investigate how self-consciousness of their outsider status created an environment where Muslim students feel they must continually attempt to make their peers comfortable with their presence while also challenging dominant stereotypes of Muslims. This study gives voice to Muslim undergraduate students as they negotiate prejudices, scrutiny, and discrimination on college campuses.
   Setting: Data was collected in southern California because there is a critical mass of community, concentration of students, and number of political advocacy and service providers for the diverse Muslim communities in the region. Focusing on this age group allows for an examination of this specific generation's understandings of race, identity, and citizenship, because they came of age amidst a rise in discrimination and racism against those associated with Islam and Muslims.
   Data Collection and Analysis: Data was collected through semi-structured life history interviews and ethnographic observations of Muslim undergraduates in Southern California. The interviews spanned between three and five hours each and were conducted over multiple meetings with each participant. Drawing from a critical feminist framework, interviews were conducted not simply to garner data, but rather to allow students the opportunity explore their own experiences, analyze their histories, and engage in social analysis. The research utilized a multi-level coding scheme in order to understand individual meaning-making processes.
   Findings/Results: This study reveals that Muslim students often feel politically and culturally targeted and isolated on their campuses and do not feel that their peers and teachers engage with them as full members of the campus community.
   Conclusions: This study contributes to the growing body of literature that demonstrates the multiracial demographic of students who choose the term Muslim as a primary form of identity. This study reveals that Muslim students often felt politically and culturally targeted and isolated on their campuses and did not feel that their peers and teachers engaged with them as full members of the campus community. Colleges and universities must take proactive steps to engage Muslim students in dialogue about their concerns, fears, and questions about issues of freedoms and protections on campus.

AB  - In this paper, math anxiety descriptions are extracted from Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) reviews using text mining techniques. Learners' emotional states associated with math phobia represent substantial barriers to learning mathematics and acquiring basic mathematical knowledge required for future career success. MOOC platforms accumulate big sets of educational data, learners' feedback being of par- ticular research interest. Thirty-eight math MOOCs on Udemy and 1,898 learners' re- views are investigated in this study. VADER sentiment analysis, k-means clustering of content with negative sentiment, and sentence embedding based on the Bidirection- al Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) language model allow identify- ing a few clusters containing descriptions of various negative emotions related to bad math experiences in the past, a cluster with descriptions of regrets about missed op- portunities due to negative attitudes towards math in the past, and a cluster describ- ing gradual overcoming of math anxiety while progressing through a math MOOC. The constructed knowledge graph makes it possible to visualize some regularities pertain- ing to different negative emotions experienced by math MOOC learners.

AB  - We argue that attitudes about immigration can be better understood by paying closer attention to the various ways in which national group boundaries are demarcated. We describe two related lines of work that address this. The first deals with national group definitions and, based on evidence from studies carried out in England and analyses of international survey data, argues that the relationship between national identification and prejudice toward immigrants is contingent on the extent to which ethnic or civic definitions of nationality are endorsed. The second, which uses European survey data, examines support for ascribed and acquired criteria that can be applied when determining who is permitted to migrate to one's country, and the various forms of national and individual threat that affect support for these criteria. We explain how the research benefits from a multilevel approach and also suggest how these findings relate to some current policy debates.

KW  - IMPACT
AB  - Rationale: Individuals who choose to obtain genetic information may learn that their genetic profile confers health risks to themselves or offspring. Individuals may react more negatively to this information when personal attitudes, perceived norms, and/or the decision to receive results confiict with one another.
   Objective: We predicted that holding more negative attitudes (personal evaluations) or injunctive norms (perceptions of others' approval) toward obtaining genetic test results would prospectively predict greater confiict about the decision to undergo sequencing and less disclosure of sequencing results to family members. We also expected attitudes and norms to interact, such that attitudes would be negatively associated with decisional confiict and positively associated with disclosure when injunctive norms were positive, but weakly associated with outcomes when injunctive norms were negative.
   Method: Participants (N=312) were enrolled in a genomic sequencing trial focused on identifying carrier genetic variants, refiecting a variant that might affect their biological children's or grandchildren's health. Participants reported attitudes and injunctive norms, underwent sequencing, and later received results indicating carrier status for at least one variant. Decisional confiict was assessed at immediate post-test, and 1and 6-month follow-ups. Disclosure of results to children and siblings were assessed at 1 and 6 months.
   Results: In structural equation models with covariates, attitudes were negatively associated with post-test and 1month decisional confiict. Injunctive norms were negatively associated with decisional confiict at 1 and 6 months and positively associated with disclosure to children and siblings at 1 month. The significant attitudes by injunctive norms interaction predicting post-test decisional confiict supported lower decisional confiict when attitudes, norms, and the decision to receive results were all aligned. Exploratory analyses supported indirect effects of attitudes and norms on 6-month sibling disclosure via 1month decisional confiict.
   Conclusion: Results support roles of psychosocial factors in decisional confiict and disclosure after receiving sequencing results.

AB  - Being able to take the perspective of others is an important part of human social competence that has considerable impacts on social cognition. Previous research found that taking the perspective of an outgroup member is an effective strategy for reducing stereotyping and prejudice towards an outgroup member. Yet other studies showed that the perspective taking heightens the stereotyping in certain situations. In the present study, we hypothesized and found that the effect of perspective taking on stereotyping depends on the perspective taker's need for cognitive closure (NFC). In Study 1, after taking the perspective of the elderly, people with high NFC used more stereotypic traits in describing the elderly, whereas those low in NFC used significantly less. In Study 2, people with high NFC had higher level of stereotype accessibility, as compared with people with low NFC. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - University education affects the attitudes of future professionals toward people with mental illness. To evaluate and compare stigmatizing attitudes of university students from nursing, psychology, and occupational therapy careers toward people with severe mental disorder (SMD), a multisite, non-randomized, pre-post-test design was used with evaluations before and after a practicum program in mental health. Evaluation was done on a convenience sample of 520 students. The Mental Illness Clinicians' Attitudes (MIws1CA-4) scale was used to assess attitudes and a mixed linear model was used to compare the pre- and post-test data. Our results show that the practicum was slightly effective at reducing negative attitudes toward people with mental illness. Students' attitudes changed significantly after the training when considering career and country, although the changes were small. Nursing and psychology, but not occupational therapy, showed decreased stigma. Although nursing decreases negative attitudes in the post-test, it achieves higher scores than other careers. Social science's professionals are less stigmatizing than health professionals such as nurses, a result that could be associated with the approach used in the training of students. Although the practicum decreases stigma toward people diagnosed with SMD, its effect is reduced; it would be necessary to incorporate more specific actions in order to decrease the stigma further. The negative attitudes that decreased with professional training, particularly, were those related to behaviors in the workplace.
   Public Significance Statement This study shows that health career clinical practices are effective in reducing stigma toward users with severe mental disorders. However, the changes are small and there would be differences in the levels of stigma between careers with more psychosocial training than those with more biomedical training. Clinical practices are required to consider reducing stigma and establish more clearly the role of the teacher who models this process.

AB  - This paper explores the interface between the fields of Education and Communication with respect to developing narratives that can identify leadership among women who live daily with social inequalities and violence. These studies, debates, and research took place at the AFRODIaSPORAS Research Center on Black Women, Audiovisual Culture, and Educommunication in Urban Peripheries at the Rio de Janeiro State University (UERJ) School of Education from Baixada Fluminense (FEBF), Duque de Caxias city, RJ, Brazil. Two studies were chosen as examples of the specific leadership developed by black women using concepts from Education, Communication, Intersectionality, and a daily struggle against prejudice and racism. The first study reports the experiences of a black deaf woman who teaches sign language alongside the history and culture of black deaf people. The second introduces a young black filmmaker who produces new portrayals of the Baixada Fluminense (BF) region. Findings: Both studies show the authorship of the interviewees, demonstrating that education and black consciousness empower people to become leaders who respond to social exclusion. Non-formal education has been employed as a method to propagate narratives refuting stereotypes and colonial beliefs that still appear on the curriculum of formal education and in hegemonic media. These two young black women are protagonists, educommunicators, social activists, and leaders.

AB  - In this article, I describe some of my research on caring, helping, active bystandership, and the origins of genocide and collective violence, as a background to interventions in real-world settings aimed to create positive change. They include working with teachers to create classrooms that promote caring and helping; training police to prevent or stop unnecessary harmful actions by fellow officers, and similarly students in schools to prevent harmful actions; promoting reconciliation, using trainings and workshops, and educational radio programs in Rwanda, Burundi, and the Congo; working to improve Dutch-Muslim relations in Amsterdam after violence; and a number of other projects. In these projects, information and participants' experiences combined to create "experiential understanding." Evaluation studies showed positive effects. These projects and their evaluation show that research-and theory-based interventions can be effective. An initial motivation for this work was my early childhood experience during the Holocaust in Hungary and receiving help from bystanders.
   Public Significance Statement
   This review of research, interventions, and applications in real-world settings shows that research on helping behavior and on the origins of great violence by groups can be applied to prevent violence, for example, by police or by students who would bully, and to help groups reconcile after great violence, for example, the genocide in Rwanda. It shows that knowledge gained in research can be used to make a difference in the world.

AB  - The discrepancy between ingroup favoritism and outgroup hostility is well established in social psychology. Under which conditions does "ingroup love" turn into "outgroup hate"? Studies with natural groups suggest that when group membership is based on (dis)similarity of moral beliefs, people are willing to not only help the ingroup, but also harm the outgroup. The key limitation of these studies is that the use of natural groups confounds the effects of shared morality with the history of intergroup relations. In two preregistered experiments, we test the effect of morality-based group membership on intergroup behavior using artificial groups that help disentangling these effects. We use the recently developed Intergroup Parochial and Universal Cooperation (IPUC) game which differentiates between behavioral options of weak parochialism (helping the ingroup), strong parochialism (harming the outgroup), universal cooperation (helping both groups), and egoism (profiting individually). The preliminary findings suggest that morality-based groups exhibit less egoism, more weak parochialism, more universal cooperation, and less strong parochialism. These findings contradict earlier evidence from natural groups and suggest that (dis)similarity of moral beliefs is not sufficient to cross the boundary between "ingroup love" and "outgroup hate". The third and final preregistered study aims to replicate these findings in a different cultural setting and test the mediating role of trust in this process.

AB  - We investigated whether individual items on the nine item William's Perceived Everyday Discrimination Scale (EDS) functioned differently by age (< 45 vs >= 45) within five racial groups in the United States: Asians (n= 2,017); Hispanics (n= 2,688); Black Caribbeans (n= 1,377); African Americans (n= 3,434); and Whites (n= 854). We used data from the 2001-2003 National Survey of American Lives and the 2001-2003 National Latino and Asian Studies. Multiple-indicator, multiple-cause models (MIMIC) were used to examine differential item functioning (DIF) on the EDS by age within each racial/ethnic group. Overall, Asian and Hispanic respondents reported less discrimination than Whites; on the other hand, African Americans and Black Caribbeans reported more discrimination than Whites. Regardless of race/ethnicity, the younger respondents (aged < 45 years) reported less discrimination than the older respondents (aged >= 45 years). In terms of age by race/ethnicity, the results were mixed for 19 out of 45 tests of DIF (40%). No differences in item function were observed among Black Caribbeans. "Being called names or insulted" and others acting as "if they are afraid" of the respondents were the only two items that did not exhibit differential item functioning by age across all racial/ethnic groups. Overall, our findings suggest that the EDS scale should be used with caution in multi-age multi-racial/ethnic samples.

AB  - This article contributes new evidence about the types of immigrants that British nationals would accept as fellow citizens. I analyse the preferences of a large, nationally representative UK sample employing a choice-based conjoint-analysis experiment. Respondents were presented with paired vignettes of applicant types characterized by a combination of attributes chosen randomly. The attributes of immigrants with the largest impact on the probability of granting citizenship were occupation and religion: respondents especially penalized applicants who were Muslim or with no occupation. Respondents granted citizenship at different rates on average (from 64 per cent to 80 per cent): rates were lower among respondents who had voted to leave the EU, were older, less educated, and earned less. The types of immigrant who were most likely to be granted citizenship did not, however, vary by respondents' income, education, or age, and varied little between Brexit Leave and Remain voters. My findings about nationals' citizen preferences reflect the inclusive-exclusive nature of British citizenship and national identity, whereby inclusion is conditional on productivity and on the endorsement of liberal values.

TI  - Sexual Orientation Beliefs and Identity Development: A Person-Centered Analysis among Sexual Minorities
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEX RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - We conducted person-centered analysis of sexual orientation beliefs among sexual minorities to explore potential relationships between these beliefs and sexual orientation, developmental milestones, race and ethnicity, and attitudes about sexual orientation. We recruited participants (N = 416) via Amazon Mechanical Turk who completed measures of beliefs about sexual orientation and attitudes about their own sexuality, as well as assessments of mental health and age of sexual identity development milestones. We conducted a latent profile analysis and found three distinct sexual orientation belief profiles, similar to those previously observed in predominantly straight samples. We found that sexual orientation and race-ethnicity predicted belief profile membership, with the latter exhibiting the most substantial effect. Of the four identity developmental milestones tested, only the age of first same-sex attraction predicted belief profile membership. Across profiles, members differed significantly in their mean endorsement of both positive and negative attitudes regarding sexual orientation and psychological distress. Thus, the current research suggests that sexual orientation beliefs are powerful constructs in the lives of sexual minorities, with relationships to sexual orientation, other social identities, and mental health.

AB  - Socioeconomic status (SES) differences in attitudes towards cancer have been implicated in the differential screening uptake and the timeliness of symptomatic presentation. However, the predominant emphasis of this work has been on cancer fatalism, and many studies focus on specific community subgroups. This study aimed to assess SES differences in positive and negative attitudes towards cancer in UK adults. A population-based sample of UK adults (n=6965, age >= 50 years) completed the Awareness and Beliefs about Cancer scale, including six belief items: three positively framed (e.g. 'Cancer can often be cured') and three negatively framed (e.g. 'A cancer diagnosis is a death sentence'). SES was indexed by education. Analyses controlled for sex, ethnicity, marital status, age, self-rated health, and cancer experience. There were few education-level differences for the positive statements, and overall agreement was high (all >90%). In contrast, there were strong differences for negative statements (all Ps<0.001). Among respondents with lower education levels, 57% agreed that 'treatment is worse than cancer', 27% that cancer is 'a death sentence' and 16% 'would not want to know if I have cancer'. Among those with university education, the respective proportions were 34, 17 and 6%. Differences were not explained by cancer experience or health status. In conclusion, positive statements about cancer outcomes attract near-universal agreement. However, this optimistic perspective coexists alongside widespread fears about survival and treatment, especially among less-educated groups. Health education campaigns targeting socioeconomically disadvantaged groups might benefit from a focus on reducing negative attitudes, which is not necessarily achieved by promoting positive attitudes.

TI  - Leadership Lessons from the Court of St. Fernando: The Treatise of Loyalty and Nobility
T2  - CATHOLIC SOCIAL SCIENCE REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - PERSONALITY
AB  - This article analyzes the leadership of a medieval treatise on leadership written at the request of Saint Fernando III of Castile in the thirteen century. We investigate how the conceptualization of leadership is similar and different from our modern approaches. We find that the medieval leadership source had stronger Catholic ontological and epistemological underpinnings although it remained hostage to prejudices and misconceptions of its time. The analysis raises questions about how modern secular leadership approaches do not clearly disclose their own ontological and epistemological foundations. In addition, the contrast with a medieval leadership source shows our modern leadership approaches also remain captive to the prejudices and misconceptions of our time. Most importantly, modern leadership approaches assume leaders can set final ends, are immune to greed in themselves and others, focus on intelligence rather than will, and technical skill rather than moral virtue. On the other hand, both sources agree leaders should be decisive, sociable, approachable, and create a culture of trust. More research on historical models of leadership is needed.

AB  - Introduction: Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of morbidity and mortality of the mother and child. The inability of the unborn child to protect itself, raises the social and academic responsibility to protect the child from the harmful effects of smoking. Interventions including rewards (incentives) for lifestyle changes are an upcoming trend and can encourage women to quit smoking. However, these incentives can, as we will argue, also have negative consequences, for example the restriction of personal autonomy and encouragement of smoking to become eligible for participation. To prevent these negative consequences, we developed an ethical framework that enables to assess and address unwanted consequences of incentive-based interventions whereby moral permissibility can be evaluated.
   Aims and Methods: The possible adverse consequences of incentives were identified through an extensive literature search. Subsequently, we developed ethical criteria to identify these consequences based on the biomedical ethical principles of Beauchamp and Childress.
   Results: Our framework consists of 12 criteria. These criteria concern (1) effectiveness, (2) support of a healthy lifestyle, (3) motivational for the target population, (4) stimulating unhealthy behavior, (5) negative attitudes, (6) personal autonomy, (7) intrinsic motivation, (8) privacy, (9) fairness, (10) allocation of incentives, (11) cost-effectiveness, and (12) health inequity. Based on these criteria, the moral permissibility of potential interventions can be evaluated.
   Conclusions: Incentives for smoking cessation are a response to the responsibility to protect the unborn child. But these interventions might have possible adverse effects. This ethical framework aims to identify and address ethical pitfalls in order to avoid these adverse effects.
   Implications: Although various interventions to promote smoking cessation during pregnancy exist, many women still smoke during pregnancy. Interventions using incentives for smoking cessation during pregnancy are a promising and upcoming trend but can have unwanted consequences. This ethical framework helps to identify and address ethical pitfalls in order to avoid these adverse effects. It can be a practical tool in the development and evaluation of these interventions and in evaluating the moral permissibility of interventions using incentives for smoking cessation during pregnancy.

AB  - We argue that the motivations that underlie stereotype-based discrimination against racial minorities and other stigmatized groups often fail to meet standard criteria for rational judgments. Stereotyping of such groups is often driven by threats to one's self-esteem and a desire to rationalize inequality, and declines when the perceiver is motivated to be accurate. Also, Bayesian racism-the belief that it is rational to discriminate against individuals based on stereotypes about their racial group-correlates highly with negative feelings toward minorities and the desire to keep low-status groups in their place, and correlates negatively with indices of rational thinking. The motives that drive social judgments call into question whether people engage in stereotype-based discrimination for rational reasons.

AB  - The purpose of the current study was to explore the association between gender and previous acquaintance with social workers (SWs) and between attitudes towards SWs. Attention was given to three categories of role relationships, reflecting respondents' status with regard to SWs: (i) current and former clients of social services departments (SSDs), (ii) activists and volunteers at SSDs and (iii) people who never had any interpersonal interaction with SWs. Data were collected in Israel by means of structured questionnaires among 806 participants aged twenty-one and older. The findings show that women have more positive attitudes towards SWs than men and rank them higher than do men for professionalism and effectiveness. In almost all parameters related to attitudes towards SWs (aside from appreciation), current and former clients of SSDs indicated more negative attitudes than volunteers and activists or than people who never had any interpersonal interaction with SWs. The conclusions were that personal encounters with SWs, as part of the therapist-client relationship, do not necessarily guarantee better attitudes towards them. Additionally, based on the finding that men have more negative attitudes towards SWs than women, it is also important to promote men's awareness and knowledge of the functions of SWs.

AB  - The aims of this paper were to predict membership to a group of attitude of acceptance or ambiguity-rejection toward homosexuality, and describe the attitude levels. The Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay men (ATLG) scale was applied to a non-probability sample of 239 single heterosexual men. All of them were students of health sciences. 15% expressed rejection (including 4% extreme) based on the ATLG total score. Rejection toward gay men (28% including 7% extreme) was higher than toward lesbians (9% including 2.5% extreme). Not having homosexual friends and having adscription to Christian or Catholic religions were significant predictors of belonging to the group with an ambiguity-rejection attitude. It is concluded that the percentage of rejection toward homosexuality is significant. For this reason it is encouraged to implement workshops for promoting an acceptance attitude, and consider these risk variables in their design.

AB  - While the language that majorities use to convey ethnic attitudes to members of their own group has received significant scholarly attention in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands and the USA, the ways in which people of colour actually experience prejudice have been largely ignored. Drawing upon interviews with one young black woman in the south of England, this paper presents findings concerning the patterns of talk and the rhetorical strategies followed to recount experiences of differential treatment. The analysis, inspired by a critical discursive approach, points to the negative construction of the majority group and identifies a number of recurring devices used to bolster the facticity of the accounts. These include the presentation and quoting of self and others, the explicit invocation of category entitlements and the use of extreme case formulations, particularly in anticipation of non-sympathetic hearings. Given the prohibitions on making accusations of racism, the paper culminates with a discussion on factuality which this research attributes to the presence of the white interviewer.

AB  - The populations most susceptible to environmental degradation are often the populations that rely most on the natural world for sustenance. Within the many isolated islands that are part of rural Indonesia, many communities are dependent on natural resources for their livelihoods, but paradoxically members of these communities often engage in practices that destroy their natural resources. The current research uses survey methodology to investigate determinants of sustainable behavioral intentions of participants (N = 104) living in coastal communities in Sulawesi, Indonesia specifically through the lens of an adapted theory of planned behavior model. Results showed that participants with stronger intentions to use nets and lines to fish had more negative attitudes to destructive fishing, a greater sense that their behavior and that of their community affects marine life, and greater belief that other villages are responsible for degrading reefs. Participants with stronger intentions to prevent their waste from going into the ocean had more negative attitudes to throwing waste in the ocean, greater perceptions of control over the behavior, and more positive perceptions of change in the health of the reefs. Although some of the findings align with theory and past research, some were unexpected, highlighting the importance of conducting research to identify motivators of sustainable practices in developing world, low resource communities.

AB  - After making a choice between 2 objects, people reevaluate their chosen item more positively and their rejected item more negatively (i.e., they spread the alternatives). Since Brehm's (1956) initial free-choice experiment, psychologists have interpreted the spreading of alternatives as evidence for choice-induced attitude change. It is widely assumed to occur because choosing creates cognitive dissonance, which is then reduced through rationalization. In this article, we express concern with this interpretation, noting that the free-choice paradigm (FCP) will produce spreading, even if people's attitudes remain unchanged. Specifically, if people's ratings/rankings are an imperfect measure of their preferences and their choices are at least partially guided by their preferences, then the FCP will measure spreading, even if people's preferences remain perfectly stable. We show this, first by proving a mathematical theorem that identifies a set of conditions under which the FCP will measure spreading, even absent attitude change. We then experimentally demonstrate that these conditions appear to hold and that the FCP measures a spread of alternatives, even when this spreading cannot have been caused by choice. We discuss how the problem we identify applies to the basic FCP paradigm as well as to all variants that examine moderators and mediators of spreading. The results suggest a reassessment of the free-choice paradigm and, perhaps, the conclusions that have been drawn from it.

AB  - The factor structure of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) remains a contentious issue. Although designed to measure three underlying attitude clusters, aggression, submission and conventionalism, many items are deliberately double-or triple-barrelled, to capture the covariation of the three clusters in a unidimensional scale. Additionally, although the scale is balanced, there is an item wording direction bias in the clusters; aggression items are pro-trait, and conventionalism items are con-trait. Sub-scale structure is therefore potentially confounded with acquiescence bias. Although RWA as a unitary construct has been an effective tool for exploring prejudice, it would be useful in many cases to measure its underlying components directly. Proposed solutions to this problem include creating short-form scales as subsets of the original scale, or modifying items to simplify and un-confound the structure. We present convergent evidence of an underlying factor structure by considering one-, two-and three-factor solutions to the uncorrected scale and then using an indirect method to correct for acquiescence bias. Before and after correction, factor analysis supported a three-factor solution. Confirmatory factor analyses also support a three-factor solution compared to a one-factor solution.

AB  - The current paper connects anxiety about disease contamination to that about cultural contamination and the exclusionary behavior toward ethnic outgroups that it incites. We suggest that when individuals are exposed to disease fears, an epistemic groundwork is laid for construing outgroups as sources of contamination. We begin with a pilot experiment showing that contagious disease anxiety primes opposition to legalization of illegal aliens. We then analyze historical data about the diffusion of rumor-based ethnic violence, showing that Indian regiments of the East India Company were more likely to mutiny against their British officers if they had been exposed some months earlier to a cholera discourse. (These mutinies were proximally caused by acceptance of a rumor that the Company administration had violated a cultural taboo.) We discuss implications for studying the cognitive antecedents of the diffusion of beliefs and practices in organizations and in cultures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: The study investigates the effects of attitudes displayed by patients with epilepsy toward their disease on their mental health and quality of life.
   Materials and Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in the neurology outpatient clinic at Hafsa Sultan Hospital, Manisa Celal Bayar University between April 2015 and April 2016. The study sample comprised 182 patients. The study data were collected using the Personal Information Form for Patients with Epilepsy, Impact of Epilepsy Scale, Epilepsy Knowledge Scale, Epilepsy Attitude Scale, Short Form-36 (Quality of Life Scale), and Brief Symptom Inventory. In the analysis of the data, the t-test, ANOVA, Scheffe's post-hoc test, and Pearson's correlation coefficient were used.
   Results: In the Epilepsy Attitude Scale, the participants obtained a mean score of 48.66 +/- 13.13, suggesting that they displayed negative attitudes toward epilepsy. In the subscales of the Short Form-36 (Quality of Life Scale), the participants' scores were low. Of the participants with epilepsy, those with a significantly positive attitude toward epilepsy had a high quality of life perception. Psychological symptoms decreased in patients with epilepsy who have a positive attitude toward their disease.
   Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrated that the participants' "attitudes toward epilepsy" was significantly correlated to their "psychological symptoms and quality of life. The fact that the negative attitudes of patients with epilepsy are related to their psychological symptoms and quality of life indicates the importance of recognizing and understanding patients' attitudes toward their disease.

AB  - Few studies using psychographic segmentation have been conducted; even fewer in minority samples. Study aims were to identify psychographic clusters and their relation to tobacco and alcohol use within a predominantly Hispanic (87%) young adult (ages 18-25) sample. Participants (N = 754; 72.5% female; M-age = 20.7[2.2]) completed the following measures online: sociodemographics, tobacco use history, the Daily Drinking Questionnaire (Collins, Parks, & Marlatt, 1985), a social activities scale, a psychographic survey, a music preference item, the Brief Sensation Seeking Scale (Hoyle, Stephenson, Palmgreen, Lorch, & Donohew, 2002), and the Mini International Personality Item Pool (Donnellan, Oswald, Baird, & Lucas, 2006). Two step cluster analysis identified two groups. 'Popular Extroverts' (493% of sample) reported higher: extroversion scores F(1, 652) = 40.03, sensation seeking scores F(1, 652) = 20.38, alcohol use (greater number of drinks per week [F(1, 652) = 9.69]; and past month binge drinking [chi(2) (1) = 12.80]), and lifetime tobacco use (chi(2) [1] = 10.61) (all ps <= 0.002). 'Mainstream/Conventionals' (50.7% of sample) reported greater intentions to smoke in the next month F(1, 284) = 11.81, p = 0.001. 'Popular Extroverts' may benefit from prevention/cessation messaging promoting peer support and intensity-oriented activities. For 'Mainstream/Conventionals,' messaging communicating negative attitudes toward smoking and the tobacco industry may be effective. Future directions include testing targeted messages which may be incorporated into mass media tobacco and alcohol interventions for young adults on the U.S./Mexico border.

AB  - Background: Research among people who inject drugs (PWIDs) in the USA and Mexico has identified a range of adverse health impacts associated with policing of PWIDs. We employed a mixed methods design to investigate how PWIDs from San Diego and Mexico experienced policing in Tijuana, and how these interactions affect PWIDs behavior, stratifying by country of origin.
   Methods: In 2012-2014,575 PWIDs in San Diego, 102 of whom had used drugs in Mexico in the past six months, were enrolled in the STAHR-II study, with qualitative interviews conducted with a subsample of 20 who had recently injected drugs in Mexico. During this period, 735 PWIDs in Tijuana were also enrolled in the El Cuete-IV study, with qualitative interviews conducted with a subsample of 20 recently stopped by police. We calculated descriptive statistics for quantitative variables and conducted thematic analysis of qualitative transcripts. Integration of these data involved comparing frequencies across cohorts and using qualitative themes to explain and explore findings.
   Results: Sixty-one percent of San Diego-based participants had been recently stopped by law enforcement officers (LEOs) in Mexico; 53% reported it was somewhat or very likely that they would be arrested while in Mexico because they look like a drug user. Ninety percent of Tijuana-based participants had been recently stopped by LEOs; 84% reported it was somewhat or very likely they could get arrested because they look like a drug user. Participants in both cohorts described bribery and targeting by LEOs in Mexico. However, most San Diego-based participants described compliance with bribery as a safeguard against arrest and detention, with mistreatment being rare. Tijuana-based participants described being routinely targeted by LEOs, were frequently detained, and reported instances of sexual and physical violence. Tijuana-based participants described modifying how, where, and with whom they injected drugs in response; and experienced feelings of stress, anxiety, and powerlessness. This was less common among San Diego based participants, who mostly attempted to avoid contact with LEOs in Mexico while engaging in risky injection behavior.
   Conclusion: Experiences of discrimination and stigma were reported by a larger proportion of PWIDs living in Mexico, suggesting that they may be subject to greater health harms related to policing practices compared with those residing in the USA. Our findings reinforce the importance of efforts to curb abuse and align policing practices with public health goals in both the US and Mexico. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Students' attitudes towards native English speaking teachers (NESTs) and local English teachers has been a fertile area of research for many years, but the commonly used surveys focusing on students' explicit attitudes have been criticised because of the influence of prejudice. An alternative is to use social psychology instruments such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT) to investigate both explicit and implicit attitudes as in Watson Todd and Pojanapunya (2009. "Implicit Attitudes Towards Native and Non-native Speaker Teachers." System 37: 23-33. doi:10.1016/j.system.2008.08.002). This article is a direct replication of Watson Todd and Pojanapunya (2009), but, because the sociolinguistic context in Thailand has changed with greater use of English as a lingua franca (ELF) since the original study, we aim to look for differences between the findings of the original study and those of the current study rather than confirm the original, a process we term elaborative replication. Using an IAT with 439 Thai university students, the results show that, in contrast to our expectations, students' implicit and explicit attitudes towards NESTs have become more positive in the ten years since the original study, a finding that casts doubt on the wider social impact of the ELF movement.

AB  - The Maudsley Hospital, reopened in January 1923, became the centre of British psychiatric research and achieved a world-wide reputation. At a time when women were rare in psychiatry, New Zealand-born Mary Barkas was the only woman (and psychoanalyst) among the first four psychiatrists appointed. This paper looks at her role in the early years at the Maudsley. The letters she wrote to her father, often on a daily basis, provide a unique insight to the earliest years of the hospital that was to have such an influence on British psychiatry. It is the only insider record we have of this crucial time. Barkas demonstrated her versatility in psychiatry and child psychiatry. She used psychoanalysis to treat her patients, receiving recognition from her colleagues. Her work in this field proved to be an exception as analysis was not practiced after she left the Maudsley. Her problem was the institutionalised prejudice against women in psychiatry, which caused her to leave. Her career was terminated at an early stage and her life took a puzzling turn after she returned to New Zealand in 1933. We can remember Mary Barkas as a forgotten psychiatric pioneer whose life and work deserves to be more widely known and recognised.

AB  - Although dehumanization research first emerged following the overt and conscious denials of humanity present during war and genocide, modern dehumanization research largely examines more subtle and implicit forms of dehumanization in more everyday settings. We argue for the need to reorient the research agenda toward understanding when and why individuals blatantly dehumanize others. We review recent research in a range of contexts suggesting that blatant dehumanization is surprisingly prevalent and potent, uniquely predicting aggressive intergroup attitudes and behavior beyond subtle forms of dehumanization and outgroup dislike, and promoting vicious cycles of conflict.

AB  - The media and scientific literature are increasingly reporting an escalation of large carnivore attacks on humans in North America and Europe. Although rare compared to human fatalities by other wildlife, the media often overplay large carnivore attacks on humans, causing increased fear and negative attitudes towards coexisting with and conserving these species. Although large carnivore populations are generally increasing in developed countries, increased numbers are not solely responsible for the observed rise in the number of attacks by large carnivores. Here we show that an increasing number of people are involved in outdoor activities and, when doing so, some people engage in risk-enhancing behaviour that can increase the probability of a risky encounter and a potential attack. About half of the well-documented reported attacks have involved risk-enhancing human behaviours, the most common of which is leaving children unattended. Our study provides unique insight into the causes, and as a result the prevention, of large carnivore attacks on people. Prevention and information that can encourage appropriate human behaviour when sharing the landscape with large carnivores are of paramount importance to reduce both potentially fatal human-carnivore encounters and their consequences to large carnivores.

AB  - Objective.
   The goals of the present studies were 1) to determine the psychometric utility and norms of the Profile of Chronic Pain: Screen (PCP: S) in young adults (ages 17-24) with self-reported pain and 2) to compare non-, mildly-, and clinically-depressed young adults with chronic pain in their patterns of pain attitudes and pain beliefs as assessed by the Profile of Chronic Pain: Extended Assessment (PCP: EA) battery.
   Methods.
   Participants in the first study included 2,475 male and female college students drawn from undergraduate introductory psychology classes in a large western (U.S.) university. Study 2 participants were 275 male and female introductory psychology students, screened for chronic pain and depression from a cohort of 1,266 students.
   Results.
   Study 1 results confirmed the utility of the PCP: S as a screening tool for pain problems in young adults. Study 2 revealed that, although not differing in pain severity, clinically depressed participants differed from their nondepressed and mildly depressed peers in terms of enhanced catastrophizing tendencies and greater perceived disability. Both depressed groups scored lower on control beliefs than the nondepressed group. Moreover, the clinically depressed students reported the highest scores on pain-induced fear, differing from both the mildly depressed and the nondepressed. Finally, the three groups did not differ in their belief in a medical cure.
   Conclusions.
   Results suggest that depressed young persons with chronic pain demonstrate a pattern of negative attitudes and beliefs that could compromise their ability to flexibly adjust to changing life circumstances.

AB  - ObjectiveIn 2013, the Philippines was struck by typhoon Haiyan, which damaged local hospitals and disrupted health care. The Belgian First Aid and Support Team erected a field hospital and water purification unit in Palo. This study aims to describe the diagnoses encountered and treatment provided.MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, medical records of 1267 field hospital patients were reviewed for gender, age, complaints, diagnoses, and management and referral information.ResultsAlmost 28% of the patients suffered from injury, but most presented with nonsurgical diseases (64%), particularly of respiratory (31%), dermatological (11%), and digestive (8%) origin. Only 53% presented with disaster-related pathology, and 59% showed signs of infection. Patients needed wound care (47%), pain relief (33%), or antibiotics (29%); 9% needed procedures, 8% needed fluid therapy, and 5% needed psychological support. Children under 5 years of age were more at risk for infections (OR, 18.8; CI, 10.6-33.3) and injuries (OR, 10.3; CI, 6.3-16.8). Males were more prone to injuries than females (OR, 2.1; CI, 1.6-2.6).ConclusionsOne week after the acute phase of a typhoon, respiratory, dermatological, and digestive problems emerge to the prejudice of trauma. Only 53% of patients presented with disaster-related conditions. Young children are more at risk for injury and infectious diseases. These trends should be anticipated when composing Emergency Medical Teams and medical resources to be sent to disaster sites. (Disaster Med Public Health Preparedness. 2019;13:265-278)

AB  - This article presents three classroom demonstrations designed to help instructors who would like to include some political psychology in their classes. All three demonstrations involve student participation and give the students direct experience with psychological processes relevant to political science. Specifically, I describe how I present the Stroop task, a priming task, and Tversky and Kahneman's Asian disease experiment in my own teaching. For each of the demonstrations, I give practical advice for classroom use, a short description of the psychological processes the demonstration illustrates, and a brief discussion of how those processes have been applied in political science.

AB  - We studied the acculturation processes of Syrian refugees in the Netherlands, based on semi-structured in-depth interviews. The study aims to investigate how Syrian refugees perceive the cultural distance caused by the differences and boundaries between Syrian and Dutch culture; how they cope with the boundaries and prejudice that they perceive; and which acculturation orientations they prefer. The research builds mainly on the framework of Berry's acculturation model. Religion emerges as a prominent issue in the acculturation process and is found to impact acculturation as it is perceived to be a cause of cultural distance, a salient social identity, a bright boundary and a source of prejudice in the host country. Our findings suggest that refugees' religious identity strongly influences their coping strategies and preferred acculturation orientations. Refugees with low/no religious affiliation were more in favour of an assimilation orientation whereas refugees with strong religious identity preferred an integration orientation.

AB  - Introduction This study examined how health warning labels (HWL) on a waterpipe venue menu captured and held the attention of consumers and influenced waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS) attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Aims and Methods A randomized experiment (N = 96) of young adult waterpipe smokers was conducted in an immersive virtual reality laboratory. Participants viewed one of two virtual reality scenarios, a menu with an HWL and nicotine concentration or menu without an HWL and nicotine concentration. Eye-tracking metrics were collected, and participants completed posttest questionnaires on demographics, tobacco use history, and WTS attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. T-tests were used to assess group differences, and a mediation analysis conducted to examine the relationship between the HWL and intention to quit WTS. Results Participants in the HWL group demonstrated greater visual attention to the warning and nicotine areas and less visual attention to the flavor and ingredients areas of the menu compared to the control group. The HWL group demonstrated greater negative attitudes toward WTS (p = .002), greater perceived risk of decreased lung function (p = .026), and greater intention to quit WTS (p = 0.003). The mediation model indicated the relationship between the HWL on a menu and intention to quit WTS was mediated by an increase in negative attitudes toward WTS. Conclusions The HWLs on a menu captured and held the attention of consumers and increased negative attitudes, perceptions of health risk, and intention to quit WTS indicating potential benefit of including a warning label or nicotine concentration on menus to correct misperceptions of WTS. Implications The study contributes to the broader literature on communicating the harms and risks of WTS. The findings suggest that HWL and nicotine concentration on waterpipe venue menus attract attention from consumers in environments comparable to the real world and the strategy warrants further exploration as a targeted policy intervention to educate the public and reduce the health burden of WTS.

AB  - Wildlife conservation is a key issue for the sustainable development of nature. Understanding consumers' true attitudes toward wildlife products would contribute to the promotion of wildlife conservation. Yet, the inner thoughts of consumers toward wildlife products are difficult to acquire, particularly under the circumstance that some wildlife trades are illegal. Most available researches have used self-report questionnaires to measure consumers' explicit attitudes that are usually biased by social desirability. Different from previous approach, the current study tend to use implicit association test, a well accepted measurement, to detect implicit attitudes that are impacted by automatically activated evaluation without performers' awareness. Our results indicated that participants may explicitly expressed negative attitudes towards wildlife products, but implicitly be in favor of them. Besides, participants hold stronger negative attitudes towards the consumption of hedonic wildlife products than utilitarian wildlife products. The inconsistency in attitudes we identified shows the importance of introducing implicit approaches to avoid evasive responses, and to accurately understand participants' attitudes toward wildlife products. It is a convincing preliminary experimental evidence for designing effective interventions. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Health information seeking is critical to medical decision-making and optimal health. Although researchers have begun to explore how people with disabilities search for health information, no studies have investigated health information seeking by women with physical disabilities.
   Objective: The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the health information seeking experiences of women with physical disabilities.
   Method: We conducted a series of semi-structured, online focus group meetings with 21 women with disabilities. Sessions were recorded and transcribed, and data were analyzed using conventional content analysis.
   Results: Two broad themes emerged: 1) pathways to information on general health; sexual and reproductive health; as well as bowel, bladder, and other pelvic health issues; and 2) perceived facilitators and barriers to obtaining health information. Information pathways differed by the type of information sought. Internet was a commonly used resource, with a high value placed on social media interaction among peers. Self-advocacy emerged as a prominent facilitator of health information seeking. Barriers identified were lack of disability-related education, limited accessibility, and providers' negative attitudes.
   Conclusion: This is the first known in-depth qualitative exploration of health information seeking by women with disabilities. Study findings revealed pathways to information commonly used by women with disabilities. The study also identified notable gaps and challenges to health information seeking including the need for improved provider education and training. Findings highlight the importance of the availability and accessibility of high quality, health-related information essential for the health and well-being of women with disabilities.

AB  - Objective. A few studies with a qualitative design have addressed physical activity (PA) maintenance in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but none of them focused specifically on maintenance of PA according to public health recommendations. The purpose of this study was to describe perceptions of PA maintenance during the second year of an outsourced 2-year support program among people with RA.
   Methods. For this descriptive design with a qualitative inductive approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 18 participants with RA (3 men and 15 women). Variation in age, disease duration, activity limitation, pain, levels of PA, and PA maintenance was targeted through strategic sampling. Qualitative content analysis was used, and a pattern of theme, subthemes, and categories was constructed based on the participants' perceptions of PA maintenance.
   Results. A main overarching theme, "A necessary investment in future health"-with 3 subthemes of dedication, awareness, and affinity-was identified as participants' perceptions of PA maintenance. Eight categories further described are a changed mindset, habits, commitments, monitoring, insights in PA, health gains, social support, and PA context.
   Conclusions. PA according to public health recommendations was perceived as a true investment in future health and wellness requiring dedication, awareness, and affinity. To promote PA maintenance, physical therapists working with people with chronic conditions should consider strengthening these prerequisites by targeting patients' negative attitudes to PA, supporting their creation of PA habits to incorporate in daily routines, introducing monitoring of PA intensity, supporting development of PA self-regulation skills, and providing suitable gym facilities with the possibility of peer support.

AB  - This study is to discover the current situation of the professional ethics education of engineers in Taiwan's construction industry and also to discover which types of ethical education experiences can really shape suitable ethical attitudes and behaviours for construction practitioners. These engineers can be categorized into three types according to their ethical education experiences. This study included 526 civil engineers, and it showed that only 13% of the engineers studied ethics at school. Factor analysis and reliability analysis were employed in this study to explore the factors of ethical beliefs, perceptions and behaviour of construction industry engineers. According to the three t-tests on the three types of engineers with different ethical education experiences and those without any ethical education experiences, it was found that ethical education experiences from on-the-job training and the strict regulations of organizations have a significantly more positive effect on ethical attitude development. It was also found that civil engineers' ethical behaviour is subject to the influences of their ethical beliefs and ethical perceptions, particularly their ethical perceptions of interpersonal relationships. Therefore, it is suggested that construction organizations and employers should emphasize teamwork and respect between employees so as to achieve more effective results in boosting engineers' ethical behaviour.

TI  - THE GAY PERJURY TRAP
T2  - DUKE LAW JOURNAL

KW  - INFORMATION
KW  - DISCRIMINATION
KW  - EQUALITY
KW  - MEN
AB  - In Bostock v. Clayton County, the Supreme Court held Title VII's prohibition on sex-based employment discrimination applies to discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Although the opinion is an important victory, if history is any guide, Bostock was only one battle in a larger war against invidious workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Prejudiced employers and managers will seek alternative, less obvious ways to discriminate. Judges and civil rights lawyers must prepare themselves to recognize and reject pretextual rationales for adverse actions taken against lesbian, gay, and bisexual employees. A better understanding of history can inform those efforts.
   This Article examines an unexplored chapter in the United States' history of anti-gay discrimination in the workplace: punishing gay workers for concealing their sexual orientation. Beginning in the 1960s, as federal and state law implemented procedural protections for public-sector workers, employers developed a new mechanism to evade those protections: the gay perjury trap. At its core, the strategy is simple. An employer asks job applicants about their sexual orientation. If they reveal that they are gay, decline to hire them. If gay workers conceal their sexual orientation and it is later discovered, terminate them for their dishonesty. Either way, gay workers are purged from the workforce.
   This Article provides historical examples of the federal government and local school districts using this strategy to terminate high-performing workers who were later discovered to be gay. After discussing the inherent unfairness of the gay perjury trap, this Article explains how prejudiced employers may attempt to deploy this strategy as a means of circumventing Title VII liability in the post-Bostock era. Finally, this Article discusses how courts should prevent employers from using the gay perjury trap in the post-Bostock work environment. Dismantling the gay perjury trap entails three components. First, courts should interpret Title VII as prohibiting employers from inquiring about an applicant's or employee's sexual orientation. Second, courts should not afford employers a general right to penalize gay workers for concealing or misrepresenting their sexual orientation. Third, courts should construe Title VII to protect employees who refuse to answer questions about their sexual orientation.
   Whether Title VII can effectively deter and remedy anti-gay discrimination will in significant part depend on courts' ability to recognize and prohibit employers from using the gay perjury trap. The post-Bostock Title VII cannot succeed if employers can use alleged dishonesty about sexual orientation as a means of punishing gay workers and avoiding liability.

AB  - Introduction Approximately 44% of patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) experience some form of shock anxiety, associated with cardiac fear, physical inactivity, and increased morbidity and mortality. The Florida Shock Anxiety Scale (FSAS) was created to measure ICD-specific fears for a more precise target of patient psychologic distress and potential need for intervention. The current paper describes results from a focused literature review of studies using FSAS over the past 15 years, with the aim of summarizing its current reliability and validity, associated outcomes, and potential future directions for its clinical and research implementation. Methods In this review, 26 peer-reviewed articles were analyzed and selected from an in-depth literature search of two electronic databases. Results The reliability and validity of FSAS has been upheld since its initial validation and remain positive. The majority of studies used FSAS as an assessment tool to evaluate a clinical need for psychologic support or psychoeducation. The most frequently reported predictors of FSAS shock anxiety include experience of shock, appropriate and inappropriate, and number of shocks experienced. Common correlates of higher FSAS scores include lower device-related knowledge, lower perceived support from healthcare providers, greater posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, and negative attitudes about device dependency. Younger age and female gender are also associated with increased shock anxiety. Conclusions Since 2006, FSAS has been widely represented as a valid and reliable assessment tool for quantifying device-related anxiety in ICD recipients in diverse populations. Future directions for FSAS should explore its potential role in support of measurement-based care.

AB  - Introduction: Negative attitudes exist in practice towards those with a diagnosis of personality disorder. Preregistration training offers the opportunity to address this by developing understanding of the diagnosis, confidence in working with people with the diagnosis and empowering new nurses to challenge prevailing attitudes. Attempts to integrate and evaluate specific educational interventions of this nature into preregistration nurse education have not been explored elsewhere.
   Aim: To explore preregistration, nurses' experience of a programme of training focused on personality disorder and their perception of its influence on attitudes, understanding of clients and their experience of practice.
   Method: A qualitative study using thematic analysis of two focus groups of preregistration mental health nursing students.
   Results: Evidence of positive attitudes and confidence to supportively challenge negative attitudes in practice were found. Students showed a shift away from a focus on changing the perceived "difficult" behaviour of a client towards an understanding of their own emotional responses to the behaviours.
   Discussion: The Knowledge and Understanding Framework training shows potential for students to change attitudes and develop progressive practice working with people with personality disorder.
   Implications for practice: The integration of the Knowledge and Understanding Framework should be considered as part of preregistration training. Further research into the sustained influence of the training post registration is required.

AB  - How do non-Han populations in China navigate the paradoxical expectations to become "proper" Chinese citizens, like the majority Han, while retaining pride in cultural practices and traditions that mark their differences? This article examines how Mosuo (otherwise known as Na) people in Southwest China have constructed the moral legitimacy of their ethnic traditions and identity through redirecting the Orientalizing gaze toward their Yi neighbors, another ethnic minority in the region. This argument, which displaces the analytical focus from the majority Han and the political state in analyses of the maintenance of ethnic boundaries, delineates how prejudice against a third-party ethnic other can serve as an important pathway for establishing cultural citizenship in the People's Republic of China. The article ends with a discussion of the methodological significance of this lens for understanding interethnic relationships, while recognizing the challenges of examining ethnic prejudice as a site for negotiating identity and citizenship.

AB  - Controversial wildlife conservation and management, such as that involving gray wolves (Canis lupus), can be symbolic of broader social conflicts. We conducted an online survey (N = 420) to determine factors shaping public attitudes toward wolf management among residents of Washington state, United States. We used 12 Likert-type statements to form a single latent construct that represented attitudes toward wolf management in a multi-use landscape and fit a simple structural equation model to identify demographic predictor variables. The strongest predictors were that voters self-identifying as Democrats were more likely to hold positive attitudes toward wolves and management to conserve them than those identifying with other political parties (standardized latent variable coefficient = 0.585) and women were more likely than men to hold negative attitudes (-0.459). Older respondents were also more likely to hold negative attitudes (-0.015) and respondents who tried to stay informed about wolf issues were more likely to hold positive attitudes (0.172). Perceived links between wildlife management issues and political ideology may exacerbate community disagreements, hindering coexistence between rural livelihoods and wolves. We recommend appropriate framing and messengers to account for this linkage and improve communication of policy and promote science-based decision-making.

TI  - Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices relating to Leprosy among Public Health Care Providers in Colombo, Sri Lanka
T2  - LEPROSY REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - Introduction: Leprosy remains a serious public health problem due to its ability to cause disability. The prevention of leprosy ultimately lies in the early diagnosis and treatment of the individuals having leprosy, thereby preventing further transmission. In Sri Lanka, 46% of new cases identified in year 2013, were late presentations and this caused to 7-8% patients to present with deformities. It has been observed that lack of awareness among health staff has contributed to this late diagnosis.
   Objective: To describe knowledge, attitudes and practices towards leprosy amongst public health care workers in Colombo Municipal Council area, Sri Lanka. Material & methods: A descriptive cross sectional survey was carried out in Colombo Municipal Council area by distributing self administered questionnaire among all public healthcare workers (n = 178) from January to February, 2015.
   Results: Hundred and fifty three participants (86%) identified 'hypo pigmented patches', 64 (36%) identified 'skin nodules' and 36 (20%) identified 'thickened nerves' as suspicious sings of leprosy. More than one fifth of participants believed leprosy is easily transmitted by touch. Sixty one (34.3%) health care workers were scared of leprosy and 77 (43.3%) didn't want to reveal to a friend that if a family member gets leprosy. Another 49 (27.5%) didn't want to share materials with a patient. A significant minority (22.5%) believed that patients should be kept apart from others.
   Conclusion: Including leprosy in continuous medical education and refresher training is crucial in early diagnosis of leprosy as certain gap in knowledge was identified. An emphasis needs to be placed on education regarding transmission and low rate of infectivity of leprosy as study revealed certain misconceptions and prejudices still exist even among healthcare workers.

AB  - Rather than being seen as citizens, the children of immigrants are portrayed as a population to be controlled and contained across Europe. In Italy today, debates about cultural authenticity' and renewed nationalism accompany waves of moral panic that depict a country under siege by illegal and unwanted immigrants. Specifically in cities, immigrants and their children are imagined and portrayed as alien and out of place. Drawing on fourteen months of ethnographic research in Turin, Italy, with children of immigrants aged between 16 and 21, De Martini Ugolotti and Moyer illustrate how these youth make use of their bodies through capoeira and parkour practices to contest and reappropriate public spaces, thereby challenging dominant visions about what constitutes the public, how it should be used and by whom. They analyse the body in place' to understand how the children of immigrants navigate unequal spatial relations and challenge dominant regimes of representation, while also attempting to improve their life conditions and reach their personal goals.

AB  - Humans have fundamental needs, and they evaluate social groups based on their stereotypical impact on goals related to those needs. According to affordance management theory, when people perceive members of social groups as a threat to fundamental goals, prejudicial emotions, and discriminatory behaviors emerge. The purpose of the current research was to investigate affordance management theory as an explanation for schizophrenia stigma. Study 1 (N = 149) examined the perceived relation of schizophrenia to fundamental needs and showed that people perceive schizophrenia as a greater threat to the goal of self-protection than goals related to other fundamental needs. Study 2 (N = 312) experimentally manipulated if a fictional target had schizophrenia or physical illnesses and showed that participants perceived the greatest threat to self-protection and child-protection goals in the schizophrenia condition. In Study 3 (N = 149), participants imagined a person with schizophrenia threatening fundamental goals. Ratings of threat, attention, and fear were higher for self-protection and child-protection goals than other fundamental goals. Study 4 (N = 413) experimentally manipulated if an attractive acquaintance had schizophrenia. Participants perceived the person with schizophrenia as an increased threat to self-protection but not affiliation or mate-seeking goals. They also reported increased fear and avoidance in the schizophrenia condition. Overall, the results of the studies supported affordance management theory's predictions about the relation of stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. Affordance management theory may prove useful understanding variations in the stigmatization of mental illness.

AB  - In 2013 approximately 37,000 people were living with HIV in Ecuador (prevalence 0.4%), representing a generalized epidemic where most new infections arise from sexual interactions in the general population. Studies that examine attitudes towards people living with HIV (PLWH), individual risk perception of acquiring HIV amongst Ecuadorians, and the ways in which levels of risk perception may affect risk behaviors are lacking. This qualitative study aimed to fill this gap in the literature by investigating these issues in the rural, coastal community of Manglaralto, Ecuador, which has among the highest incidence of HIV in Ecuador. We conducted interviews with 15 patients at Manglaralto Hospital. Analysis of interview transcripts revealed widespread negative attitudes towards PLWH, prevalent risk behaviors such as multiple sex partners and lack of condom use, and low individual risk-perception of contracting HIV. These findings underscore the need for increased efforts to prevent further growth of the HIV epidemic in Ecuador.

AB  - Although many hospitality organizations strive to handle negative word of mouth (NWOM) online, limited research has attempted to understand the influence of NWOM on potential consumers' buying behaviors in order to suggest the appropriate organizational response strategies to NWOM communication. In an attempt to bridge this gap, the authors identified the roles of consensus in NWOM communication and how organizational responses to NWOM affect the ways in which potential consumers evaluate service organizationsby making attributional judgments and forming attitude. The results show that consensus in online NWOM communication plays a pivotal role in influencing how potential consumers incorporate NWOM into their evaluations about the organization. Additionally, these NWOM consensus effects are contingent on organizational response strategies. Finally, the authors discuss theoretical and practical implications, limitations, and directions for future research.

AB  - Prejudice and stigma about mental illness is still present in society. Patients suffer both from the disease, and from the marginalization behavior exhibited by others towards them and their families. Psychiatric professionals may also become ill and suffer for the same reason. The authors of this international multicenter study have set themselves the question of whether there may be prejudice and/or stigma among psychiatric professionals towards their suffering colleagues, among patients towards nursing staff affected by the same disease and between patients themselves. Using two standardized questionnaires which have been tested, but have not been used before they have studied 207 mental health professionals and 407 patients, of Italian, Belgian, Hungarian and Croatian nationalities. The results show that there are in fact prejudices among Mental Health Professionals about colleagues suffering from mental illness because they responded that such persons cannot treat well patients with their own pathology. However Mental Health Professionals do not demonstrate behaviors which are not frankly marginalizing or stigmatizing towards colleagues suffering from mental illness. On the other hand, among patients the prevailing view was that psychiatric professionals who suffer from mental illness, can better understand the sick, because they are also suffering. This is in analogy with the Jungian theory of the "wounded healer" in the myth of the centaur Chiron. Patients did not demonstate rejection or marginalization behavior towards other sick patients. Finally both the professionals and the patients tend to be cautious in relating to healthy persons and tend not to disclose their suffering for fear of being misjudged or marginalized.

AB  - While some research suggests that ethnic and cultural diversity hinders societal cohesion, other studies show that it promotes intergroup contact opportunities, which, if exploited, help to overcome intergroup prejudice. Recently, however, intergroup contact theory has been criticized for neglecting the wider social context as well as for ignoring potential demobilizing contact effects for minority members. Using two cross-sectional general population surveys (European Social Survey in 22 countries, Swiss MOSAiCH), we address these criticisms by examining whether ethnic majority members' positive contact influences ethnic minority members' support for ingroup rights at the social context level. Applying multilevel path analysis, we show that minority members are more likely to support anti-discrimination laws and immigrant rights when living in social contexts in which majority members have positive intergroup contact experiences. Theoretical and practical implications of our findings are discussed for understanding how minority groups are affected by the climate of the social context they reside in.

KW  - Pragmatism

AB  - Truth as a fundamental ingredient within the flow of discourse and the application of freedom of expression in democratic society has historically received considerable attention from the U.S. Supreme Court. Many of the Court's central precedents regarding First Amendment concerns have been determined by how justices have understood truth and how they have conceptualized the complex relationship truth and falsity share. Despite the attention truth has received, however, the Court has not provided a consistent understanding of its meaning. For these reasons, this article examines how the Supreme Court has conceptualized truth in freedom-of-expression cases, ultimately drawing upon the results of that analysis, as well as pragmatic approaches to philosophy, the so called "pragmatic method" put forth by American philosopher William James, to propose a unifying conceptualization of truth that could be employed to help the Court provide consistency within its precedents regarding the meaning of a concept that has been central to the Court's interpretation of the First Amendment since, in many ways, another pragmatist and friend of James's, Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, substantially addressed truth in his dissent in Abrams v. United States. The article concludes by proposing that the courts conceptualize the nature of truth via three substantially related understandings: that truth is a process, that it is experience-funded, and that it is not absolute and is best approached without prejudice. Each of the three ingredients relates, at least to some extent, with thematic understandings put forth by the Court in previous freedom-of-expression cases, and therefore does not represent a significant departure from justices' traditional approaches to truth. The model, most ideally, does seek, with the help of pragmatic thought and ideas put forth by Justice Holmes, to encourage consistent recognition of certain principles regarding truth as justices go about considering its nature in First Amendment cases.

AB  - This article explores front-line cruise employees' interaction with LGBT passengers. Covert data were gathered with 70 staff, many of whom were from developing countries where attitudes to LGBT people can be less accepting. Encounters are illuminated using Allport's (1954) intergroup contact theory. Interactions between staff and gay passengers were largely positive, helping normalise homosexuality and diminish negative attitudes. Staff interactions were moderated by factors such as prior knowledge of gay people, their previous service experience on gay charters, gender, the influence of working for gratuities and the sense of fun onboard. The gay cruise provides the context that gives rise to moderating conditions, which then facilitate the mediating processes such as reduced intergroup anxiety and increased cultural learning of gay lifestyles. Suggestions for future research between cruise companies and their employees explore how other variables may positively influence staff service-gay customer interactions. Managerial implications are offered for the cruise sector.

AB  - Australia's treatment of asylum seekers continues to polarise public debate. The present study sought to investigate the factors that may influence an individual's endorsement of deterrence-based government policies. Using the integrated threat theory of prejudice, the present study examined the role of perceived threat in shaping Australian voters' political attitudes toward asylum seekers. A total of 255 Australian citizens completed an online questionnaire that assessed their support for aspects of government policy and their perceptions of asylum seekers as a threat. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to examine the combined and unique influences of perceived threat and sociodemographic factors on overall and individual government policy endorsement. Results indicated that various types of threat (realistic, symbolic, and negative stereotypes) were significant predictors of policy support. Practical implications regarding the development of anti-discriminatory strategies and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - This study explored the role of gender, ethnicity, religiosity, and sexual attraction in adolescents' acceptance of same-sex sexuality and gender non-conformity. Using an intersectionality perspective, we also tested whether the effects of gender, ethnicity, and religiosity on adolescents' attitudes would function differently in adolescents with and without same-sex attractions. Data for this study were collected by means of a paper questionnaire completed by 1,518 secondary school students (mean age = 14.56 years, SD = 1.05) in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The sample was 48.1% female and 51.9% male. Approximately one third of adolescents in the sample were of a non-Western ethnic background (32.3%, n = 491) and 7.5% of the participants (n = 114) reported experiencing same-sex attractions. Results of our analyses showed that adolescents in our sample who were male, of non-Western ethnicity, and who were more religious (as indicated by frequency of religious service attendance), were less accepting of same-sex sexuality and gender non-conformity in comparison to female, Western and less religious peers. We also found a significant interaction effect between religiosity and sexual attractions, but only in relation to evaluation of same-sex attracted, gender non-conforming females. The negative effect of religiosity on acceptance of same-sex attracted, gender non-conforming females was stronger among those adolescents who reported same-sex attractions.

AB  - BackgroundUniversity students' knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) toward COVID-19 are vital to prevent the spread of the virus, especially in the context of developing countries. Consequently, the present study aimed to determine the KAP levels of university students and associated anxiety during the earlier stage of the pandemic in Bangladesh. MethodsA cross-sectional, online study with 544 university students was conducted during April 17-May 1, 2020. The questionnaire incorporated several KAP-related test items aligned with the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Anxiety was measured with the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-2). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between KAP levels and anxiety adjusting for sociodemographic variables. Subgroup analyses included rerunning models stratified by gender and quarantine status. ResultsApproximately 50% of students showed high levels of knowledge about COVID-19 guidelines, 59% reported behavioral practices that aligned with COVID-19 guidelines, and 39% had negative attitudes toward COVID-19 guidelines. Attitudes differed by anxiety (chi(2) = 23.55, p < 0.001); specifically, negative attitudes were associated with higher anxiety (OR: 2.40, 95% CI = 1.66-3.46, p < 0.001). Associations were significant for male (OR = 2.36; 95% CI = 1.45-3.84, p < 0.001) and female (OR = 2.45; 95% CI = 1.3-4.34; p < 0.001) students. Stratified analyses found non-quarantined students with negative attitudes had three times the chance of experiencing anxiety (OR = 3.14, 95% CI: 1.98-4.98, p < 0.001). Non-quarantined students with low levels of knowledge had half the chance of developing anxiety (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.31-0.78, p < 0.01). ConclusionBased on these findings, it is recommended that university authorities continue to prioritize proactive and effective measures to develop higher levels of knowledge, more positive attitudes and better behavioral practices regarding COVID-19 for the mental health of their students.

AB  - The present study reports the psychometric properties of the English version of the short form of the Attitudes Toward Homosexuality Scale (ATHS; Falomir-Pichastor & Mugny, 2009). Workers from Amazon's MTurk (TM) (n = 235 for validation, n = 60 for test-retest) completed the short form of the ATHS, translated from French, and the Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay Men Scale (ATLG; Herek, 1998) and responded to a series of demographic questions. In this paper, we present evidence for a single-factor structure of the scale, along with evidence for the validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability of the measure. The data revealed distinct patterns in participants' ATHS scores as a function of their religious affiliation and political conservatism. Finally, positive ATHS scores predicted support for gay rights over and above that predicted by ATLG scores (Herek, 1984). The evidence presented suggests that the ATHS is a psychometrically reliable and valid tool for assessing attitudes toward homosexuality.

AB  - We investigated knowledge and attitudes before and after reading refutation texts augmented by different kinds of persuasive information and how emotions mediated the process of knowledge and attitude change. Undergraduates (N = 424) enrolled in 4 universities from 3 countries read a refutation text on genetically modified foods (GMFs) and were then randomly assigned to receive additional information about advantages of GMFs, disadvantages of GMFs, or both. After studying, students reading about advantages of GMFs had significantly more positive attitudes than students who read about disadvantages. There was also a significant reduction in misconceptions; participants in the positive-oriented text condition showed the largest learning gains, particularly those who held more positive initial attitudes. Epistemic emotions of curiosity, frustration, hope, and enjoyment mediated attitude change while confusion mediated relations between prereading attitudes and postreading knowledge. In addition, the direct relationship between prior attitudes and surprise was moderated by type of text. When reading about both advantages and disadvantages of GMFs, participants reported significantly less surprise when compared with those who read about either advantages or disadvantages of GMFs. To foster conceptual change when learning about complex topics, refutation texts may be paired with persuasive information that is aligned with accurate conceptions.

AB  - Using the stereotype content model and behavior from intergroup affect and stereotypes map model, we examined whether stereotype content directed toward specific disabilities conforms to the high warmth/low competence stereotype associated with "disabled people" or whether individual disabilities, or clusters, would elicit different stereotypes. Participants from the USA rated 12 disabilities on perceived warmth, competence, courage, emotions and behavioral tendencies. All disabilities, except schizophrenia and disability, were rated higher in warmth than competence. Four clusters emerged, varying on relative warmth, competence and courage. Pity was the highest rated emotion, and negative behavioral intentions were generally low. Perceived warmth predicted positive behavioral intentions, but mean ratings suggest actual help might be minimal. Results suggest some uniformity in stereotypes of different disabilities, but some variation in stereotypes indicates the need for targeted interventions to reduce prejudice and discrimination against disabled people.

AB  - The local acceptance of wind energy projects has received significant attention because local opposition is a barrier to implementing a wind energy project. To decrease objections from local residents, previous studies identified factors that evoke negative attitudes. However, little research has focused on the acceptance of people who remain silent. Therefore, the situation in which there is no marked opposition has been regarded as a success for the project. This research focused on the acceptance of people who are not objecting to a wind farm in their backyard and clarifies the implications of the silent situation. One of the principal findings is that while most of the respondents accept the existing local wind farm, they have negative attitudes towards a new wind farm. This result means that the silent situation does not support further wind development. We conclude that the purpose of consensus building needs to be set to encouraging local residents to express their opinions instead of simply aiming for the absence of opposing opinions. Finally, we discuss a council model through a budgetary provision, eliciting opinions from people who remain silent, and adaptable management as the policy implications for sustainable wind development.

TI  - FRONT-END FIDUCIARIES: PRECERTIFICATION DUTIES AND CLASS CONFLICT
T2  - STANFORD LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - ADEQUACY
KW  - SETTLEMENTS
KW  - LITIGATION
AB  - The role and ethical obligations of attorneys in class actions have received no shortage of scholarly attention. Much of this focus has been in the context of class certification hearings and assessment of the merits of settlements. Those inquiries are often ex post, focusing not on what attorneys may do, but on what they have already done. But what duties, if any, are owed by a plaintiff's attorney to potential class members in a class action prior to certification? What is the scope of such a precertification fiduciary duty?
   Such questions have been given short shrift. There has been little scholarly treatment of the contours of an attorney's fiduciary duty outside the strictures of Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Precertification conflicts are far more difficult to address because no Federal Rules-based framework exists for addressing precertification conduct. Unlike postcertification inquiries into conflicts of interest concerning settlements, this inquiry is particularly complicated because there is often inadequate information about likely outcomes when certain litigation strategies are employed by plaintiffs' lawyers. At the precertification stage, without information about how the litigation will run its course, attorneys make decisions that could credibly be defended as in the best interest of the class, or be criticized as in breach of the attorney's fiduciary obligations to those class members.
   In discussing precertification fiduciary duties, this Note offers a specific formulation of the scope of attorneys' precertification fiduciary duties: an attorney breaches his fiduciary duty to class members when he makes a decision that prejudices the substantive legal rights of absent class members without notice and opportunity for objection. When an action potentially prejudices or does prejudice a substantive legal right of absent class members, an attorney should have an opportunity to offer a good faith defense that the course of conduct was undertaken in a good faith belief that it would maximize the class's recovery. That defense, in turn, can be evaluated in terms of whether it is legitimate or pretextual.

AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to confirm the scale of Attitudes toward Cultural Diversity (ADC). The instrument comprises 7 dimensions: positive intentions, negative intentions, positive beliefs, negative beliefs, positive behavior, negative emotions and support capacity. The sample consisted of 508 students of the Faculty of Education at the University of Cordoba. The results of the ADC show that this scale is a reliable and valid scale for measuring attitudes toward cultural diversity. Furthermore, it was shown that future teachers have positive attitudes to cultural diversity and the teacher's training received had a positive influence in reducing negative attitudes.

AB  - Background: Student nurses often have a negative attitude towards older patients due to negative stereotypes, which may explain their reluctance to work in geriatric care.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate a dual effect (direct and indirect via anxiety) of patients' age on student nurses' attitudes towards their patients.
   Design: Quantitative survey study with 2 between-subjects conditions (patient age: young patients vs. older patients; both n's = 52).
   Setting: Two schools for higher vocational education in the Netherlands.
   Participants: 104 student nurses between the ages of 16-30 in the third or fourth year of their nursing education (M-age = 21.58, SD = 2.22; 93 women).
   Results: Attitudes towards older patients were more negative than those towards young patients. Older patients also elicited less anxiety compared to young patients, and anxiety had a weaker relationship with attitudes towards older patients than attitudes towards younger patients. Attitudes towards younger patients, but not towards older patients, were depressed by anxiety.
   Conclusions: Older patients generate more negative attitudes among student nurses, but can also improve attitudes indirectly by lowering intergroup anxiety. Older people may be therefore be especially suitable as a patient group to receive care from young nurses in training, who can mature in their profession without being anxious over making a wrong impression.

AB  - The educated echelons of the Pakistani society as well as the medical fraternity have consistently reported poor knowledge of mental illnesses in past surveys. This poor knowledge further translates into poorer attitudes toward psychiatric patients in Pakistani hospitals. However, a paucity of data on predictors of attitude toward depression among Pakistani medical students, warrants further in depth investigations. This cross-sectional study was conducted in two medical colleges in the province of Punjab, Pakistan from January to July 2017. The data were collected conveniently, using a self-administered questionnaire comprising of five parts: (a) demographics, (b) a dichotomous (yes/no) scale exploring biological, psychosocial and religio-magical beliefs about causation of depression, (c) a dichotomous scale (yes/no) assessing knowledge regarding symptomatology of depression, (d) the revised depression attitude questionnaire, (e) Toronto empathy questionnaire. There were a total of 674 respondents. Students with an A-levels/high school diploma, urban background, and aspiration for a career in psychiatry, high empathy levels and endorsement of typical and atypical symptoms of psychiatry had more positive attitudes towards depression. Negative attitudes toward depression were associated with belief in religio-magical causes and false symptoms of depression. Attitude toward depression among Pakistani medical students are shaped by several modifiable and non-modifiable factors. Modifiable factors including exposure toward mentally ill patients and knowledge of depression can be mitigated by in-depth clerkship training in psychiatry.

AB  - In English-speaking western cultures the punitive attitudes towards law-breakers is well documented. The present study examines the utility of predictors of punitive attitudes with online survey data obtained from a convenience sample of 566 Australian residents. After controlling for demographic variables, the study examines the utility of two theoretical models; the Crime-distrust model and the Racial-animus model, in predicting punitive attitudes. All three factors of the Crime-distrust model significantly predict punitive attitudes. The study extends the current literature through identifying the significance of negative perceptions of Indigenous Australians in predicting punitive attitudes to sentencing. Results suggest that community perception of Indigenous Australians is a significant predictor of punitive attitudes in addition to factors of the Crime-distrust model. Future research using a more representative sample of the Australian population is recommended to increase the confidence with which findings are interpreted.

AB  - I argue that epistemic injustice manifests not only in the content of our concepts, but in the spaces between them. Others have shown that epistemic injustice arises in the form of "testimonial injustice," where an agent is harmed because her credibility is undervalued, and "hermeneutical injustice," where an agent is harmed because some community lacks the conceptual resources that would allow her to render her experience intelligible. I think that epistemic injustice also arises as a result of prejudiced and harmful defects in the inferential architecture of both scientific practice and everyday thinking. Drawing on lessons from the philosophy of science, I argue that the inferential architecture of our epistemic practices can be prejudiced and wrongful, leading to a variety of epistemic injustice that I am calling "inferential injustice." This type of injustice is fully structural; it inheres in our epistemic practices themselves rather than as a direct result of an individual's action. For this reason, cases of inferential injustice are importantly different from extant cases of epistemic injustice and are especially hard to track. We need a better understanding of inferential injustice so that we can avoid and ameliorate cases such as the ones I present here.

AB  - While past research has documented significant relationships between both athletic and Greek system (fraternity and sorority) membership and negative attitudes toward gays and lesbians, such work seems to membership in athletics and the Greek system as causal mechanisms of homophobia. In this way, athletes and Greeks may be easy targets to blame for the homophobia evident on college campuses. However, it may be more productive to attempt to identify underlying constructs that are related to collegiate athletes' and fraternity/sorority members' attitudes to best inform campus LGBT programs. In this study, athletes' and fraternity and sorority members' attitudes toward lesbian, gay, bisexual men and women, and transgender (LGBT) individuals are examined. Further exploration considers how LGBT affiliations (i.e., knowing LGBT individuals, knowing about LGBT programs, and having Gay-Straight Alliances in high school) and religiosity may mediate the relationship between athletic and Greek membership and attitudes toward LGBT individuals. Results show that being a male athlete or being a fraternity member is related to unsupportive attitudes toward LGBT individuals; however, LGBT affiliations and religiosity mediate some of the significant relationships. In contrast, being a female athlete is unrelated to attitudes toward LGBT individuals while being a sorority member is related to attitudes toward LGBT individuals in some models. Campus LGBT program implications for both athletes and Greek system members are provided.

AB  - Small-group pedagogies, such as group research projects, are a common instructional method in undergraduate education. The literature suggests that small-group learning has positive effects on learning outcomes, but some students have negative attitudes toward group work, and student complaints about negative group dynamics, such as free-riding, are common. This study examines the relationship between learning outcomes associated with group research projects, student experiences, and group dynamics, controlling for students' individual characteristics, group composition, task type, and incentive structures. The sample includes data on course records and self-assessment narratives for 240 students who completed a sociology research methods course at a small, private liberal arts institution between 2004 and 2015. Multivariate analyses indicate that students' experiences have indirect effects on individual learning outcomes, and some aspects of group composition, task type, and group dynamics predict students' experiences with group research projects.

AB  - Social exclusion and inclusion from groups, as well as the distribution of resources, are fundamental aspects of social life, and serve as sources of conflicts that bear on issues of fairness and equality, beginning in childhood. For the most part, research on social exclusion and allocation of resources has not focused on the issue of group membership. Yet, social exclusion from groups and the denial of resources reflect societal issues pertaining to social inequality and its counterpoint, fair treatment of others. Social inequality occurs when opportunities and resources are distributed unevenly in society, often through group norms about allocation that reflect socially defined categories of persons. This occurs at multiple levels of societal organization, from experiences of exclusion in childhood such as being left out of a play activity, to being denied access to resources as a member of a group. These situations extend to larger-level experiences in the adult world concerning social exclusion from voting, for example, or participation in educational institutions. Thus, most decisions regarding social exclusion and the denial of resources involve considerations of group identity and group membership, implicitly or explicitly, which contribute to prejudice and bias, even though this has rarely been investigated in developmental science. Current research illustrating the role of group identity and autonomy regarding decision-making about social exclusion and the denial of resources is reviewed from the social reasoning developmental model, a theoretical perspective that integrates social domain theory and developmental social identity theories to investigate how children use moral, conventional, and psychological judgments to evaluate contexts reflecting group identity, group norms, and intergroup dynamics.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study is to determine the level of attitude and perception of Saudi pharmacy students toward working in community pharmacies after graduation and to assess cultural, educational, and job related barriers and limitations that interfere with students and community pharmacy as a favorable workplace.
   Methods: A cross sectional questionnaire, was mailed to a random sample of 600 pharmacy students. It included questions on students' future careers, ideal environment and barriers that might face them in community pharmacy.
   Results: Four hundreds and twelve (412) completed the survey (response rate was 69%). Mean age was 23 years and 51.2% of respondents were female. Our results revealed low responses toward how interested they are to work in community pharmacy. The study response showed that improvement in salary and money incomes (46%) and culture and society issue (45%) are the two main barrier to make the career in community pharmacy more attractive.
   Conclusions: Saudi pharmacy students had a negative attitudes and insufficient knowledge about community pharmacy. Pharmacy school would have an important role to fill the knowledge gap and prepare the student to work in the community pharmacy. In order to successfully "Saudization" the community pharmacy setting, efforts should be made to overcome their perceived barriers. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - A current debate surrounds the issue of whether prejudice-reducing interventions such as intergroup contact may reduce resistance to unequal intergroup relations among disadvantaged groups. Addressing this question, this research investigates how positive contact with members of the advantaged group shapes action strategies to cope with disadvantage. Using survey data from a sample of Latino Americans (N = 112), structural equation modeling revealed that friendship contact with Anglo-Whites was overall negatively associated with interest in collective action. This relation was due to both reduced identification with the disadvantaged group and positive attitudes toward the advantaged group, which predicted reduced anger about inequality. Contact was also positively associated with an individual mobility orientation, a relation which was explained through increased perceived permeability. Individual mobility orientation did not, however, predict reduced motivation for collective action. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings for societal change and novel directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Background Globally, the prevalence of obesity has almost tripled in the last 45 years, and almost 2 billion adults are considered overweight or obese. Such individuals have been shown to experience bias and stigma in their everyday life. While some prior research suggests that there has been an increase in weight-based bias over time, there have also been active efforts to counteract weight-based bias over the past decade. The current study uses cohort-sequential growth curve modelling on a nationally representative survey to examine change in weight-based bias over the last decade. The study also investigates whether changes in weight-based bias reflect developmental changes that occur with age, or whether there are cohort-based differences in such bias. The current study also examines whether there are gender differences in weight-based bias over the past decade.
   Methods We used data from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Survey (NZAVS). The NZAVS is an ongoing study that has been conducting an annual longitudinal panel survey of adult New Zealanders since 2009. There were 61,051 participants who responded to at least 1 out of the 11 waves available from the NZAVS. We used a feeling thermometer measure to assess attitudes toward people who are overweight over eleven years.
   Findings We found that weight-based bias has remained relatively stable over the last decade. Small cohort-based differences occurred for women within four younger birth cohorts (those born 1990-1986; 1980-1976; 1975-1971; and 1970-1966) revealing a small increase in warmth towards people who are overweight. Both men and women showed a slight gradual increase in warmth toward people who are overweight, which peaked in middle age.
   Interpretation Weight-based bias appears relatively stable over the past decade. These small changes do not appear to reflect developmental changes as a function of ageing. However, small decreases in weight-based bias among younger birth cohorts of women may reflect shifting societal norms about the acceptability of weight-based bias, although future work is needed to better understand this.

AB  - Background: There are limited empirical data on all matters pertaining to mental illness in the Caribbean but what little there is suggests significant levels of stigmatization exist. In this context, health professionals reveal at least equal to or only slightly improved attitudes to mental illness as compared to the general population. In addition, while there is evidence of improved attitudes among the population at large over the past decade this trend has not been observed among health professionals. This study, therefore, sought to assess medical students' knowledge about and attitudes toward mental illness as they traversed medical school. Methods: Preclinical medical students were surveyed and then retested in their final year of training. Students completed a knowledge scale, and the medical conditions regard scale comparing attitudes to four mental illness and three physical illness. Results: Knowledge about and attitudes toward mental illness showed significant improvement over the 5-year period. However, both preclinical and clinical students revealed significant levels of stigmatization toward mental illness despite improvements in knowledge. Students recognized the need to prioritize treatment for persons with mental illness but did not want to be personally involved in the treatment process. Discussion: Results highlight that significant negative attitudes still exist among medical students toward mental illness and these persist up until graduation. There is a need for further research into innovations and interventions to address this matter.

AB  - The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Tolerance Tendency Enhancement Program (TTEP) which was prepared to enhance tolerance tendency and reduce bullying level of the fifth grade students. Pretest, posttest, follow up test, control and placebo group experimental design has been used in this research. This study was carried out with a sample of 42 fifth grade students (14 for experimental group, 14 for placebo group, and 14 for control group). The data used in this study was obtained through the Tolerance Tendency Scale (TTS) and Peer Bullying Scale (PBS). Wilcoxon Signed Ranks, Kruskal-Wallis H Tests were used to analyze the data. The results of the study showed that there was a significant change between post-tests of the placebo, control and experimental groups in favor of the experimental group. It can be said that the TTEP enhance tolerance tendency and reduce bullying level of the experimental group. Besides, the TTEP applied on the experimental group was understood to have permanent effects on tolerance tendency. Conclusion part of the study, some suggestions and recommendations were provided for the counseling practices and researchers in the light of findings.

AB  - The study of community attitudes toward welfare and welfare recipients is an area of increasing interest. This is not only because negative attitudes can lead to stigmatization and discrimination, but because of the relevance of social attitudes to policy decisions. We quantify the attitudes toward welfare in the Australian population using attitude data from a nationally representative survey (N = 3243). Although there was broad support for the social welfare system, negative attitudes are held toward those who receive welfare benefits. Using canonical correlation analysis we identify multivariate associations between welfare attitudes and respondent demographic characteristics. A primary attitudinal dimension of welfare positivity was found amongst those with higher levels of education, life instability, and personal exposure to the welfare system. Other patterns of negative welfare attitudes appeared to be motivated by beliefs that the respondent's personal circumstances indicate their deservingness. Moreover, a previously unidentified and unconsidered subset of respondents was identified. This group had positive attitudes toward receiving government benefits despite having no recent experience of welfare. They did, however, possess many of the characteristics that frequently lead to welfare receipt. These results provide insights into not only how attitudinal patterns segment across the population, but are of relevance to policy makers considering how to align welfare reform with community attitudes.

AB  - Background: Healthcare workers may affect the utilization of sexual and reproductive healthcare (SRH) services, and quality of care thereof, for example by their behaviours or attitudes they hold. This can become a hindrance to accessing and utilizing SRH services, particularly by young people, and thus a better understanding of these behaviours and associated factors is needed to improve access to and utilization of SRH services.
   Methods: A systematic review of literature was conducted to identify studies focusing on healthcare workers' behaviors and personal determinants associated with providing adequate SRH services in sub-Saharan Africa (January 1990 - October 2015). Five databases were searched until 30th October 2015, using a search strategy that was adapted based on the technical requirements of each specific database. Articles were independently screened for eligibility by two researchers. Of the 125-screened full-text articles, 35 studies met all the inclusion criteria.
   Results: Negative behaviours and attitudes of healthcare workers, as well as other personal determinants, such as poor knowledge and skills of SRH services, and related factors, like availability of essential drugs and equipment are associated with provision of inadequate SRH services. Some healthcare workers still have negative attitudes towards young people using contraceptives and are more likely to limit access to and utilization of SRH by adolescents especially. Knowledge of and implementation of specific SRH components are below optimum levels according to the WHO recommended guidelines.
   Conclusions: Healthcare workers' negative behaviours and attitudes are unlikely to encourage women in general to access and utilize SRH services, but more specifically young women. Knowledge of SRH services, including basic emergency obstetric care (EmOC) is insufficient among healthcare workers in SSA.

AB  - Women with a history of sexual violence may face obstacles to obtaining preventive health services. Group education models have been used in other settings to improve knowledge and uptake of care. Focus groups were conducted to solicit the concerns and input of the subject population. Interdisciplinary group education sessions (GESs) were designed specifically to address concerns voiced in focus groups. GESs were conducted, addressing mammograms, pelvic examinations, and menopause, and emphasized preventive health education, as well as shared decision-making. GESs were audio recorded and qualitative feedback was collected immediately after each GES. Surveys were administered before and after each GES to evaluate attitude and knowledge change. A total of 18 women attended the focus groups, and 27 women attended at least one GES, with 12 women attending both. GESs were well received, and participants cited the education, group support, and healing dynamic as benefits of participation. Content knowledge improved after all three GESs. Attitude change showed a trend toward improvement, but the sample size was not large enough to detect statistical significance. Group education is an acceptable and feasible model among survivors of sexual violence. GESs improved knowledge among this small group of participants. GESs could be made available in a wide range of topics, as requested by our participants. Larger studies are warranted to examine long-term knowledge and attitude change after GESs.

AB  - Objective: Several factors affect the quality of care in the elderly, such as nurses' attitudes. This study aimed to assess nurses' attitude toward elderly in the city of Ilam.
   Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 230 nurses working at public hospitals in the city of Ilam. Participants were selected using simple random sampling from the list of staff. The Kogan's attitude questionnaire was used to measure nurses' attitudes toward the elderly.
   Results: The mean age of respondents in this study was 32.65 (SD = 7.67), and the score of attitudes toward the elderly was 144.96 (SD = 51.75) in average. More than half (54.3%) of the nurses had negative attitudes toward the elderly. The results of ANOVA analysis showed significant differences (P < 0.05) were observed in the attitudes toward the elderly among the nurses as their ages, marital status, work experiences, and ward types differed.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, nurses in this study have marginally negative attitudes toward the elderly. Therefore, promoting nurses' attitudes toward the elderly is important to provide high-quality care. (C) 2017 Chinese Nursing Association. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Outgroup projection is the tendency to generalise among members of different outgroups as if their members were all alike. The present study analysed this almost unexplored phenomenon and tested whether intergroup threat enhances the tendency to generalise the members of a negatively-valued outgroup (i.e., Roma) onto another larger (partially) inclusive outgroup (i.e., Romanians). Evidence showed that Roma are generalised to Romanians to a higher extent under realistic and symbolic threat conditions. Outgroup projection is discussed in relation to the ingroup projection bias and the ingroup overexclusion effect.

AB  - While previous studies unequivocally show that education and attitudes towards immigrants correlate, the underlying mechanisms remain debated. The liberalization effect claims that education fosters egalitarian values and analytic skills, which translate into positive attitudes. Additionally, the higher educated are less likely to face economic competition from immigrants. However, research on socialization shows that political attitudes develop early in life. Thus, there may be self-selection into education. While there is reason to expect both education and selection effects, previous work has relied exclusively on cross-sectional analyses, thus confounding the two mechanisms. Drawing on the Swiss Household Panel, we find that virtually all variation in education disappears when only within-individual variance is modelled. While we find strong differences in attitudes towards immigrants between individuals, we observe little change in attitudes as individuals pass through education. Furthermore, our findings show that when entering the labour market, higher educated individuals also become more likely to oppose immigrants. This suggests that differences between educational groups are mostly due to selection effects, and not to the alleged liberalizing effect of education. We conclude that future research on attitudes towards immigrants would greatly benefit from addressing selection into education.

AB  - Previous studies have identified Japanese negative attitudes towards their English and ambivalent attitudes towards the language (e.g. Jenkins 2007, English as a Lingua Franca: Attitude and identity. Oxford: Oxford University Press; Matsuda 2003, The ownership of English in Japanese secondary schools. World Englishes 22(4). 483-496; McKenzie 2010, The social psychology of English as a global language: Attitudes, awareness and identity in the Japanese context. Dordrecht: Springer). The current research targets Japanese university students and adds several insights into the nature of these attitudes through the analysis of 95 open-ended questionnaires and 18 conversational interviews. First of all, the participants' negative language attitudes embraced notable contradictions. Also, their ambivalence was scarcely evident, and more to the point, a matter of degree. Moreover, it is the doxic experience (Bourdieu 1977, Outline of a theory of practice. Trans. Richard Nice. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) within Japanese society that was likely to hinder grounding those attitudes on their own critical thinking and valuing their English communication ability with non-Japanese. And most importantly, it was easy for them to appreciate English as a Lingua Franca (ELF) perspectives, so long as they would like to use English for international communication. More precisely, while they were unlikely to have any previous attitudes towards the unfamiliar representation of their English (i.e. from ELF perspectives), they were highly likely to develop positive attitudes towards it. This article calls for more future research and effort devoted to raising ELF awareness in Japanese and other similar contexts.

AB  - Aim Breastfeeding is believed to be beneficial to both mother and child. Although the percentage of Polish mothers who start breastfeeding after childbirth is relatively high, most of them finish after 8-12 weeks. Many factors are involved in the decision to stop, including an unfavourable social attitude towards breastfeeding in public. Our cross-sectional web-based study was conducted to identify the factors predicting negative attitudes towards public breastfeeding among Polish women. Subjects and methods A population-based internet-administered public opinion survey was conducted among 663 women aged 19 to 50 years old regarding their attitude towards breastfeeding in public. The participants completed a questionnaire concerning demographic data, general beliefs about breastfeeding and attitudes towards breastfeeding in public. Results Overall, 46.6% of respondents had a negative attitude towards breastfeeding in public. Multivariable logistic regression analysis found that the beliefs that breastfeeding is not a natural activity [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 17.54; 95% CI = 1.44-21.95] and that breastfeeding is not emotionally moving (AOR = 8.73; 95% CI = 3.950-19.30) or not having any opinion (AOR = 2.31; 95% CI: 1.18-4.50) to play the most significant roles in shaping a negative attitude, as well as breastfeeding their own child for < 6 months (AOR = 13.93; 95% CI = 0.14-20.24). Conclusions As women's beliefs about breastfeeding play a key role in choosing to breastfeed in public, there is a need to further explore attitudes regarding this activity.

AB  - Given the long establishment of English as an international lingua franca, the motivation of English learning among the English as foreign language (EFL) learners is still a challenging issue faced by EFL teachers in some contexts. In this study, a survey was conducted with 158 EFL learners in a university in the southern Lao PDR to explore factors that negatively impacted on their motivation to learn English. The results of factor analysis revealed that they reported five dimensions of demotivation in EFL learning, namely, difficulty to achieve linguistic accuracy, negative attitudes toward English, curriculum issues, lack of supports and resources, and foreign language anxiety. The findings of this study offered the directions to cultivate the motivation of EFL learning among the EFL learners in the Lao PDR. In addition, the findings also pointed to the possibility of viewing motivation and demotivation as the two ends of a continuum of L2 motivation; rather than describing these two notions using noncongruent frameworks as currently practiced by both L2 motivation and demotivation researchers.

AB  - Understanding and intervening to address health disparities is part of the expanding role of psychologists (Johnson, 2013). We drew on Hatzenbuehler's (2009) psychological mediation framework and Lick, Durso, and Johnson's (2013) conceptual pathways to lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) physical health disparities to test a serial mediation model in which 2 types of cognitive appraisals (proximal minority stressors and coping self-efficacy) partially account for the association between perceived discrimination and prejudice (distal minority stressor) and self-reported physical health symptoms in a nationally recruited sample of 564 LGB individuals (270 women, 294 men) who participated in a web-based survey. Results indicated that perceived experiences of discrimination and prejudice were associated with expectations of rejection and internalized homonegativity. These 2 proximal stressors were associated with lower coping self-efficacy, and the combined cognitive appraisal pathways were associated with higher levels of self-reported physical symptom severity. The pathway through emotion-focused coping self-efficacy was particularly salient in accounting for the overall mediation. Interventions to address distal and proximal minority stressors and improve emotion-focused coping self-efficacy may be particularly helpful in reducing the negative effects of stigma on physical health.

AB  - BackgroundThere is evidence of negative attitudes among health professionals towards people with mental illness but there is also a knowledge gap on what training must be given to these health professionals during their education. The purpose of this study is to compare the attitudes of students of health sciences: nursing, medical, occupational therapy, and psychology.MethodsA comparative and cross-sectional study in which 927 final-year students from health sciences university programmes were evaluated using the Mental Illness: Clinicians' Attitudes (both MICA-2 and MICA-4) scale. The sample was taken in six universities from Chile and Spain.ResultsWe found consistent results indicating that stigma varies across university programmes. Medical and nursing students showed more negative attitudes than psychology and occupational therapy students in several stigma-related themes: recovery, dangerousness, uncomfortability, disclosure, and discriminatory behaviour.ConclusionsOur study presents a relevant description of the attitudes of each university programme for education against stigma in the formative years. Results show that the biomedical understanding of mental disorders can have negative effects on attitudes, and that education based on the psychosocial model allows a more holistic view of the person over the diagnosis.

AB  - Background: Ambiguity in understanding what professionalism means, and uncertainty in how best to teach it, remains. This study aimed to explore experiences of senior faculty in their endeavor to develop and include professionalism within a curriculum reform (CR), and illuminate challenges encountered.Methods: Using a qualitative case study approach, data were collected from interviews with faculty who were involved in a major CR, plus archived document analysis to provide context, and aid triangulation. Data coding and analysis were inductive, using thematic analysis to generate initial coding scheme; exploring themes in the data.Results: Seventeen interviews were undertaken and approximately 90 documents were reviewed. Analysis revealed: faculty may unintentionally influence, through mixed messages and hidden meanings, the content and processes of professionalism teaching and learning. We identified several intersecting tensions related to the nature of the existing curriculum, staff knowledge, resources, and lack of clear guidance about the what and how to teach professionalism.Conclusion: This study illustrates, hidden messages and contextual factors can enable or inhibit the translation of professionalism into curricula. Those involved in implementing professionalism must be reflective, keep the hidden curriculum in the spotlight to consider how presuppositions and prejudices of their cultural milieu may shape curricular outcomes.

AB  - Intergroup conflicts are a major scourge across the world, leading to death, injury and pain as well as a huge societal and economic impact. One of the leading theories advocated for conflict resolution and prevention is the Contact Hypothesis (Allport, 1954). According to this theory, contact under certain conditions will create a positive intergroup encounter, which in turn, will reduce prejudice and discrimination, and bring about an improvement in intergroup relations. Although the Internet has become an accessible and pivotal medium of communication there are surprisingly few projects that make use of its potential for bridging between groups in conflict. This article explains how the Internet's unique qualities may help overcome the major obstacles inherent in the Contact Hypothesis. In doing so, it differentiates between structured and unstructured online intergroup contact, and provides an analysis of some of the leading online intergroup contact platforms, both past and present. The paper concludes with suggestions for future research in this field. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

KW  - BELIEFS
AB  - Objective. There are no studies that have explored attitudes towards mental illness that are held by rural primary healthcare (PHC) providers. The aim of this study was to conduct evidential and comparative research about attitudes towards mental illness among primary healthcare providers from different mental health service models in China rural communities. Methods. A self-administered questionnaire was conducted with a total of 361 rural primary healthcare providers engaged in mental health service delivery. Results. Total attitude score mark of rural primary healthcare providers shows that most PHC providers still held pessimistic and negative attitude towards mental illness patients. 71.3% of respondents agreed that "the mental patients often impulsively perform destruction of property"; 72.9% agreed that "mental patients are burdens to the families and society." There are also positive correlations between attitudes and abilities of primary healthcare providers to mental illness. Conclusion. This study provides baseline evidence that primary healthcare providers in rural China hold negative attitudes towards mental illness. It is critical to improve negative attitudes and understanding about the importance of the management of severe mental illness among rural primary healthcare workers in mental health services. We should take comprehensive methods to enrich primary healthcare providers' professional knowledge about mental illness and eliminate discrimination and inappropriate perception against the mental illness.

AB  - In spite of efforts to increase gender diversity across many science fields, women continue to encounter beliefs that they lack ability and talent. Undergraduate education is a critical time when peer influence may alter choice of majors and careers for women interested in science. Even in life science courses, in which women outnumber men, gender biases that emerge in peer-to-peer interactions during coursework may detract from women's interest and progress. This is the first study of which we are aware to document that women are outperforming men in both physical and life science undergraduate courses at the same institution, while simultaneously continuing to be perceived as less-able students. This is problematic because undergraduate women may not be able to escape gender-ability stereotypes even when they are outperforming men, which has important implications for 1) the recognition of women's achievements among their peers in undergraduate education and 2) retention of women in STEM disciplines and careers.

AB  - Much of the current psychological literature investigates single category dimensions (i.e., race or social class), with little focus on the intersection of multiple social category dimensions. Yet some evidence suggests that the intersection of race and social class information influences (a) stereotype expression, (b) categorization, (c) impressions, (d) prejudice, and (e) discrimination, revealing common links between Blackness and low social class and Whiteness and high social class in at least the United States. The present article reviews evidence for considering both target race and social class as intersecting social categories that simultaneously influence intergroup processes. This analysis suggests that a more comprehensive understanding of intergroup processes can be achieved when considering the intersection of race and social class information. This review also provides a series of future directions to advance intergroup processes research.

AB  - Racial categorization of faces has a notable impact on human behavior, but its neural underpinnings remain unresolved. Previous electroencephalography (EEG) research focused on contributions of phase-locked neural activities to racial categorization of faces. We investigated functional roles of non-phase-locked neural oscillations in spontaneous racial categorization of faces by recording EEG from Chinese adults who performed an individuation task on Asian/White faces in Experiment 1 and on Asian/Black faces in Experiment 2. We quantified neural processes involved in spontaneous racial categorization of faces by examining repetition suppression of non-phase-locked neural oscillations when participants viewed faces of one race presented repeatedly in the same block of trials (repetition condition), or faces of two races presented alternately in the same block of trials (alternating condition). We found decreased power of alpha (9-13 Hz) oscillations in the repetition than alternating conditions at 80-240 ms over frontal-central electrodes induced by White/Black (but not Asian) faces. Moreover, larger repetition suppression of alpha oscillations in response to White/Black (vs. Asian) faces predicted greater implicit negative attitudes toward White/Black faces across individuals. Our findings suggest that non-phase-locked alpha oscillations are engaged in spontaneous racial categorization of faces and are associated with implicit negative attitudes toward other-race faces.

AB  - Purpose: Youth smoking is a global public health concern. Health educators are increasingly using Internet-based technologies, but the effectiveness of Internet viral marketing in promoting health remains uncertain. This prospective pilot study assessed the efficacy of an online game-based viral marketing campaign in promoting a smoke-free attitude among Chinese adolescents.
   Methods: One hundred and twenty-one Hong Kong Chinese adolescents aged 10 to 24 were invited to participate in an online multiple-choice quiz game competition designed to deliver tobacco-related health information. Participants were encouraged to refer others to join. A zero-inflated negative binomial model was used to explore the factors contributing to the referral process. Latent transition analysis utilising a pre-and post-game survey was used to detect attitudinal changes toward smoking.
   Results: The number of participants increased almost eightfold from 121 to 928 (34.6% current or ex-smokers) during the 22-day campaign. Participants exhibited significant attitudinal change, with 73% holding negative attitudes toward smoking after the campaign compared to 57% before it. The transition probabilities from positive to negative and neutral to negative attitudes were 0.52 and 0.48, respectively. It was also found that attempting every 20 quiz questions was associated with lower perceived smoking decision in future (OR = 0.95, p-value <0.01).
   Conclusions: Our online game-based viral marketing programme was effective in reaching a large number of smoking and non-smoking participants and changing their attitudes toward smoking. It constitutes a promising practical and cost-effective model for engaging young smokers and promulgating smoking-related health information among Chinese adolescents.

AB  - The aim of this research was to identify the factors that influence the attitudes of student nurses towards illicit drugs. This insight is important in providing a foundation for the development of educational approaches aimed at challenging what appear to be negative attitudes to illicit drug users within nursing.
   The absence of a testable hypothesis prior to the investigation led to the generation of theory from the data (inductive enquiry) with a constructivist approach to grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006), being employed.
   Data generation involved informal conversational interviews (n = 12), semi-structured interviews (n = 9), four focus groups and an audit of the education received by students (n = 61) around substance misuse issues. The final grounded theory indicated that:
   Student nurses enter training with a wide range of personal experiences relating to illicit drug use. The influences of society's negative views and the image of drug use presented in the press appeared to be significant factors in developing their attitudes on the subject. In the absence of effective approaches to education, and given that many professionals in the practice environment appear to view illicit substance users in a negative way, it is likely that interventions with identified drug users will be influenced by negative attitudes.

AB  - The forests of the north-east USA were once home to the wolf Canis lupus, a species that played an important role in the ecology of this region. However, wolves were eradicated from the region more than a century ago, altering the species composition of the landscape and driving cascading changes in this ecosystem. Outdoor recreation is a major component of the economy of this region, and outdoor recreationists, including the hunting community, have a strong influence over decision-making related to policies on natural resources. Given their powerful position, hunters are important stakeholders whose views need to be taken into account when designing policies related to wildlife, in particular in relation to a controversial species such as the wolf. In this study, through expert interviews and an online survey, we gained a deeper understanding of the attitudes of hunters towards wolves, and how these attitudes could affect any future reintroduction programme or natural movement of wolves into the state. We found that the majority of hunters hold a suite of negative attitudes towards wolves, their role in the landscape and their potential impact on the region. However, for hunters who were able to recognize the ecological roles of wolves, these negative attitudes were mostly reversed.

AB  - With a sample of Asian international students, the consequences of perceiving pervasive discrimination against one's in-group were examined by experimentally manipulating perceived discrimination (pervasive vs rare) and group identification (low vs high). We report evidence that supports and integrates aspects of two contrasted models; namely, the discounting model and the rejection-identification model. Consistent with both models, the effects of perceiving discrimination on one's psychological well-being depended on the level of group identification. Nevertheless, after reading about pervasive discrimination, low (vs high) identifiers reported less depressed affect, consistent with the discounting model. However, they also reported lower self-esteem, consistent with the rejection-identification model.

AB  - Purpose: Laparoscopy has certainly brought considerable benefits to patients, but laparoscopic surgery requires a set of skills different from open surgery, and learning in the operating room may increase surgical time, and even may be harmful to patients. Several training programs have been developed to decrease these potential prejudices.
   Purposes: to describe the laparoscopic training program for urological residents of the "Hospital das Clinicas" of the Sao Paulo Medical School, to report urological procedures that are feasible in dry and wet labs, and to perform a critical analysis of the cost-benefit relation of advanced laparoscopic skills laboratory.
   Materials and Methods: The laparoscopic skill lab has two virtual simulators, three manual simulators, and four laparoscopic sets for study with a porcine model. The urology residents during their first year attend classes in the virtual and manual simulator and helps the senior urological resident in activities carried out with the laparoscopic sets. During the second year, the urological resident has six periods per week, each period lasting four hours, to perform laparoscopic procedures with a porcine model.
   Results: In a training program of ten weeks, one urological resident performs an average of 120 urological procedures. The most common procedures are total nephrectomy (30%), bladder suture (30%), partial nephrectomy (10%), pyeloplasty (10%), ureteral replacement or transuretero anastomosis (10%), and others like adrenalectomy, prostatectomy, and retroperitoneoscopy. These procedures are much quicker and caused less morbidity.
   Conclusion: Laparoscopic skills laboratory is a good method for achieving technical ability.

AB  - Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has majorly disrupted many aspects of people's lives, provoking psychosocial distress among students. People's positive and negative attitudes towards the past, present and future were a dispositional pre-COVID-19 reality. Faced with a pandemic, people have reported disruptions in the speed of passing time. People can shift their attention more towards the past, present or future when major changes in society occur. These aspects of psychological time would be key to understanding the quality of psychosocial adjustment to the pandemic. We hypothesized that dispositional time attitudes impact psychosocial distress because they would trigger situational changes in our time perception and temporal focus. Methods One hundred and forty-four university students in Uruguay responded to self-report questionnaires online while in-person classes were cancelled. Students reported on shifts in temporal focus, changes in time awareness and dispositional time attitudes. Reactive psychological, social and learning environment distress were reported. Results Students reported substantial changes in time perception and temporal focus. A correlation matrix showed significant relationships between time attitudes, focus and awareness. For example, psychological distress was correlated with negative time attitudes, slower passage of time, boredom, blurred sense of time and shifting focus to the past. Mediation models were derived. The indirect effect of time attitudes on psychological distress was significant through past focus. Discussion Dispositional time attitudes would impact students' capacity to cope with the pandemic. Situational shifts in temporal focus and perception were prevalent and can be viewed as temporal coping mechanisms in the wake of powerful societal change. Our mediation models showed that those with negative time attitudes experienced more psychological distress because they shifted their attention to the past. Future directions for research and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - The present research tests the indirect effects of intergroup contact on adolescents' bystander intervention intentions via four potential mediators: "empathy," "cultural openness," "in-group bias," and "intergroup anxiety." British adolescents (N = 855), aged 11-13 years, completed measures of intergroup (interethnic) contact and the identified indirect variables. Intended bystander behavior was measured by presenting participants with an intergroup (immigrant) name-calling scenario. Participants rated the extent to which they would behave assertively. The findings extend previous intergroup contact research by showing a significant indirect effect of intergroup contact on assertive bystander intentions via empathy, cultural openness and in-group bias (but not via intergroup anxiety). Theoretical implications and practical suggestions for future prejudice-reduction interventions are discussed.

AB  - Purpose The current research presents findings from an innovative online Teachers Professional Development (TPD) program entitled - The Israeli Society is Meeting Online. This study aims to examine to what extent does online contact promote meaningful acquaintance among teachers from different cultures in Israeli society, and how did the online TPD program influence the way teachers perceive their roles in the Israeli education system. Design/methodology/approach This study implemented a qualitative phenomenological approach to learn about the teachers' experiences (through the TPD program. Findings The findings indicate that teachers who live and study in a diverse and divided society can improve intergroup relations using online contact with teachers from other groups. This contact may lead to a significant acquaintance, which, in turn, prepares teachers as agents of change in the field of multicultural education. Originality/value Israeli society is diverse and divided and these divisions are reflected in the educational system, which is characterized by high degrees of prejudice, stereotyping and racism between groups. The findings highlight the educative potential of online contact in a diverse society and the importance of improving intergroup relations between teachers from different cultures prior to their attempts to promote multicultural education.

AB  - A correlational study on Facebook investigated the relationship between virtual intergroup contact and general attitudes toward diverse out-groups. A so-called Facebook application retrieved objective data about the intercultural composition of participants' Facebook networks. The exact percentage of out-group friends correlated significantly with more favorable out-group attitudes. This relationship was mediated by humanitarian-egalitarian values, suggesting that having intercultural friends on Facebook is positively linked to value orientations, which in turn are associated with more favorable intergroup attitudes. In addition, identification with one's own national group and real-life experience abroad did not moderate the results. Overall, although causation cannot be inferred because of the correlational design of our study, results suggest that virtual intergroup contact may positively affect attitudes.

AB  - This paper considers how, in the process of positioning that is implicit in every interaction, all of us employ multiple and often competing narratives when we talk about cultural identity and our relationships with new cultural environments. In interviews with newly arrived postgraduate students about their experience of travelling to study abroad, the students employ competing block and thread narratives. Block narratives represent an essentialist discourse of culture. As such, they are easily converted into cultural prejudice by blocking the possibility for understanding and sharing at the point of tolerating an Other who can never be like us'. These are default narratives because of the way in which we are brought up in our societies within a global positioning and politics. Thread narratives instead support a critical cosmopolitan discourse of cultural travel and shared meanings across structural boundaries that act against cultural prejudice. Threads need to be nurtured as alternative forms of engagement. Therefore, there is a place for the researchers to intervene with their own thread narratives. This intervention is both allowed within and supported by an understanding that researchers join with their participants in the creative intercultural events of the interview.

Studies show that joint storytelling can help reach deeper levels of understanding through exposure to another group's narrative. We hypothesized that engagement in a collaborative digital storytelling task would lead to reductions of negative emotions and attitudes. In our study, dyads of Ethiopian and non-Ethiopian Israelis interacted via a unique digital platform that supports storytelling in a comics-like format aiming to reduce intergroup tension. Their responses to this task were measured before and after the joint activity. Findings showed a decrease in negative emotional states in intergroup contexts (STAI) between pre-and post-intervention for members of both groups, and a slight decrease in negative attitudes toward the out-group. In other words, joint-digital storytelling sessions lead groups in complex relations to be more likely to support engagement. This study has implications for the effect of contact on intergroup tension.

AB  - In this research we demonstrate the powerful role of ingroup favoritism, rather than hostility, in American intergroup biases. Specifically, we take a novel perspective to understanding the relationship between political ideology and discrimination against ethnic-minority Americans by focusing on the role of patriotism. Across three studies, we show that political ideology is a strong predictor of resource allocation biases, and this effect is mediated by American patriotism and not by prejudice or nationalism. Conservatives report greater levels of patriotism than liberals, and patriotism is associated with donating more to American, as opposed to ethnic-minority American, organizations. We further show that the link between patriotism and partiality to the national group is mediated by stronger American=White associations. These findings have important implications for intergroup relations and diversity-related policy issues in the United States.

AB  - Due to perceived non-conformity to conventional constructions of gender, trans people may be subject to overt victimisation (e.g. physical or sexual violence; verbal abuse) and as a result of those experiences (actual or witnessed') may fear future victimisation. While some existing works report levels of transphobic victimisation, there is a dearth of research on perceived risk; and more importantly, exploring group differences in actual victimisation and perceived risk. Drawing on survey responses from 660 trans people, the current study sets out to explore levels of victimisation, perceived risk of victimisation, and group differences (gender identity; stage of transition) in both these phenomena. Findings show that congruent with work on systematic oppression and minority stress, perceived risk of victimisation outstrips actual experiences. Almost no group differences were found on a basis of gender identity. Conversely, those currently undergoing a process (or part of a process) of gender reassignment or transition were significantly more likely to report having been victimised, and to perceive themselves at risk of future victimisation than those at any other stage of transition. That levels of perceived risk outstripped actual experiences of victimisation suggests that, in a culture that privileges cis-gender experiences, isolated experiences of victimisation invoke a heightened sense of fear in members of the wider trans community. These findings suggest that there is a pressing need for dedicated support services for trans people; especially those who are going through a process of transitioning.

AB  - Background HIV Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is being considered for implementation among MSM nationwide in Vietnam. However, there may be concerns about potential obstacles for PrEP adherence among Vietnamese MSM. This study aims to assess the acceptability to use PrEP, potential barriers and facilitators, and the preferences for PrEP service accessibility and delivery among Vietnamese MSM. Methods Four focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with 30 HIV-negative MSM in January 2018 in Hanoi, Vietnam. FGDs explored MSM's awareness regarding PrEP, perceived benefits and barriers of PrEP use, and willingness to use PrEP. FGDs were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Content analysis was used. Results The mean age of participants was 23.9 years old. Most participants realized the advantages of PrEP given its efficacy in HIV risk reduction and expressed high motivation and interest to use PrEP in the future. PrEP was considered as a supplement alongside condoms. Common concerns about PrEP included side-effects, forgetting to take the pill daily, stigmatization due to using PrEP, negative attitudes toward PrEP from other MSM and accessibility of PrEP. Participants would prefer an injectable PrEP regime if available as it was seen as easier to adhere to. Concerns were also raised that PrEP usage could be interpreted as an indication of engaging in sexual risk behavior for HIV, potentially causing suspicion in love relationships or by family and friends. Participants preferred to receive PrEP in civil business organizations and MSM-friendly clinics, and recommended that pharmacy stores would not be suitable for PrEP implementation due to lack of trust and fear of fake drugs. Conclusion This study indicated a high level of willingness to use PrEP among MSM in Vietnam in combination with condom. Strategies to raise awareness of PrEP, reduce stigma towards PrEP, and improve the accessibility among MSM in Vietnam is needed. Existing MSM-friendly clinics were recommended to implement PrEP programs in Vietnam.

AB  - Previous research on sports rivalry has emphasized fans' social identity and the threat posed by rivals. Much of this scholarship is based on intercollegiate sports, where many fans, such as students and alumni, have a formally defined identity with the university. In this study, fans (N = 4,828) across five major professional leagues-Major League Baseball (MLB), Major League Soccer (MLS), National Basketball Association (NBA), National Football League (NFL), and National Hockey League (NHL)-are surveyed to compare their animosity toward rivals based on four variables: schadenfreude, disidentification, prejudice, and relationship discrimination against rivals. The results consistently demonstrate that NFL fans harbor significantly greater animosity toward rivals than their counterparts in other leagues. Apart from the NFL, fans of NHL teams generally exhibit more animosity compared to other leagues, and NBA fans exhibit the least. While fan identification is relatively consistent across leagues, highly identified fans react more adversely to rivals. These differences in rivalry reactions have implications for promotional planning and event security protocol.

KW  - hermeneutics
KW  - interpretive research
AB  - In this article, I explore the intersection between Hans Georg Gadamer's 'fusion of horizons' and interpreter's 'prejudices,' together with the concept of cultural resonances as they pertain to qualitative research in psychology. I define cultural resonances as the researcher's different cultural associations and/or connotations (e.g., myths, legends, popular media references), that emerge in an interpretive encounter with a text. Through a reading of Gadamer's theory, I further explain how cultural resonances are contained within what he referred to as the interpreter's language, prejudice, horizon, and play. Therefore, inspired by Gadamer's assertion that understanding is always a process in which different worlds of knowledge (horizons) fuse together, and with reference to psychoanalytic reverie, Boesch's concepts of cultural psychology, and narrative theory, I discuss cultural resonances as a horizon that inevitably unfolds in qualitative research. Finally, relying on the different topics discussed in the article, I offer a Gadamer-inspired framework for using cultural resonances in qualitative interpretation. The limitations of this framework, as well as its advantages, are discussed, with regard to reflexivity, power, rigor, and cultural sensitivity.

AB  - Youth in residential care often have high rates of emotional and behavioral problems, and a disrupted past with trauma and prior placements. There is a need for the residential youth care (RYC) services to adopt research-informed practices that may improve the outcomes for youth entering. Still, as RYCs can be a challenging setting to implement practice change in, more knowledge on what facilitate effective implementation in residential settings are warranted. More research on implementation in RYCs will enable stakeholders and professionals to adopt appropriate implementation strategies in an upcoming change process in RYCs. Research from other settings emphasize the role of organizational components in implementation. In this study, a qualitative approach was utilized to identify providers' perspectives on organizational facilitators and barriers of implementation in RYCs. The results highlight the importance of providing dedicated time to work with the new intervention, providers perception of organizational resources and support from colleagues. Barriers to implementation include negative attitudes in the staff group, challenging aspects of the structure and procedures in RYCs, and task demands. Finally, the results and their implications are discussed.

AB  - Objective: Pregnant and postpartum women living with HIV face disproportionate risk of depression and suicide, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. This study examined patterns and predictors of suicidal ideation among women living with HIV in antenatal care in Kilimanjaro, Tanzania. Design: We conducted a longitudinal cohort study of 200 pregnant women living with HIV, with surveys conducted during pregnancy and 6 months postpartum. Methods: Pregnant women were recruited during HIV and antenatal care visits at nine clinics. A structured questionnaire was verbally administered in Kiswahili by a trained study nurse. We used simple frequencies andt-tests to measure patterns of suicidal ideation and logistic regression to assess factors associated with suicidal ideation. Results: Suicidal ideation was endorsed by 12.8% of women during pregnancy and decreased significantly to 3.9% by 6 months postpartum. Ideation was not significantly greater among participants newly diagnosed with HIV. In univariable analyses, suicidal ideation was associated with depression, anxiety, HIV stigma, single relationship status, unknown HIV status of the father of the baby, negative attitudes about antiretroviral medication, and low social support. In the multivariable model, women experiencing anxiety and HIV stigma were significantly more likely to endorse suicidal ideation during pregnancy. Conclusion: Suicidal ideation and associated feelings of hopelessness are a critical challenge in antenatal care among women living with HIV, with important implications for quality of life, care engagement, and survival. To better support patients, targeted approaches to address anxiety, depression, stigma, and hopelessness must be prioritized, including crisis support for suicide prevention.

AB  - BackgroundThe Lebanese public perceives the physician-patient relationship as flawed. The objectives of this study are to assess factors associated with the public's trust in physicians in the context of the Lebanese healthcare system and to explore potential ways to enhance it.MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study based on a grounded theory methodology using semi-structured interviews with members of the Lebanese public (not restricted to patients). We selected participants through convenience and maximum variation sampling approaches. The constant comparative analysis resulted in a theoretical framework that describes the factors influencing trust in physicians.ResultsParticipants trusted an experienced, up-to-date, graduate of a North American or Western European school, working in a reputable hospital, with a high level of diagnostic skills. The personal characteristics that improved trust were physicians who are non-materialistic', have a good rapport, and have sufficient encounter time with patients. Social factors that enhance trust in the physician include: being a family member, recommended by a family member, featured in mainstream media, and/or having a good reputation. Trust increased compliance, loyalty despite occasional mistakes committed, high consultation fees, and negative attitudes towards the physician's institution. Conversely, no trust led to severed therapeutic relationship and seeking second opinions.ConclusionThe level of trust of members of the Lebanese public in physicians was affected by the personal characteristics of physicians, their practice or clinical skills, their interactions with the patient, finances, in addition to a number of social factors. Moreover, the level of trust had major implications on patients' interactions with their physicians.

AB  - Adolescents' views of the legal system, just world beliefs, and moral emotions are interrelated and form an important frame of reference, particularly for young people involved in the juvenile justice system. Yet past scholarship has generally treated these as independent indices of youths' experience. This study took a person-centered, latent profile approach to attitudes and beliefs among 136 male youth incarcerated within secure US juvenile facilities. Three heterogeneous profiles were found (negative attitudes/low emotion, moderate attitudes/mixed emotions, andpositive attitudes/positive emotion) which were differentially associated with antisocial behavior. Youth who belonged to historically marginalized populations had significantly lower odds of belonging to a protective profile characterized by positive legal attitudes, just world beliefs, and emotions (positive attitudes/positive emotion). Findings highlight our gaps in understanding young people's experiences with legal and judicial entities and illustrate significant heterogeneity in youth's frame of reference within the juvenile justice system.

AB  - This study examined attitudes about social acceptance, discrimination protection, and marriage equality for gay/lesbian people with a representative sample of 1,008 Hong Kong Chinese adults via a telephone survey. Despite majority endorsement of homosexuality (52.29% positive vs. 34.12% negative) and discrimination protection (50.72% favorable vs. 14.64% opposed), attitudes toward same-sex marriage diverged (32.79% favorable vs. 39.41% opposed). There was a sharp distinction in accepting gay/lesbian people as co-workers (83.57%) and friends (76.92%) versus relatives (40.19%). Having more homosexual/bisexual friends or co-workers contributed to greater endorsement of social acceptance and discrimination protection but not same-sex marriage. Age, religion, political orientation, and homonegativity consistently predicted attitudes toward social acceptance, discrimination protection, and same-sex marriage, whereas gender-role beliefs, conformity to norms, and cultural orientations had varying impacts. This article informs theory and advocacy by disentangling homonegativity from attitudes about gay/lesbian issues and highlighting the centrality of family-kinship and relative-outsider delineation in Chinese societies.

AB  - Previous research located two opposite findings and frequently used threat perceptions and value-support to explain the relationship between religiosity and attitudes toward immigrants: Religious individuals have negative attitudes toward immigrants because they support conservative values and feel threatened by unfamiliar groups. Second, they are open toward immigrants because they integrate prosocial and altruistic teachings of religion into their daily lives. Both lines have been confirmed repeatedly, which is puzzling. I argue that we need to consider all three factors (religiosity, value-support, threat perceptions) simultaneously and explore their mutual interactions. In this study, I test this line of argumentation empirically with data from the European Social Survey (Round 7). The analyses reveal that religiosity has the weakest direct effect on attitudes toward immigrants. Threat perceptions, on the other hand, have the strongest direct effects, followed by value-support. However, religiosity affects the attitudes toward immigrants indirectly via threat perceptions. These findings highlight that religiosity, value-support, and threat perceptions are closely linked and need simultaneous consideration to make reliable claims about their effects.

AB  - This paper examines the impact underground literature (yeralti edebiyati) has on influencing the opinions and beliefs of Turkey's youth regarding issues of contemporary importance. In order to understand the relevance of this genre to Turkish youth culture, we have not only examined the debate surrounding the topic in popular and academic circles, but also asked the readers themselves their opinions about their experience with the genre (in both its imported Western and homegrown Turkish variants) and its relevance to their lives. For our purposes, the effect of such texts on readers is the primary focus, and ours is the first mixed-media study to conduct a methodological, data-based investigation into the composition and opinions of underground literature's readers. Thus, our study supplements a lack in the existing scholarship by offering concrete qualitative and quantitative data that will better elucidate our knowledge of the relationship between underground literature and Turkish youth attitudes, as well as the potential the genre might hold for the future of Turkey's youth.

AB  - A recent evolutionary theory of female sexual fluidity suggests that women do not have sexual orientations in the same sense that men do, and instead women's apparent sexual orientation is a function of their sociosexual orientation. Among other things, the theory predicts that women's unrestricted sociosexual orientation decreases their negative attitude toward same-sex behavior, whereas men's unrestricted sociosexual orientation increases it. An analysis of the General Social Surveys data shows that, net of age, education, race, religion, religiosity, political attitude, intelligence, urbanicity and region of residence, and survey year, sociosexually unrestricted women are less likely to believe homosexual relationships are always morally wrong, while sociosexuality was not associated with homophobia among men. The study provides further evidence for the evolutionary theory of female sexual fluidity.

AB  - Communicators, motivated by strategic self-presentation, selectively underreport negative content in describing their impressions of individuals and stereotypes of groups, particularly for targets whom they view ambivalently with respect to warmth and competence. Communicators avoid overtly inaccurate descriptions, preferring to omit negative information and emphasize positive information about mixed individual targets (Study 1). With more public audiences, communicators increasingly prefer negativity omission to complete accuracy (Study 2), a process driven by self-presentation concerns (Study 3) and moderated by bidimensional ambivalence. Similarly, in an extension of the Princeton Trilogy studies, reported stereotypes of ethnic and national outgroups systematically omitted negative dimensions over 75 years as anti-prejudice norms intensified-while neutral and positive stereotype dimensions remained constant (Study 4). Multiple assessment methods confirm this stereotyping-by-omission phenomenon (Study 5). Implications of negativity omission for innuendo and stereotype stagnation are discussed.

AB  - Purpose
   Metronidazol and vancomycin were long the two best options against Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile infections (CDI). Now, the cost of new drugs such as fidaxomicin directs us towards alternative treatment options, such as faecal microbiota transplant (FMT). Its effectiveness is similar to fidaxomicin. There are questions regarding its safety, but the biggest challenges are prejudice and inconvenience. Most protocols refer to FMT applied in the form of a solution. We investigated different modalities of FMT.
   Methods
   Instead of using nasoenteric tubes or colonoscopy, we place frozen or lyophilised stool in non-coated, size "00", hard gelatine capsules or enterosolvent, size "0" capsules.
   Results
   We found that non-coated, size "00", hard gelatine capsules are appropriate for conducting FMT. Capsules containing lyophilised supernatant with a low number of bacteria have been proven to be non-inferior to other FMT modalities. The primary cure rate in the supernatant group was 93.75%, and 66.67% in the sediment group. The overall cure rate was 82.14%. Depending on the protocol, 4-7 capsules are sufficient per patient. Capsules can be stored for up to one year at -20 degrees C.
   Conclusions
   FMT is a feasible alternative to antibiotic treatments in CDI. Our method makes the process flexible and less inconvenient to patients. Long storage time allows a consistent supply of capsules, while small volume and formulation make the procedure tolerable.

AB  - Training has shown little effectiveness in altering harassing or discriminatory behavior. Limitations of prior intervention efforts may reflect poor conceptualization of the problems involved, poor training intervention design, approaches that engender cynicism, or misunderstanding psychological principles of attitude and behavior change. Interventions should capitalize on behavioral science models and tools at multiple levels from a broad array of disciplines to explain harassment and bias, and then to defeat these behaviors. Measures to ensure fair treatment should focus on leadership socialization, organizational culture and climate, increased professional competence, and integration with organizational approaches to corporate social responsibility and performance.

AB  - With >1 400 species, bats comprise the second-largest order of mammals and provide critical ecological services as insect consumers, pollinators, and seed dispersers. Yet, bats are frequently associated with infectious human diseases such as SARS, MERS, and Ebola. As early as the end of January 2020, several virological studies have suggested bats as a probable origin for SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. How does the public view the role of bats in COVID-19? Here we report pilot data collected shortly after the outbreak of COVID-19 using two online surveys, combined with a conservation intervention experiment, primarily on people who are receiving or have received higher education in China. We found that 84% of the participants of an online survey (n = 13 589) have misunderstood the relationship between bats and COVID-19, which strengthened negative attitudes towards bats. Knowledge of bats, gender, and education level of the participants affected their attitudes towards bats. Participants who indicated a better knowledge of bats had a more positive attitude towards bats. The proportion of female participants who had negative attitudes towards bats was higher than that of male participants. Participants with a higher education level indicated a more positive attitude towards bats after the outbreak of COVID-19. A specially prepared bat conservation lecture improved peoples' knowledge of bats and the positive attitudes, but failed to correct the misconception that bats transmit SARS-CoV-2 to humans directly. We suggest that the way virologists frame the association of bats with diseases, the countless frequently inaccurate media coverages, and the natural perceptual bias of bats carrying and transmitting diseases to humans contributed to the misunderstandings. This probably led to a rise in the events of evicting bats from dwellings and structures by humans and the legislative proposal for culling disease-relevant wildlife in China. A better understanding of the relationship between disease, wildlife and human health could help guide the public and policymakers in an improved program for bat conservation.

AB  - Background: Cradle to Grave (C2G), a hospital-based violence prevention programme, brings inner-city youth into an urban Level I trauma centre to follow the path of an adolescent gunshot victim from trauma bay to morgue. We hypothesised that C2G alters student attitudes towards gun violence.
   Methods: Eighty-eight adolescents were prospectively enrolled. With parental and student consent, students completed the Attitudes Towards Guns and Violence Questionnaire (AGVQ), a previously validated and reliable social science assessment tool. Two weeks later, the students participated in C2G. The survey was re-administered four weeks after C2G participation. AGVQ results are reported both as a total score and as a breakdown of the four component subscales. Higher AGVQ scores indicate proclivity towards violence. ANOVA compared scores with respect to demographics and type of school (public vs. charter).
   Results: C2G altered student's attitudes towards guns and violence. Of 43 public school students, total scores decreased following C2G (p = 0.02). The greatest attitudinal change occurred in subscale 1, "Aggressive Response to Shame" (p < 0.01). C2G failed to produce significant changes AGVQ scores in the 45 students attending a city charter school. The two groups were found to have baseline differences, with public school students showing higher baseline tendencies towards violence.
   Conclusions: Our hospital-based programme is capable of positively impacting adolescents' attitudes towards guns and violence. This effect is most pronounced in subjects who already display increased tendencies towards violence. These results suggest that hospitals offer a unique opportunity to address the public health crisis posed by inner-city. rearm violence. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Intergroup anxiety has become important in understanding the success or failure of intergroup contact. In this paper, we suggest that intergroup anxiety is made up from two constructs: self-anxiety (anxiety over thinking or doing something that is prejudiced) and other-anxiety (anxiety that the other might do something to you). Over four studies, we show how these two dimensions have different correlates and independently predict psychophysiological reactivity to an intergroup interaction. Other-anxiety was associated with negative intergroup attitudes and negative affect. In contrast, self-anxiety had no simple relationship with conventional measures of intergroup attitudes but was associated with a flattening of responses that were indicative of freezing (Study 3) and simultaneous approach and avoidance (Study 4). We suggest that whereas other-anxiety is associated with negative affect and avoidance, self-anxiety is associated with freezing responses to intergroup interaction. Thus, the distinction between these two constructs has important repercussions. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

   Study design Data on reported vaccination status were analyzed from a nationally representative prospective survey of mothers of 2-to 6-month-old infants. Weighted univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted. Latent profile analysis of mothers reporting nonimmunized infants identified distinct groups.
   Results Of 3268 mothers, 2820 (weighted 86.2%), 311 (9.1%), and 137 (4.7%), respectively, reported their infant had received all, some, or no recommended vaccinations for age. Younger infants and infants with younger mothers were more likely to have received no vaccinations. Mothers with neutral and negative attitudes toward vaccination were > 3 (aOR 3.66, 95% CI 1.80-7.46) and 43 times (aOR 43.23, 95% CI 20.28-92.16), respectively, more likely than mothers with positive attitudes to report their infants had received no vaccinations. Two subgroups of mothers reporting that their infants had received no vaccinations were identified: group A (52.5%) had less than positive attitudes and less than positive subjective norms about vaccination (ie, perceived social pressure from others); group B (47.5%) had positive attitudes and positive subjective norms. GroupAmothers were more likely to be white (76.1% vs 48.3%, P =.002), more educated (43.5% vs 35.4% college or higher, P =.02), and to exclusively breastfeed (74.9% vs. 27.3%, P <.001).
   Conclusions Although access barriers can result in nonvaccination, less than positive maternal attitude toward vaccination was the strongest predictor. Strategies to improve vaccination rates must focus on both improved access and better understanding of factors underlying maternal attitudes.

AB  - Purpose: Despite positive health advantages of post-surgery physical activity (PA) for bariatric surgery patients, the majority is not sufficiently physically active. The aim was to explore women's perceptions and experiences concerning PA five years after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) surgery. Methods: Eleven women were interviewed five years post-surgery. Grounded Theory approach was applied. Results: The core-category "Attitudes and surrounding environment influence activity levels" includes three attitudes towards PA: "Positive attitudes", "Shifting attitudes" and "Negative attitudes". Participants with a positive attitude were regularly physically active, felt supported and proud of their achievements. Contrary, participants with a negative attitude didn't prioritize PA, didn't feel supported and saw no need or benefit of PA. Some participants revealed an on-off behaviour, hovering between the attitudes of vigorous PA and sedentary lifestyle, without sustainable balance. The majority mostly viewed PA as a mean to lose weight. Conclusion: The level of perceived post-surgery PA was related to the participants' attitudes towards PA and whether or not they had a supportive environment. These findings might explain why bariatric surgery patients often fail to be sufficiently active post-surgery, and highlight the need for prolonged support and motivational interventions to promote sustainable PA post-bariatric surgery.

AB  - Previous studies have indicated that obese people face many forms of severe prejudice and discrimination in various settings, such as education, employment, and interpersonal relationships. However, research aimed at reducing obesity stereotyping is relatively rare, and prior studies have focused primarily on negative stereotypes. Based on the empathy-altruism hypothesis and self-other overlap hypothesis, this study investigates the impact of perspective taking (PT) on both positive and negative obesity stereotypes and examines the mediating effects of empathy and self-other overlap. A sample of 687 students (191 males and 496 females) at Chinese universities participated by completing self-report questionnaires on trait tendency and evaluation toward obese people. Structural equation modeling and the bootstrap method revealed that self-other overlap (but not empathy) mediated the relationship between PT and negative obesity stereotypes. While self-other overlap and empathy both mediated the relationship between PT and positive obesity stereotypes. These findings address the importance of PT for improving positive and negative obesity stereotypes: specifically, PT promotes psychological merging, and produces empathic concern (EC).

AB  - Despite the well-recognised benefits of sport, there are also negative influences on athlete health, well-being and integrity caused by non-accidental violence through harassment and abuse. All athletes have a right to engage in safe sport', defined as an athletic environment that is respectful, equitable and free from all forms of non-accidental violence to athletes. Yet, these issues represent a blind spot for many sport organisations through fear of reputational damage, ignorance, silence or collusion. This consensus statement extends the 2007 IOC Consensus Statement on Sexual Harassment and Abuse in Sport, presenting additional evidence of several other types of harassment and abusepsychological, physical and neglect. All ages and types of athletes are susceptible to these problems but science confirms that elite, disabled, child and lesbian/gay/bisexual/trans-sexual (LGBT) athletes are at highest risk, that psychological abuse is at the core of all other forms and that athletes can also be perpetrators. Harassment and abuse arise from prejudices expressed through power differences. Perpetrators use a range of interpersonal mechanisms including contact, non-contact/verbal, cyber-based, negligence, bullying and hazing. Attention is paid to the particular risks facing child athletes, athletes with a disability and LGBT athletes. Impacts on the individual athlete and the organisation are discussed. Sport stakeholders are encouraged to consider the wider social parameters of these issues, including cultures of secrecy and deference that too often facilitate abuse, rather than focusing simply on psychopathological causes. The promotion of safe sport is an urgent task and part of the broader international imperative for good governance in sport. A systematic multiagency approach to prevention is most effective, involving athletes, entourage members, sport managers, medical and therapeutic practitioners, educators and criminal justice agencies. Structural and cultural remedies, as well as practical recommendations, are suggested for sport organisations, athletes, sports medicine and allied disciplines, sport scientists and researchers. The successful prevention and eradication of abuse and harassment against athletes rests on the effectiveness of leadership by the major international and national sport organisations.

AB  - Weight bias comprises a multitude of stereotypes about individuals with large bodies, as well as negative attitudes and discriminatory behaviors. In a culture of normative discontent that emphasizes thinness as a social ideal, many counselors will inevitably work with clients who seek assistance with weight loss. Although weight loss may be a client's identified treatment goal, counselors must consider the potential for harm working toward such a goal in therapy. In this article, we utilize justice motive theory to discuss the potential unintended harm to clients in counseling when weight bias is not considered as part of a case conceptualization. Through the examination of three common social messages related to body weight (i.e., the controllability of body weight, the morality of weight, the social acceptability of weight bias), the justice motive is used to illustrate a case example and the implications for counseling. Considerations for socially just practices in counseling are discussed, as well as future research directions.

AB  - AimTo develop and test the psychometric characteristics of a questionnaire that measures attitudes towards e-learning, as well as to study attitudes about e-learning and to identify variables related to those attitudes amongst dental students.
   Subject and MethodsThe study was conducted from November 2010 to December 2011 at all three Croatian dental schools. A questionnaire entitled Attitude Towards e-Learning' consisting of 12 questions about socio-demographic data and 22 statements about attitude towards e-learning was self-administered by 386 students. Factorial analysis and Cronbach's alpha were used to test the psychometric characteristics of the questionnaire. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify variables related to attitudes towards e-learning.
   ResultsFactorial analysis confirmed two factors: positive attitude and negative attitude, which interpret 58% of the total variance and had good internal consistency of =0.852 and 0.668, respectively. The average score of positive attitude was 426, indicating a highly positive attitude towards e-learning. The average score of negative attitude was 27 +/- 6, indicating minor negative attitude. Higher age and study year, usage of the Internet in education, more frequent usage of Facebook and more attendance of e-courses demonstrated a significant influence on positive attitude towards e-learning (R-2=0.304; P<0.001). Lower year of study and less frequent attendance of e-courses had a significant influence on negative attitude (R-2=0.268; P<0.001).
   ConclusionsDental students have generally positive attitudes towards e-learning. Teachers should adopt strategies to change negative attitudes by introducing more e-learning courses in lower study years and should encourage students to use the Internet in their education and communication with teachers and colleagues.

AB  - Research suggests that contact with sexual minorities and etiology beliefs regarding the origins of homosexuality are associated with antigay bias; however, factors related to etiology beliefs have received little empirical attention. Our primary research question is: Does closeness to someone who is gay, lesbian, or bisexual influence etiology beliefs? Students (n=851) from four U.S. universities completed an anonymous survey, and regression results indicated that contact and closeness were not significantly associated with etiology beliefs. Because both contact and relationship closeness were associated with antigay attitudes, and closeness demonstrated the largest effect, we tested three alternative structural equation models to determine if contact and closeness mediated etiology beliefs. Results suggested that contact and the degree of closeness are indirectly associated with students' etiology beliefs through antigay bias.

AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the extent of overlap between autistic traits, body dissatisfaction and disordered eating and to explore the mediating effects of negative attitudes towards emotional expression and emotion dysregulation. The sample comprised 416 university students (82% females, 17-48 years [M=19.76, SD=3.85]), who completed an online questionnaire assessing eating attitudes and behaviours (including dieting, bulimia and oral control), body dissatisfaction, and autistic traits (including the Autism Quotient [AQ] and its related subscales as well as the Empathising Quotient). Attitudes towards emotional expression and emotion regulation were also assessed. Results revealed that eating pathology correlated highly with all AQ subscales, with the exception of the attention to detail subscale. However, there was no significant relationship between empathising and eating pathology. Path-analyses indicated that emotion dysregulation, but not negative attitudes towards emotional expression, was a significant mediator of the relationship between AQ body dissatisfaction and eating pathology. Direct relationships were also obtained for the AQ-bulimia and the AQ-oral control paths. Prevention and early intervention programs for eating pathology would likely benefit from addressing abnormalities in emotion processes in individuals who score highly on measures of autistic traits.

AB  - BackgroundPersonality dimensions such as openness and agreeableness have been found to be associated with prejudice levels towards several minority groups. Yet these variables have been mostly ignored by existing research into attitudes towards people with intellectual disability (PWID), which has primarily focused on contact and demographic variables. The current study investigated the relationship between personality dimensions and attitudes toward PWID.
   MethodsAn online survey was completed by 466 adult participants recruited through a variety of sources. The survey consisted of a well-validated attitude survey, the Big Five inventory, contact related and demographic questions.
   ResultsThe hypothesis that higher levels of the personality dimensions openness and agreeableness would be significantly associated with positive attitudes towards PWID was supported. However the effect was relatively weak and the strongest predicting factor of positive attitudes was increased quality of contact with PWID. More positive attitudes were also associated with females, more highly educated and younger participants.
   ConclusionsResults provide support for an integrated (including person and situational factors) theoretical approach to attitudes research in this field. Practically, results support programmes that stimulate and promote quality interactions between PWID and the wider community.

AB  - Objective: to explore research knowledge about lesbian women's experiences with health-care providers in the birthing context.
   Method: a systematic search for relevant qualitative studies in selected databases identified 13 articles of sufficient quality. The findings were synthesized using a meta-ethnographic approach as described by Noblit and Hare.
   Synthesis and findings: issues related to covert or overt homophobia and prejudice were demonstrated and were sometimes mediated by subtle mechanisms that were difficult to understand and to manage. On the other hand, small gestures of support were described to make a huge difference. A lack of knowledge was demonstrated, contrasted by staff showing a positive and informed attitude. Disclosure was an important issue, but due to the risk involved the women demonstrated a need to be in control. Finally, being acknowledged, both as individuals and as family were considered vital. In this regard, it was essential to recognize and include co-mother as equal parent and to look upon lesbian sexuality as normal and natural.
   Key conclusions: midwives' emotional involvement in the situation is significant for moral perception of the women's intimate citizenship, even when they are distressed by lesbian sexuality.
   Implications for practice: our findings reveal the importance of including sexuality as an issue deserving reflection in maternity wards, whether or not this might cause unrest in midwives who do not feel comfortable with intimate citizenships beyond mainstream.

AB  - The spillover of racism towards welfare opinions has previously been studied in several countries. This paper analyses how racism and welfare are formed intertwined in Austria. This remains an important topic, as the welfare state not only distributes material resources but is also seen as a site of socialization - at least within the German-speaking literature. Besides identifying a potential spillover effect within survey data for Austria, the article also discusses how the topics of the racialized, especially in the form of the migrant "other" and welfare state and support, are rhetorically linked within newspaper articles. Four rhetorical strategies are distinguished within the empirical material using the notion of the undeserving "other" to argue, among others, for general welfare state cutbacks. These strategies also introduce arguments for extreme cases of social exclusion within the welfare state that affect existing views on, and possibly also, society and social life itself.

KW  - social work

AB  - Antisemitism, one of the oldest forms of prejudice and oppression is surging throughout the world. It ranges from verbal abuse to the destruction of property to murder. In the last two years, attacks against Jews in the United States were the overwhelming target of religion-based hate crimes. Stereotypes and myths continue to fuel prejudice and antisemitism in society. Factors such as anti-Israel sentiments, remarks by persons in power, the use of social media, white nationalism, and even the Covid 19 pandemic have contributed to its escalation.
   As a result of the increasing violence, the U.S. legislature held a hearing on confronting antisemitic terrorism with one outcome being that social workers and community advocates were needed to join law enforcement in the effort to heal and work for justice. Social work with its mandate to promote social justice and human rights and challenge oppression cannot ignore antisemitism and its impact on individuals and societies. However, the subject is basically ignored in the curriculum. This paper offers a brief history of antisemitism and presents guidelines and models for integrating it into social work programs.

TI  - Britishness, Belonging and the Ideology of Conflict: Lessons from the Polis
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
LA  - English
AB  - A central aspiration of the 'Britishness' agenda in UK politics is to promote community through the teaching of British values in schools. The agenda's justification depends in part on the suppositions that harmony arising from agreement on certain values is a necessary condition of social health and that conflict arising from pluralism connotes a form of dysfunction in social life. These perceptions of harmony and conflict are traceable to the ancient Greeks. Plato used the device of the soul-city analogy to provide a form of independent justification for his favoured model of community according to which harmony was essential. However, the soul-city analogy involves an intellectual sleight-of-hand. The idea that conflict connotes a defect in social life, which continues to haunt contemporary debates about community and values education, is the vestige of an ancient aristocratic ideology and we must learn to see it as such. There is no more reason to accept the Platonist portrayal of the place of conflict in social life than there is to accept a diametrically opposed Heraclitean account, which interprets harmony as the central threat to social flourishing. The implications of this ancient dispute for modern education are considerable: there is nothing natural or inevitable about the association of conflict with social dysfunction that partly supports the Britishness agenda; it is a political prejudice. Coming to see it as such will reveal new pathways to belonging and new ways of understanding the role of education in fostering the good society.

AB  - Research suggests that many men have used a variety of tactics to avoid using condoms when having sex with women. Guided by previous work demonstrating that men's use of coercive condom resistance tactics was predicted by negative attitudes toward women, inconsistent condom use, multiple partners, and sexual sensation seeking, the current study used latent profile analysis (LPA) to determine whether similar constructs were associated with a variety of resistance tactics. A community sample of 313 moderate-drinking men participated, of whom 80% reported employing at least one condom use resistance tactic since adolescence. The LPA revealed three classes of men. In general, men with the least negative beliefs about women, low levels of sexual sensation seeking and impulsivity, and positive beliefs about condoms (Condom Positive/Low Hostility) reported less use of resistance tactics than men with moderate sexual sensation seeking and impulsivity, negative beliefs about condoms, and moderate (Condom Negative/Moderate Hostility) or high (Condom Negative/High Hostility) negative attitudes about women. The classes also differed in terms of their sexual behaviors. This study demonstrated that sexual risk behavior interventions should not only address the tactics through which men resist using condoms but also tailor these efforts to men's individual characteristics.

AB  - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and other same-sex attracted young people have been shown to be at a higher risk of mental health problems, including depression, anxiety, suicidality, and substance abuse, compared to their heterosexual peers. Homophobic prejudice and stigma are often thought to underlie these disparities. In this study, the relationship between such experiences of social derogation and mental health and substance use in same-sex attracted young people was examined using Meyer's minority stress theory. An online survey recruited 254 young women and 318 young men who identified as same-sex attracted, were aged 18-25 years, and lived in Sydney, Australia. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that internalized homophobia, perceived stigma, and experienced homophobic physical abuse were associated with higher levels of psychological distress and self-reported suicidal thoughts in the previous month. Furthermore, perceived stigma and homophobic physical abuse were associated with reporting a lifetime suicide attempt. The association between minority stress and substance use was inconsistent. While, as expected, higher levels of perceived stigma were associated with club drug dependence, there was an inverse association between internalized homophobia and club drug use, and between perceived stigma and hazardous alcohol use. The findings of this study provide support for the minority stress theory proposition that chronic social stress due to sexual orientation is associated with poorer mental health. The high rates of mental health and substance use problems in the current study suggest that same-sex attracted young people should continue to be a priority population for mental health and substance use intervention and prevention.

TI  - Disability income support design and mental illnesses: a review of Australia and Ontario
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH & PRACTICE

KW  - STIGMA
AB  - Aim: Mental illnesses have many distinctive features that make determining eligibility for disability income support challenging - for example, their fluctuating nature, invisibility and lack of diagnostic clarity. How do policy makers deal with these features when designing disability income support? More specifically, how do mental illnesses come to be considered eligible disabilities, what tools are used to assess mental illnesses for eligibility, what challenges exist in this process, and what approaches are used to address these challenges? We aimed to determine what evidence is available to policy makers in Australia and Ontario, Canada, to answer these questions.
   Methods: Ten electronic databases and grey literature in both jurisdictions were searched using key words, including disability income support, disability pension, mental illness, mental disability, addiction, depression and schizophrenia, for articles published between 1991 and June 2013. This yielded 1341 articles, of which 20 met the inclusion criteria and were critically appraised.
   Results: Limited evidence is available on disability income support design and mental illnesses in the Australian and Ontarian settings. Most of the evidence is from the grey literature and draws on case law. Many documents reviewed argued that current policy in Australia and Ontario is frequently based on negative assumptions about mental illnesses rather than evidence (either peer reviewed or in the grey literature). Problems relating to mental illnesses largely relate to interpretation of the definition of mental illness rather than the definition itself.
   Conclusions: The review confirmed that mental illnesses present many challenges when designing disability income support and that academic as well as grey literature, especially case law, provides insight into these challenges. More research is needed to address these challenges, and more evidence could lead to policies for those with mental illnesses that are well informed and do not reinforce societal prejudices.

AB  - Social behavioral abnormalities are commonly seen in the later stages of dementia. However, there has been only limited empirical study of social functioning in the earlier stages of the disease, or in individuals diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The aim of the present study was to test whether these clinical groups show more socially inappropriate and prejudicial behavior relative to controls, as rated by informants. No group differences were identified for ratings of either socially appropriate behavior or stereotyping and prejudice. However, the results also indicated that informants rated participants with dementia as showing the most inappropriate behavior, and that these ratings were related to participants' degree of immediate logical memory impairment, but not to delayed memory recall or to more general neurocognitive decline as indexed by the Mini Mental State Examination. Together, these results have implications for an understanding of some of the changes in social function seen in abnormal adult aging.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Family involvement during the transition process is crucial. However, culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) families report barriers to effective transition planning related to cultural misunderstandings with educators. Professionals need to be culturally competent when interacting with CLD families and youth. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to revise a CLD Transition Knowledge and Skills (CLDTKS) Evaluation Instrument and have special educators use the instrument to evaluate the levels of CLD transition knowledge and skills of their colleagues.
   METHODS: The CLDTKS Evaluation Instrument was revised following expert review. Participants included 206 special educators. Exploratory factor analysis was used to explore the factor structure of the instrument. Structural equation modeling was used to test construct validity, and confirmatory factor analyses were performed. Means were computed for all factors.
   RESULTS: The CLDTKS Evaluation Instrument consisted of four scales: Cultural Characteristics Related to Active Family Involvement, Family Norms and Communication Styles, Individualized Education Program (IEP) Meetings and Transition Policies, and Family Legal Status and Associated Prejudice. For all factors, there was a lower mean on skills than on knowledge.
   CONCLUSIONS: The CLDTKS Evaluation Instrument is a valid and reliable measure for evaluating transition knowledge and skills related to working with CLD youth and families, and it can be used for research and professional development needs.

AB  - In light of the growing role of social media in conflict management, the current study analyzes the interrelationship of online political participation of Israeli Jews, the frequency of their online contacts with Arabs, and Jews' perceived social distances from Arabs. The research was conducted through an online survey of a representative sample of 458 Israeli Jews who use the social media at least 3 times a week. Overall, although causation cannot be inferred because of the correlational design of our study, results suggest that frequency of online contacts may positively affect closeness to Arabs in line with contact theory. In keeping with the socialization perspective of political engagement, the findings indicate that the impact of online political participation on social distances from Arabs was mediated by interactions between Jews and Arabs in the social media.

AB  - Both facial cues of group membership (race, age, and sex) and emotional expressions can elicit implicit evaluations to guide subsequent social behavior. There is, however, little research addressing whether group membership cues or emotional expressions are more influential in the formation of implicit evaluations of faces when both cues are simultaneously present. The current study aimed to determine this. Emotional expressions but not race or age cues elicited implicit evaluations in a series of affective priming tasks with emotional Caucasian and African faces (Experiments 1 and 2) and young and old faces (Experiment 3). Spontaneous evaluations of group membership cues of race and age only occurred when those cues were task relevant, suggesting the preferential influence of emotional expressions in the formation of implicit evaluations of others when cues of race or age are not salient. Implications for implicit prejudice, face perception, and person construal are discussed.

AB  - Purpose: The theory that self-esteem is substantially constructed based on social interactions implies that having a stutter could have a negative impact on self-esteem. Specifically, self-esteem during adolescence, a period of life characterized by increased self-consciousness, could be at risk. In addition to studying mean differences between stuttering and non-stuttering adolescents, this article concentrates on the influence of stuttering severity on domain-specific and general self-esteem. Subsequently, we investigate if covert processes on negative communication attitudes, experienced stigma, non-disclosure of stuttering, and (mal)adaptive perfectionism mediate the relationship between stuttering severity and self-esteem.
   Methods: Our sample comprised 55 stuttering and 76 non-stuttering adolescents. They were asked to fill in a battery of questionnaires, consisting of: Subjective Screening of Stuttering, Self-Perception Profile for Adolescents, Erickson S-24, Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, and the Stigmatization and Disclosure in Adolescents Who Stutter Scale.
   Results: SEM (structural equation modeling) analyses showed that stuttering severity negatively influences adolescents' evaluations of social acceptance, school competence, the competence to experience a close friendship, and global self-esteem. Maladaptive perfectionism and especially negative communication attitudes fully mediate the negative influence of stuttering severity on self-esteem. Group comparison showed that the mediation model applies to both stuttering and non-stuttering adolescents.
   Conclusion: We acknowledge the impact of having a stutter on those domains of the self in which social interactions and communication matter most. We then accentuate that negative attitudes about communication situations and excessive worries about saying things in ways they perceive as wrong are important processes to consider with regard to the self-esteem of adolescents who stutter. Moreover, we provide evidence that these covert processes also need to be addressed when helping adolescents who are insecure about their fluency in general. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background/Context: The current biographic understanding of John Dewey's experience adopting and raising an Italian boy named Sabino emphasizes the theme of finding an emotional replacement for Morris and Gordon, two young sons who had tragically died on family trips to Europe. Lacking is substantive attention to the fact that John Dewey's son had a physical disability who grew up during the early surge of eugenics thought in American popular life. The leading biographer Jay Martin has portrayed John and Alice Dewey as rescuing Sabino from poverty, an experience that gave John Dewey "a special empathy for the second-best, the second-class citizen, the loser in society." What is missing from all biographic research on the Deweys is their experience of raising a boy with a physical disability during a historical time when disabilities were highly stigmatized.
   Purpose/Objective/Research: The purpose of this historical study is to supplement the current understanding of John Dewey fathering an adopted son with an account that attends to the fact that young Sabino had a physical disability. Working in the disability studies tradition, this analysis explores both how the Deweys contended with Sabino's bone tuberculosis as an illness requiring medical treatment and how they navigated the complex political context of deeply discriminatory attitudes surrounding disabled persons. The conclusion initiates a discussion of the larger questions concerning how the experiences of fathering a boy impacted directly by disability oppression might have influenced John Dewey's political activity and scholarship.
   Research Design: This historical analysis utilizes prior biographic research, published and unpublished works by John Dewey, and primary historical documents such as family letters and medical and popular publications of the era.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: This analysis finds that John and Alice Dewey were very loving and attentive parents who endured many struggles due to their child's disability. They worried about their son's health, and they capably navigated the available medical options. They were troubled by their son's suffering and pain, and they worked together with great consistency to comfort and support him. Further, they directly confronted disability prejudice, including educational segregation, and worked assiduously against the powerful cultural assumption that their disabled son should lead a life of anything less than full participation in the community. The article concludes with a preliminary examination of how these experiences influenced John Dewey's political writings and activities.

TI  - Culture and diversity among occupational therapists in Ireland: when the therapist is the 'diverse' one
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY

KW  - Cultural diversity
KW  - ethnicity
KW  - disability
KW  - COMPETENCE
AB  - Introduction: Literature in occupational therapy, although paying increased attention to cultural differences and diversity, has largely ignored the situation of therapists who are themselves members of social and cultural minority groups. 'Difference' is assumed to be exclusively an attribute of the client.
   Method: This qualitative study explored the professional experiences of 12 occupational therapists in Ireland who self-identified as disabled or ethnic minority group members.
   Findings: Participants reported challenges with colleagues and managers, which revolved primarily around cultural differences in the norms and expectations guiding social interactions, communications and practice styles. Overt discrimination was reported only by disabled therapists. With clients, again there were clashes of cultural values, but participants also experienced overt and covert prejudice and intolerance. This was particularly difficult to respond to in the context of client-centred practice.
   Conclusion: Cultural competence, as the prevailing approach to diversity, emphasises suspending one's own values to facilitate those of clients. This demand may be inappropriate for minority therapists who may face prejudice and discrimination. In contrast, cultural humility and critical reflexivity emphasise negotiating values in the context of social power relations, an approach that may better position occupational therapy to benefit from a diverse workforce.

AB  - Almost every adapted physical education teacher, recreation therapist, or general activity leader knows at least one individual (and more likely knows several) who has difficulty learning sport skills, whose movements appear dissimilar from peers, and/or who doesn't do well when playing games and sports. That same individual may have difficulty with fine motor skills, have very hard to read hand writing, and may look clumsy when performing daily tasks. This individual lacks coordination. It may be that this lack of coordination is the result of a concomitant disability, inadequate opportunities to develop motor skills, or just lack of effort. However, lack of coordination may also be a result of the individual having a developmental coordination disorder.
   Any individual experiencing coordination problems may feel left out, inadequate, unhappy, frustrated, and embarrassed by his or her ineptness. These feelings can result in said individual's withdrawal and/or refusal to join in and participate in physical activity. Lack of coordination can also lead to that individual being disruption in an attempt to shift attention from away from his or her lack of competence. This individual may be "labeled" lazy, slow, clumsy, stupid, or troublemaker, but no matter what the label, the individual has a problem. Lack of coordination can have lasting effects in all areas of daily life. For the physical education student with a developmental coordination disorder, frustration can lead to refusal to participate and future negative attitudes about physical activity. Lacking coordination in motor activity can also, in later life, lead to complete aversion to leading an active lifestyle.
   But, while general assumptions regarding who has a developmental coordination disorder, who is uncoordinated due to a disability, and who is just having transitory difficulty mastering a skill, can be made, it is important for physical education, recreation, and sport professionals to be able to distinguish the specifics of developmental coordination disorder in order to provide appropriate and timely intervention. This article explores determination of developmental coordination disorder, causes of chronic coordination problems, how a lack of coordination relates to other disabilities, and how lack of remediation can have a negative lasting effect on an active lifestyle. Most important, this article will include techniques for activity professionals to use to assist a student with developmental coordination disorder in mastering physical activity and sport skills. These techniques are equally appropriate for implementation in one-on-one situations and large classes, as well as with sports teams.

AB  - Due to their racialized identity and immigrant status, African immigrants face increased risk for social exclusion and other negative outcomes. Research indicates that discrimination, social and economic disadvantage increase risk for substance use among Black populations in the United States. While emerging studies on African immigrants have explored consequences of social exclusion on psychological health, little is known about how these conditions impact substance use patterns. This study examined the effects of social exclusion on alcohol and/or other drug use, and non-medical use of prescription drugs among African immigrants, and explored whether perceived discrimination mediated this relationship. Data were collected between 2019 and 2020 from a cross-sectional survey examining experiences of first and second-generation African immigrants across the United States (N = 597). The majority of the sample identified as female (71%) and Black (82%). Structural equation modeling was conducted with probit regression paths to examine the direct and indirect effects of three dimensions of social exclusion (sociocultural, economic, and structural) on alcohol and/or other drug use and non-medical use of prescription drugs, with perceived discrimination as the mediator. Increased sociocultural and structural exclusion significantly increased the likelihood of alcohol and/or other drug use and non-medical use of prescription drugs through the perceived discrimination pathway. Structural exclusion also had direct effects on substance use. Findings highlight the importance of examining social stressors when exploring risk for substance use, and point to the need for prevention efforts that reduce negative attitudes and promote inclusivity of this marginalized population.

AB  - This essay explores in particular and historical detail a well-worn truism of Chaplin criticism: that there was a special affinity between Chaplin and Dickens. That affinity turns out, it argues, to have important implications for Chaplin's self-fashioning both as a performer, in film, especially in his first full-length feature and most personal film, The Kid, and as an autobiographer, in print, not only in My Autobiography but (to some degree) in the disputed and dubious 1916 work Charlie Chaplin's Own Story. His identification with Dickens, especially the Dickens of Oliver Twist, was deep-rooted and enabling; it is expressed particularly in his creative relationship to his child self, in his encounter with stereotype, prejudice, and stage 'Jewishness', and in his understanding of performance as a kind of self-making. Besides Dickens himself, several 'Dickensian' actors will prove major players in this story, including 'Dickensian' 'impersonator' Bransby Williams and, above all, Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, whose performance as Fagin electrified the young, stage-struck Chaplin in or just after 1905. Their roles will elucidate, to some degree, Chaplin's inheritance from the 'legitimate' theatre of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

AB  - Background: Despite a high prevalence of herbal and dietary supplement use (HDS) in pre-dialysis patients, the reasons are unknown as to why they decide to use HDS. Objectives of the cross-sectional and qualitative studies were to determine reasons for the use and non-use of HDS in Thai patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
   Methods: This prospective study recruited 421 patients with stage 3-5 CKD from two kidney clinics in Thailand, and 357 were followed up regarding their HDS use over 12 months. Patients receiving renal replacement therapy at baseline were excluded. Participants were interviewed at baseline and in the twelfth month regarding their HDS use, and reasons for their use or non-use of HDS. Among HDS users, 16 patients were enrolled in a qualitative study and were interviewed using eight-open ended questions about reasons for HDS use. Descriptive and thematic analyses were performed.
   Results: Thirty-four percent of patients with CKD consistently used HDS over the 12 months and 17% of all patients intermittently took them during the follow-up period. At baseline, family or friends' recommendation was the most common reason for HDS use (35%), followed by having a perception of benefits from using HDS (24%). During the follow-up period, perceived benefits of HDS was a frequently reported reason for either continuing with HDS use (85%) or starting to use HDS (65%). Negative experience from using HDS influenced patients to stop using them (19%). Although the main reason for non-use of HDS was trust in a doctor or effectiveness of conventional medicine (32%), doubt about the benefits from HDS or concerns about negative effects were frequently reported reasons for non-use (23%). Doctor's recommendations to avoid using HDS were the main influence for non-users (19%) and for those who had stopped using HDS (23%). The media and patients' social network had an impact on HDS use.
   Conclusions: Patients who perceived benefits from HDS use were more likely to use HDS, whilst non-users had negative attitudes towards HDS. Health professionals therefore should educate patients and their relatives about the risks and benefits from using HDS.

AB  - Medical students begin their education inside a laboratory dissecting cadavers to learn human gross anatomy. Many schools use the course experience as a way to instill empathy and some have begun integrating video and recorded interviews with body donors to humanize the experience, but their impact has yet to be measured. This study examines the effects of a brief documentary film and the initial cadaver encounter on student perceptions and attitudes towards the laboratory experience. A pre-test, exposure, post-test design was used with 77 first-year medical students at the University of Central Florida. A previously validated questionnaire was adapted to measure attitudes, emotions, initial reaction to cadaver, perception of the donor as a person, and impressions of the film. An online questionnaire was completed before the first day of laboratory, in which students watched the film Anatomy and Humanity and handled their respective cadavers (no dissection was performed). The post-test was administered immediately following the activities of the first laboratory day. Results indicate an increase in negative attitudes towards dissection, but a more positive initial reaction to the cadaver than originally anticipated. Students also experienced a decrease in emotions like sadness and guilt regarding anatomy laboratory and were less likely to view the cadaver as a once-living person. Findings suggest a higher comfort level, but also greater detachment toward the cadavers from day one despite the video intervention. These results provide novel insight that may aid other interventions aimed at promoting humanism in the anatomy laboratory experience. (C) 2015 American Association of Anatomists.

AB  - Although the effects of direct and indirect forms of contact on intergroup relations are well documented, little is known about their longitudinal co-development. Based on the social-psychological literature, we hypothesize that indirect contact predicts future direct contact by reducing intergroup anxiety. Across five longitudinal studies (Study 1: German adults, N = 560; Study 2: German, Dutch, and Swedish school students, N = 6,600; Study 3: Northern Irish children, N = 1,593; Study 4: Northern Irish adults, N = 404; Study 5: German adults, N = 735), we systematically examined this effect, and further tested the mediating role of intergroup anxiety in Studies 3 to 5. Cross-lagged models provided consistent evidence for the positive effect of indirect contact on future direct contact, whereas a reduction in intergroup anxiety mediates this effect in most models. Results highlight the importance of indirect contact, which has the potential to increase direct contact, and thus promote social cohesion in diverse contexts, over time.

AB  - The Dual Process Model of ideology and prejudice (DPM) proposes specific information-processing mechanisms by which broad-bandwidth personality shapes social worldviews. We adapt a classic anchoring and adjustment paradigm and show that Openness to Experience interacts with exposure to information about safety and threat to shape judgments of societal threat and danger. Those low in Openness to Experience were more sensitive to anchor information about the proportion of dangerous and threatening people in society (Study 1). The moderating effect of Openness to Experience on dangerous worldview estimates was due specifically to an intellect or cognitive component of this personality trait, rather than an aesthetic component (Study 2). These results indicate low Openness increases the tendency to be anchored by threat-relevant cues. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Public Significance Statement In this study, we found that sexual stigma, meaning the negative attitudes and discriminatory behaviors based on privileging heterosexuality, was significantly associated with a greater likelihood of experiencing sexual violence for young bisexual people. We also identified that the sexual identity-specific factors, like sexual stigma, interacted with general factors, like decreased access to resources, to increase participants' vulnerability for sexual violence. Taken together, we believe that attention to sexual stigma, and in particular how sexual stigma impacts other areas of sexual minoritized people's lives, is critical to developing effective sexual violence prevention efforts for sexual minoritized people.
   Young sexual minoritized people report elevated rates of sexual violence in comparison with their heterosexual peers. This health disparity is largest among lesbian and bisexual people, and in particular bisexual women. We know little about what drives this health disparity, which is critically necessary information for developing effective sexual violence interventions. Recently, sexual stigma has been identified as an important factor related to sexual victimization among sexual minoritized people. The current article details a concurrent mixed-method study investigating what factors contribute to young lesbian and bisexual people's vulnerability for experiencing sexual violence, and in particular the similarities and differences between these two groups. We conducted a survey with 328 participants to investigate the quantitative relationships between sexual stigma and experience of sexual violence. A subset of 25 survey participants with a history of sexual victimization also engaged in qualitative interviews about their experience of violence. Primary quantitative findings indicate that sexual stigma significantly predicts a greater likelihood of reporting an experience of sexual violence among bisexual people, and to a lesser degree, lesbian people. Qualitative findings support the development of a theoretical model that describes how intersectional experiences of marginalization across individual, interpersonal, and societal levels interact to increase vulnerability for sexual violence.

AB  - This paper aims to offer a new perspective on two fifth-century texts: Martianus Capella's De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii and Macrobius' Saturnalia. Both were transmitted and received throughout the Middle Ages as methodical sources containing an account of the ancient sciences and disciplines, and highly criticised in modern times for their supposedly poor level of scientific knowledge. Setting aside the recent focus on the Neoplatonic ascription of some of their content, I claim that these texts still contribute to a traditional educational ideal. They put forward a kind of amateur, dilettantish encyclopaedic lore as the appropriate 'further education' for young Latin men of the higher class that would allow them to acquire material for excellence in discourse within the framework of a basically rhetorical education. With their literary sophistication and informal approach, they also illustrate the means of acquiring this broader knowledge in a non-professional way, by individual reading/listening and excerpting, as something distinct from the formal schooling available in grammar and rhetoric. Such an approach could help us to avoid the still rather widespread and sometimes undeservedly excessive criticism of the level of their 'science' and, especially, blaming this dubious characteristic on the prejudiced assumption of the decline of science in the 'obscure times' of Late Antiquity.

AB  - In contrast to earlier in the HIV/AIDS pandemic, net of other demographic factors, formal education acts as a preventative factor in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite this trend, there has been almost no research on the causal mechanisms behind the widely reported education effect. Consistent with the education effect, structural equation modeling of the influence of education attainment on condom use with Demographic Health Survey data from nine sub-Saharan Africa nations collected between 2003 and 2005 finds that net of control variables, there is a robust, positive influence of education on condom use among sexually risky adults. Information-transfer and attitude change, the two most commonly assumed educational influences on the use of condoms, are tested, and although education attainment increases acquisition of basic facts and the inculcation of positive attitudes about HIV/AIDS, these factors have only weak influence on condom use. Given this, a new hypothesis about education's enhancement of health reasoning is developed from neuro-developmental and decision-making research. Modeling finds that education robustly influences health reasoning ability and this factor mediates a significant proportion of the education effect on condom use. The results raise concern about the enormous effort by NGOs in the region to use mainly fact-and attitude-based educational programs to reduce future HIV infections. Future research on the causal mechanisms behind the association between education and HIV/AIDS prevention should focus how on schooling enhances the cognitive skills needed for health reasoning.

AB  - Background: Nonattendance rates remain high for first therapy appointments, despite initiatives to increase access to psychological therapy. The reasons for nonattendance are poorly understood and studies of demographic and clinical predictors have produced conflicting findings. Aims: We aimed to pilot a method for investigating psychological factors associated with first appointment attendance in a primary care mental health service. Method: Questionnaires were completed by individuals at the point of referral to CBT with a low-intensity service in one general practice (n = 67), including a measure of beliefs, goals and attitudes towards therapy, as well as anxiety and depression scales. Subsequent attendance at the first appointment was used as an outcome. Results: Preliminary results showed that attendance was not associated with age or gender, severity of distress, or overall ratings for positive or negative attitudes towards therapy; although distress itself was associated with increased endorsement of negative attitudes. However, one specific psychological item, "Talking to a therapist will help me understand better how my mind works" had a significant association with subsequent attendance. Conclusions: The psychological factor that was associated with increased attendance may reflect the concept of psychological mindedness; however, this requires replication in a larger study. A full-scale study was deemed to be warranted based on this prospective design.

AB  - Why do some people maintain stable feelings of commitment toward their partners, whereas others' feelings wax and wane from day to day? The current article draws insight from decision conflict research suggesting that individuals torn between decision options are particularly susceptible to attitude change. In three samples, we validated a stay/leave ambivalence scale to capture internal conflict about whether to remain in versus exit a relationship. In two dyadic daily experience studies, individuals who felt more ambivalent about their relationships experienced greater daily fluctuation in commitment and breakup contemplation compared to less ambivalent individuals. Ambivalent individuals' relationship intentions were also more strongly tied to their daily experiences, such that they felt more motivated to stay on days with greater relationship positivity, and more motivated to leave on days with greater relationship negativity. We discuss implications of these results for ambivalent individuals, their partners, and our understanding of stay/leave decision processes.

AB  - Sensory analysis is unusual in sustainability research, although it can offer a neoteric aspect of nature and wild animals' perception. The study's objective was to identify consumers' attitudes towards plant and animal products from wild and conventional foods and put these findings into a broader social context. A blind sensory evaluation with 80 semi-trained assessors was used, segmented by gender, age, education, income, place of origin, family status, number of children, and willingness to pay. Wild boar (Sus scrofa) was chosen as an example of an overpopulated animal species occurring in the wild, which could be considered a partial substitute for pork. Statistical testing in these blind evaluations proved that wild boar meat is not considered less tasty. Therefore, wild boar meat could represent a partial substitute, complementing pork, on which consumers are willing to spend the same amount of money. Despite the mostly indifferent sensory evaluation, focus group responses showed considerable barriers to wild food. This paper concludes that possible educational and popularizing procedures are presented, including forest pedagogy, eliminating consumers' prejudices. A mixed-methods approach within quantitative and qualitative methodology was chosen.

AB  - Effective livestock vaccination has the potential to raise prosperity and food security for the rural poor in low and middle income countries. To understand factors affecting access to vaccination services, and guide future policy, smallholder farmers in three locations in India were questioned about vaccination of their cattle and buffalo, with particular reference to foot and mouth disease (FMD), haemorrhagic septicaemia (HS) and blackquarter (BQ). In the three regions 51%, 50%, and 31% of respondents reported vaccinating their livestock; well below any threshold for effective population level disease control. However, within the third region, 65% of respondents in villages immediately surrounding the Kaziranga National Park reported vaccinating their cattle. The majority of respondents in all three regions were aware of FMD and HS, awareness of BQ was high in the Kanha and Bandhavgarh regions, but much lower in the Kaziranga region. The majority of respondents had positive attitudes to vaccination; understood vaccination protected their animals from specific diseases; and wished to immunise their livestock. There was no significant association between the age or gender of respondent and the immunisation of their livestock. Common barriers to immunisation were: negative attitudes to vaccination; lack of awareness of date and time of vaccination events; and difficulty presenting animals. Poor access to vaccination services was significantly associated with not vaccinating livestock. Fear of adverse reactions to vaccines was not significantly associated with not vaccinating livestock. Respondents who reported that vets or animal health workers (AHWs) were their main source of animal health knowledge were significantly more likely to have immunised their livestock in the last twelve months. Participants cited poor communication from vaccinators as problematic, both in publicising immunisation programmes, and explaining the purpose of vaccination. Where vaccinations were provided free of charge, farmers commonly displayed passive attitudes to accessing vaccination services, awaiting organised "immunisation drives" rather than seeking vaccination themselves. Based on these findings the following recommendations are made to improve participation and effectiveness of immunisation programmes. Programmes should be planned to integrate with annual cycles of: disease risk, agricultural activity, seasonal climate, social calendar of villages; and maximise efficiency for vaccinators. Dates and times of immunisation in each village must be well publicised, as respondents frequently reported missing the vaccinators. Relevant farmer education should precede immunisation programmes to mitigate against poor knowledge or negative attitudes. Immunisation drives must properly engage beneficiaries, particularly ensuring that services are accessible to female livestock keepers, and sharing some responsibilities with local farmers. Payment of a small monetary contribution by animal keepers could be considered to encourage responsibility for disease prevention, making vaccination an active process by farmers.

AB  - Credibility is central to the legal treatment of sexual violence, as epitomized by the iconic "he said/she said" contest. Over time, the resolution of competing factual accounts has evidenced a deeply skeptical orientation toward rape accusers. This incredulous stance remains firmly lodged, having migrated from formal legal rules to informal practices, with much the same result-an enduring system of disbelief. Introducing the concept of "credibility discounting" helps to explain the dominant feature of our legal response to rape. Although false reports of rape are uncommon, law enforcement officers tend to default to doubt when women allege sexual assault, resulting in curtailed investigations as well as infrequent arrests and prosecutions. Credibility discounts, which are meted out at every stage of the criminal process, involve downgrades both to trustworthiness (corresponding to testimonial injustice) and to plausibility (corresponding to hermeneutical injustice).
   By conceptualizing prejudiced disbelief as a distinct failure of justice, one deserving of separate consideration, we may begin to grasp the full implications of credibility discounting, beyond faulty criminal justice outcomes. Attending to this failure of epistemic justice on its own terms advances a conversation about how best to reform institutions so that credibility judgments do not perpetuate inequality. To this end, credibility discounting should count as actionable discrimination. Under certain conditions, moreover, this recognition raises constitutional concerns. When rape victims confront a law enforcement regime predisposed to dismiss their complaints, they are effectively denied the protective resources of the state.

AB  - Background: Weight stigma contributes to the present epidemic of obesity, and obese people with stigmatization are at risk of acquiring adverse physical, behavioral and psychological health outcomes
   Objectives: to identify the source of obesity stigma and to examine the effect of obesity stigma on adults with overweight/obesity in Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: A cross sectional study was done on a sample of the Saudi population from different regions. A pre-designed questionnaire was used to collect data about exposure to negative behavior by others because of obesity, ways and sources in which participants face discrimination and prejudice and participants were asked about their feelings and effect of obesity on their life and daily activities.
   Results: Often, because of obesity, 25.6% of the participants were exposed to negative behavior by others, 18.2% were exposed to bad comments from children, 25.2% were exposed to physical barriers and 25.4% were exposed to bad comments from the family. The most important sources of discrimination against obese people were by family members (42.4%) and (27.9%) face this discrimination by self-love, and self-acceptance. Participants with an age ranging from 21-29 years had a significant higher frequency of those who reported exposure to negative behavior by others, bad comments from children, family and others, and encountered more physical barriers and obstacles compared to other age groups.
   Conclusion: Obese individuals should be health educated to accept themselves and in the national discourse on obesity, weight stigma must be discussed.

AB  - Research suggests that some people, particularly those on the political right, tend to blatantly dehumanize low-status groups. However, these findings have largely relied on self-report measures, which are notoriously subject to social desirability concerns. To better understand just how widely blatant forms of intergroup dehumanization might extend, the present article leverages an unobtrusive, data-driven perceptual task to examine how U.S. respondents mentally represent "Americans" versus "Arabs" (a low-status group in the United States that is often explicitly targeted with blatant dehumanization). Data from 2 reverse-correlation experiments (original N = 108; preregistered replication N = 336) and 7 rating studies (N = 2,301) suggest that U.S. respondents' mental representations of Arabs are significantly more dehumanizing than their representations of Americans. Furthermore, analyses indicate that this phenomenon is not reducible to a general tendency for our sample to mentally represent Arabs more negatively than Americans. Finally, these findings reveal that blatantly dehumanizing representations of Arabs can be just as prevalent among individuals exhibiting low levels of explicit dehumanization (e.g., liberals) as among individuals exhibiting high levels of explicit dehumanization (e.g., conservatives)-a phenomenon into which exploratory analyses suggest liberals may have only limited awareness. Taken together, these results suggest that blatant dehumanization may be more widespread than previously recognized and that it can persist even in the minds of those who explicitly reject it.

AB  - Outgroup dehumanisation, the denial of full humanity to outgroups relative to ingroups, is pervasive in many contemporary societies. The aim of the present work is to review effective strategies aimed at fostering outgroup humanity attribution. After presenting the main models of humanity attribution, we differentiate two types of strategies. Outgroup-specific strategies are focused on a target outgroup, therefore their effectiveness is more dependent upon the specific intergroup relationship. These include intergroup contact, meta-humanisation, and social categorisation. Outgroup-independent strategies are not inherently linked to a target outgroup, implying that their effectiveness is less dependent on the specific intergroup dynamics under consideration. These involve human-animal similarity and secure relationship attachment. We provide evidence for the effectiveness of these strategies and their underlying processes, showcasing our research programme within the larger literature. In so doing, we take into account the distinction between blatant and subtle dehumanisation, and conclude with suggestions for future research.

AB  - British officials knew a good deal about the upsurge in malignity following the terrible euphoria of the Anschluss in March 1938. Word even reached a British consul working under Sir Frederick Leith-Ross in China. Alexander made his way from the Far East to Germany, the place where he had spent contented days as a student, in order to negotiate the release of a Jewish friend from Dachau. Negotiations were progressing nicely until they were interrupted by the outburst of destructive fury against Germany's Jews in November 1938. As talks faltered in a febrile atmosphere of Jew-hatred, Alexander used his connections to gain access to a member of the Nazi aristocracy. The British diplomat got more than he bargained for. The senior Nazi made a shocking proposal. He outlined an incredible scheme that, he claimed, would lead to permanent peace between Germany and Britain. His plan uncannily presaged details of the Final Solution three years before its implementation. This information quickly made its way back to London and indeed to the British Foreign Secretary himself, Lord Halifax. So, how would the Foreign Office react? Wallis's article tells the story of a forgotten memorandum, one that challenges whether theories concerning the limits of the British imagination are sufficient to explain British inaction in the face of massive anti-Jewish persecution and violence.

AB  - The present body of scholarship suggests that Black Americans seek mental health services at much lower rates than their White American counterparts. The explanations for these decreased levels of mental health help-seeking typically distinguish barriers such as stigmatization, lack of culturally relevant treatment models, and negative attitudes toward mental health services. The final results of these analyses are not invalid; however, this researcher contends that they are arguably incomplete. Black Americans must navigate countless obstacles rooted in systematic oppression, institutional inequalities, and structural disparities when seeking help for mental health concerns. This article reviews a set of key terms to offer a historically based and culturally candid perspective on those mental health service seeking experiences for underresourced Black Americans living in environmentally toxic urban spaces. The four theoretical concepts of historical trauma, environmental toxicity, culturally bound economic insecurity, and cultural mistrust both individually and interactively are used to present a more realistic topography of the mental health (help-seeking) experiences for underresourced Black Americans. These ideas are collectively positioned as the theoretical construct of obstructed use.

AB  - Purpose
   This paper aims to identify common barriers to employment of autistic people and reasonable adjustments that address those barriers; to define autistic strengths and see how the prevailing narrative of autism is affecting employment.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This is a qualitative review of an online consultation amongst a group of 34 autistic adults that took place during April-October 2019. It includes anecdotal accounts and reviews of the themes contained therein.
   Findings
   Key barriers are, namely, deficit narrative of autism; misunderstandings and prejudices amongst senior management and work colleagues; bullying and peer pressure to isolate the autistic employee, leading to anxiety and mental health breakdown in absence of social support; managers making discriminatory choices believing it is the right business decision; the discriminatory nature of provisions, criteria and practices, failing to recognise strengths. Rather than imposing the manner of work, reasonable adjustments should be made to enable the autistic employee to function in his autistic way, achieving results.
   Research limitations/implications
   Qualitative nature; small self-selecting sample online; functioning and diagnosis not verified, themes derived subjectively.
   Practical implications
   The need to change the deficit narrative and redefine autistic strengths by autistic people themselves, to legitimise and normalise autistic way of functioning and adjust the managerial provisions, criteria and practices accordingly. Coaching autistic leaders to be the public role models would also help.
   Originality/value
   Identifying barriers and reasonable adjustments, from the perspective of lived experience. A new framework of assessing autistic competence and suitability for employment is proposed.

AB  - We propose that the propensity to think creatively tends to be associated with independence and self-directionqualities generally ascribed to menso that men are often perceived to be more creative than women. In two experiments, we found that outside the box creativity is more strongly associated with stereotypically masculine characteristics (e.g., daring and self-reliance) than with stereotypically feminine characteristics (e.g., cooperativeness and supportiveness; Study 1) and that a man is ascribed more creativity than a woman when they produce identical output (Study 2). Analyzing archival data, we found that men's ideas are evaluated as more ingenious than women's ideas (Study 3) and that female executives are stereotyped as less innovative than their male counterparts when evaluated by their supervisors (Study 4). Finally, we observed that stereotypically masculine behavior enhances a man's perceived creativity, whereas identical behavior does not enhance a woman's perceived creativity (Study 5). This boost in men's perceived creativity is mediated by attributions of agency, not competence, and predicts perceptions of reward deservingness.

AB  - Empathy is a critical component of social work practice, yet research has indicated that health professionals often express negative attitudes toward people who abuse substances. The current study examines levels of empathy and attitudes of social work students, clinical social workers and practicing nurses. Rates of empathy were lower than expected. The findings suggest that using tools such as SBIRT may be beneficial in terms of contributing to job satisfaction and well-being of nurses and social workers in the field.

AB  - Recent increases in intergroup tensions and violence have global negative implications and underline the need for effective interventions to ameliorate conflictual relations. Despite the ongoing trend in social psychology toward an interventionist approach, there is still a theoretical and empirical gap in personalizing intergroup interventions to achieve optimal effectiveness. Integrating interventions aimed at prejudice reduction and promoting peace, we present a theoretical framework for personalizing these intergroup interventions. We propose a three-layer model: personalization parameters, intergroup interventions, and mechanisms that link parameter and intervention. To illustrate the model, three sample parameters are described (ideology, dominant emotional sentiments, and Big Five personality types) and three corresponding mechanisms (level of intervention congruency; the degree to which an intervention addresses core appraisal theme; and a needs-based mechanism). We demonstrate how the parameters and mechanisms map onto different established intergroup interventions, and suggest some empirical directions to test and later apply the theoretical framework. Finally, we discuss the potential of personalized interventions to substantially improve intergroup relations.

AB  - Objective: The aims of this study were to compare weight-based attitudes in obese Latino adults with and without binge eating disorder (BED) and to examine whether these attitudes are related to indices of eating disorder psychopathology and psychological functioning.
   Method: Participants were a consecutive series of 79 monolingual Spanish-speaking-only obese Latinos (65 female, 14 male) participating in a randomized placebo-controlled trial performed at a Hispanic community mental health center. Participants were categorized as meeting the criteria for BED (n = 40) or obese non-binge-eating controls (n = 39) based on diagnostic and semistructured interviews administered by fully bilingual research clinicians trained specifically for this study.
   Results: Analyses revealed that negative attitudes toward obesity did not differ significantly between the BED and non-binge-eating groups nor were they correlated with the intensity of eating disorder psychopathology (eg, levels of weight and shape concerns). Overall, the levels of negative attitudes toward obesity in this Latino/Latina group are similar to those reported previously for samples of English-speaking primarily white obese persons.
   Discussion: These findings suggest that it may be obesity per se-rather than eating disorder psychopathology or body image-that heightens vulnerability to negative weight-based attitudes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose To understand the associations between awareness, attitudes, and intentions to use long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) among youth seeking induced abortion services in Shanghai, China. Materials and methods A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 1,215 nulliparous youth with unintented pregnancies in 41 hospitals of Shanghai, China, through a stratified sampling process between January and May 2019. Multivariable logistic regression was used to test the associations between awareness, attitudes and intentions to use LARCs. Results Around 70% of youth had heard of at least one method of LARCs. About 38% of youth perceived that the copper-bearing intrauterine contraceptive device (Cu-IUD) was safe; the rate was 8% and 7%, respectively, for levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) and subdermal implants. Less than 40% of youth thought Cu-IUD was effective in contraception, and it was around 6% for LNG-IUS and subdermal implants. Overall, less than 8% of youth expressed intentions to use LARCs. Positive attitudes towards LARCs were highly associated with the intentions to use LARCs [adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) 3.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.96-5.42, p < 0.001]. Conclusions Low awareness and negative attitudes towards LARCs were found in this study, and the negative attitudes towards LARCs could contribute to low intentions to use LARCs among youth who had already experienced unintended pregnancies.

The present research examined the relationships between different types of intergroup threats and their antecedents and U.K residents' attitudes toward Gypsies/Travellers. Regression analyses confirmed that negative stereotypes, symbolic threats, and intergroup anxiety predicted attitudes, whereas multicultural ideology endorsement, ingroup identification, realistic threats, and intergroup anxiety predicted support for Gypsy/Traveller group rights. Moreover, multicultural ideology endorsement predicted support for group rights indirectly through realistic threats, whereas negative stereotypes predicted attitudes indirectly through symbolic threats and intergroup anxiety and predicted support for group rights indirectly through realistic threats and intergroup anxiety. Discussion focuses on the implications for strategies aimed at reducing what is often defined as "the last acceptable racism."

AB  - Objectives: Qualitative studies show that women link menopause to the ageing process, and yet surprisingly little research has investigated how attitudes to ageing might shape women's experience of menopause, as well as their overall well-being at midlife. This study validated the Attitudes to Ageing Questionnaire (AAQ) for use among midlife women, and explored the AAQ's role in predicting menopausal factors and 10 year well-being trajectories in the midlife group.
   Study design: Scale validation involved cross-sectional group comparisons of the AAQ factor structure between a sample of midlife women aged 40-60 (n = 517) and sample of women aged over 60 (n = 259). Longitudinal data on 10-year change in subjective well-being was analysed for a subsample of the midlife group (n = 492).
   Main outcome measures: Hot flush interference ratings, menopausal beliefs, subjective well-being.
   Results: Assessment of measurement invariance showed support for configural and scalar invariance, with partial support for strict invariance. Midlife women exhibited more negative attitudes to ageing on the psychosocial loss subscale compared to older women. Attitude to psychosocial loss was the strongest predictor of women's experience of menopause, and women with a negative attitude to psychosocial loss did not experience gains in subjective well-being with age that were characteristic of those with a positive attitude.
   Conclusions: Findings demonstrate the validity and utility of the AAQ for use among midlife women. Policies to enhance attitudes to ageing could be beneficial to protect well-being during the second half of life. 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examined how intergroup processes and social-cognitive factors shape bystander responses to bias-based and general bullying. Participants included sixth and ninth graders (N = 179, M = 13.23) who evaluated how likely they would be to intervene if they observed bullying of immigrant-origin and nonimmigrant-origin peers. Adolescents' grade, intergroup attitudes, and social-cognitive abilities were evaluated as predictors of bystander responses. Nonimmigrant-origin adolescents reported that they expect they would be less likely to intervene when the victim is an immigrant-origin peer. Furthermore, participants with more intergroup contact and higher theory of mind were more likely to expect they would intervene in response to bias-based bullying. Findings have important implications for understanding factors that inform antibullying interventions that aim to tackle bias-based bullying against immigrants.

AB  - Introduction Risky sexual behaviors. Adequate awareness of reproductive health in young people is important because they are in the early years of fertility, and engaging in risky sexual behaviors is more probable. This study aimed to evaluate the sexual attitude and associated factors of risky sexual behaviors among girls and boys and the difference in sexual norms by gender among university students. Methods A university-based study with a cross-sectional survey was conducted for 9 months in 2019. A total of 800 university students were studied by a random sampling technique using a self-administered structured questionnaire derived from the World Health Organization illustrative questionnaire to assess sexual attitudes among adolescents and young adults. Results Most of the respondents were female and single. Girls were more religious, more frequently visited the cinemas and were more likely to discuss sex matters with family members than boys. There was no significant difference in the total score of sexual attitudes in girls and boys, and both genders had negative attitudes toward risky sexual behavior (42/72). Those who go to parties, bars, or movies are more likely to have risky sexual behavior. Being a religious person is an essential predictor of having less risky behavior (RR = 2.02, 95% CI = [0.96, 3.41]). Conclusion Being religious was a protective factor for engaging in risky sexual behavior. More interventions in schools and universities need to educate students to enhance awareness about the consequences of risky sexual behavior and reduce its rate.

AB  - Objectives:Much is known about some healthcare professionals' attitudes toward patients with substance use disorders, but few studies have specifically looked at emergency department (ED) physicians. Individuals with substance use disorders are more likely to be people who chronically, frequently use the ED, and thus ED physicians are in a unique position to provide early identification and intervention for people struggling with addiction. The purpose of this study was to understand ED physicians' attitudes toward patients with substance use disorder with the aim of decreasing stigma and improving the care of ED patients with substance use disorder.Methods:An anonymous Qualtrics survey was emailed to 115 emergency physicians in the Johns Hopkins Health System. The survey contained (1) demographics and (2) the medical condition regard scale, http://links.lww.com/JAM/A67. Participants were offered a $10 Amazon gift card to complete the survey.Results:The response rate was 50% (n=58) and the completion rate was 43% (n=50). Physicians had lower regard for patients with substance use disorders than other medical conditions with behavioral components. Of note, 54% of respondents indicated that they at least somewhat agree that they prefer not to work with patients with substance use who have pain.Conclusions:A significant portion of our study population had low regard for patients with substance use. Future research is needed to determine significant contributing factors and develop interventions to mitigate negative attitudes among ED physicians toward patients with substance use disorder.

AB  - In modern societies there is strong belief in scientific progress, but, unfortunately, a parallel partial regress occurs because of often avoidable mistakes. Mistakes are mainly forgetting, erroneous theories, errors in experiments and manuscripts, prejudice, selected publication of "positive" results, and fraud. An example of forgetting is that methods introduced decades ago are used without knowing the underlying theories: Basic articles are no longer read or cited. This omission may cause incorrect interpretation of results. For instance, false use of actual base excess instead of standard base excess for calculation of the number of hydrogen ions leaving the muscles raised the idea that an unknown fixed acid is produced in addition to lactic acid during exercise. An erroneous theory led to the conclusion that lactate is not the anion of a strong acid but a buffer. Mistakes occur after incorrect application of a method, after exclusion of unwelcome values, during evaluation of measurements by false calculations, or during preparation of manuscripts. Co-authors, as well as reviewers, do not always carefully read papers before publication. Peer reviewers might be biased against a hypothesis or an author. A general problem is selected publication of positive results. An example of fraud in sports medicine is the presence of doped subjects in groups of investigated athletes. To reduce regress, it is important that investigators search both original and recent articles on a topic and conscientiously examine the data. All co-authors and reviewers should read the text thoroughly and inspect all tables and figures in a manuscript.

AB  - Microcephaly is a congenital malformation in which the brain does not develop properly. It can be the result of a series of factors, from malnutrition of the mother, drug abuse, infections during pregnancy, among others. In the family context, the birth of a child with microcephaly, produces profound changes and needs in the psychosocial and financial dimensions of the family. Based on this, the objective was to unveil the feelings experienced by mothers of infants with microcephaly. For that, a descriptive, exploratory study was developed with a qualitative data approach, carried out in a reference maternity hospital, located in a great city of Northeastern Brazil, with 20 (twenty) mothers. In order to process the collected data, the IRaMuTeQ software was used and the results were analyzed by the Hierarchical Descending Classification. Six classes were found: Feelings before the diagnosis of microcephaly; Feelings in coping with microcephaly; Acceptance of the diagnosis of microcephaly and the importance of family support; Feelings related to the limitations and the search of care for infants with microcephaly; Feelings related to the routine of mothers of infants with microcephaly and Feeling related to the mother's reaction to the prejudice of society. It has been shown that for mothers, the birth of a child with microcephaly is a delicate and conflicting moment in their lives, because it is a new and unexpected event in their life, also because it is the loss of the idealized baby, to be replaced by a baby who will need more specific care.

AB  - Heterosexism and heteronormativity are pervasive in the South African society, but to what degree are they present in Life Orientation (LO) textbooks? This question, explored through a content analysis of widely used Grade 10 LO textbooks, was framed by queer theory. The paper quantitatively examines the coverage of sexualities, and qualitatively examines how sexualities are constructed and projected in the texts. The quantitative analysis reveals a low percentage of statements devoted to sexuality overall and the normalisation of heterosexuality mainly through the exclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) sexualities but also through techniques of differentiation, hierarchisation and homogenisation. The qualitative analysis reveals inadequate information about sexualities and in its place a simplistic, moralistic ideological approach. Furthermore, discussions of the family, dating, safe sex and marriage assume heterosexuality as the norm. Nineteen years after the democratisation of South Africa and 17 years after the ratification of South Africa's constitution which explicitly forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, LGBT sexualities are largely invisible in school LO curricula. Since this is a subject that is compulsory for all learners and its express aim is to prepare young South Africans for participation as citizens in a just and democratic society, the absence of LGBT issues and identities helps perpetuate prejudice and violence towards LGBT communities.

AB  - Research into the relationship between religion and anti-gay attitudes frequently focuses on Christianity. We explored the role of religiosity dimensions, previous contact, and factors in the dual-process motivation model as predictors of explicit and implicit anti-gay attitudes in samples of Muslims and Atheists. The explicit and implicit attitudes of Muslims were more negative than the attitudes of Atheists. Explicit attitudes were more negative towards gay men than lesbians; implicit attitudes were negative towards gay men but were unexpectedly positive towards lesbians. In regression analyses, religious fundamentalism and extrinsic religious orientations (Study 1), and contact and right-wing authoritarianism (Study 2) were strong significant predictors of explicit anti-gay attitudes. Interestingly, none of the factors of interest predicted implicit anti-gay attitudes. These findings reveal a strong link between Islam and explicit anti-gay attitudes, but suggest that the relationship between religion and implicit anti-gay attitudes may be more complex than previously thought.

AB  - When dominant groups are accused of discrimination against non-dominant groups, they often seek to portray themselves as the victims of discrimination instead. Sometimes, however, members of dominant groups counter accusations of discrimination by invoking victimhood on a new dimension of harm, changing the topic being discussed. Across three studies (N = 3081), we examine two examples of this digressive victimhood - Christian Americans responding to accusations of homophobia by claiming threatened religious liberty, and White Americans responding to accusations of racism by claiming threatened free speech. We show that members of dominant groups endorse digressive victimhood claims more strongly than conventional competitive victimhood claims (i.e., ones that claim "reverse discrimination"). Additionally, accounting for the fact that these claims may also stand to benefit a wider range of people and appeal to more abstract principles, we show that this preference is driven by the perception that digressive victimhood claims are more effective at silencing further criticism from the non-dominant group. Underscoring that these claims may be used strategically, we observed that individuals high in outgroup prejudice were willing to express a positive endorsement of the digressive victimhood claims even when they did not fully support the principle they claimed to be defending (e.g., freedom of religion or speech). We discuss implications for real-world intergroup conflicts and the psychology of dominant groups.

AB  - Complaining about humanitarian refugees is rarely an unequivocal activity for society members. Their talk appears dilemmatic: 'sympathy talk', comprising rhetorical displays of 'care', tolerance and aesthetic evaluations, is woven together with more pejorative messages. In this article we investigate how 'sympathy talk' functions as a discursive resource in talk-in-interaction when people give accounts of minority group individuals. A 'synthetic' discursive psychological approach was employed to analyse a corpus of 12 talkback radio calls to an evening 'shock jock' radio personality in Adelaide, Australia, after the stabbing death of a Sudanese-Australian refugee. Analysis shows how host and callers dialogically negotiate and orientate to various sympathetic and humanitarian descriptions/evaluations. We contend that sympathetic talk advances the activity of conversation, softening complaints that could be made accountable as prejudiced. Sympathy talk also functions as a counter-argument to perceived punitive or 'racist' complaints. Moreover, this article proposes that such rhetoric shares an ideological thread that potentially undermines Sudanese refugees' social positioning. Dialogue that deploys sympathetic formulations may be an element in the increasingly varied and subtle activity of 'new racism'. We discuss how sympathetic accounts contain, within their semantic structure, their own antithesis for their deployment in anti-racist practice; for the development of counter discourses fundamental to the disruption of pervasive ideological representations and the construction of alternative refugee identities.

AB  - Objectives: In Germany, "self-help friendliness" is an upcoming popular concept for the promotion of patient centredness through closer cooperation of health care services with self-help groups of chronically ill and/or disabled patients and their relatives. The study aimed at gathering information from physicians with special expertise in quality management on opportunities for and barriers against introducing more collaboration between physicians and self-help groups in outpatient care.
   Methods: A cross-sectional explorative survey was conducted with quality circle moderators (group leaders) from four German federal states in 2008 and 2010 (n = 624 or 32.1% respondents out of 1943). Main outcome measure was the moderators' assessment of their peers, measured with 18 items. Statistical analyses were mainly descriptive, supplemented by subgroup analyses by federal state and characteristics of the respondents.
   Results: Moderators see a large willingness of outpatient physicians to integrate self-help activities, and many opportunities for better cooperation with patient groups. Nevertheless, most types of cooperation need activation and motivation. To enhance the cooperation, additional fees by health insurance funds, CME credit points and the decrease of doctors' work load are most likely to be effective.
   Conclusions: Given the willingness of office-based physicians to cooperate with patient groups, increased patient centredness through cooperation seems to be an achievable quality target in medical practices in Germany. Self-help-friendliness in medical practices is considered as an important partnership approach: however, the implementation is still in the early stages and has to overcome diverse barriers, mainly based on unfavourable opinions, negative attitudes and lack of incentives.

AB  - Purpose: In Lebanon, the LGBTQ+ community struggles with everyday stressors and unique difficulties that have intensified in recent months due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a crippling economic and political crisis. The purpose of this article is to highlight the kind of misrepresentation that the LGBTQ+ community has on Lebanese television and observe its effects on the wellbeing of this marginalized community.
   Materials and methods: The findings of this article were obtained through a thorough research and analysis of Lebanese television shows, series, and interviews over the past few years.
   Results: Many organizations work with the LGBTQ+ community and the healthcare professionals in order to help limit discrimination and raise awareness. However, sexual and gender minorities remain specifically targeted and subjected to prejudice and hostility through Lebanese Television. The representation of the LGBTQ+ community in Lebanese Television fuels the public's subjective perception of this vulnerable group, through an inaccurate lens that influences mass viewers.
   Conclusion: This article gives examples of several forms of inaccurate and biased depictions of the LGBTQ+ community and illustrates how this can directly influence society's views of this sub-population and subsequently lead to more prejudice and homophobia.

AB  - This study of the 2008 first presidential and vice presidential debate builds on past research on viewers' perceptions of candidate images. Going back to the Kennedy-Nixon debates in 1960, image research has been conducted in most presidential election cycles. Findings consistently show that viewers enter the debates with perceptions of candidates' character and leadership qualities and that the debates tend to reinforce rather than change images unless the viewers are undecided or not well informed about a candidate. The results of the 2008 study confirmed trends from past research but also provided some surprises in that most changes in image perception were for senator Joe Biden, the longest-serving public official in the race. The study concludes that media often assume knowledge about candidates that might not exist and that in the 2008 match-ups, the debates did not provide the "game changer" that the McCain-Palin ticket needed to overcome a growing movement toward the Obama-Biden ticket that began shortly before the first debate.

AB  - This research demonstrates a common psychology of outgroup hostility driven by perceived intergroup threat among three groups and seven cultural contexts: non-Muslim Westerners, Muslims in Western societies, and Muslims in the Middle East. In Study 1, symbolic, but not realistic and terroristic threats, predicted non-Muslim Norwegians' intentions to join anti-Islamic movements. In Study 2, symbolic and realistic, but not terroristic threat, predicted non-Muslim Americans' willingness to persecute Muslims. In Studies 3 and 4, symbolic threat predicted support and behavioral intentions against the West among Swedish and Turkish Muslims. Finally, in Study 5, a comparison demonstrated that symbolic and realistic threats had the same effects on violent intentions among non-Muslim and Muslim Danes, and Muslims in Afghanistan. Meta-analysis showed that symbolic threat was most strongly associated with intergroup hostility. Across studies, participants with high religious group identification experienced higher levels of threat. Implications for intergroup research and prejudice reduction are discussed.

AB  - Results from a nationally representative sample of the New Zealand European majority and Maori (the indigenous peoples of New Zealand) indicated that dual ideologies of symbolic exclusion and historical negation were differentially ameliorated and heightened through ingroup and outgroup contact (N=4718). For New Zealand Europeans, contact with Maori friends increased the symbolic projection of Maori culture as representative of the national category. For Maori, contact with New Zealand European friends decreased the symbolic projection of ingroup culture as representative of the nation. Ingroup contact, in contrast, heightened support for the symbolic exclusion of Maori for New Zealand Europeans, and promoted symbolic projection for Maori. For both groups, outgroup contact was unrelated to levels of historical negation, an ideology relating to material reparation for colonial injustice. These results indicate that post-colonial ideologies relating to the symbolic promotion versus exclusion of indigenous culture are more amenable to change via contact than ideologies linked directly to reparative attitudes based on historical injustice. Furthermore, for indigenous peoples, contact with the majority group may increase system-favoring ideologies that exclude their own culture from representations of the nation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although existing studies have suggested that gender stereotypes affect human perceptions about robots, neither what type of robot tasks or roles are expected to show gender characteristics nor whether expected gender characteristics are directly related to conventional gender conceptions have been sufficiently investigated. To explore these issues, this study conducted two online surveys. In the first survey (N = 500) a total of 30 items related to interaction scenes asked whether male, female, or neutral gender was preferred in terms of the appearance of communication partners in these scenes, and five categories regarding the roles and tasks of robots were extracted based on expected gender appearances. The results revealed a weak effect showing higher gender conceptions inviting a female gender appearance preference in some categories. The second survey (N = 400) measured participants' gender conception, negative attitudes toward robots, gender appearance preferences for the categories of robot roles and tasks extracted in the first survey, and occupations to investigate relationships between them. The results revealed that the influence of gender stereotypes and negative attitudes toward robots on gender appearance preferences changed depending on human occupation, in particular, those with the occupations of counselor, adviser, nurse, and caregiver were not associated with stereotypes, attitudes, or gender preferences toward robots playing roles in their own field of expertise.

AB  - Despite increasing contact opportunities, prejudice toward refugees persists, especially in mass immigration contexts. We investigated changes in and associations between Turkish early adolescents' (N = 687, M-age = 11.11 years) positive and negative contact with Syrian refugees and their outgroup approach-avoidance tendencies over 15 months (three waves). Univariate growth curve models demonstrated a rise in outgroup negativity indicated by increasing negative contact and avoidance tendencies, and decreasing approach tendencies, while positive contact only slightly increased over time (nonsignificantly). Combined latent growth curve models showed that increasing positive contact buffered against increasing outgroup negativity in behavioral tendencies by predicting a less steep decline in approach and a less steep increase in avoidance. Increasing negative contact was positively associated with increasing outgroup negativity so that it predicted a more steep increase in avoidance. Findings underline the importance of early contact interventions that target the fast deterioration of positive intergroup interactions in increasingly hostile intergroup contexts.

Such stressors may increase pandemic-related and general health risks both directly and indirectly and increase the risk for both general and traumatic stress. These stressors and their historical and social contexts are discussed, and implications for clinicians are provided.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study is to provide the first systematic analysis of differences in the closeness of sibling relations between lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) and heterosexual adults.
   Background Across countries, LGB people experience poorer socioeconomic and health outcomes than heterosexual people. Although the reasons for this disadvantage are complex, low levels of family support have been recurrently identified as an important contributor. However, the available literature has concentrated on relations between LGB people and their parents, neglecting other important familial bonds-including sibling bonds.
   Method To compare the closeness of sibling relations between individuals with different sexual orientations, this study leverages unique data from an Australian national survey (Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey, n = 13,157 individuals, 35,622 individual-sibling pairs) and multilevel regression models.
   Results Key results indicated that-when compared with heterosexual individuals-LGB individuals had less frequent contact with and lived geographically farther from their siblings. The pattern of effects was similar for bisexual and gay or lesbian individuals, and stronger for male than female sexual-minority individuals. There was only sparse evidence of moderation of these associations by individual or sibling traits.
   Conclusions The findings of this study are consistent with theoretical perspectives highlighting the unique barriers to socioeconomic inclusion experienced by individuals from sexual minorities. They suggest that these barriers begin within the nuclear family.

AB  - The contact hypothesis proposes that bringing groups together under favorable conditions can improve intergroup relations. It is now well established that intergroup contact can improve attitudes not only toward the out-group as a whole but also toward other, noncontacted groups (secondary transfer effect). We review evidence of a further, higher-order generalization effect whereby intergroup contact also impacts more general cognitive processes outside of the intergroup context (i.e., tertiary transfer effects). We present a taxonomy of transfer effects that explains these generalization effects as distinct outcomes of the contact process yet contingent on the same component process, specifically, the assessment of the semantic distance between the target (e.g., contacted individual) and the frame (e.g., group prototype). This conceptualization provides an explanatory framework for uniting the disparate forms of transfer effect in the contact literature, clarifying why primary and secondary transfer effects are facilitated by low semantic distance and why contact is more cognitively demanding under conditions of high semantic distance, but with greater potential for cognitive growth.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between symbolic racism and native-born citizens policy opinions toward legal and undocumented immigration. With data from the 1994 General Social Survey and the NPR/Kaiser Foundation/Kennedy School of Government 2004 Immigration Survey, the results from logit regression models indicate that symbolic racism significantly predicts opposition to legal immigration, immigrant access to federal aid, and standard costs for college, citizenship for U.S.-born children, and work permits for undocumented immigrants. The effects are independent of group threat and other factors. Symbolic racism explained more variation in policy opinions toward government assistance, while group threat explained more variation toward immigration levels and citizenship status. Depending on the issue, native-born citizens likely derive their immigration policy opinions from moral ideologies in addition to intergroup competition.

TI  - The Better Way to Stop Delay: Analyzing Speedy Sentencing Claims in the Wake of Betterman v. Montana
T2  - VANDERBILT LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - In Betterman v. Montana, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment's speedy trial right terminates after a defendant's conviction. In dicta, the Court suggested that a defendant might pursue a constitutional claim of undue sentencing delay under the Due Process Clause. Lower courts have generally embraced this suggestion. Still, the Betterman Court's limited holding left certain questions open: What analytical framework is appropriate to address due process claims of delay between conviction and sentencing? And if a court finds that sentencing was unduly delayed, what is the proper relief?
   After Betterman, some courts have analyzed postconviction delay using Barker v. Wingo's four factors: length of delay, reason for delay, defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant. Other courts have used United States v. Lovasco's two prong test: the defendant must demonstrate that he suffered actual prejudice and the government delayed in bad faith. This Note advocates for adopting the more flexible balancing test established by Barker but argues that Barker's traditional remedy for undue delay (dismissal of charges) is inappropriate in the sentencing context. Instead, this Note proposes a default remedy in which a defendant's sentence is reduced by the amount of delay if a speedy sentencing violation is proven.

AB  - Purpose - Today's organizations try to keep their employees loyalty but employees may still feel unsatisfied and adopt negative attitudes. Cynicism, as a negative attitude of employees toward their organization, leads to unwanted outputs such as lower performance or lower loyalties that can appear in every kind of sector. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to determine the effects of personality traits on organizational cynicism in the education sector.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study used the survey method to collect data and survey forms were distributed to teachers from various private schools in Istanbul, Turkey. With the e-mail survey method, the authors received 254 healthy survey forms from teachers. For personality traits, the five-factor model of personality traits that was developed by McCrae and Costa (1987) was preferred and the organizational cynicism model was evaluated with three basic dimensions as based on Brandes's (1997) model.
   Findings - Based on data from 254 teachers of various private schools in Istanbul, interrelationships amongst personality traits and organizational cynicism were tested. On the basis of the partial least-squares method, the authors found that agreeableness had a negative effect on cognitive cynicism and affective cynicism, conscientiousness had a negative effect on cognitive cynicism and affective cynicism, neuroticism had a negative effect on cognitive cynicism and behavior cynicism, and openness to experience had a positive effect on cognitive cynicism and affective cynicism. Thus, it can be said that personality traits of teachers had a significant effect on organizational cynicism as a result of this study.
   Research limitations/implications - This study used two main scales: the scale of McCrae and Costa (1987) for personality traits and the scale of Brandes (1997) for organizational cynicism. The authors adapted both the scales for Turkish culture and the education sector that the results can be considered valid for only this study.
   Originality/value - This study shows a significant effect of personality traits on cynicism in the education sector and thus can be considered to be useful for future studies.

AB  - This research investigates the novel link between consumers' support for underdog brands and their ethical expectations of such brands and finds that the underdog brand positioning may not always be beneficial. Rather, we argue that the identification-based supporting motivation for underdog brands may backfire when the accompanying specific moral expectation is not satisfied. Study 1 demonstrates that the underdog brand falls into an ethical trap in which consumers judge the brand more harshly when ethical transgressions are committed. In Study 2, the psychological underlying mechanism for this ethical underdog trap effect is proved to be perceived betrayal. In Study 3, a boundary condition, community-related (vs. autonomy-related) transgressions, is explored. In Study 4, the three types of transgressions (autonomy, community, and functional) and the mediating effects of perceived betrayal are tested in integrated research design. Finally, theoretical and managerial implications are discussed, followed by conclusions.

TI  - Positive Aging: The Experience of Happiness among Pakistani Older Adults
T2  - ANNALS OF KING EDWARD MEDICAL UNIVERSITY LAHORE PAKISTAN

KW  - interpretative phenomenological analysis
KW  - wellbeing
KW  - positive psychiatry
AB  - Background: This paper reflects and brings together the interests of positive psychiatry and positive gerontology, which are emerging fields that emphasize the promotion of health and positive mental traits rather than a focus on illness alone.
   Objective: To explore the experience of happiness among older individuals and the factors that lead to happiness for them.
   Method: The study used a mixed methods research design. Within the framework of Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), semi structured interviews were conducted with 10 community residing older adults (5 men and 5 women) recruited from Lahore. Themes were derived from the interview transcripts. The top themes from the qualitative study were then taken and measured as variables in a survey, taking a purposive sample of 300 older adults.
   Results: The qualitative study yielded seven themes dealing with the sources of happiness and unhappiness for the sample. These included children as central, being at the giving end, connection with the Divine, engrossed or up and about, the human connection, negative attitudes of people and health and mobility. The experiential themes were happiness as a surge of energy versus stillness and peace, gratitude as nested within happiness and happiness as an inner versus outward experience. The survey revealed that the top three themes, titled Children Associated Factors, Altruism, and Religion and Spirituality, were significantly positively correlated with happiness.
   Conclusion: This study has thrown light on the experience of happiness among older adults and the factors which contribute to their happiness level. The older persons' perspective needs to be taken into account to shape and inform practice and policy geared toward enhancing wellbeing in old age.

AB  - Background: Many institutions have conducted research on the subject of bullying. The literature includes many studies of the effects of widespread bullying among primary and secondary school students. Bullying against hospital nurses and also bullying against university students are well-known and frequently discussed research topics. Yet, the exposure of nursing students to bullying has not been sufficiently explored, and few studies have focused on the issue of bullying against nursing students.
   Purpose: The aim of this study is to examine bullying against nursing students, including the rate of bullying, types of bullying, and responses to the negative effects of bullying.
   Methods: This study was conducted on 202 nursing students (including sophomores, juniors, and seniors) during the 2013-2014 academic year. The participation rate was 88.5%. The Negative Attitudes Scale was used to collect data, and descriptive statistics were used in data analysis.
   Results: Participants were evenly distributed between women (49.5%) and men (50.5%). The median age of participants was 21.58 +/- 2.28 years; the frequency of bullying was 78.1%. The types of bullying were pejorative statements about the nursing profession (11.3%); low grades used as a form of punishment (9.9%); work, homework, and job rotation used as punishment in lieu of training (9.4%); impossible workloads (9.0%); and the spreading of rumors and gossip (7%).
   Conclusions/Implications for Practice: This study indicates that the participants were exposed to high levels of bullying. As exposure to bullying negatively affects the job attitudes of nursing students, further studies are necessary to develop strategies to prevent horizontal bullying.

AB  - Intergroup relations research has largely focused on relations between members of dominant groups and members of disadvantaged groups. The small body of work examining intraminority intergroup relations, or relations between members of different disadvantaged groups, reveals that salient experiences of ingroup discrimination promote positive relations between groups that share a dimension of identity (e.g., 2 different racial minority groups) and negative relations between groups that do not share a dimension of identity (e.g., a racial minority group and a sexual minority group). In the present work, we propose that shared experiences of discrimination between groups that do not share an identity dimension can be used as a lever to facilitate positive intraminority intergroup relations. Five experiments examining relations among 4 different disadvantaged groups supported this hypothesis. Both blatant (Experiments 1 and 3) and subtle (Experiments 2, 3, and 4) connections to shared experiences of discrimination, or inducing a similarity-seeking mindset in the context of discrimination faced by one's ingroup (Experiment 5), increased support for policies benefiting the outgroup (Experiments 1, 2, and 4) and reduced intergroup bias (Experiments 3, 4, and 5). Taken together, these experiments provide converging evidence that highlighting shared experiences of discrimination can improve intergroup outcomes between stigmatized groups across dimensions of social identity. Implications of these findings for intraminority intergroup relations are discussed.

AB  - Individuals with obesity often report experiencing prejudice and discrimination due to their weight. Past research on obesity bias reduction strategies have yielded mixed results. The present study investigated the effectiveness of manipulating information about weight controllability in reducing obesity bias. Participants (N = 350) were randomly assigned into one of three conditions: counterstereotypic, stereotypic, or control. Each condition consisted of four short vignettes. The counterstereotypic condition provided an uncontrollable explanation of obesity (e.g., genetics) in each vignette describing a person with obesity, while the stereotypic condition emphasized lifestyle choices as the main cause of obesity. The control condition included a vignette in which weight was not addressed. Participants completed questionnaires about weight controllability and obesity bias pre- and post-exposure. There was a significant interaction between time and condition on beliefs about weight controllability and obesity bias. Participants in the counterstereotypic condition increased in belief about the uncontrollability of weight and decreased in obesity bias, while participants in the stereotypic condition decreased in belief about the uncontrollability of weight and increased in obesity bias. Obesity bias reduction strategies that utilize information about weight controllability can be effective. However, perpetuating stereotypic causes of obesity can worsen the problem.

AB  - The researcher examined the experiences of Black British female managers (BBFM) who worked for Children and Young People's Services (CYPS) operating in the UK. The following research questions guided this study: How do Black British female managers experience racial microaggressions and how do they cope with it? Purposive and theoretical sampling were used to recruit 10 BBFM who worked for CYPS and who had similar demographic characteristics (i.e., racial/ethnic background and managerial experience). Interview transcripts were analyzed using constructivist grounded theory (Charmaz, 2006a). Over 200 codes were identified and extracted from individual interview transcripts. Organizing the codes into categories resulted in five themes that highlighted the challenging practices that BBFM perceived thwarted their careers (i.e., The Organizational Culture, On the Outside Looking In, Stereotype Threat, Prejudice, and Discrimination and Institutional Racism and Espoused Practice vs. Reality), and one theme that described their coping strategies (i.e., The Silent Catastrophe). Although the study is centered on a multisectorial sample, two main conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, gendered racism curtails the career development of BBFM in ways that are not experienced by their White counterparts. Second, BBFM perceive that their experiences in CYPS was fundamentally negatively disproportionate and aversive. The implication is that CYPS leaders must give racial and gender equality, diversity and inclusion greater priority.

AB  - This article presents the findings from a case study, exploring the factors that support and impede implementation of evidence-based practice (EBP) in a Dutch social work organisation that has recently committed to EBP. Qualitative data were gathered from semi-structured interviews with ten staff members and twelve social workers (service providers for adults and families). The organisational model for EBP implementation, recently developed by Plath, was used to examine how EBP was implemented and the factors that support and impede it. Findings revealed that EBP occurs predominantly at the organisational level. Research & Development (R&D) staff take responsibility for the key steps of gathering, appraising and translating research insights into practice activities, whilst social workers are primarily involved in implementing interventions. R&D is also involved in the internal evaluation of interventions in order to support ongoing practice development. Several factors affecting EBP implementation and facilitative strategies have been identified. Most of these are congruent with the organisational model for EBP implementation, with the exception of two impacting factors (negative attitudes about EBP and an organisational culture that values and encourages innovation and learning) and one facilitative strategy (research partnerships). These findings were used to develop the model further.

AB  - Background: Knowledge, attitudes and practices are basic foundations of prevention and control of Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) disease. The aim of this study was to assess Human Immune Virus (HIV)/AIDS knowledge, attitudes and practices and factors associated among women at reproductive age in South Sudan. Methods: This study was a secondary data analysis based on the South Sudan multiple indictor cluster survey (MICS)of 2010 for South Sudan, data from 9069 women of 15-49 years were used. Descriptive statistics, chi-square and binary Logistic regression were used to assess factors associated with practices and then more analysis was performed to assess factors associated with knowledge and attitudes. Results: Nearly half (46.0%) of respondents had never ever heard about AIDS disease, and misconception about transmission routes were reported. Majority of respondents were having low level of HIV/AIDS knowledge (63.1%) and negative attitude (72.4%), and risky sexual behavior (96.3%). Factors associated with practices were residence area, education level, wealth index, and attitudes. Participants who live in urban were 1.6 time likely to have safe practices more than who live in rural (OR = 1.6). Those who attended secondary school were 4.4 time likely to have safe practices (OR = 4.4), and who were at richest wealth index level were 1.9 time likely to practice safe practices than who had poorest wealth index (OR = 1.9). Participants with positive attitudes were 1.8 time likely to have safe practice more than who have negative attitudes (OR =1.8). Factors associated with knowledge were; residence area, education, wealth index and attitudes. Respondents who were living in urban area (OR=1.3), attended school (OR= 1.3), having wealth index richest level (OR = 1.5) and positive attitudes (1.5) were more likely to have correct information about HIV/AIDS transmission routes and prevention methods. P-value <.01. Attitudes associated with residence area (OR = 1.5), education (OR =3.1), wealth index (OR = 2.5), and knowledge (OR = 1.5). Participants who live in urban, attended school, having wealth index richest level, and moderate/high HIV/AIDS knowledge level were likely to have positive attitudes toward people living with HIV. Conclusion: Majority of study group were having low knowledge of HIV/AIDS, and negative attitude and risky practices. Therefore, reinforcement and expanding of HIV/AIDS prevention and control policies are needed at community level.

AB  - Background: Positive parental attitudes towards infant feeding are an important component in child nutritional health. Previous studies have found that participants in the Special Supplemental Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Program have lower breastfeeding rates and attitudes that do not contribute towards healthy infant feeding in spite of breastfeeding and nutrition education programs targeting WIC participants. The objective of this study was to assess the frequency of exclusive breastfeeding in the early postpartum period and maternal attitudes towards breastfeeding in a population of mothers at two San Francisco hospitals and in relation to WIC participation status.
   Methods: We interviewed women who had recently delivered a healthy newborn using a structured interview.
   Results: A high percentage (79.8%) of our sample was exclusively breastfeeding at 1-4 days postpartum. We did not find any significant differences in rates of formula or mixed feeding by WIC participant status. Independent risk factors for mixed or formula feeding at 1-3 days postpartum included Asian/Pacific Islander ethnicity (odds ratio [OR] 2.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.17-7.19). Being a college graduate was associated with a decreased risk of formula/mixed feeding (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.10-0.79). We also found that thinking breastfeeding was physically painful and uncomfortable was independently associated with not breastfeeding (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.06-1.89).
   Conclusions: Future studies should be conducted with Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders to better understand the lower rates of exclusive breastfeeding in this population and should address negative attitudes towards breastfeeding such as the idea that breastfeeding is painful or uncomfortable.

AB  - We have shown by multiple regression analyses that partner support (as an external source of support) and ego-resiliency (as a personality trait and internal source of support) are significant factors contributing to pregnant women's satisfaction with many different domains of psychological well-being (PWB), such as positive relations with others, self-acceptance, and environmental mastery, facilitating better psychological adaptation to pregnancy and motherhood. Type of pregnancy (high-risk or low-risk) is important for two areas of PWB of pregnant women, namely positive relations with others and self-acceptance. The attitudes towards maternity and pregnancy are weaker predictor than ego-resiliency and partner support and they are significant only for one PWB dimension - autonomy. Positive or negative attitudes towards motherhood and the unborn child depend on the education level. They are less stable factors than ego-resiliency. Empirical evidence is found for the moderating role of the pregnancy type (low- vs. high-risk) in the relationships between support from partner and two dimensions of PWB: positive relations with others and purpose in life. The received partner support helps women in high-risk pregnancy with positive psychological functioning, especially in maintaining the belief that their life is purposeful and in sustaining quality relationships with others.

AB  - There is an animated debate in popular media about whether or not photography should be allowed in art museums. However, there is limited research that examines how visitors themselves feel about visitor photography and the reasons why they choose to take (or not take) photographs in museums. This research, conducted at the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC, uses semistructured, in-depth interviews and photo elicitation with 40 adults to examine visitors' attitudes to using photography inside art museums and their motivations for doing so. The research results suggest that visitors with positive attitudes towards visitor photography see photographic devices as tools that enhance certain aspects of the museum experience, promote further education, and provide entry points to exhibitions and a more interactive, personal experience. Those with negative attitudes see photographic devices as mediating and distracting lenses that have a detrimental effect on intimate experiences with artworks. Many of the participants with negative attitudes still use photographic devices because they believe that the risk of diminishing art experiences in the museum is worth taking, considering the potential uses of photography. The six main motivations for taking photographs in museums are (a) to aid memory, (b) to share, (c) for further research, (d) to inspire, (e) as building material for self-identity, and (f) as an art form in its own right.

AB  - Objectives: The study aims to determine the stigmatizing attitudes, beliefs, and actions of women towards abortion in rural and conservative areas where fertility is high.
   Methods: The research is cross-sectional. It was carried out in Mus State Hospital between 28 March-28 April 2022. The sample of the study consisted of 499 women. Introductory information form and stigmatizing attitudes, beliefs, and actions scale towards abortion were used as data collection tools.
   Findings: The participants' mean score of stigmatizing attitudes, beliefs, and actions towards abortion scale 69.5, negative stereotypes 28.3, discrimination and exclusion 29.1, and fear of contagion sub-dimension 11.9. The mean score of the scale was found to be significantly higher in women who are single, between 20-35 ages, live in the city center and nuclear family, have an undergraduate or above education level, work (p<0.05). There was a negative correlation between the scale mean score of women and the number of pregnancies, births, living children; and a positive correlation between the scale mean score and the number of abortions (p<0.05).
   Conclusions: It was found out that stigmatizing and negative attitudes, beliefs, and actions towards abortion are high among women in rural regions with high fertility.

AB  - Due to recent intensification in international mobility in Europe, its citizens are exposed to a much wider range of lifestyles and competing attitudes towards difference. Individuals are, therefore, increasingly likely to encounter strangers' and are, therefore, required to negotiate discontinuities and contradictions between the values that are transmitted through different sites. In response, the article explores the concept of the stranger' through original data collected in the UK and Poland. The article highlights that the construction of who is a stranger depends on national historical contexts, core values and related visions of the society. The UK and Poland have very different histories and experiences with social diversity, impacting on the ways in which individuals negotiate strange encounters. In both countries, the stranger' is often seen in a negative way and in relation to the minority groups that are perceived to be visibly different, distinct or unknown' in contemporary times. In Poland, this is now largely articulated through sexual prejudice (homophobia), whilst in the UK, attitudes towards the stranger' are largely conveyed through religious prejudice (Islamophobia). As such, the article offers a means of understanding how encounters with difference produce' strangers in different contexts.

AB  - This study focuses on the process of the integration of Arab Muslim Israelis suffering from mental disorders into the normative community, addressing perspectives of both people with mental disorders and the community. This qualitative-constructivist study seeks to understand the dynamics of face-to-face meetings by highlighting the participants' points of view. The main themes of the findings included stereotypes and prejudices, gender discrimination, and the effect of face-to-face meetings on integration of people with mental disorders (PMD) into the community. The findings support former studies about the integration of PMD into the normative community, but add a unique finding that females suffer from double discrimination: both as women in a conservative society and as PMD. The study findings indicate a perception of lack of self-efficacy of PMD as a key barrier preventing integration into the community, which also prevents community members and counselors from accepting them or treating them as equals. We recommend on a social marketing campaign to be undertaken with the Arab Muslim community to refute stigmas and prejudices, particulary with double gender discrimination suffered by women with mental disorders in the Muslim community and training of community center counselors who have contact with the PMD population.

AB  - Background: In China, the Compulsory Detoxification Centres are the main response for people who use illegal drugs. Due to high relapse rates among people released from the Compulsory Detoxification Centres, it is likely that they may seek medical help, including Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) services, at some point. Therefore, better understanding of the attitudes and beliefs of people in the Compulsory Detoxification Centres can help to provide more adequate response to opioid dependence.
   Methods: In total, 329 detained heroin users and 112 active MMT clients were recruited from a local Compulsory Detoxification Centre and MMT clinic, respectively. The survey contained specific questions relating to attitudes and beliefs regarding MMT.
   Results: Participants at the Compulsory Detoxification Centre and the MMT clinic expressed different opinions, regarding positive and negative attitudes and beliefs towards MMT. In addition, participants from both sites hold certain negative attitudes and beliefs about methadone despite their acknowledgement of the positive effects of MMT. Finally, participants at the Compulsory Detoxification Centre and the MMT clinic reported distinctive treatment preferences, with the former preferring community-based treatment and the latter MMT.
   Conclusions: Developing targeted education about MMT for people at the Compulsory Detoxification Centres could help improve access to accurate and evidence-based health and treatment information. The study may also help providers understand and adjust services needed for target population in the future.

AB  - Novel medical technologies, like large-panel genomic tumor testing (GTT), offer great promise but also substantial uncertainty regarding their clinical value and appropriate use. The goal of this study was to understand how clinicians' perceived uncertainty about GTT, and uncertainty tolerance (UT), a construct that describes trait-level differences in individuals' responses to uncertainty, influence attitudes and self-efficacy regarding GTT. Community-based oncologists participating in a study of large-panel GTT completed surveys assessing their perceptions of uncertainty about GTT, and their attitudes and self-efficacy regarding GTT. Multivariable regression analyses examined the relationship between oncologists' perceived uncertainty of GTT and their GTT-related attitudes and self-efficacy, and the potential moderating effect of individual differences in UT. Fifty-seven oncologists completed surveys. Greater perceived uncertainty about GTT was associated with more negative attitudes towards it. This association was moderated by UT, such that lower UT was associated with a stronger negative relationship between perceived uncertainty and attitudes. That is, oncologists who perceive GTT as uncertain, tended to have more negative attitudes, particularly if they were low in the trait of uncertainty tolerance. More research is warranted to understand how uncertainty and uncertainty tolerance influence clinicians' responses to GTT and other novel medical interventions.

AB  - Medicine involves specific practical expertise as well as more general context-independent medical knowledge. This raises the question, what is the nature of the expertise involved? Is there a model of clinical judgement or understanding that can accommodate both elements? This paper begins with a summary of a published account of the kinds of situation-specific skill found in anaesthesia. It authors claim that such skills are often neglected because of a prejudice in favour of the 'technical rationality' exemplified in evidence-based medicine but they do not themselves offer a general account of the relation of practical expertise and general medical knowledge. The philosopher Hubert Dreyfus provides one model of the relation of general knowledge to situation-specific skilled coping. He claims that the former logically depends on the latter and provides two arguments, which I articulate in the second section, for this. But he mars those arguments by building in the further assumption that such situation-specific responses must be understood as concept-free and thus mindless. That assumption is held in place by three arguments all of which I criticize in the next section to give a unified account of clinical judgement as both practical and conceptually structured and thus justified in the face of a prejudice in favour of 'technical rationality'.

AB  - The aim of this quantitative study was to determine the attitudes of Australian nursing students towards caring for people with HIV/AIDS. This research study was conducted among second year undergraduate nursing students at a university in South Australia, during August 2007. The survey tool consisted of six demographic questions and the AIDS Attitude Scale. This questionnaire was completed by 396 students, giving a response rate of 94.7%. The vast majority (95.7%) of students participating in this study demonstrated very positive attitudes towards caring for people with HIV/AIDS and only 4.3% demonstrated negative attitudes. No statistically significant differences were found in attitude score based on participants' age, gender, previous HIV/AIDS education, previous nursing experience or previous experience of caring for someone with HIV/AIDS. A statistically significant difference in AIDS attitude score was found in relation to participants' country/region of citizenship, with nursing students from China, East Asia, South East Asia, and Central Asia and Middle East having more negative attitudes than students from other countries/regions. As an increasing number of nursing students have been recruited to Australia from these countries/regions, nurse educators need to be aware of such differences when planning and delivering HIV/AIDS educational programs in tertiary institutions.

AB  - This research aims to examine what motivates "white" people working to bring more racial justice to South Africa through education to become involved in this work. Using theories of narrative identity and social action, as well as drawing on previous studies of white identity in South Africa and the USA, this qualitative study explores the narratives of white racial justice activists from a South African perspective. The analysis revealed three large narratives that guided the sense of self of participants. The three big stories are as follows: "People Are People", "Following God", and "Quality Education for All", which provided the underlying framework for the motivations and moral action of participants. These narratives highlight a move away from overt prejudice and is a sincere attempt to positively engage with the "new South Africa", however by not engaging with race at all, it could be viewed as avoiding the guilt of continued racial privilege.

AB  - Today's globalized environment exposes people to culture mixing-mixing of iconic symbols of different cultures in the same space at the same time. Findings on individuals' exposure to culture mixing provide evidence for both exclusionary and inclusionary responses. In this article, we focus on the growing phenomenon of culture mixing of global and local symbols and artifacts. We generate a conceptual model to identify who is likely to respond in what way to the mixed cultural environment and why. To answer these questions, we build on the global acculturation model, which aims to explain individuals' adaptation to the global environment by considering the relative strength of their local and global identities. We extend this model by considering not only the two entities' relative strength but also their balance-the degree of symmetry between the identities' strength. We propose that individuals with dominant (unbalanced) identity types (global or local) will exhibit negative and exclusionary responses to culture mixing, whereas individuals with balanced identity types (glocal or marginal) will exhibit positive and inclusionary responses to culture mixing. We also incorporate the concept of bicultural identity integration (BII) to suggest that individuals with high identification with both cultures (glocals) and with high BII will exhibit more inclusive responses than glocals with low BII. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Are there mechanisms by which the advantaged can see the perspectives of the disadvantaged? If advantaged individuals have prolonged engagement with disadvantaged populations and confront issues of inequality through national service, do they see the world more through the lens of the poor? We explore this question by examining Teach For America (TFA), as TFA is a prominent national service program that integrates top college graduates into low-income communities for two years and employs a selection model that allows for causal inference. A regression discontinuity approach, utilizing an original survey of over 32,000 TFA applicants and TFA's selection data for the 2007-2015 application cycles, reveals that extended intergroup contact in a service context causes advantaged Americans to adopt beliefs that are closer to those of disadvantaged Americans. These findings have broad implications for our understanding of the impact of intergroup contact on perceptions of social justice and prejudice reduction.

AB  - The declining interest in foreign languages in English-speaking countries has been attributed to negative societal attitudes and specific pupil attitudes and perceptions. While various initiatives have aimed to encourage language study, little research has systematically documented the relationship among perceptions, attitudes, and actually opting to study a language (henceforth, uptake). This article reports on an experiment involving 604 13/14-year-old pupils in 3 secondary schools in England that tested whether perceived relevance of languages can be improved through 2 different interventions (a panel discussion with external speakers versus a lesson with an external tutor) and whether pupil perceptions and attitudes can be linked explicitly to foreign language uptake at an optional level. Findings show that only pupils who participated in the panel discussion subsequently reported more positive attitudes and higher personal relevance of languages, though participating in either intervention may have contributed to higher uptake compared to a nonactive control group. Boys appeared to have generally more negative attitudes toward both language learning and advocacy than girls. Declared intentions to study or drop a language did not align with final decisions for one quarter of the pupils. Critically, perceptions of language lessons (French, German, or Spanish) and attitudes to languages were reliable predictors of uptake, though the strongest predictor was whether pupils considered languages to be important for themselves. Perceived wider importance of languages was not, in itself, a sufficient incentive.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of three knowledge-transfer intervention trial types (postal, group, one-to-one) to promote best practice to treat sheep with footrot. Further aims were to investigate whether farmer behaviour (i.e. management of lameness) before the trial was associated with uptake of best practice and whether the benefits of best practice framed positively or negatively influenced change in behaviour. The intervention was a message developed from evidence and expert opinion. It was entitled "Six steps to sound sheep" and promoted (1) catch sheep within three days of becoming lame, (2) inspect feet without foot trimming, (3) correctly diagnose the cause, (4) treat sheep lame with footrot or interdigital dermatitis with antibiotic injection and spray without foot trimming, (5) record the identity of treated sheep, (6) cull repeatedly lame sheep. In 2013, 4000 randomly-selected English sheep farmers were sent a questionnaire, those who responded were recruited to the postal (1081 farmers) or one-to-one intervention (32 farmers) trials. A random sample of 400 farmers were invited to join the group trial; 78 farmers participated. A follow-up questionnaire was sent to all participants in summer 2014. There were 72%, 65% and 91% useable responses for the postal, group and one-to-one trials respectively. In both 2013 and 2014, the prevalence of lameness was lower in flocks managed by LC1 farmers than LC2 and LC3 farmers. Between 2013 and 2014, the reduction in geometric mean (95% CI) period prevalence of lameness, proportional between flock reduction in lameness and within flock reduction in lameness was greatest in the one-to-one (7.6% (7.1-8.2%) to 4.3% (3.6-5.0%), 35%, 72%) followed by the group (4.5% (3.9-5.0%) to 3.1% (2.4-3.7%), 27%, 55%) and then the postal trial (from 3.5% (3.3-3.7%) to 3.2% (3.1-3.4%), 21%, 43%). There was a marginally greater reduction in lameness in farmers using most of Six steps but slow to treat lame sheep pre-trial than those not using Six steps at all. There was no significant effect of message framing. The greatest behavioural change was a reduction in therapeutic and routine foot trimming and the greatest attitude change was an increase in negative attitudes towards foot trimming. We conclude that all three intervention trial approaches were effective to promote best practice to treat sheep with footrot with one-to-one facilitation more effective than group and postal intervention trials. Results suggest that farmers' behaviour change was greater among those practising aspects of the intervention message before the trial began than those not practising any aspect.

AB  - Background: Lack of knowledge about epileptic seizure management and negative attitudes toward children with epilepsy among nursing students may negatively affect the quality of healthcare services they deliver.
   Aim: This study aimed to examine the effect of training given to nursing students using simulation and standard child mannequins on their childhood epileptic seizure management knowledge, skills, and attitudes.
   Methods: Participants (n = 72) were recruited from a Nursing Faculty in Izmir, Turkey. Students were randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups (n = 36 in each). The intervention group received simulation-based training on epilepsy while the control group received standard child mannequin training on epilepsy. One week after the training, the students were asked to demonstrate their epileptic seizure management knowledge and skills on a simulation model or a standard child mannequin. During this process, they were observed and assessed by two independent observers on the basis of a list of epileptic seizure management skills. All participants completed the personal information form, the Epilepsy and Epileptic Seizure Management Knowledge Test, and the Epilepsy Knowledge and Attitude Scale before, and after the training, McNemar's test, repeated measure ANOVA (intravenous), dependent t-test, chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, independent t-test, Pearson's correlation analysis, and Pearson's chi-square test were used to compare the groups. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to evaluate the consistency between observers.
   Results: The epilepsy knowledge scale mean scores of both groups significantly increased after their respective trainings (p < 0.001), but the difference between the groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.829). There was no statistically significant difference between the pre- and posttraining epilepsy attitude scale mean scores of the control group (p = 0.630), however, a statistically significant increase was observed in the epilepsy attitude scale mean score of the intervention group (p = 0.008). In addition, both groups' self-confidence in epileptic seizure management significantly increased after the training (p = 0.000).
   Conclusions: Simulation-based training was beneficial for students insofar as it helped them to develop positive attitudes toward epilepsy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Herek's notion of cultural heterosexism describes an ideology that works implicitly through language, and leads non-heterosexuals to be framed as "others." National statistics in many countries indicate group differences between same-gender and mixed-gender couples in divorce rates, and we used media accounts and individual interpretation of group differences in divorce to operationalize it here. We found qualified support for three hypotheses in two studies. In Study 1, analysis of 412 English-language news articles on divorce indicated that comparative statements overwhelmingly positioned same-gender couples as figure and mixed-gender couples as ground. In Study 2, 88 participants read about how same-gender couples differed from mixed-gender couples, or about how mixed-gender couples differed from same-gender couples in their reasons for dissolving relationships. Results indicated that participants showed higher perceived legitimacy of inequality, higher sexual prejudice, and higher estimates of global divorce rates in the former conditions. Analysis of participants' explanations of group differences in divorce rates indicated that they spontaneously contrasted mixed-gender couples against same-gender couples more of the time. As the media discourse focused on male couples (Study 1) and the effects of linguistic framing was evident only when male couples were described (Study 2), we discuss how these studies, which operationalized and evidenced cultural heterosexism, may point to the emergence of homonormative ideologies that recognized gay men more than lesbians in twenty-first century politics.

AB  - Why do some upper caste respondents view Dalit socio-economic conditions as a consequence of a lack of effort by Dalits, while others see it as a consequence of systematic discrimination and exclusion of Dalits from opportunities across generations? What explains this variation? This forms the central question I explore in this article. Two commonly held explanations for much of the observed upper caste behaviours towards Dalits also explain the divergent opinions held by upper caste respondents on the reasons for current Dalit socio-economic conditions. Using individual level data from the Politics and Society between Elections survey, I find that a negative bias toward Dalits that arises when upper caste respondents perceive themselves as more hardworking than Dalits and a perception of the relatively favourable treatment of Dalits by government officials significantly explain differences in upper caste opinions. Persistent inequalities reinforced by denying the historical burden borne by Dalits over centuries ultimately renders social change meaningless and democratic deepening a pipe dream.

AB  - Background: Research evidence is strong for opiate replacement treatment (ORT). However, public opinion (attitudes) can be at odds with evidence. This study explored the relationships between, attitudes, knowledge of drugs and a range of socio-demographic variables that potentially influence attitude. This is relevant in the current policy arena in which a major shift from harm reduction to, rehabilitation is underway.
   Methods: A cross sectional postal questionnaire survey in Scotland was conducted where the drug, treatment strategy has changed from harm-reduction to recovery-based. A random sample (N = 3000), of the general public, >18 years, and on the electoral register was used. The questionnaire was largely structured with tick box format but included two open questions for qualitative responses. Valuation was measured using the economic willingness-to-pay (WTP) method.
   Results: The response rate was 38.1% (1067/2803). Less than 10% had personal experience of drug, misuse but 16.7% had experience of drug misuse via a friend/acquaintance. Regression modelling revealed more positive attitudes towards drug users in those with personal experience of drug misuse, (p < 0.001), better knowledge of drugs (p = 0.001) and higher income (those earning >50,000 pound per, annum compared to <15K; pound p = 0.01). Over half of respondents were not willing to pay anything for drug treatment indicating they did not value these treatments at all. Respondents were willing-to-pay most for community rehabilitation and least for methadone maintenance treatment. Qualitative analysis of open responses indicated many strong negative attitudes, doubts over the efficacy of methadone and consideration of addiction as self-inflicted. There was ambivalence with respondents weighing up negative feelings towards treatment against societal benefit.
   Conclusions: There is a gap between public attitudes and evidence regarding drug treatment. Findings suggest a way forward might be to develop and evaluate treatment that integrates ORT with a community rehabilitative approach. Evaluation of public engagement/education to improve knowledge of drug treatment effectiveness is recommended. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigated the attitudes toward lesbians and gay men among social work, psychology, medical, and nursing students in Crete, Greece, using Herek's ATLG scale. No respondents held completely heterosexist attitudes; only 1.6% held completely non-heterosexist attitudes. The 44.96 total ATLG score indicates a slightly positive attitude toward lesbians and gay men. Psychology students scored higher than all others on positive attitudes, followed by social work students, medical students, and nursing students. Gender, having lesbian or gay acquaintances or friends, and religiosity were significant factors influencing students' attitudes, while no impact on attitudes due to the effects of higher education could be discerned. Implications for curriculum design and teaching methods are discussed.

AB  - This study investigated the efficacy of a live theater performance intervention for enhancing the attitudes of pre-service rehabilitation students toward people with disabilities. A convenience sample of 54 undergraduate students of Latino/a descent (females = 33 and males = 21), age range 18 - 24 completed a pre-post design attitude change intervention. Data were collected on the students' attitudes toward persons with disabilities, using the scale of attitudes towards disabled persons, and gladness, using a liker scale. Multivariate analysis of covariance was used to analyze the data. Results indicated the live theater performance intervention was more effective in providing positive emotion of gladness and in improving the attitudes of the students towards PWDs compared to simple print media.
