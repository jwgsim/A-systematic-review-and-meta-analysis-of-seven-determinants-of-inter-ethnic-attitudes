AB  - We present an integrative model outlining how the threat and competition-based motives identified in the Dual Process Model of Ideology and Prejudice are linked to the context-specific ideologies of historical negation and symbolic exclusion identified by the Dark Duo Model of post-colonial ideology. Using nationally representative data from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (N = 12,586), we found reasonable support for the integrative model. Social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism were each independently and positively associated with historical negation and symbolic exclusion. These post-colonial ideologies in turn were associated with greater resource-specific policy opposition, and mediated associations between social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism with policy attitudes. The results show that broader ideological motives that maintain inequalities may also act as antecedents to culturally specific ideologies which provide more effective, context-specific means to legitimise inequalities faced by Indigenous groups.

AB  - Some students in Indonesian Pesantren (Islamic Boarding School) reported negative attitudes toward English as lingua Franca due to their environmental background, socio-cultural awareness, and identities. However, there are limited studies conducted in investigating their religious beliefs as the basis of pesantren students' attitudes toward learning English. Thus, this study aimed to investigate Indonesian pesantren students' attitudes toward learning English based on their religious beliefs and practices. The survey method was addressed to 250 respondents from three pesantren in Central Java. The researchers used a close-ended questionnaire adapted from the Attitudes/motivation Test Battery and 12 items focusing on the students' religious beliefs toward English. Besides, semi-structured interviews were conducted to get a deep understanding. This research employed one-way ANOVA and revealed a significant difference of the students' educational background in the pesantren on the mean of L2 attitudes, F = (14.40), Sig. = .000. The qualitative analysis revealed that ethnoreligious background shaped the positive attitudes of pesantren students toward English. Although most English speakers were non-believers, the students believed that learning English does not indicate the equal faith of non-believers and threat their religious identity. Furthermore, the participants claimed that learning English is important and not forbidden by religious teaching. They also thought that learning English can be considered as a kind of worship depending on the learner's intention, such as for communicating Islamic values to non-believers, future education, and improving careers.

AB  - Rabies is a deadly zoonotic disease responsible for almost 60,000 deaths each year, especially in Africa and Asia including Thailand. Dogs are the major reservoirs for rabies virus in these settings. This study thus used the concept of knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) to identify socioeconomic factors that contribute to the differences in the canine rabies occurrences in high and low-risk areas which were classified by a Generalized Additive Model (GAM). Multistage sampling was then applied to designate the study locations and a KAP-based questionnaire was used to retrieve data and relevant perspectives from the respondents. Based on the responses from 476 participants living across four regions of Thailand, we found that the knowledge of the participants was positively correlated with their behaviors but negatively associated with the attitudes. Participants who are male, younger, educated at the level of middle to high school, or raising more dogs are likely to have negative attitudes but good knowledge on rabies prevention and control whereas farmers with lower income had better attitudes regardless of their knowledge. We found that people in a lower socioeconomic status with a lack of knowledge are not willing to pay at a higher vaccine price. Public education is a key to change dog owners' behaviors. Related authorities should constantly educate people on how to prevent and control rabies in their communities. Our findings should be applicable to other countries with similar socioeconomic statuses.

AB  - Influenza vaccination is the most effective method in preventing influenza and its complications. This study's objectives were to investigate the vaccination coverage and frequency and to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward influenza vaccination in Jordan during the year 2012 and the 5 years preceding it. Additionally, it aimed at identifying the barriers and motivations to receive the vaccine and the factors contributing to its uptake. In May 2012, a self-administered cross-sectional survey was distributed to 3,200 adults conveniently selected across Jordan to explore influenza vaccination status, knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward the influenza vaccine. The survey response rate was 98.3%. The overall coverage rate of seasonal influenza vaccination ranged from 9.9% to 27.5%. Results of the univariate analysis revealed that males, participants older than 45 years, business owners, and university students or graduates were more likely to take the vaccine. Healthcare workers (HCW) showed higher rates than non-HCW and those with concomitant chronic diseases were more committed to receive the vaccine. Knowledge about the influenza vaccine is considered high in the Jordanian population. Fear from side effects was the major barrier, while the fear of the virus spread and outbreak was the major reason to receive the vaccine. The coverage rates were low in Jordan compared to other countries. The need for influenza vaccine campaigns and on-going education in Jordan health schools is crucial to increase the rate and remove misconceptions and negative attitudes toward vaccination.

AB  - Eco-feedback has been proved effective in promoting energy-saving behaviors in residential contexts. However, in terms of thermostat settings in the workplace, its effectiveness may be reduced by thermostat-setting habits and low motivation to save energy. To solve these problems, this study proposed and compared two types of interactive feedback integrated with thermostat interfaces: feedback of energy efficiency, and feedback of health level of the current temperature setting. Experiments with simulated thermostat interfaces on 84 office workers in a controlled thermal environment showed that both types of interactive feedback resulted in higher temperature setting and preference than interfaces without feedback. Self-reported data revealed the mechanism of the change: feedback not only transformed users' decision-making style from a habit-driven mode to a deliberate thinking mode, but also induced more positive attitudes towards higher temperatures in setting thermostats. The attitude change was caused by changes in both the belief about importance of related attributes (e.g. comfort not being so important), and in the ratings of temperatures on these attributes (e.g. 27 degrees C being a comfortable temperature). While the two types of feedback did not differ significantly in terms of temperature setting, preference, and attitude change, they acted on different factors underlying thermostat-setting process. These findings demonstrate the power of interactive feedback in promoting energy saving in setting thermostat, and the possibility to save energy with feedback content appears unrelated to energy saving.

AB  - Background With the growing aging population, continual increase of the number of the old, and increase of cancer survival rate, palliative care is being considered a global public health issue. As a core force for the sustainable development of the nursing field, undergraduate nursing students' knowledge about and attitudes toward palliative care will directly affect the quality of care for dying patients in the future.
   Objective: To investigate undergraduate nursing students' knowledge about and attitudes toward palliative care and analyze their influencing factors.
   Methods: This descriptive and cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2016. A total of 1200 Chinese undergraduate nursing students were randomly selected as the survey subjects using stratified sampling method. The revised palliative care quiz for nursing (PCQN) and a self-designed questionnaire were used to measure students' knowledge and attitudes.
   Results: The mean score of the revised PCQN was 16.10 +/- 5.04. Only a few respondents (19.8%) expressed desire to work in palliative care in the future. The findings show that knowledge and school, grade, gender, birthplace, and religious beliefs have statistically significant impacts (P < 0.01). In addition, logistic regression analysis showed that talking about death and caring for dying family members can have a significant influence on students' attitudes (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: At present, Chinese undergraduate nursing students' knowledge about palliative care is minimal with the majority holding negative attitudes. Thus, the development of an effective end-of-life care program for nursing students is critical.

AB  - Background: Pressure ulcers still remain a significant problem in many healthcare settings. Poor knowledge and negative attitudes toward pressure ulcer prevention could undesirably affect preventive care strategies.
   Objective: To assess both knowledge and attitudes among nursing students on Pressure Ulcer Prevention
   Evidence-Based Guidelines.
   Design: A multicenter cross-sectional survey was carried out from December 2012 to August 2013.
   Settings: The study was carried out in seven Italian nursing schools.
   Participants: We involved a convenience sample of nursing students (n = 742)
   Methods: Data were collected using two validated questionnaires to assess students' knowledge and attitudes on pressure ulcer prevention.
   Results: The overall Knowledge and Attitude scores were 51.1% (133/26) and 76.7% (39.9/52), respectively. We found a weak correlation between total Knowledge scores and total Attitude scores (rho = 0.13, p < 0.001). We also observed that nursing students' year of education, training experience and number of department frequented during their clinical placement were significantly related to both the Knowledge and the Attitude total scores (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Nursing students' knowledge on pressure ulcer prevention was relatively low. However, we observed an association between a high level of education/training experience and higher knowledge scores. Most of the participants showed high attitude scores. These results suggest that positive attitudes toward pressure ulcer prevention may contribute to the compliance with the guidelines in clinical practice. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a rare, genetically determined defect in enamel mineralization associated with poor esthetics and dental sensitivity. Because the condition is associated with negative social outcomes, this study evaluated oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL), dental fear, and dental beliefs before and after early prosthetic crown therapy for AI during adolescence.
   Methods: The study included 69 patients with AI, aged 6-25 yr: 33 males and 36 females (mean age 14.5 +/- 4.3); healthy controls (n = 80), patients with cleft lip and palate (CLP; n = 30), and patients with molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH; n = 39). All matched in age and gender, and all but the CLP group insocioeconomic area. Patients completed three questionnaires measuring OHRQoL (OHIP-14), dental fear (CFSS-DS), and dental beliefs (DBS-R). Twenty-six patients with severe AI between ages 9 and 22 yr received crown therapy and completed the questionnaires twice: before and after therapy.
   Results: OHIP-14 scores were significantly higher among patients with AI (7.0 +/- 6.7), MIH (6.8 +/- 7.6) and CLP (13.6 +/- 12.1) than healthy controls (1.4 +/- 2.4) (p < 0.001). After crown therapy, quality of life problems in the 26 patients with severe AI decreased significantly, from 7.8 +/- 6.1 to 3.0 +/- 4.8 (p < 0.001). Early prosthetic therapy did not increase dental fear or negative attitudes toward dental treatment.
   Conclusions: OHRQoL increased after early crown therapy in patients with severe AI. Therapy did not increase dental fear or negative attitudes toward dental treatment.

AB  - Research indicates that mental health and medical professionals often hold negative views of overweight or obese people. Little is known about weight prejudice among social work students. In order to address this gap in the literature, this study examines the attitudes of Bachelor of social work and Master of social work students (n = 250) toward persons who are overweight and/or obese. Consistent with the literature, findings indicate generally those with higher body mass index scores are more likely to believe that obesity is beyond their control. Further, although age was correlated with Beliefs About Obese People scores, it was not a significant predictor. Implications for social work social justice and cultural competency curriculum are discussed.

AB  - Aim This study was conducted to discover the organisational and managerial challenges of nurses recovered from COVID-19. Background Nurses, who are at the front line of fighting against COVID-19, face numerous organisational and managerial challenges that impose a burden on their already heavy burden of infection. Working in challenging situations can affect the quality of nursing care. Methods This qualitative study was conducted through an interpretive phenomenological approach. To collect the data, 18 semistructured interviews were held with 15 recovered nurses, which were then analysed using van Manen's method. Results The data analysis led to the extraction of four themes: nurses as victims of organisational prejudice, a profession surrounded by problems, insufficient sources for dealing with COVID-19 and post-COVID-19 development. Conclusion This study showed the organisational and managerial challenges of recovered nurses from COVID-19. Although these nurses had positive experiences, they needed eliminating organisational prejudice, minimizing concerns and sufficient resources to deal with the crisis. Implications for nursing management It is believed that these results can be used as a guide to nurse managers to improve the experience of recovered nurses from COVID-19 by treating all employees with equal kindness, considering to their problems and minimizing burden by actively providing resources.

AB  - Objective:
   We aimed to investigate the relationships between use of media to obtain information on radiation and radiation anxiety among community residents in Fukushima, 5.5 years after the nuclear power plant accident.
   Methods:
   A questionnaire survey was administered between August and October 2016 to 2000 randomly sampled residents in Fukushima prefecture. Radiation anxiety toward health and regarding discrimination and prejudice were assessed with 4- and 3-item scales, respectively. Participants nominated their most-used media for acquiring information on radiation by choosing up to 3 sources from 12 information sources listed (eg, local newspaper, TV news, websites, social networking sites [SNS], local government newsletter, word of mouth). We investigated associations of most-used media types and radiation anxiety, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and anxiety regarding radiation's health effects immediately after the accident, using multivariate linear regression analyses.
   Results:
   Valid responses were obtained from 790 (39.5%) residents. Acquiring information about radiation by word of mouth was related to higher radiation anxiety toward health. Regarding radiation anxiety concerning discrimination and prejudice, SNS use was related to higher anxiety, whereas acquiring information through Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK) TV news was related to lower anxiety.
   Conclusions:
   Interpersonal interactions rather than gaining information from media - characterized by unidirectional information exchange - may increase radiation anxiety.

AB  - The current study investigated the extent to which foreign-born university professors teaching at American universities focus on being possible targets of stereotypes (stigma consciousness associated with being foreign born) and how this concern may affect their experiences. A sample of 162 foreign-born faculty members employed at 12 East Coast U.S. universities completed a series of online questionnaires to assess stigma consciousness, self-esteem, perceptions of rejection, loneliness, well-being, self-perceived teaching effectiveness, and feelings toward the university. Stigma consciousness about being foreign born predicted loneliness and negative feelings toward the university via the mediating variable of perceived rejection. There was also an unexpected pathway between stigma consciousness and perceptions of teaching effectiveness: Stigma consciousness was positively related to the perception of rejection, and, in turn, rejection was positively related to self-perceived teaching effectiveness. The results document the importance of stigma consciousness about being foreign born on the psychological adjustment and work-related perceptions of university faculty.

KW  - PREJUDICE
AB  - This article traces the biography of an Afro-German woman born during the 1920s Rhineland occupation to examine the peculiarities of the black German diaspora, as well as potential connections between these peculiarities and larger trends in the history of German colonialism and racism. "Erika Diekmann" was born inWorms in 1920. Her mother was a German citizen, her father a Senegalese French soldier. Separated from her birth mother at a young age, Erika spent her youth and early adulthood in a school for Christian Arab girls in Jerusalem run by the Protestant order of the Kaiserswerth Deaconesses (Kaiserswerther Diakonissen). After World War II, Erika returned to West Germany, but in 1957, she emigrated to the United States, along with her (white) German husband and four children. Erika's story offers unique opportunities for studying Afro-German women's active strategies of making Germany their "home." It underlines the complicated role of conventional female gender prescriptions in processes of interracial family-building. The centrality of religion to Erika's social relationships significantly enhances our understanding of the complexity of German attitudes toward national belonging and race during the first half of the twentieth century.

TI  - REPARATIONS FOR CENTRAL AMERICAN REFUGEES
T2  - DENVER LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - In the midst of vicious and unrelenting attacks on Central American asylum seekers in the United States, this Article seeks to understand historic and present-day patterns of animus and discrimination facing this group of refugees, and to propose solutions. This Article begins by examining decades of prejudice faced by Central American asylum seekers, as well as attempts to right those wrongs through litigation, legislation, and the creation of Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Next, this Article identifies the predominant push and pull factors driving Central American refugees north-and the U.S. role in creating them. The Article then lays out the impact of this Administration's systemic attacks on Central American asylum seekers, in particular, through family separation and zero-tolerance, the asylum ban and Matter of A-B-, and the framework in which refugees should be permitted to seek protection under current U.S. law. Finally, this Article evaluates several potential solutions including humanitarian asylum, an expansion of TPS, and litigation. Ultimately, this Article concludes that, in light of decades of abuse and prejudice directed at this class of refugees, the only adequate means of reparation is congressional legislation that would carve out special, tailored protections for this vulnerable group.

AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated that simply imagining a positive interaction with an outgroup member reduces prejudice, especially if the outgroup member is typical of the whole outgroup. In this research, We tested how a multicultural vs. colorblind mindset might impact the efficacy of imagined contact with a typical or atypical outgroup member. Specifically, we tested the interactive effects between ideologies (multiculturalism vs. colorblindness) and the typicality of the outgroup member (typical vs. atypical) in the imagined encounter. Results revealed that participants exposed to the multicultural ideology who imagined an encounter with an atypical outgroup member expressed fewer positive perceptions (warmth and competence) toward both primary and secondary outgroups compared with respondents exposed to the multicultural ideology who imagined an interaction with a typical outgroup member, and compared with respondents exposed to a colorblind ideology (irrespective of typicality of the outgroup member). The study highlights the importance of considering the interaction between cultural ideologies and typicality during intergroup contact when designing interventions aimed at promoting positive intergroup perceptions.

AB  - Introduction: Men who have sex with men (MSM) in Kenya are at high risk for HIV and may experience prejudiced treatment in health settings due to stigma. An on-line computer-facilitated MSM sensitivity programme was conducted to educate healthcare workers (HCWs) about the health issues and needs of MSM patients.
   Methods: Seventy-four HCWs from 49 ART-providing health facilities in the Kenyan Coast were recruited through purposive sampling to undergo a two-day MSM sensitivity training. We conducted eight focus group discussions (FGDs) with programme participants prior to and three months after completing the training programme. Discussions aimed to characterize HCWs' challenges in serving MSM patients and impacts of programme participation on HCWs' personal attitudes and professional capacities.
   Results: Before participating in the training programme, HCWs described secondary stigma, lack of professional education about MSM, and personal and social prejudices as barriers to serving MSM clients. After completing the programme, HCWs expressed greater acknowledgement of MSM patients in their clinics, endorsed the need to treat MSM patients with high professional standards and demonstrated sophisticated awareness of the social and behavioural risks for HIV among MSM.
   Conclusions: Findings provide support for this approach to improving health services for MSM patients. Further efforts are needed to broaden the reach of this training in other areas, address identified barriers to HCW participation and evaluate programme effects on patient and HCW outcomes using rigorous methodology.

AB  - Many individuals believe that meditation has the capacity to not only alleviate mental-illness but to improve prosociality. This article systematically reviewed and meta-analysed the effects of meditation interventions on prosociality in randomized controlled trials of healthy adults. Five types of social behaviours were identified: compassion, empathy, aggression, connectedness and prejudice. Although we found a moderate increase in prosociality following meditation, further analysis indicated that this effect was qualified by two factors: type of prosociality and methodological quality. Meditation interventions had an effect on compassion and empathy, but not on aggression, connectedness or prejudice. We further found that compassion levels only increased under two conditions: when the teacher in the meditation intervention was a co-author in the published study; and when the study employed a passive (waiting list) control group but not an active one. Contrary to popular beliefs that meditation will lead to prosocial changes, the results of this meta-analysis showed that the effects of meditation on prosociality were qualified by the type of prosociality and methodological quality of the study. We conclude by highlighting a number of biases and theoretical problems that need addressing to improve quality of research in this area.

AB  - Previous research on attitudes toward immigrants has so far focused on composite outcome measures instead of dealing with more specific forms of perceived threat and prejudice. The present article approaches this gap by investigating the antecedents of the perception that immigrants take jobs away from the host-country population. This form of perceived economic competition is a fundamental feature of immigrant-native relations in many countries, and it is embedded in the institution of the labor market. Accordingly, the main interest of this study lies in the influence of two central aspects of labor market policy, employment protection legislation and unemployment benefit level. European Social Survey data are used in multilevel models that include individual-, regional-, and country-level factors. The results indicate that unemployment benefits abate perceived competition, and the impact is strong. This finding is robust against the inclusion of several other policy indicators, including integration policies, welfare regime types, and other structural factors such as unemployment rates and unionization figures. Employment protection affects perceived economic threat only indirectly by mitigating the impact of regional unemployment. Furthermore, it actually increases perceived competition for unemployed persons. These findings challenge the notion that prevention is always better than cure.

AB  - The partisan realignment of the White South, which transformed this region from being solidly Democratic to being the base of the Republican Party, has been the focus of much scholarship. Exactly how it occurred is unclear. Widespread individual-level attitude changes would be contrary to the well-known within-person stability of party identification. However, according to the impressionable-years hypothesis, events that occur during adolescence and early adulthood may have a lasting impact on later political attitudes. This would suggest that cohort replacement may be driving partisan realignment. We test this possibility using data from the American National Election Studies from 1960 to 2008. Consistent with the impressionable-years hypothesis, Southern Whites from the pre-Civil Rights cohort (born before 1936) maintained their Democratic Party identification longer than their younger counterparts. However, all cohorts in the South have changed their partisan attitudes at comparable rates over time, contrary to the impressionable-years hypothesis. These data suggest that the partisan realignment of the South was driven by both cohort replacement and within-cohort attitude change. More targeted case studies of older cohorts living through the civil rights era, and of younger cohorts in the post-Reagan era, yield results generally consistent with the impressionable-years hypothesis. More generally, our findings suggest that very large scale events are required to disrupt the normal continuity of party identification across the life span.

AB  - Aural surgery is a branch of nineteenth-century medicine and surgery providing specialized treatment for ear diseases. During the 1830s, faced with a "popular prejudice" against the curability of deafness as well as intraprofessional rivalries and continuous accusations of quackery, aurists found their surgical authority questioned and their field's value threatened. In an attempt to bolster aural surgery's reputation, in 1841, the aurist John Harrison Curtis (1778-4856) introduced his new diagnostic instrument, the cephaloscope, which could not only improve diagnosis but also provide approaches for regulating aural knowledge, thus strengthening aural surgery's authority. This article examines the motives underlying Curtis's introduction of the cephaloscope and the meanings it held for the occupational group at large.

AB  - Women and families are the fastest growing segment of the homeless population. Negative attitudes of nurses toward homeless women are a major barrier to homeless women seeking health care. This cross-sectional, mixed-methods pilot study, conducted primarily by nurses, tested the Mantram Repetition Program for the first time with 29 homeless women. The Mantram Repetition Program is a spiritually based skills training that teaches mantram (sacred word) repetition as a cost-effective, personalized, portable, and focused strategy for reducing stress and improving well-being. For the cross-sectional, pretest-posttest design portion of the study, the hypothesis that at least half of the homeless women would repeat their mantram at least once a day was supported with 88% of the women repeating their mantram 1 week later. The qualitative portion of this study using phenomenology explored the women's thoughts on mantram week 2. Themes of mantram repetition, mantram benefits, and being cared for emerged. This groundbreaking, interventional, mixed-methods pilot study fills a gap in interventional homeless research.

AB  - The Multi-Axial Gay Men's InventoryMen's Short Version (MAGIMSV) assesses internalized homophobia via 20 items and 3 dimensions. This study extended the psychometric examination of the MAGIMSV. The instrument was administered to 228 ethnically diverse HIV-negative gay men seeking counseling in New York City (mean age = 35, age range = 1670). Following principal axis factoring and parallel analyses, 4 factors emerged and 14 items were retained. The descriptive labels for factors included gay self-assurance and worth, public appearance of homosexuality, and impact of HIV/AIDS on homosexuality. The new, fourth factor was named maladaptive measures to eliminate homosexuality.

AB  - Background: Efforts to explain negative attitudes toward obese people have centered on beliefs about the controllability of body weight, whereas other processes (such as the emotion of disgust) have been largely ignored. This study examined the role of disgust in evaluations of obese people, as well as other social groups (for example smokers, drug addicts, women, homosexuals, politicians).
   Method: In three studies, participants (total N = 524) made ratings of how much they believe that obesity is a matter of personal control, indicated how disgusted they are with obese people, and reported their attitudes toward obese people. In Study 1, participants also made similar ratings (perceptions of control over group membership, disgust, and attitudes) for 15 additional social groups.
   Results: Disgust was the strongest predictor of negative attitudes toward obese people, and disgust fully mediated the association between perceptions of control and attitudes toward obese people. In addition, obese people were rated less favorably, and as more disgusting, than almost all social groups. Across all social groups, perceived control over group membership was positively correlated with disgust ratings, and disgust mediated the link between perceived control and favorability ratings.
   Conclusion: These findings indicate that disgust is an important, yet understudied, component of weight bias. Furthermore, these findings situate representations of obesity in a broader context by establishing similarities with other social groups.

AB  - Background: A high level of evidence exists to suggest that negative attitudes held by clinicians toward persons with sickle cell disease serve as important barriers to the delivery of high quality care to this patient population. Little is known. though. about the characteristics of clinicians that may be predictive of these negative attitudes.
   Methods: During spring and summer 2009, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to test an intervenlion to improve clinician attitudes toward persons with sickle cell disease. Participating clinicians completed questionnaires regarding their demographic characteristics and their attitudes toward sic kle cell patienls. Principal clinician charac teristics of interest included their race, professio nal discipline (nurse/ physic ian), and the amount of their recent exposure to sickle cell patients in pain. Secondary analyses from this trial are presented here.
   Main Findings: Asian clinicians reported more negative allitudes towards these palients than did Black or White clinicians, nurses reported more negative altitudes lhan physicians. and clinicians w ith the greatest levels of recent exposure to sickle cell patients in pain reported more nega tive attitudes than did clinicians with lower levels of recent exposure.
   Conclusions: Our findings could facilitate the development of tailored educational resources needed to improve the quality of care delivered to persons with sickle cell disease, a national priority for sickle cell efforts.

AB  - We examined how people construct their social identities from multiple group memberships-and whether intergroup contact can reduce prejudice by fostering more inclusive social identities. South Indian participants (N = 351) from diverse caste backgrounds viewed 24 identity cards, each representing a person with whom participants shared none, one, two, or all of three group memberships (caste, religion, nationality). Participants judged each person as "us" or "not us," showing whom they included in their ingroup, and whom they excluded. Participants tended to exclude caste and religious minorities, replicating persistent social divides. Bridging these divides, cross-group friendship was associated with more inclusive identities which, in turn, were associated with more positive relations between an advantaged, an intermediate, and a disadvantaged caste group. Negative contact was associated with less inclusive identities. Contact and identity processes, however, did not affect entrenched opposition to (or undermine support for) affirmative action in advantaged and disadvantaged groups.

AB  - Alcohol- and drug addiction tends to evoke disapproval and rejection among people. This study provides insight into the origin of people's negative attitudes towards these people. Corrigan's attribution model is used to examine intentions of the Dutch public to impose restrictions to people who are addicted to alcohol or illicit drugs.
   Data were derived from a cross-sectional survey among a representative panel of the Dutch population (N = 2,793). Path analyses were conducted to test the influence of attribution beliefs, emotional responses and familiarity with addictions on people's intentions to impose restrictions to these people.
   More than half of the respondents agreed with imposing restrictions to someone with an addiction such as excluding from taking public office or forbid to care for children. Corrigan's attribution model was partially applicable to explain people's intentions to impose restrictions, since only a rather small percentage of the variance in people's intentions was explained by the model. The perception of personal responsibility for an addiction and high expectancy of aggressiveness have a positive influence on intentions to impose restrictions. Feelings of anger and fear were also predictors of intentions to impose restrictions.
   The Dutch public showed high intentions to restrict people with an alcohol- or drug addiction which has an extensive impact on their life opportunities. Perceived aggressiveness, feeling of anger and fear, and perceived responsibility were associated with higher intentions to impose restrictions.

AB  - People with disabilities (PWD) have reported that health care workers' negative attitudes are among the most significant barriers to accessing health care services. PWD constitute one quarter of the population, yet the curriculum for PWD is inconsistent. This study describes a curriculum intervention allowing student interaction with a panel of PWD to change nursing student attitudes. Surveys were administered before and after the intervention. Our pilot study did not reveal a significant change in attitudes, which suggests that more exposure to PWD and education may be needed.

AB  - Thirty-four states criminalize HIV in some way, whether by mandating disclosure of one's HIV status to all sexual partners or by deeming the saliva of HIV-positive persons a "deadly weapon." In this paper, we argue that HIV-specific criminal laws are rooted in historical prejudice against HIV-positive persons as a class. While purporting to promote public health goals, these laws instead legally sanction discrimination against a class of persons.

AB  - Background: Postpartum depression affects parents of newborns. Major depression causes cognitive prejudice. Nothing is known about memory impairment in those affected of postpartum depression. This study has a purpose to assess working and short-term memories during the postpartum period in mothers and fathers in the city of Pelotas, RS, Brazil and also to correlate the changes in memory with postpartum depression, sociodemographic factors and possible confounding factors.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study includes families assisted by the public health system. The sample consisted of fathers and mothers of live births, born from March to December 2008. The participants were evaluated during home visits using the Edinburg Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the word span test. The cutoff point for depression in the EPDS scores was >= 13. and the word span scores were evaluated as discrete variables.
   Results: The sample consisted of 395 individuals (222 women and 173 men). The prevalence of depression was 16.2% among mothers and 5.2% among fathers. Depressed individuals performed worse on the memory test.
   Limitations: The number of men evaluated was smaller than that of women. That's a transversal study, so we have the prevalence bias.
   Conclusions: This study shows that postpartum depression affects both men and women, and the symptoms of depression affect the working and short-term memories of affected individuals. Given that this was a larger study than those in the literature, the results emphasize the importance of detecting and treating postpartum depression and helping affected families.

The distilled wisdom of victims of oppression, however, often find expression in indigenous literary forms such as folk songs and narratives. This article examines Exodus 1 as one such narrative reflection on the causes of oppression and the ways that suffering communities and their allies might resist regimes that employ fear, prejudice, and violence to exploit vulnerable populations for political gain.

AB  - People with disabilities often experience the idea that those with disabilities are not, or should not be, sexual beings. This article examines how people with physical disabilities define sexual activity, their levels of sexual satisfaction, group differences in how people define different acts as sexual activities, and the differences in levels of sexual satisfaction. Additionally, this study (N = 450) looks at the correlations between levels of independence in multiple contexts. Levels of independence are also assessed in relationship to severity of disability and sexual satisfaction. Implications for social work and social service practice, education, and policy are discussed.

AB  - We examine the ability of intergroup contact to ameliorate intergroup relationships in an entrepreneurial and developing world context. We provide a decision model of how an entrepreneur chooses to invest time to extend their professional network. The model accommodates two distinct channels and generates alternative predictions based on which is activated by intergroup contact. One is the knowledge of the necessary time investment to forge a network connection with a member of another group, and the second is the preference-driven disutility of that time spent with that individual. We employ randomized experiments to test whether actual and imagined contact effectively reduces prejudice between indigenous Malawian shopkeepers and their Chinese migrant counterparts and test the stability of these changes over time. Actual contact produced differing results. Local Malawians' attitude toward Chinese migrants did not improve, but their willingness to spend time with them did. In contrast, actual contact led to improvement in the Chinese migrants' attitude toward local Malawians but did not increase their willingness to spend time with them. Imagined contact had no impact on Malawians' attitude toward or willingness to spend time with Chinese migrants. These results are consistent with contact activating informational channels more so than preference ones.

AB  - We use an experimental panel study design to investigate the effect of providing "value-neutral" information about genomic science in the form of a short film to a random sample of the British public. We find little evidence of attitude change as a function of information provision. However, our results show that information provision significantly increased dropout from the study amongst less educated respondents. Our findings have implications both for our understanding of the knowledge-attitude relationship in public opinion toward genomic science and for science communication more generally.

AB  - This study explored the views of non-psychiatric medical specialists about people with schizophrenia and depression and examined whether specialists' approach to these clients, and their perception of dangerousness and social distance, differed by disorder. Non-psychiatric medical specialists working in community centers in Italy read either a schizophrenia or depression description and then completed a questionnaire on their views about people with that disorder. The schizophrenia-group (N = 114) was more sure than the depression-group (N = 97) that the patients should be approached differently in outpatient specialized clinics like those where the respondents worked; are incapable of caring for their open health; and are kept at distance by others. Perceived dangerousness did not significantly differ between the two groups. These findings highlight the potential effects of attitudes on medical practice and outline the need to educate non-psychiatric medical specialists on stigma as a strategy to reduce health discrepancies, particularly toward people diagnosed with schizophrenia.

AB  - Police racism and prejudice against minorities are believed to impede law enforcing agencies' ability to equitably perform their job. One factor driving police forces throughout the world to adopt community policing was their will to ameliorate relations with minority groups. In the Israeli case, a survey of 643 police officers and police managers reveals that positive attitudes towards community policing correlate with positive attitudes towards Arab citizens. This article discusses these findings and their implications.

AB  - Objectives To explore junior doctors' knowledge about and experiences of managing patients with medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) and to seek their recommendations for improved future training on this important topic about which they currently receive little education.
   Design Qualitative study using in-depth interviews analysed using the framework method.
   Setting Participants were recruited from three North Thames London hospitals within the UK.
   Participants Twenty-two junior doctors undertaking the UK foundation two-year training programme (FY1/FY2).
   Results The junior doctors interviewed identified a significant gap in their training on the topic of MUS, particularly in relation to their awareness of the topic, the appropriate level of investigations, possible psychological comorbidities, the formulation of suitable explanations for patients' symptoms and longer term management strategies. Many junior doctors expressed feelings of anxiety, frustration and a self-perceived lack of competency in this area, and spoke of over-investigating patients or avoiding patient contact altogether due to the challenging nature of MUS and a difficulty in managing the accompanying uncertainty. They also identified the negative attitudes of some senior clinicians and potential role models towards patients with MUS as a factor contributing to their own attitudes and management choices. Most reported a need for more training during the foundation years, and recommended interactive case-based group discussions with a focus on providing meaningful explanations to patients for their symptoms.
   Conclusions There is an urgent need to improve postgraduate training about the topics of MUS and avoiding over-investigation, as current training does not equip junior doctors with the necessary knowledge and skills to effectively and confidently manage patients in these areas. Training needs to focus on practical skill development to increase clinical knowledge in areas such as delivering suitable explanations, and to incorporate individual management strategies to help junior doctors tolerate the uncertainty associated with MUS.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this research is to understand whether service robots can safeguard servicescapes from deviant consumer behaviour. Using routine activity theory, this research examines whether increasing the perceived humanness of service robots reduces customer intentions to commit deviant consumer behaviour and whether this negative relationship is mediated by perceived empathy and perceived risk of being caught. Design/methodology/approach Five hundred and fifty-three US residents responded to a hypothetical scenario that manipulated the humanness of a service agent (from self-service technology, to robot, to human employee) across seven conditions and measured the likelihood of deviant consumer behaviour, empathy towards the service robot, perceived risk of being caught and punished and negative attitudes towards robots. Findings The results indicate that replacing human service agents with different types of service robots does inadvertently reduce customer perceptions of capable guardianship (i.e. the human element that deters potential offenders from committing crimes) in the servicescape and creates conditions that allow customers to perpetrate more deviant consumer behaviour. Practical implications When investing in technology such as service robots, service providers need to consider the unintended cost of customer misbehaviour (specifically deviant consumer behaviour) in their return-on-investment assessments to optimise their asset investment decisions. Originality/value Moving beyond research on customer adoption and use, this research examines the unintended consequences that might arise when deploying service robots in a technology-infused service environment. Humanised service robots offer more guardianship than self-service technology but do not replace human employees in preventing deviant consumer behaviour, as they remain more capable of deterring customer misbehaviour.

AB  - The insider threat is a significant security concern for Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) organizations. A successful insider act in one of the CNI sectors has potential to damage assets and interrupt the critical services that society depends upon. Existing research suggests that behavioral indicators are often evident prior to an act taking place, but that reporting of such behaviors does not usually happen. The aim of this study was to identify factors that influence employees' intention to intervene when observing behavioral changes associated with insider acts. An online survey with employees within a large Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) energy sector organization (N=55) explored factors including behavioral change type, relationship to the actor, employment status of the actor and actor motivations. Results supported existing research regarding reluctance to report behavioral indicators of attitude change, but also demonstrated that situations with sufficient evidence are more likely to be reported. Factors which inhibited intervention likelihood were relative seniority and perceived motivations of the actor, confidence of confidentiality and clarity of reporting processes. Primary barriers to intervention related to the observer's perceived ability to correctly interpret behavioral indicators and awareness of how to respond. Organizations need to provide training regarding behavioral indictors of insider threats, clear, confidential reporting processes, and a culture where respectful challenge is encouraged.

AB  - Although virtual reality technology is increasingly being used in tourism, its potential as a shopping tool and as an avenue for marketing and selling tourism products and services has not yet been examined. Likewise, very little is known about how exploring holiday packages through virtual reality affects behavioral intention to visit tourist destinations. This study aims to compare the visit intentions evoked and the process of booking holiday travel packages between an immersive virtual reality environment (displayed through Oculus head-mounted glasses) and a traditional web-based 2D platform. A causal model is proposed and tested for both designs. Using a between-subjects experimental design with a sample of 202 individuals, the experiences of two randomly selected groups were observed as they bought holiday tour packages to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The first group made a simulated purchase in an immersive virtual reality environment using a head-mounted device, and the second group made the purchase on a traditional e-commerce website. The findings revealed that the scores given to sense of presence, attitude change, and perceived ease of use were greater among those who made the purchase in the more immersive virtual reality environment. However, the relationships between the variables in the causal model were stronger for the classic website than for the virtual reality setting. Attitude change positively affected intention to visit a destination more in the virtual reality environment.

AB  - The deficit syndrome was proposed over 20 years ago as a separate negative symptom syndrome within schizophrenia with a distinct neurobiological pathophysiology and etiology. Recent research, however, has indicated that psychological factors such as negative attitudes and expectancies are significantly associated with the broad spectrum of negative symptoms. Specifically, defeatist beliefs regarding performance mediate between neurocognitive impairment and both negative symptoms and functional outcome. Additionally, asocial beliefs predict asocial behavior and negative expectancies regarding future pleasure are associated with negative symptoms. The present study explored whether these dysfunctional beliefs and negative expectancies might also be a feature of the deficit syndrome. Based on a validated proxy method, 22 deficit and 72 nondeficit patients (from a pool of 139 negative symptom patients) were identified and received a battery of symptom, neurocognitive, and psychological measures. The deficit group scored significantly worse on measures of negative symptoms, insight, emotion recognition, defeatist attitudes, and asocial beliefs but better on measures of depression, anxiety, and distress than the nondeficit group. Moreover, the deficit group showed a trend for higher scores on self-esteem. Based on these findings, we propose a more comprehensive formulation of deficit schizophrenia, characterized by neurobiological factors and a cluster of psychological attributes that lead to withdrawal and protect the self-esteem. Although the patients have apparently opted-out of participation in normal activities, we suggest that a psychological intervention that targets these negative attitudes might improve their functioning and quality of life.

AB  - Researchers studying a range of psychological phenomena (e.g., theory of mind, emotion, stereotyping and prejudice, interpersonal attraction, etc.) sometimes employ photographs of people as stimuli. In this paper, we introduce the Chicago Face Database, a free resource consisting of 158 high-resolution, standardized photographs of Black and White males and females between the ages of 18 and 40 years and extensive data about these targets. In Study 1, we report pretesting of these faces, which includes both subjective norming data and objective physical measurements of the images included in the database. In Study 2 we surveyed psychology researchers to assess the suitability of these targets for research purposes and explored factors that were associated with researchers' judgments of suitability. Instructions are outlined for those interested in obtaining access to the stimulus set and accompanying ratings and measures.

AB  - Background and objective: Attitudes toward suicide is one of the important determinants for help-seeking behaviors among suicidal population. We hypothesized that older age groups would have more favorable attitudes toward suicide than would younger groups.
   Methods: We conducted a survey of attitudes toward suicide in a nationally representative sample. Attitudes toward suicide were measured with the Korean version of the Suicide Opinion Questionnaire (SOQ). Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to determine the influence of age on attitudes toward suicide after adjusting for other sociodemographic and clinical variables.
   Results: A total of 1200 people in the general public responded to the survey. Older people expressed less favorable attitudes toward suicide than did younger people. According the multiple linear regression analysis, age was the most influential factor with regard to attitudes toward suicide.
   Conclusion: Contrary to our a priori hypothesis, people in the older age groups had more negative attitudes toward suicide than did those in the younger age groups. The results suggest that negative attitudes toward suicide in the general population may interfere with the help-seeking behavior of people at high risk for suicide. Future studies should directly investigate the relationship between attitudes toward suicide and suicide rates.

AB  - Hakbeol refers to one's place in a hierarchical undergraduate pedigree system in South Korea. This qualitative study explored 12 Korean men's experiences with societal prejudices associated with nonprestigious hakbeol status (e.g., attending "lesser-known" universities). Considering the gender role strain paradigm and the Confucian historical context in Korea, this study attempted to illuminate psychological issues stemming from Korean men's emphasis on the value of a prestigious hakbeol status. Participants reported (a) holding both supportive and critical views about the hakbeol system; (b) perceiving an influence of their hakbeol status on fulfilling their filial piety; (c) experiencing unwanted everyday experiences in relation to others, careers, and self-image; and (d) making efforts to cope with barriers related to their hakbeol status. These findings provide psychologists with the language and evidence to address mental health concerns caused by hakbeol-based discrimination and systemic injustice issues. Implications for counseling, training, advocacy, and research are discussed.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to examine the joint effects of product type (hospitality services vs goods) and consumers' need for status (low/Patricians vs high/Parvenus) on consumers' attitude change toward their favorite luxury brands. As an ever increasing number of customers can now afford luxury products, it is important to understand how affluent consumers react to the less affluent mimicking behaviors.
   Design/methodology/approach - In all, 265 luxury consumers with annual household income of more than $100,000 and experiences of luxury consumption in the past three months were recruited. A 2 (product type) x 2 (need for status) factorial design was used to test the hypotheses.
   Findings - This study demonstrates that when faced with mimicking behaviors by less affluent consumers, Parvenus exhibit more negative attitude toward their favorite luxury goods brands than luxury hospitality brands. Conversely, Patricians exhibit similar levels of attitude change across the two types of luxury brands.
   Practical implications - The findings suggest that luxury hospitality companies may find it easier to expand to less affluent markets than their luxury goods counterparts, in particular when the majority of target consumers are Parvenus.
   Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to examine consumers' reactions to mimicking behaviors by the less affluent in the context of luxury hospitality services, and it adds to the knowledge on the joint effects of product type and status seeking on luxury consumption.

AB  - The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) The Real Cost campaign advertisements (ads) have targeted U.S. youth with messages designed to prevent and reduce tobacco use. This study examined exposure to The Real Cost campaign, including ad and slogan recall, and associations with attitudes and risk perceptions among U.S. adolescents. We analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents aged 13 to 17 years (n = 1125) surveyed by phone from October 2014 to June 2015. We assessed aided recall of and attitudes toward four campaign ads and the one slogan. Logistic regression models assessed whether aided recall of The Real Cost ads or slogan was associated with perceived likelihood of serious health consequences of cigarette smoking. Most (88%) adolescents reported seeing or hearing at least one of four ads for The Real Cost, and 54% recalled The Real Cost slogan. The majority of adolescents reported more negative attitudes toward tobacco products after seeing or hearing the ads. Recall of any The Real Cost ad was significantly associated with greater perceptions of serious health consequences of cigarette smoking (Adjusted Odd Ratios (AOR) = 5.58, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.20-25.90). The FDA's The Real Cost campaign has achieved very high reach and is associated with more negative attitudes toward tobacco products and greater risk perceptions of cigarette smoking among U.S. adolescents.

AB  - Aim In this mixed-methods study, we examined client descriptions of counselling outcomes and how they corresponded with a quantitative measure of change (i.e., Outcome Questionnaire-45; OQ-45). Method Using purposeful sampling at a university counselling training centre, we compared 17 clients who had reliably improved, deteriorated or did not change to qualitative outcomes based on post-counselling interviews using the Change Interview protocol. Results Qualitative outcomes included two Central change categories, the first of which included interpersonal, cognitive and behavioural, affective, and attitude changes. The second Central category of outcomes comprised four areas of change that varied by degree of change expressed (i.e., Problem Resolution, Confidence, Happiness and Changes Affirmed by Others). Congruence was not present between OQ-45 and Central 1 changes but was present for three of the four Central 2 changes (Problem Resolution, Happiness and Changes Affirmed by Others), all correlating above .60. Conclusion OQ-45 change scores showed congruence with three qualitative outcomes: degree of expressed improvement in Happiness, Problem resolution and changes noticed by significant others. However, the lack of congruence for Central 1 changes (i.e., Interpersonal, Cognitive and Behavioural, Affective, and Attitude Change) suggests a diverse range of outcomes important to clients that go undetected using the OQ-45. We strongly encourage further mixed design research to better understand how best to appraise clinical improvement.

AB  - Research conducted in Western cultural contexts has discovered that people are more intolerant of moral than demographic diversity, prefer greater social and physical distance from morally dissimilar others, and actively discriminate against those who do not share their moral attitudes. The goal of the current work was to test whether (a) these findings generalize across cultural contexts and (b) similar patterns would emerge with not only social but also political intolerance. Strength of moral conviction associated with participants' most important issue was associated with higher and similar levels of social intolerance of attitudinally dissimilar others in both China and the United States but was only related to political intolerance in China. These results demonstrate that moral mandate effects are not unique to highly individualized cultural contexts and reveal a possible boundary condition on the links between moral conviction and intolerance. Implications are discussed.

AB  - Objective: Our goal was to develop a scale to assess social distance attitudes related to COVID-19. Methods: We performed an online national survey of US adults (n = 1,074) to assess social distance attitudes, COVID-19 related beliefs and behaviors, and demographics. We assessed scale structure using confirmatory factor analysis and evaluated internal consistency and validity. We assessed association of scale factors with respondent characteristics. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis supported a hypothesized two-factor solution. Internal consistency was high for both positive (Alpha = 0.92) and negative (Alpha = 0.91) attitude factors. Analyses supported construct and predictive validity with expected associations between scale factors and perceived norms and behavior (e.g. trips out of the home). We found an interaction suggesting that holding highly negative attitudes reduced the effect of holding positive beliefs. Both attitude factors were related to age, gender, race/ethnicity, and political affiliation. Perceived COVID-19 risk (to others but not for self) and perceived severity were consistently associated with higher positive and lower negative attitudes. Conclusion: This COVID-19 Social Distance Attitude Scale contains positive and negative factors with high internal consistency and construct and predictive validity. Practice implication: A greater understanding and ongoing assessment of COVID-19 social distance attitudes could inform policymakers, researchers, and clinicians who seek to promote protective social distance behaviors.

AB  - Authoritarian predispositions and contextual threats are both thought to result in intolerance and prejudice towards immigrants and other minorities. Yet there is considerable dispute as to how authoritarianism and threat interact to produce an "authoritarian dynamic." Some scholars argue that threats increase intolerance by "galvanizing" authoritarians. Others claim that authoritarians are always intolerant toward outgroups, with threat instead "mobilizing" nonauthoritarians. Using experimental manipulations of immigrant cultural threat embedded in nationally representative samples from 19 European societies, this study offers a test of these competing hypotheses. While we find some evidence for the "galvanizing" hypothesis, we find no evidence for the "mobilizing" hypothesis. The effects vary considerably across national samples however, with immigrants from Muslim societies being particularly likely to activate authoritarian predispositions. These findings show how the migration of culturally distinctive groups has the potential to activate authoritarian dispositions, thereby pushing the issue of immigration to the center of political debates.

AB  - Aims: Diabetes stigma and weight stigma have been identified as important but neglected issues that warrant attention among people with type 2 diabetes. This study assessed associations of diabetes stigma and weight stigma with diabetes self-care behaviors and health care in adults with type 2 diabetes.
   Methods: U.S. adults with type 2 diabetes (N = 1,227) completed self-report questionnaires to assess their experiences of weight stigma, diabetes stigma, diabetes self-management, diabetes-specific distress, healthcare utilization, perceptions of diabetes-specific health care. They also provided sociodemographic information. Linear regressions examined relationships among stigma and diabetes self-care and related health care, controlling for participants' age, education, income, gender, race/ethnicity, and body mass index.
   Results: Internalized weight stigma and diabetes self-stigma were both significantly associated with higher diabetes-specific distress. Adults who expressed self-stigma for their diabetes reported less diabetes self-management and lower self-efficacy, and those who reported being judged about their weight by a doctor exhibited greater diabetes-specific distress. While a history of experienced weight stigma (in general) did not reduce frequency of seeking health care, lower quality interactions with health care professionals were reported by adults who expressed diabetes self-stigma and those who experienced weight stigma from a doctor.
   Conclusions: Self-stigma for diabetes and body weight, as well as experiencing judgment about weight from doctors, may have negative implications for diabetes-specific self-care behaviors and perceived quality of health care.

AB  - The problem of inadequate pain management in hospitals is well documented. Patients who have substance use disorders (SUD) have many medical problems and are often in pain as a result of these problems. Nurses often lack knowledge of appropriate treatment of both pain and SUD, and have been identified as having negative attitudes toward patients with SUD. The negative attitudes may affect the quality of care delivered to patients with problems of pain and SUD. The purpose of this study was to identify and explore nurses' attitudes toward hospitalized patients with SUD who are in pain, to expand the knowledge about nurses' attitudes and interactions with patients with SUD in pain, and to generate theory that will contribute to a greater understanding of the problem. Grounded theory methodology was used to interview hospital-based nurses who work with patients with SUD who are in pain. Individual interviews, using a semistructured interview guide, were conducted with 14 nurses who worked with this population. Additionally, an expert addictions nurse was interviewed at the end of the study to validate the findings. Interviews were analyzed and coded with the use of grounded theory concepts. A model illustrating the categories and their relationships was developed based on the theory generated as a result of the study. The implications for nursing practice, education, research, and policy are discussed. (C) 2014 by the American Society for Pain Management Nursing

AB  - Background: Research informs that transgender individuals experience harsh and negative experiences when accessing medical care. As a person of contact, nurses serve a key role in providing a sense of emotional safety for transgender patients. Method: Undergraduate nursing students (N = 265) completed an online survey assessing transprejudice attitudes and other individual-difference variables (e.g., openness to experience, attribution of cause for being transgender, and empathic concern). Results: Confidence in providing culturally competent and affirming health care to diverse populations was associated with having received educational information on transgender issues and personally knowing a transgender individual. A significant positive correlation was found between beliefs that being transgender is due to genetics and holding more accepting attitudes toward transgender individuals. Conclusion: Nursing education that addresses gender identity and provides an opportunity for student health professionals to interact with transgender individuals may help promote affirming heath care practices and reduce prejudice toward transgender people.

AB  - Purpose: Family planning is an effective strategy to minimize maternal mortality, child death, miscarriages and unintended pregnancies. Nursing students, the future's health personnel, should have sufficient knowledge and a positive attitude towards family planning services. This study was undertaken to examine the effect of training program given to the nursing students upon family planning attitudes.
   Materials and Methods: The study, with a control group and semi-experimental design, was done at a university located in southern Turkiye. The sample of the study was consisted of 100 students, 50 students assigned to the experimental group and another 50 students to the control group. The experimental group students received weekly a two-hour family planning training for 10 weeks (except for the 1st and 10th weeks). The control group received no training "Information Request Form" -which included students' socio-demographic aspects- and "Family Planning Attitude Scale" was administered to the participants in the experimental and control groups in the 1st week and last week- were used.
   Results: Following the family planning training, the experimental group students' family planning attitude scores went up and this rise was found to statistically be significant. In the study, it was concluded that training intervention affected students' family planning attitudes positively.
   Conclusion: There is an urgent need for behavior change interventions so that a positive attitude change towards family planning can be achieved among students.

AB  - This questionnaire-based observational study was conducted in July 2020 with the aim of understanding the ethical and social issues faced by health care providers (HCPs) registered with the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine in intensive care units (ICUs) during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. There were 200 questionnaire respondents, and we analyzed the responses of 189 members who had been involved in COVID-19 treatment in ICUs. The ethical and social issues that HCPs recognized during the pandemic were difficulties in the decision-making process with patients' families, limitations of life-sustaining treatment, lack of palliative care, and inadequate mental support for patients' families and HCPs. Regarding decision-making on issues of clinical ethics during the pandemic, more than half of the respondents thought they had failed to provide sufficient palliative care to patients and responded that they experienced moral distress. The free-text responses on moral distress revealed issues such as unusual treatment and care, restricted visits, challenging situations for HCPs, and psychological burden. Additionally, 38.1% of respondents experienced episodes of social prejudice or discrimination and 4.7% experienced a shortage of medical resources. Our study result shows that the moral distress of HCPs was caused by difficulties in patient-centered decision-making and insufficient medical care to patients and their families. These were caused mainly by a lack of communication due to the stronger implementation of infection control measures. We believe that it is important to address ethical and social issues during a pandemic in order to provide appropriate medical care and prevent burnout among HCPs.

AB  - Background: Negative attitudes toward mental disorders are not only an interpersonal issue but also a concern of mental health care. Given that nursing students are future health care providers, it is pivotal to improve their attitudes toward individuals with mental disorders prior to their transition into clinical practice. However, research on nursing students' attitudes in relation to schizophrenia in Taiwan remains unexplored. Aim: The aim of this article is to examine the correlates of attitudes toward individuals with schizophrenia among Taiwanese undergraduate nursing students. Method: A descriptive, correlational, and cross-sectional study was adopted. Self-reported questionnaires were conducted with a convenience sample of 306 Taiwanese undergraduate nursing students. Descriptive statistics, independent t tests, one-way analysis of variance, Pearson's correlations, and a stepwise regression analysis were performed. Results: Nursing students expressed negative attitudes toward individuals with schizophrenia. Nursing students, who were female, had contact with individuals with mental disorders, and expressed greater empathy and personality traits held more favorable attitudes toward individuals with schizophrenia. The study found that empathy, personality traits, and academic year were the most crucial attributes contributing to attitudes of nursing students toward individuals with schizophrenia. Conclusion: Findings suggest that nursing education programs with empathy- and personality-tailored modules in mental health are pivotal to provide humanistic approaches with supportive attitudes regarding schizophrenia.

AB  - For years, experts have blamed Strickland v. Washington's lax standard for assessing trial attorney effectiveness for many of the criminal justice system's problems. But the conventional understanding of Strickland as a problem for ineffectiveness claims gives the decision too much prominence because it treats Strickland as the test for all such claims. That is a mistake. Properly understood, the Supreme Court has recognized four different constitutional forms of trial attorney ineffectiveness, and Strickland's two-pronged test applies to only one of the four. If litigants and courts would notice this complexity and relegate Strickland to its proper place, it would pave the way for meritorious ineffectiveness claims of the other. three kinds. This Article disaggregates strands of Sixth Amendment doctrine that others have jumbled together to enable courts and litigants to confine Strickland to its proper domain and use more appropriate analyses elsewhere.
   The Article also explains why additional disaggregation is necessary within the category of cases where Strickland rightly applies. Implicitly, the Supreme Court has created not one but three tests for assessing deficient performance within that domain, and it has indicated a willingness to soften the outcome-determinative prejudice prong as well. Failure to recognize these different forms of Strickland ineffectiveness has made the test seem much harder for defendants to satisfy than needs to be true. Recognizing these complexities, and applying the right test in the right case, is necessary if individual defendants are to be treated fairly and systemic constitutional problems in the provision of indigent defense services are to be addressed.

AB  - This article discusses from a critical education perspective what it is like to be a Dalit (former untouchable) student studying at an elite university in India. Much writing on exclusion and discrimination in higher education is focused on power relations such as gender, race, ethnicity and religion. This article broadens this focus to consider how caste shapes the experiences of those positioned at the very bottom of the caste hierarchy in higher education, and offers an innovative perspective on how caste in contemporary India, and particularly in elite contexts, has parallels with the stigma and prejudice that LGBT students suffer. This article departs from mainstream scholarship on Dalits in higher education by focusing not on numbers or reservations policy, but on the inner lives and struggles of Dalit students and how they cope with both institutional and social environments that devalue their identities. 'The Dalit Closet' reveals the immense pressure to hide one's identity and pass at an elite institution, while at the same time prove oneself academically in the face of pervasive anti-Dalit stereotypes of intellectual weakness. In this study, Dalit students, whether open or not about their identity, are sharply critical of the dominant ideology of merit that surrounds the policy of 'reservations' in India, and are well-aware of the structural and cultural disadvantages of their caste identities, in comparison to the life-long caste privilege of their upper-caste peers. The 'Dalit Closet' reveals the limitations of the current reservations policy from the perspective of Dalit students, and discusses measures that can be taken to promote a genuine culture of inclusion at Indian universities.

AB  - The resurgence of right-wing political parties across the globe raises questions about the origins of national identity. Based on the Dual Process Model of Ideology and Prejudice, we argue that people's tendency to submit to ingroup authorities (Right-Wing Authoritarianism [RWA]) and preference for group-based hierarchy (Social Dominance Orientation [SDO]) underlie people's belief in the superiority of their nation (nationalism) and attachment to their homeland (patriotism). We examine these hypotheses using three waves of data from an annually conducted national longitudinal panel study of New Zealanders (N = 3,838). As predicted, RWA had positive cross-lagged effects on nationalism and patriotism. Conversely, SDO had a positive cross-lagged effect on nationalism, but a negative cross-lagged effect on patriotism. Little evidence of reciprocal cross-lagged effects (i.e., national identity on authoritarianism) was found. These results demonstrate that nationalism and patriotism are related, albeit distinct, ways of identifying with one's nation that are ultimately rooted in authoritarianism.

AB  - The purpose of the present research was to study gender inequality in British and German universities. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with female academics in each country (UK, N = 40; Germany, N = 47). A generational difference of attitude was perceived in academe, with the younger generation clearly more strategic in career development, and more ready to embrace agency rather than passivity. German respondents were more constrained by social expectations and somewhat more subject to covert prejudice. They found networking more difficult to achieve than their British counterparts, and some struggled to attain full academic inclusion. They were subject to strong pressures to adopt the same habitus as their managers, which indicates the importance of sponsored mobility. Although in both the UK and Germany, children were perceived as the primary factor hindering female achievement, family and work could form a powerful positive synergy, inculcating habits of efficiency that transferred into the work environment: having offspring could be an emancipatory experience. Moreover, the academic achievement of the interviewees was located within a social matrix. Most of the respondents received support from their partners and families of origin to an extent that makes it appropriate to speak of 'academic communitarianism'. Most men as well as women invested deeply in their families and in their partner's career, thereby blurring the traditional distinction between the public and private domains, and vitiating the radical feminist allegation of patriarchalism.

AB  - Empirical research has linked gender bias in medical education with negative attitudes and behaviors in healthcare providers. Yet it has been more than 20 years since research has considered the degree to which women and men are equally represented in anatomy textbooks. Furthermore, previous research has not explored beyond quantity of representation to also examine visual gender stereotypes and, in light of theoretical advancements in the area of intersectional research, the relationship between representations of gender and representations of ethnicity, body type, health, and age. This study aimed to determine the existence and representation of gender bias in the major anatomy textbooks used at Australian Medical Schools. A systematic visual content analysis was conducted on 6044 images in which sex/gender could be identified, sourced from 17 major anatomy textbooks published from 2008 to 2013. Further content analysis was performed on the 521 narrative images, which represent an unfolding story, found within the same textbooks. Results indicate that the representation of gender in images from anatomy textbooks remain predominantly male except within sex-specific sections. Further, other forms of bias were found to exist in: the visualization of stereotypical gendered emotions, roles and settings; the lack of ethnic, age, and body type diversity; and in the almost complete adherence to a sex/gender binary. Despite increased attention to gender issues in medicine, the visual representation of gender in medical curricula continues to be biased. The biased construction of gender in anatomy textbooks designed for medical education provides future healthcare providers with inadequate and unrealistic information about patients.

AB  - Background In Kenya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is recommended for adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) at high risk of HIV. Health providers play a critical role in the uptake and effective use of sexual and reproductive health services; however, few published studies have explored providers' attitudes toward and experiences delivering PrEP to AGYW. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional qualitative study, interviewing 113 providers at 36 public, private, and nongovernmental health facilities in Kenya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe that were offering PrEP during the research period or were likely to offer PrEP in the future. Data were coded in NVivo 11, and an applied thematic analysis was conducted. Results Most providers preferred that adolescent girls wait until age 18 to have sex but acknowledged that many girls younger than 18 could benefit from oral PrEP. Their primary concern was whether adolescent girls would be able to take PrEP daily, especially if they do not tell their parents or partners they are using it. Providers reported that it was more challenging to deliver PrEP and other HIV services to girls younger than 18. Those with experience providing PrEP pointed to stigma and lack of PrEP awareness in communities as two primary barriers to PrEP uptake and use. Conclusions Providers were generally accepting of oral PrEP as an HIV prevention option for AGYW; however, many had negative attitudes about adolescent girls being sexually active and concerns about whether they could take PrEP daily. Results were used to update national PrEP training materials to address negative provider attitudes about PrEP use by AGYW.

AB  - While there is a wealth of research on gender ideology, most research focuses on attitudes toward women and women's roles. This study aims to address the gap in our understanding of attitudes toward working fathers. Using the 2016 General Social Survey (GSS), we find more negative attitudes toward work-oriented fathers than working mothers. Results from multinomial logistic regression show that men, older individuals, Hispanics, and those who attend religious services more frequently are more likely to agree that both working mothers and work-oriented fathers are harmful to families. On the other hand, those whose mothers were employed when they were 16 years old and those who have a college or graduate degree are less likely to agree that only working mothers are harmful.

AB  - Research on immigration has emphasized the role that statistical discrimination plays in hiring decisions. A better understanding of how immigrants overcome this type of discrimination might lead to better interventions to improve their labour market participation. In this article, we use qualitative interviews to examine how immigrants can reduce statistical discrimination by signalling their similarity to employers in their job applications. Specifically, we find that immigrants who demonstrate signal similarity to employers in the type of education, job experience and religion tend to reduce their statistical discrimination by employers. We suggest how further research can build on these results to provide possible tools for immigrant integration.

AB  - In recent decades the Netherlands has seen the rise of anxieties regarding the present and future of the nation. De Koning explores the way such anxieties circulate and are taken up in various settings and by differently positioned people, using the notorious' Amsterdam Diamantbuurt neighbourhood as her vantage point. She focuses on engagements with the iconic figure of the troublesome Moroccan youth' in order to trace how such anxious discourses move from the national stage, to the neighbourhood and into the narratives of Moroccan-Dutch residents. While younger women contest discourses that frame their male peers as inherently disposed to crime, and instead single out overzealous policing, older residents grapple with explanations. They articulate an anxious belonging that differs markedly from the contentious narratives of the younger generation. These engagements give us a sense of how such publicly articulated anxieties interpellate differently positioned people, and feed into generationally specific senses of belonging.

AB  - Background: It is unknown whether obesity is a barrier to international travel. The purpose of this qualitative study was to describe the travel experiences of a cohort of severely obese individuals attending a hospital-based bariatric service, to identify their perceived barriers to travel and to generate recommendations that address the needs of severely obese individuals.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with severely obese patients attending a regional, structured, multidisciplinary lifestyle modification programme. Coding and thematic analysis of the transcripts were completed by three independent researchers. A thematic analysis was performed based on examination of the transcribed interviews. Demographic and clinical data such as gender, age and body mass index were also recorded.
   Results: Twelve patients (six males), with a mean age of 54 +/- 5.98 years and a mean body mass index of 46.2 +/- 8.2 kg/m(2), agreed to semi-structured interviews (14-52-minute duration). The principal themes emerging from the interviews included obese air traveller embarrassment, physical discomfort on commercial flights, perceived weight bias, challenges in accessing hotel rooms, heat intolerance in warm climates, restricted leisure travel activities and medical co-morbidities. Most of the interviewees perceived a health benefit to travel but regarded obesity as a significant barrier to international travel.
   Conclusion: These findings highlight the limitations experienced by obese travellers when engaging in international travel. Our results may inform the pre-travel health advice given to obese travellers. They might also serve to raise awareness among operators within the travel industry of the difficulties travellers with severe obesity face.

AB  - Social work programmes are expected to enable students to work adequately with sexual minorities. In Switzerland, however, curricular content on sexual minorities is lacking in BSW programmes. Potential sexual prejudice is not explicitly addressed. This study aimed to assess the attitudes towards lesbian women and gay men amongst students entering the BSW programme of a university in Switzerland to establish a basis for discussing curriculum development. Students entering the programme from 2015 through 2018 were surveyed using an online questionnaire. Heterosexist attitudes were captured using the 'Multidimensional Scale of Attitudes toward Lesbians and Gay Men'. The responding 955 entering students reported positive attitudes towards lesbians and gay men and evidenced low levels of heterosexist views. However, only 4.3 per cent of the respondents consistently disagreed with all items expressing heterosexist views, whilst 43.3 per cent completely agreed with at least one item. The views expressed by male participants expressed significantly higher levels of heterosexism than did those of female participants. The findings evidence uncertainties and a lack of reflection on unquestioned but heteronormative views. This reflects a need to infuse BSW programmes with sexual minority content, to provide opportunities for critical reflection and to address heteronormative and heterosexist views.

AB  - In spring 2011, a study was initiated to investigate the nature and extent of gender issues in clinical dental education at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Dentistry. Surveys were sent to 236 dental students in the second, third, and fourth years; eighty-six (36.4 percent) responded. Surveys were also sent to seventy-one full-time dental faculty members who had clinical contact with students, and thirty-four (47.9 percent) responded. Of the student respondents, fifty-one were female and thirty-five were male; the faculty respondents were ten women and twenty-four men. A significantly greater proportion of female than male student respondents reported that issues related to gender affected clinical training. The female students also responded that mentorship was less available and less in content for them compared to males, and significantly more female than male students reported lower self-confidence in clinical settings. Among faculty respondents, a higher proportion of women than men reported insufficient awareness of gender issues. These faculty members also reported thinking that female students showed more empathy toward patients than males. Both faculty and student respondents said that female faculty members received less respect from students than did male faculty members. Forty-eight percent of the students reported experiencing or witnessing gender-based prejudice in clinical settings, and 7.0 percent reported experiencing or witnessing unwelcome sexual advances or conduct. A more robust study to include other dental institutions is needed. With confirmation of specific gender issues, corrective measures could be recommended to improve the climate for both females and males in the clinical component of dental education.

T2  - FORDHAM LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - More than sixty years ago, the U.S. Supreme Court decided Remmer v. United States, thereby defining what procedural steps restore a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial in the face of a contaminated or partial jury. Remmer, a case replete with evidence of jury tampering and covert investigations, fashioned the remedy for future courts to redress allegations of jury taint. Upon making out a prima facie case, a defendant is entitled to an evidentiary hearing, at which the evidence is presumed to prejudice the defendant, and the government bears the burden of rebutting. In Remmer's wake, however, the Court issued two subsequent opinions that some circuits have interpreted to obviate the presumption of prejudice and restrict Remmer's rule.
   This Note observes the inconsistent effects of the current circuit split on defendants' rights at trial, and it contends that the disparity will increase as technology dissolves access barriers between jurors and outside information. This Note examines where Supreme Court jurisprudence, circuit procedure, and habeas corpus doctrine have shaped the current circuit split. It then proposes that circuits can mend the split and pave a unified path forward by reframing their analyses to include three additional considerations. Further, by separating allegations of jury taint into three subcategories, circuits can renew Remmer's pretechnology rule to properly address jury taint in a digital age.

AB  - Of this article's seven experiments, the first five demonstrate that virtually no Americans know the basic global warming mechanism. Fortunately, Experiments 2-5 found that 2-45min of physical-chemical climate instruction durably increased such understandings. This mechanistic learning, or merely receiving seven highly germane statistical facts (Experiment 6), also increased climate-change acceptanceacross the liberal-conservative spectrum. However, Experiment 7's misleading statistics decreased such acceptance (and dramatically, knowledge-confidence). These readily available attitudinal and conceptual changes through scientific information disconfirm what we term stasis theorywhich some researchers and many laypeople varyingly maintain. Stasis theory subsumes the claim that informing people (particularly Americans) about climate science may be largely futile or even counterproductivea view that appears historically naive, suffers from range restrictions (e.g., near-zero mechanistic knowledge), and/or misinterprets some polarization and (noncausal) correlational data. Our studies evidenced no polarizations. Finally, we introduce HowGlobalWarmingWorks.orga website designed to directly enhance public climate-change cognition.

AB  - Although weight stigma and discrimination are associated with increased body dissatisfaction and eating disorder risk, reduced opportunities, and poorer well-being, there are few legal protections for such discrimination in the U.S. We addressed one barrier to enacting protective legislation - public attitudes toward anti-weight discrimination laws - by assessing the impact of media representations of fatness and information about peer attitudes. Using a 2 x 2 experimental design, participants (N = 525) completed baseline assessments of political conservatism and weight bias and were randomly assigned to view fat negative or fat-positive media content that was ostensibly supported or not supported by their peers, followed by questionnaires assessing fat phobia and legislative attitudes. Two-way ANCOVAs controlling for baseline weight bias and political conservatism indicated a significant effect for media framing, with greater fat phobia and less support for anti-discrimination laws and policies among those who viewed the fat negative frame; however, effects for ostensible peer support and interaction effects were not significant. These preliminary findings suggest that efforts to shift media rhetoric may enhance support for anti-weight discrimination laws. Future research should investigate other barriers to anti-discrimination legislation and estimate their impact on body dissatisfaction, eating disorder risk, and other indicators of population health.

AB  - Background: In 2016, the Virginia Health Commissioner signed a standing order into law allowing licensed pharmacists to dispense opioid receptor antagonists (ORAs) for overdose reversal.
   Objectives: Using the theory of planned behavior as an initial guide to study development, the aim of this qualitative study was to explore community pharmacists' attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and behavioral intention toward dispensing ORAs under a standing order in Virginia.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with community pharmacists across the Commonwealth between June 2018 and October 2019. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed.
   Results: Twenty-one community pharmacists were interviewed. Pharmacists were confused about the specifics and the processes involved with dispensing naloxone under the standing order. Furthermore, many recognized the underuse of the standing order. Positive attitudes focused on the life-saving action of ORAs. Negative attitudes included encouraging risky behaviors by patients, negatively affecting the patient-pharmacist relationship, offending or contributing to stigmatizing patrons, and having liability issues to the pharmacy. Subjective norms regarding dispensing of ORAs under the standing order were perceived to be favorable among peer pharmacists and primary care and emergency department physicians but may be seen as profit-seeking by patients. Barriers to service provision included lack of guidance from corporate offices (in chain pharmacies), inadequate training, patient out-of-pocket costs, reimbursement issues, inadequate staffing and time, and stigma. Facilitators comprised the existence of practice site-specific protocols, the REVIVE! training, technician support, increased community awareness, physician collaboration, pharmacist training, and employer guidance. Whereas some pharmacists intended to become more familiarized with the standing order, others did not intend to actively identify patients who were at risk of an opioid overdose.
   Conclusion: Pharmacists expressed mixed behavioral intention toward dispensing ORAs under the standing order. Future research should focus on quantifying the uptake of the standing order at the state level. (C) 2021 American Pharmacists Association (R). Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Marketers are increasingly relying on covert advertising tactics to persuade consumers. This empirical study selected the context of an emerging market to examine the effectiveness of product placements. Using an experimental design, we captured the affective and behavioral responses of young Indian adults. The results indicated that young adults are positive about product placements. The mediating role of brand attitude change in the relationship between attitude toward product placements and purchase intentions is established. The study provides valuable insights into the impact of execution factors on viewers' responses. Implications and directions for future research are discussed based on the results of this study.

AB  - Cities worldwide face the challenge of persistent social polarisation that is exacerbated by the mass migration of populations. Scholars have debated whether the planning of public spaces, which presumably fosters inter-group encounter, potentially reduces prejudice against minorities such as migrants, and eventually promotes social inclusiveness. This research uses a large-scale questionnaire survey conducted in 36 neighbourhoods (estates) in Beijing, China, combined with field observations and interviews, to investigate whether the presence, perception and use of neighbourhood-scale spaces of encounter are relevant in predicting residents' attitudes towards migrant social inclusion, particularly with respect to equal access to citizenship and government welfare. Qualitative and quantitative analyses found that residents' inclusiveness attitude is less associated with the physical presence of public spaces and facilities in the neighbourhood, and more with actually using such spaces for neighbourly encounters in daily life. The findings echo recent critiques of the romanticised view of public spaces for urban encounters, and suggest that neighbourhood planning of public spaces should incorporate elements from social projects that facilitate meaningful interaction between native and migrant residents to achieve the goal of building an inclusive city.

AB  - Sexuality is a widely used appeal in advertising today. The aim of this research was to establish whether or not this form of advertising connects with South African students and whether gender differences existed. A triangulated research design with data collected in focus groups, was used. The findings generally indicated negative attitudes towards sexual appeals in advertising. The main difference in gender responses was that males responded more negatively to adverts that contained male models as opposed to female models, whereas, women responded in similar ways regardless of the gender of the model.

AB  - We discuss research on discrimination against blacks and other racial minorities in labor market outcomes, highlighting fundamental challenges faced by empirical work in this area. Specifically, for work devoted to measuring whether and how much discrimination exists, we discuss how the absence of relevant data, the potential noncomparability of blacks and whites, and various conceptual concerns peculiar to race may frustrate or render impossible the application of empirical methods used in other areas of study. For work seeking to arbitrate empirically between the two main alternative theoretical explanations for such discrimination as it exists, we distinguish between indirect analyses, which do not directly study the variation in prejudice or the variation in information, the mechanisms at the heart of the two types of models we review, and direct analyses, which are more recent and much less common. We highlight problems with both approaches. Throughout, we discuss recent work, which, the various challenges notwithstanding, permits tentative conclusions about discrimination. We conclude by pointing to areas that might be fruitful avenues for future investigation.

AB  - Internalized heterosexism (IH) is a strong predictor of the psychological well-being of lesbian, gay, bisexual (LGB), or other same-sex attracted individuals. To respond to the call for interventions to address IH, the current study developed and tested an online intervention to reduce IH among gay, bisexual, and other same-sex attracted men. A total of 367 self-identified same-sex attracted adult males were recruited through various nationwide LOB-related sources and were assigned by birth month to either the experimental condition (focusing on IH reduction) or the control condition (a similarly structured invention focusing on stress management); 290 of these participants completed the intervention and all post-intervention measures. Mean levels of IH were compared by condition, indicating significant differences on the IH global score and 2 of the 3 IH subscale scores between the participants in the 2 conditions. The study findings support the promise of using the Internet to deliver IH interventions. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

TI  - ANTI-SEMITISM IN SLOVAKIA AFTER THE VELVET REVOLUTION OF 1989
T2  - OCCASIONAL PAPERS ON RELIGION IN EASTERN EUROPE
LA  - English
AB  - This study discusses anti-Semitism in Slovakia after the Velvet Revolution of 1989. The introductory section presents an overview of the most destructive manifestations of anti-Semitism during 1918-1920, the Holocaust, and the Communist era (1948-1989). Anti-Semitism in Slovakia is less aggressive than in many other countries of the European Union. Physical violence is especially rare, and even the defacement of Jewish sites (particularly cemeteries) is typically motivated by vandalism, rather than by anti-Semitism. The most frequent expression of prejudice against Jews takes the form of verbal insults. These are predominantly used by children, who hear them from their families. Children (and adults) generally view these words as a regular part of the language culture and do not attribute a pejorative context to them. Between 1990 and 2019, anti-Semitism became embedded in the ideological equipment of certain political parties. In the process, it has moved from the margins of society to its center. Although I have examined different aspects of anti-Semitism in Slovakia in the past,(2) it was only while writing this study that I could more thoroughly consider the various manifestations of this phenomenon in the current democratic milieu. Jews in Slovakia(3) welcomed the Velvet Revolution of 1989 with the hope that it would usher in a brighter future. At the same time, some members of the community-especially the older generation-voiced concerns that the newfound freedom of expression would once again allow people to fulfill the adage that every change is a change for the worse. The history of Slovakia in the 20th century provides at least three examples which affirm this unfortunate Jewish experience.

AB  - Introduction Educational workshops are a promising strategy to increase healthcare providers' ability to provide gender-affirming care for transgender (trans) people. This strategy may also reduce healthcare providers' stigma towards trans people and people living with HIV. There is less evidence, however, of educational workshops that address HIV prevention and care among trans women. This protocol details development and pilot testing of the Transgender Education for Affirmative and Competent HIV and Healthcare intervention that aims to increase gender-affirming HIV care knowledge and perceived competency, and to reduce negative attitudes/biases, among providers.
   Methods and analysis This community-based research (CBR) project involves intervention development and implementation of a non-randomised multisite pilot study with pre-post test design. First, we conducted a qualitative formative phase involving focus groups with 30 trans women and individual interviews with 12 providers to understand HIV care access barriers for trans women and elicit feedback on a proposed workshop. Second, we will pilot test the intervention with 90-150 providers (n=30-50x3 in-person settings). For pilot studies, primary outcomes include feasibility (eg, completion rate) and acceptability (eg, workshop satisfaction). Secondary preintervention and postintervention outcomes, assessed directly preceding and following the workshop, include perceived competency, attitudes/biases towards trans women with HIV, and knowledge needed to provide gender-affirming HIV care. Primary outcomes will be summarised as frequencies and proportions (categorical variables). We will conduct paired-sample t-tests to explore the direction of preintervention and postintervention differences for secondary outcomes.
   Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the University of Toronto HIV Research Ethics Board (Protocol Number: 00036238). Study findings will be disseminated through community forums with trans women and service providers; manuscripts submitted to peer reviewed journals; and conferences. Findings will inform a larger CBR research agenda to remove barriers to engagement in HIV prevention/care among trans women across Canada.

AB  - Although personal intergroup contact is known to predict positive intergroup outcomes, little is known about the kind of positive personal contact that reduces prejudice in real-world post-conflict societies. Using a behavioural experiment, the present study examined the effect of face-to-face personal contact between three groups of ex-combatants (national army, former national army and armed group) and civilians with disabilities in Rwanda. A total of 444 participants were randomly assigned to intergroup or intragroup pairs under high and low personalisation conditions, and their person preference, evaluative bias and impressions of contact partners were compared to those who had contact without personalisation. Between ex-combatants of the national army and civilians, low personalisation generally resulted in better intergroup outcomes than high personalisation or no personalisation. The trend is reversed for personalisation between the three groups of ex-combatants, who are former adversaries. Implications for personal contact in real-world post-conflict societies are discussed.

AB  - Background: Not many of the studies on the pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood of drug-using women that have been conducted in Central and Eastern Europe, including Slovenia, have demonstrated the marginal position such groups hold in research. There is not much knowledge about experiences of drug-using mothers, their needs or risk behaviours, as almost all studies focus on the harm undergone by new-born children. Aim: The goal of this study was to explore and better understand the experiences of women using illicit drugs during pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood, and to recognize their needs and the obstacles they have to face. Methods: The in-depth semi-structured interviews with fifteen mothers who had used opioid drugs during their pregnancy and labour served as the source of information. All subjects were included in various addiction treatment programmes The methodology used was qualitative. Results: Apart from the problems that are physically linked with drug use, pregnancy involves various psychosocial risks. The pregnancies of most of the mothers in this study (all of them were opioid users) had been unplanned and were detected at quite a late stage. When the mothers realized they were pregnant, they began to follow various harm reduction strategies that they believed would benefit their child, such as discontinuing illicit drug use and taking part in an agonist opioid maintenance treatment. The involvement of supportive partners and other relatives, as well as the comprehensive management of pregnancy and drug use, demonstrated positive effects on prenatal care. However, prejudice and various stereotypes prevented care and health workers, governmental and non-governmental institutions alike and individuals from applying effective strategies. This study has investigated severe features of these women's lives when they came to the term of their pregnancy and then childbirth. Conclusions: Pregnancy is a period that allows changes to happen in pregnant women's lives, and therefore calls for support strategies to benefit both mothers and their children.

AB  - Collaborative robots offer opportunities to increase the sustainability of work and workforces by increasing productivity, quality, and efficiency, whilst removing workers from hazardous, repetitive, and strenuous tasks. They also offer opportunities for increasing accessibility to work, supporting those who may otherwise be disadvantaged through age, ability, gender, or other characteristics. However, to maximise the benefits, employers must overcome negative attitudes toward, and a lack of confidence in, the technology, and must take steps to reduce errors arising from misuse. This study explores how dynamic graphical signage could be employed to address these issues in a manufacturing task. Forty employees from one UK manufacturing company participated in a field experiment to complete a precision pick-and-place task working in conjunction with a collaborative robotic arm. Twenty-one participants completed the task with the support of dynamic graphical signage that provided information about the robot and the activity, while the rest completed the same task with no signage. The presence of the signage improved the completion time of the task as well as reducing negative attitudes towards the robots. Furthermore, participants provided with no signage had worse outcome expectancies as a function of their response time. Our results indicate that the provision of instructional information conveyed through appropriate graphical signage can improve task efficiency and user wellbeing, contributing to greater workforce sustainability. The findings will be of interest for companies introducing collaborative robots as well as those wanting to improve their workforce wellbeing and technology acceptance.

AB  - One needs to recognize that the perinatal period is a vulnerable time where negative attitudes, words and actions can have an emotionally damaging effect on birthing women, who are especially sensitive to how they are treated, because of their high oxytocin levels. This case report depicts a traumatic birth in which the mother was needlessly separated from her baby and also harshly treated by the personnel, which had an emotionally devastating impact on the mother/baby relationship. This case report will demonstrate how psychotherapy was used to heal this distress.

AB  - Despite burgeoning evidence for the effectiveness of intergroup contact on prejudice reduction, relatively less is known about how much individuals' internal control and active choice is involved in the formation of intergroup contact. Through four correlational studies (N-total = 1043, Study 1 in Cyprus and Studies 2-4 in Turkey), we investigated the construct of 'contact volition'-the extent to which one engages in intergroup contact deliberately. Studies 1-3 showed that intergroup contact perceived as primarily intentional and pursued by the active choice of the self (volitional contact) was associated with greater intimacy and positivity and thereby more positive attitudes, compared to contact that is primarily based on external/situational conditions (contingent contact). Study 4 showed that contact quantity was associated with more positive attitudes and behavioral tendencies through greater intimacy and positivity, only when contact was volitional. Findings contribute to the recently emerging research literature on motivated contact behavior that can help maximize the effectiveness of contact.

AB  - This article examines US fair housing policy from a critical perspective. We describe the impact of the expansion of neoliberal ideology on the fair housing assistance program (FHAP), the fair housing initiatives program (FHIP), and the scope of US Department of Justice activities. Prior findings from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and IRS Form 990 are summarized. We argue that neoliberalism has contributed to the underdevelopment, underfunding, and poor implementation of US fair housing policy. We offer three recommendations for fair housing reform. The first focuses on the need to remove fair housing activities from HUD and place them in an independent fair housing agency. The second focuses on the need for the federal government to mandate fair housing enforcement across all governmental programs and agencies. The third focuses on the need for increased lobbying, litigation, and activism by community-based advocacy organizations for reform.

AB  - OBJECTIVE
   This paper aims to examine how the COVID-19 pandemic affects the mental distress of the Vietnamese students in the USA. We explore different root causes of mental distress among international students who are away from their home country, their loved ones, and being isolated from school and community due to this outbreak.
   DESIGN
   In-depth interviews were conducted to probe the reasons for mental stress during the pandemic and the narrative textual analysis was subsequently performed to analyze the results. This research includes the interviews of 20 Vietnamese students in the USA during the COVID-19 era.
   RESULTS
   The textual analysis showed that the mental distress of these Vietnamese students were caused by limited access to on-campus facilities and activities, limited access to public services including grocery shopping, transportations, clinics, the possibility of being infected, isolated living condition due to the lockdown order, and inability to go back to the home country when wanted.
   CONCLUSIONS
   We found that both physical attributes (e.g., living condition, internet difficulty, overwhelmed healthcare system, restricted traveling, lack of personal interaction, limited access to public services) and psychological factors (e.g., anxiety of unfamiliar teaching modality, fear of viral infection, uncertain career aspects, cultural barrier and prejudice) directly led to the mental distress of these students. Moreover, other factors such as turbulent future job markets and potential racism toward Asians in relation with "Chinese virus" may cause the mental distress of these students.

AB  - Motherhood represents a turning point in life, and it brings new responsibilities and changes in the lifestyle of first-time mothers. Participants in this study were four mothers aged 19-22 who were interviewed about their first experience of mother- hood after an unwanted pregnancy. In order to gain insight into the changes that young mothers experience in their process of transition to motherhood and how their occupational structure of the day changes, this research applied a qualitative research design using a method of semi-structured in-depth interview. The results were organized using thematic analysis which resulted in five main themes and ten subthemes. The main themes include: (1) The beginning of the transition to mother- hood, (2) Taking on the role of a mother, (3) New lifestyle, (4) Social attitudes towards young mothers and (5) Restricting and facilitating factors during and after pregnancy. Taking on the role of a mother was an individual process for each participant that was accompanied by a number of emotional changes, as well as role conflicts. The most prominent recognized emotion is fear (for the well-being of the child, for own future) and shame (due to the condemnation of others). Most significant role changes are seen in the transition from the role of a young person and student to the role of a mother. Changes in the daily occupational structure are visible through the sudden takeover of completely new occupations of childcare and co-occupations with the child. A special challenge in the transition process was the lack of family support and the prejudice of the wider social environment, especially in the times of pregnancy.

AB  - Background: Opioid use disorders are widespread, commonly occurring, and have serious impacts on individuals, families, and communities. When adequately trained, social workers play a pivotal role in treating populations impacted by opioid use through the provision of high-quality services and the shifting of negative attitudes related to opioid use. However, workforce projections indicate a growing shortage of behavioral health professionals qualified to work with such populations and, presently, social work programs are not equipped to meet these workforce needs. Emerging evidence suggests opioid overdose education is associated with improved attitudes and knowledge among health professions; however, less information exists on the outcomes of such training among social work students. Schools of social work must develop and evaluate curricular components related to opioid use prevention and management to adequately prepare students for clinical work as social work practitioners. Methods: Thirty-three advanced-year MSW students received opioid overdose training as part of a day-long seminar on substance use. Content included acute effects of opioids, withdrawal symptoms, risk factors, signs of overdose, naloxone training, and harm reduction principles. Using a single-group pretest-posttest design, students completed the Opioid Overdose Attitudes Scale (OOAS) and the Opioid Overdose Knowledge Scale (OOKS). To evaluate students' attitudes and knowledge, investigators compared overall and subscale means before and after the training via paired samples t-tests. Results: Findings indicated statistically significant improvements in the "concerns" and "competence" domains of the OOAS. Likewise, findings indicated statistically significant improvements in the "risk," "signs," "action," and "naloxone use" domains of the OOKS. Conclusion: Students reported improved opioid overdose-related knowledge and attitudes when assessed after the training as compared to before the training. Due to the nature of the study design, causality cannot be inferred from the training outcomes. Findings may help other social work programs develop curricular components related to opioid use.

AB  - How do social group boundaries evolve? Does the appearance of a new out-group change the in-group's perceptions of other out-groups? We introduce a conceptual framework of context-dependent categorization in which exposure to one minority leads to recategorization of other minorities as in- or out-groups depending on perceived distances across groups. We test this framework by studying how Mexican immigration to the United States affected white Americans' attitudes and behaviors toward Black Americans. We combine survey and crime data with a difference-in-differences design and an instrumental variables strategy. Consistent with the theory, Mexican immigration improves whites' racial attitudes, increases support for pro-Black government policies, and lowers anti-Black hate crimes while simultaneously increasing prejudice against Hispanics. Results generalize beyond Hispanics and Blacks, and a survey experiment provides direct evidence for recategorization. Our findings imply that changes in the size of one group can affect the entire web of intergroup relations in diverse societies.

AB  - In most parts of the world, hegemonic masculinity requires men to endorse traditional masculine ideals, one of which is rejection of homosexuality. Wherever hegemonic masculinity favours heterosexuality over homosexuality, gay males may feel under pressure to negotiate their conflicting male gender and gay sexual identities to maintain positive self-perceptions. However, globalization, as a source of intercultural interaction, might provide a beneficial context for people wishing to create alternative masculinities in the face of hegemonic masculinity. Hence, we tested if global identification would predict higher levels of gay-male identity integration, and indirectly subjective well-being, via alternative masculinity representations for gay and male identities. A community sample of 219 gay and bisexual men from Turkey completed the study. Structural equation modelling revealed that global identification positively predicted gay-male identity integration, and indirectly subjective well-being; however, alternative masculinity representations did not mediate this relationship. Our findings illustrate how identity categories in different domains can intersect and affect each other in complex ways. Moreover, we discuss mental health and well-being implications for gay men living in cultures where they experience high levels of prejudice and stigma.

KW  - medical
KW  - voice
KW  - game
AB  - This article re-investigates the conventional understanding of the female body and voice in 'Let's Play Doctor', a short story written by the Egyptian Nura Amin in 2005. In traditional representations of women in literary discourses, female bodies have mostly been viewed as complex entities and unsettled fields for scientific practices that enhance and sustain the image of, in particular, male doctors as superior and authoritative. The male monopoly over scientific knowledge produces forms of social regulation within which female bodies are generally represented as passively and morally inferior. In the history of the medical profession, these bodies are registered as having the potential to enact aberrant, erotic, self-indulgence and fantasy, an act which makes them liable to shame and hence constant pathological examination. Amin's characters, however, offer a potent renunciation of the long established place/image of the female body in medical literary discourses through the irony of a simple children's game. By creating a community of young female actors who play a traditional game of doctor and patients, these young characters redirect our attention to the hidden power of female knowledge which is suppressed by social medical prejudices carried out on women in a highly gendered Arab society (Egypt).

KW  - WAR
AB  - After the Second World War, using culture - such as theater, film, and writing - to promote Austria as a separate nation became a helpful strategy for Austrians and the Allied Forces alike. In this context, the role of Jews and Jewish difference in revising Austrian self-definitions was particularly fraught. Antisemitic prejudices persisted after the Holocaust, even though Austrian Jews were now largely absent. However, in the early postwar years, antisemitism was more likely to rear its head via code words or backhandedly, in efforts to deny its very existence. This article investigates the presence and consequences of this invisible' antisemitism in postwar Vienna by juxtaposing two films made at roughly the same time: Der Proze ss (1948), a film about antisemitism that takes place in a nineteenth-century village over 300 miles away and features only innocent rural Jews and diabolical antisemites, while The Third Man (1949) features an urban tale of the black market and poisoned children set in post-1945 Vienna that does not mention either Jews or the reasons for their absence. This comparison suggests that the simultaneous repression and evocation of Jewish difference that characterized the creation of culture in Vienna before the Holocaust persisted in the immediate postwar era.

AB  - Background: Information regarding how the Special Olympics programs affect volunteers' self-esteem and attitudes towards individuals with intellectual disability (ID) is limited. We conducted a quasi-experimental study to address this gap. Method: The intervention group participants (n = 120) were Chinese volunteers for the Special Olympics Eunice Kennedy Shriver University Day. They were asked to attend a pre-service training program and provide a half-day service. Results were compared with a control group (n = 123). Results: Our findings showed that the volunteers' self-esteem and attitudes immediately improved after intervention. In addition, change in participants' self-esteem contributed to their positive attitude change. Conclusions: The Special Olympics may provide an avenue for promoting the volunteers' self-esteem and attitudes regarding inclusion towards individuals with ID. Future research should include follow-up tests to examine the lasting effects of intervention.

AB  - This article provides an examination of the structure of Islamophobia across cultures. Our novel measure-the Tripartite Islamophobia Scale (TIS)-embeds three theoretically and statistically grounded subcomponents of Islamophobia: anti-Muslim prejudice, anti-Islamic sentiment, and conspiracy beliefs. Across six samples (i.e., India, Poland, Germany, France, and the United States), preregistered analyses corroborated that these three subcomponents are statistically distinct. Measurement invariance analyses indicated full scalar invariance, suggesting that the tripartite understanding of Islamophobia is generalizable across cultural contexts. Furthermore, the subcomponents were partially dissociated in terms of the intergroup emotions they are predicted by as well as the intergroup outcomes they predict (e.g., dehumanization, ethnic persecution). For example, intergroup anger and disgust underpin Islamophobic attitudes, over and above the impact of fear. Finally, our results show that social dominance orientation (SDO) and ingroup identification moderate intergroup emotions and Islamophobia. We address both theoretical implications for the nature of Islamophobia and practical interventions to reduce it.

KW  - VULNERABILITY
AB  - BackgroundHate crimes - those perpetrated because of perceived difference, including disability, race, religion, sexual orientation or transgender status - have not been studied at the point of the victim's hospital emergency department (ED) use.
   AimTo investigate the frequency, levels of physical harm and circumstances of targeted violence in those seeking treatment at EDs in three UK cities.
   MethodIn a multimethods study, face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with 124 adult ED attenders with violent injuries. Victim and perpetrator socio-demographics were recorded. Patient narratives about perceived motives and circumstances were transcribed, uploaded onto NVivo for thematic analysis.
   ResultsNearly a fifth (23, 18.5%) of the injured patients considered themselves to have been attacked by others motivated by hostility or prejudice to their difference' (targeted violence). Thematic analyses suggested these prejudices were to appearance (7 cases), racial tension (5 cases), territorial association (3 cases) and race, religious or sexual orientation (8 cases). According to victims, alcohol intoxication was particularly relevant in targeted violence (estimated reported frequency 90% and 56% for targeted and non-targeted violence, respectively).
   ConclusionsOur findings support a broader concept of hate victimisation and suggest that emergency room violence surveys could act as a community tension sensor and early warning system in this regard. Tackling alcohol misuse seems as important in this as in other forms of violence perpetration. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

KW  - Evidence-based practice
KW  - Metacognition
KW  - Learning
KW  - Qualitative research
AB  - Background: Evidence-based practice is an important component of pre-service professional learning in medicine and allied health degrees, including new programmes in paramedicine. Despite substantial interest in this area, there is still a lack of clear understanding of how the skills and understandings needed to develop the capacity to apply evidence-based practice can best be learned. Evidence-based practice is often described as consisting of five steps: ask, acquire, appraise, apply and assess. This study focuses on paramedicine students' learning about the first three steps in a final year unit which explicitly aims to develop their skills in relation to these.
   Methods: We conducted a qualitative study of learning journals recorded by 101 of 121 students in a final year unit of a paramedicine degree (20 students either withheld consent for their journals to be used in the research or did not complete their journal entries). We used phenomenographic approaches to the data analysis in order to identify both variation in students' learning and the factors affecting this variation.
   Results: We observed variation in students' understanding of the purpose of literature analysis, the nature of medical research and its relationship to practice. In all three, we identify two main factors contributing to the variation in student learning outcomes: epistemological stance, and opportunities for metacognitive learning generated through peer interactions and self-reflection. We also found that as students begin to grapple with the complexity of medical research, this sometimes produced negative attitudes towards its value; such unintended outcomes need to be recognised and addressed.
   Conclusions: We suggest key factors that should be considered in developing coursework intended to enhance students' understandings about the processes and application of evidence-based practice. Providing collaborative learning opportunities that address the architecture of variation we observed may be useful in overcoming epistemological and metacognitive barriers experienced by students.

AB  - Research has shown that group discussion can increase intergroup prejudice and discrimination. However, we know little about the process by which discussion has this effect. Therefore, four studies were conducted in a real-world context to investigate this process. Results suggest that discussing a negative societal stereotype (relative to individual rumination in Studies 1 and 3 and alternative discussions in Studies 2 and 3) increases intentions to engage in discrimination against the out-group target of the stereotype. This is mediated by the formation of an in-group norm which supports discrimination (Study 1) and the extent to which the discussion validates the stereotype (Study 2). A fourth study manipulated the extent to which consensus on the negative stereotype was reached through discussion. When the discussion ended in consensus, participants have greater intention to undertake collective action against the stereotyped out-group, mediated by a congruent in-group norm. These results provide evidence that the process by which discussion increases intergroup discrimination is via the formation of discriminatory local group norms.

AB  - The paper considers the importance of epistemic justice in democratic life, and the significance of education as a key space to foster the relevant epistemic capabilities. Epistemic in/justice offers resources to think about conditions of possibility (what Amartya Sen calls conversion factors'), given that societies train our sensibilities in ways which are flawed and prejudiced. It is proposed further that Amartya Sen's emphasis on public reasoning is central to epistemic justice. Using the space of education to make the argument, core ideas in the capability approach are first outlined. Epistemic justice is described, and the claim is then advanced that Miranda Fricker's epistemic contribution capability' is generative in education settings for developing democratic and public reasoning capabilities. To be fully involved in learning and development and fair-achieved outcomes in formal education, students would need opportunities to develop their epistemic capability of being able both to receive information and to make interpretive contributions to the common pool of knowledge, understanding, and practical deliberation. Conditions of respect, recognition and equal moral worth would be required so that all students should have access to the capability and to have their contributions taken up as integral to their flourishing. Thus, in universities and schools, epistemic virtues should be educated, trained, developed and scaffolded pedagogically, including cultivating emotions. The paper then considers the challenge of free speech and what this may demand of us educationally.

AB  - Popular entertainment often involves political messages, and entertainment elements are now commonly used in politics coverage. This study examines how suspense drives impacts of political entertainment media content on attitudes, building on the "affective news" extended model. Hypotheses were tested with four texts on controversial political issues (within-subjects), presented in alinearorinverted-pyramidstructure and either asnewsorfiction. The resulting 2 x 2 x 3 x 4 online experiment (N= 227) showed that linear texts produced greater suspense and attitude change than inverted-pyramid texts. Suspense mediated attitude impacts. Both news and fiction versions influenced attitudes, with impacts still detectable 1 day after exposure.

AB  - Gender equality is essential to social justice and sustainable development in the higher education sector. An important aspect thereof is to promote equal opportunities for academic careers. This study investigates the current situation and possibilities for improvement in this regard from the perspectives of mid-career scientists in a sustainability-oriented university department. A survey of scientists from the postdoctoral to adjunct professor level (N = 82) in the Department of Environmental Systems Science (D-USYS) of ETH Zurich (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich) was thus conducted to investigate judgements, experiences, and ideas for improvement concerning equal career opportunities. About 90% of the respondents perceived no disadvantages based on gender, ethnicity, race, or faith. However, about 30% felt disadvantaged due to their age. Comments revealed not a single case in which latter disadvantages were based on prejudice. Instead, ETH-wide or national age and time-based restrictions for certain positions caused the inequality perceptions. Furthermore, comments indicated that these restrictions can disadvantage scientists taking care of children. Some participants suggested a revision or removal of corresponding rules. Further suggestions included an improved availability of childcare places. ETH Zurich recently undertook great efforts to provide excellent and affordable childcare services, increasing the number of available places by about 30% in the year following this survey.

AB  - Traditional notions in society are being eliminated; the idea that women can become leaders in society has gained acceptance. This study investigated women who participated in a Grundtvig project sponsored by the European Union (EU) entitled "Developing Women's Leadership Skills in Society." A phenomenological model was used. Qualitative data were collected using a semi-structured survey administered to a focus group of 32 women in Hendek, Sakarya; response frequencies were analyzed. The results, which demonstrate the importance of EU projects to social development, indicate that women have an interest in developing their personal skills to become leaders in society and that women increasingly believe that they can become leaders in'sOciety. However, women also believe that there are certain barriers to women's leadership in Turkey, including low levels of education among women, socio-cultural factors, and the responsibilities traditionally ascribed to women in a patriarchal system, such as caring for children and housework. To increase the number of women leaders in society, women should be supported and educated equally, relevant laws should be changed, prejudices that suggest that woiiien cannot be leaders should be eliminated, and quotas for women should be implemented to increase women's participation in politics.

AB  - This article presents the 2021 JSI special issue on intergroup contact, which we designed to offer a fresh outlook on a rapidly expanding literature on the antecedents, dynamics, and consequences of interactions between members of opposing groups in society-or intergroup contact. We start by discussing the results of a bibliographic search of intergroup contact research between 1937 and 2021 and organizing our analysis around two distinct phases of this research, as they are demarcated in volume and quality by Pettigrew and Tropp's landmark meta-analysis in 2006. We then turn our attention to an overview of the 12 review and commentary articles contributing to the special issue, which reflect advancements in themes, methodologies, and analytics of the last 15 years of research. We argue that this second generation of research has effectively addressed influential and legitimate critiques of the literature and, as a result, led to a more complex and nuanced understanding of intergroup contact that can now be readily harnessed by social cohesion practitioners and policy makers to increase the efficacy of contact-based interventions in society. We conclude by calling on a third generation of research on intergroup contact that fully harnesses diversity of ideas, peoples, and minds and keeps in close check unproductive dynamics that stifle scientific progress, and pose a threat to healthy and safe research communities. Together with the 50 diverse contributors of this special issue, we commit to making the intergroup contact research community, like the topic of intergroup contact itself, diverse and inclusive.

AB  - Within the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) and its 17 targets is a strong emphasis on the education of learners with disability. Whereas there have been massive improvements at lower levels regarding education of the marginalised, a lot more work remains undone at tertiary education level. In this discourse, we explore literature to reveal enablers and disablers to academic success of students with visual impairments (SwVI) at higher education level in the past 10years in 16 countries doted across six habitable continents. Emerging from the study is a host of disablers such as (1) negative attitudes, (2) absence of inclusive education policy, (3) inaccessible learning environment and learning materials, (4) exclusive pedagogy, and (5) limited orientation and mobility. Amidst the disabling environment, a positive attitude, self-advocacy, and innovativeness stood out as key enablers to academic success by SwVI. The findings contribute to the realisation of the SDG agenda through advocacy on inclusive education policies and practices.

AB  - Ethnic minority group members' responses to their prejudicial treatment can take several forms. One involves identity concealment (e.g., 'passing'). In order to understand such a response, we must explore participants' understandings of the interactional context before them, their meta-perceptions of the identity others ascribe to them, and the varied meanings that identity concealment/non-disclosure may have in that context. Our analysis of interview data (N = 30) obtained with Roma in Hungary reveals diverse forms of, and motivations for, the concealment of their Roma identity. Some participants reported examples of proactive identity concealment, others reported more reactive forms (in which they went along with others' mistaken assumptions concerning their identity). The motivations for identity concealment (whether proactive or reactive) included the desire to: secure material benefits; avoid conflict; take pleasure from seeing others' assumptions blinding them to the reality before them; test (and expose) majority group members' attitudes; allow themselves opportunities to experience the world in new ways. Our analysis highlights the importance of social identity researchers recognizing the diverse motivations for ethnic identity concealment: From the actors' perspective concealment is not always assimilatory, and in some contexts can be experienced as empowering.

AB  - Imagined contact is a relatively new technique designed to focus the accumulated knowledge of over 500 studies of intergroup contact into a simple and versatile prejudice-reduction intervention. While it is now clear that imagined contact can improve intergroup attitudes, its ability to change actual intergroup behavior is less well established. Some emerging findings provide cause for optimism with nonverbal, and unobtrusive measures of behavior. This paper extends this work by adopting methods from behavioral economics to examine more deliberative behavior. Participants believed they were playing a prisoner's dilemma with an outgroup member. They could choose whether to cooperate or compete with the other player. In three studies, we provide reliable evidence that imagined contact (vs. control) successfully encouraged more prosocial, cooperative choices. In the third study we show that this effect is mediated by increased trust towards the outgroup member. The findings demonstrate that imagined contact interventions can have a tangible impact on volitional intergroup behaviors.

AB  - Point source pollution by pesticide use poses serious challenges for soil and water quality, especially in developing countries, where heavy pesticide use is often noted. However, data on farmers' practices of waste disposal and factors affecting actual behavior are scarce. The current study dealt with farmers' practices and safety behavior in proper disposal of empty pesticide containers (EPC) in Ardabil Province, Iran, based on a survey with structured questionnaires. Almost 30% of the farmers mentioned that they were leaving EPC in the farm or throwing EPC in water canals, while the remaining farmers reported that they were burning EPC or throwing them in the common trash. Concerning information on proper disposal of EPC, almost one-third of the respondents (34.3%) had no information, while above half (56.3%) had very low or low information. On a scale from 1 to 5, farmers' showed relatively negative attitudes towards proper disposal of EPC. Moreover, farmers showed low levels of subjective norms and perceived behavioral control, i.e. they were not influenced by people around them in the proper management of EPC and had fair control of proper management of EPC. Therefore, farmers showed slightly negative intention and rather weak behavior to proper disposal of EPC. Attitudes and subjective norms showed a positive effect (P < 0.05) on farmers' intention towards disposal of EPC and farmers' intention showed a positive effect (P < 0.05) on actual behavior towards disposal of EPC. Findings provide novel fundamental information for more effective disposal schemes of EPC in the study area, where disposal of pesticide waste is insufficient. Promoting attitudes towards proper disposal of EPC through information from peers or important individuals to farmers can be targeted for promoting environmentally friendly behavior of farmers with proper practices of EPC disposal after use.

AB  - Consumer-run programs (CRPs) are prevalent and evidence shows that they provide effective services to those with severe mental illnesses. Despite this, low levels of awareness of and negative attitudes toward CRPs persist on the part of professionals. Since mental health educators train these professionals, we explored their attitudes and awareness, with the idea that educators may pass their biases on to students.
   In addition to CRP awareness and attitudes, another goal of this study was to determine to what extent consumer content is being included in curricula. A survey research design was used to explore these questions among faculty members nationwide.
   Findings show positive attitudes and high levels of awareness among faculty in social work, but low levels of inclusion of consumer content in mental health courses. Several findings contradict expectation and need further exploration.

AB  - Providing undocumented immigrants access to public education remains a pertinent issue facing both institutions of higher education and state governments. While instate resident tuition (ISRT) has remained a contentious policy, little is known about how such policies, as well as other state contexts, influence college students' attitudes toward unauthorized immigrant students' educational access. Using three-level multilevel models, we sought to understand how political, economic, and demographic contexts at the institutional and state level affect the development of US citizen students' views toward undocumented immigrants' access to public education during their undergraduate years. After controlling for student-level effects, findings show that institutional variables such as selectivity, control, and percentage of low-income students enrolled contribute to students' attitude development. At the state level, findings show that students who attend institutions within states that have ISRT policies have more positive views towards undocumented immigrants' access to public education at the end of college. This research highlights the critical need for higher education researchers, institutional leaders, and policy makers to better understand how institutional and state contexts shape students' understanding of larger sociopolitical issues.

AB  - This exploratory study makes a contribution to the literature on antiracism by analyzing how first-generation French Blacks of sub-Saharan African descent practice everyday antiracism. In doing so, it expands the demographic terrain of this research to highlight some particularities in the experience of everyday racism and antiracism for ethnoracial minorities of immigrant origins. In addition to experiencing forms of racism encountered by both immigrants and other native ethnoracial minorities, first-generation French Blacks (like other non-White first-generation Europeans), face symbolic exclusion from the national community and delegitimization of their claims to Europeanness. Examining their experiences sheds light on how race, immigration, and national identity intersect to generate unique experiences of racism and antiracism. This paper also contributes to our understanding of how social context shapes the range of everyday antiracist strategies at a person's disposal. Specifically, integrating Kasinitz et al.'s (2008) framework for categorizing incidents of racial discrimination and prejudice with Fleming et al.'s (2010) categorization of responses to stigmatization, I present an analysis of antiracist responses that takes into account both the nature of the relationship between the victim and the perpetrator of racism (i.e., impersonal vs. personal) and the social context in which the encounter occurs (e. g., school, work, public space, etc). In doing so, I highlight how the conditions of a given incident of racism or discrimination set constraints on the range of antiracist responses an individual can practically (or feasibly) employ.

AB  - Background: A tremendous number of girls in Yemen are still subjected to female genital cutting (FGC), which carries an increased risk of health complications and violates children's rights. This study describes the prevalence of FGC in four Yemeni provinces and investigates the determinants of FGC.
   Methods: We analyzed data from women aged 15 to 49 years who responded to a sub-national household survey conducted in six rural districts of four Yemeni provinces in 2008-2009. Logistic regression was used to estimate the association between individual and household socioeconomic factors and FGC practices and attitudes.
   Results: The prevalence of women's FGC was 48% while daughters' FGC was 34%. Almost 45.8% of the women surveyed believe the FGC practice should discontinue. Higher odds of FGC practice and positive attitude towards it were associated with older age, family marriage, and lower tertiles of wealth and education indices. Early marriage was also associated with increased odds of FGC practice (p < 0.01).
   Conclusions: Socioeconomic indices and other individual factors associated with FGC are differing and complex. Younger generations of women are more likely to not have FGC and to express negative attitudes towards the tradition. Appropriate strategies to invest in girls' education and women's empowerment with effective engagement of religious and community leaders might support the change of attitudes and practice of FGC in the younger generation.

AB  - Recent scholarship on the social history of health and medicine in colonial India has moved beyond enclavist or hegemonic aspects of imperial medicine and has rather focused on the role of Indian intermediaries and the fractured nature of colonial hegemony. Drawing inspiration from this scholarship, the article highlights the significance of the Indian subordinates in the lock hospital system in the nineteenth century Madras Presidency. This study focuses on a class of Indian subordinates called the "gomastah", who were employed to detect clandestine prostitution in Madras to control the spread of venereal disease. It also underlines the role of other native and non-native subordinates such as Dhais, Chowdranies and Matrons, the ways in which they became indispensable for the smoother operation of the Contagious Diseases Act and the lock hospitals on a day-to-day basis. By emphasising how Indian subordinates were able to bring in caste biases within colonial governmentality, adding another layer to the colonial prejudices and xenophobia against the native population, it underlines the fact that there was not a one-way appropriation or facilitation of the coloniser's knowledge or biases by the colonised intermediaries. Rather, it argues for an interaction between them, and highlights the complexities of caste hierarchies and prejudice within the everyday colonial governmentality. Moreover, the article focuses on the consequent chaos and inherent power struggle between different factions of colonial staff.

AB  - To examine the predictors of adolescents' evaluations of affirmative action and school desegregation policies, African American and European American students (ns = 94 and 116, respectively; aged 14 to 17 years) attending a racially diverse high school in the Midwestern United States completed measures of (a) implicit racial attitudes, (b) knowledge about historical racism, and (c) perceptions of and attributions for racial disparities. The following day, adolescents learned about either a proposed affirmative action policy (n = 101) or a school desegregation policy (n = 109) and completed measures of their attitudes toward the policy. Results indicated racial differences in policy support and in the factors predicting policy support. Theoretical implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Background and Purpose: The development of scholarship on Malaysian Literature in English (MLiE) continuously receives attention, especially on one particular direction, which is the studies of the Malays. Inspired by the Malay proverb "Diluah mati mak, ditelan mati bapa" (Malay for 'between the devil and the deep sea), this study looked into local literature in relation to powerlessness and its social complexity where we argue that the Malays are often caught in-between entanglements that prohibit individualism, as due to societal prejudice.
   Methodology: This study employed thematic analysis where upon familiarizing with Azhari's short stories, namely Mariah and of Bunga Telur and Bally shoes, the researchers identified themes that help understand the types and causes of powerlessness as illustrated in the short stories before associating the Malays' state of powerlessness and their emotional suppression.
   Findings: Findings revealed that both genders suffer from the Malay prejudice and their own lack of emotional strength, causing both to be powerless captives in different contexts, unlike the Western societies where similar situations might lead to alienation.
   Contributions: The study contributed towards the understanding of social phenomenon, namely issues regarding powerlessness among the Malays. Such contribution is significant at developing potentials within building national talent, especially those regarding family and spiritual values.

AB  - The issue with most studies concerned with mate selection preferences in humans is that they rely on declarations and rational actions of experimental subjects, which are affected by their pre-conceived opinions and prejudices. Moreover, current research suggests that subcortical structures and processes, rather than the neocortex, play the principal role in actual partner choice behaviour. Consequently, we have only limited information on how relevant our current knowledge is in relation to real-life human ethology. To address these issues, we surveyed 2718 women and 4073 men between the ages of 16-50 and compared their declared and observed preferences for various properties in short-term and Long-term partners. We found differences between what the subjects declared to prefer and what they preferred in reality: for example, men declared that wealth was the second least desirable property out of eleven in short-term partners, but we observed that in reality, they considered wealth the third most important factor after charisma and sense of humour. Similarly, while women declared that dominance and masculinity were desirable properties in short-term partners, in the observational part of the study, they showed little preference for these traits. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of the phase of the menstrual cycle, hormonal contraception, pregnancy, and partnership and parenthood status on these preferences. We found some support for the good parents hypothesis and no support for the good genes and the immunocompetence handicap hypotheses when observed, rather than declared preferences were considered. We also detected that hormonal contraception, and parenthood and partnership status influenced declared preferences in considerable ways, but had only a small, if any, impact on observed preferences. We suggest interpreting the results of studies reliant on declarations and rational actions of experimental subjects with great caution.

AB  - Scott, Inbar and Rozin (2016) reported an association between greater disgust sensitivity (DS) and more negative attitudes towards genetically modified (GM) food. Royzman, Cusimano and Leeman (2017) replicated this association but argued that fear, not disgust, is the primary emotion associated with negative GM food attitudes. We believe that this conclusion is premature, because the "high-granularity" disgust scale variants on which it is based are theoretically and statistically questionable. We explain the issues with these disgust scale variants and report direct evidence showing that people respond to GM food with disgust more than fear.

AB  - AIMS: Personal cannabis use is common across New Zealand, and an upcoming referendum will enable the public to vote on whether this should be legalised. The present research aimed to examine the attitudes of midlife New Zealand adults on cannabis use and legalisation, and to identify potential predictors of those attitudes.
   METHODS: At age 40, 899 participants drawn from the Christchurch Health and Development Study were interviewed about the perceived harmfulness of cannabis use, opinions on legalisation for recreational use and supply, and the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. In addition, a range of potential predictors of legislative attitudes were examined.
   RESULTS: We identified a wide range of attitudes across the cohort, however the majority tended to hold a neutral view. More than 80% of the cohort expressed support for medicinal cannabis, while 47.8% supported decriminalisation, and 26.8% expressed support for legalisation for recreational use. The strongest predictors of support for legalisation were prior use of cannabis and other drugs, while additional positive predictors included a history of depression, Maori ancestry, parental drug use, novelty seeking and higher educational attainment. Predictors of more negative attitudes were also identified, and included female gender and having dependent children.
   CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide insight into cannabis-related views within the New Zealand context, and may help to predict voting behaviour during the 2020 Cannabis Referendum.

AB  - Objective: The clergy in sub-Saharan Africa play a major role in the care and pathways to orthodox mental health services of the mentally ill. Their attitudes concerning mental illnesses would influence community mental health intervention efforts. This study aimed to determine the attitudes of clergy towards persons with mental illness. Method: A cross-sectional survey of clergy (n=107) of the Christian and Muslim faiths was conducted, using a socio-demographic questionnaire and the 40-item Community Attitudes towards Mental Illness (CAMI) scale. Results: Stigmatizing attitudes were evident among members of the clergy surveyed. Most (71.1%) believed the mentally ill were different from other persons, while 68.2% were of the opinion that the mentally ill should be controlled like children. Over 80% of respondents were not comfortable with the idea of the mentally ill living in their vicinity and wanted mental health hospitals situated out of residential areas. Almost half of respondents (45.8%) were uncomfortable with women who were once mentally ill baby-sitting and 63.2% agreed that our mental hospitals seem more like prisons than where the mentally ill can be cared for. Conclusion: Negative attitudes towards the mentally ill were widespread among the clergy sampled. Mental health professionals need to take proactive steps to improve the mental health knowledge of the clergy which may facilitate their roles in the pathway to mental health care.

AB  - There is a dearth of studies that have examined the attitudes of society toward people with intellectual disabilities (IDs) on a global scale. This study set out to gauge the extent to which ID continues to be stigmatized and to which initiatives are in place to increase their inclusion and tackle stigma around the globe. Data were collected using a web survey from 667 experts and organizations in the (intellectual) disability field pertaining to 88 countries and covering all world regions. Information about the study was disseminated by four multinational disability organizations, and the survey was available in five languages. Findings and responses indicated that the general public in many parts of the world broadly support the fundamental principle of inclusion of children and adults with IDs, yet negative attitudes persist. High levels of stigma and denial of fundamental rights still appeared a reality in many places. Initiatives to tackle stigma appeared patchy and least in evidence where they were most needed. In many parts of the world the life chances of people with IDs often appear still very poor, and support and advocacy almost entirely their families' responsibility. More needs to be done globally to reduce the stigma associated with ID and to promote active engagement and regular social interactions between persons with IDs and their fellow citizens without IDs.

AB  - Sophisticated algorithms are used daily to search through hundreds of medical journals in order to package updated medical insights into commercial databases. Healthcare practitioners can access these searchable databases-called Point of Care (PoC) tools-as downloadable apps on their smartphones or tablets to comprehensively and efficiently inform patient diagnosis and treatment. Because racist biases are unintentionally incorporated into the search reports that the companies generate and that practitioners regularly access, the aim of this article is to examine how healthcare practitioners' "pre-existing" racial stereotypes interact with pithy conclusions about race and ethnicity in PoC tools. I use qualitative research methods (content analysis, discourse analysis, open-ended semi-structured interviews, and role play) to frame the analysis within the Public Health Critical Race Praxis (PHCRP). This approach facilitates an understanding of how biological racism-the use of scientific evidence to support inherent differences between races-that is embedded in PoC algorithms informs a practitioner's assessment of a patient, and converges with persistent racial bias in medical training, medical research and healthcare. I contextualize the study with one semi-structured interview with an Editor of a leading PoC tool, MedScope (pseudonomized), and 10 semi-structured interviews with healthcare practitioners in S.E. Ontario, Canada. The article concludes that PoC tools and practitioners' personal biases contribute to racial prejudices in healthcare provision. This warrants further research on racial bias in medical literature and curriculum design in medical school.

AB  - The threat of COVID-19 has triggered nationalism, prejudice and support for anti-democratic political systems around the world. Authoritarianism-an individual's orientation toward social conformity and individual autonomy-shapes interpretations of and responses to threat. We drew on theories of authoritarianism and threat to propose that authoritarians and libertarians will interpret the threat of COVID-19 in distinct ways. An online survey of 368 Scottish nationals was administered via the Prolific platform. Original measures of realistic and symbolic threat from COVID-19 were included, along with an established measure of the authoritarian predisposition. Linear regression analyses showed that COVID-19 was perceived primarily as a realistic threat to physical and material well-being; however, authoritarians were more likely than others to interpret the novel coronavirus as a symbolic threat to their prevailing values. Our findings contribute to understanding the psychology of pandemic-era attitudes and behaviours and provide insight into possible political consequences of the coronavirus threat. The results also demonstrate how considering authoritarians' subjective construal of threats can resolve questions in the authoritarianism and threat literature and advance theory.

AB  - Background: Scientific excellence is one of the most fundamental underpinnings of medical education and its relevance is unquestionable. To be involved in research activities enhances students' critical thinking and problem-solving capacities, which are mandatory competences for new achievements in patient care and consequently to the improvement of clinical practice. Purposes: This work aimed to study the relevance given by Portuguese medical students to a core of scientific skills, and their judgment about their own ability to execute those skills. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on students attending the first, fourth and sixth years of medical course in the same period. An assessment istrument, exploring the importance given by Portuguese medical students to scientific skills in high school, to clinical practice and to their own ability to execute them, was designed, adapted and applied specifically to this study. Results: Students' perceptions were associated with gender, academic year, previous participation in research activities, positive and negative attitudes toward science, research integration into the curriculum and motivation to undertake research. The viewpoint of medical students about the relevance of scientific skills overall, and the ability to execute them, was independently associated with motivation to be enrolled in research. Conclusions: These findings have meaningful implications in medical education regarding the inclusion of a structural research program in the medical curriculum. Students should be aware that clinical practice would greatly benefit from the enrollment in research activities. By developing a solid scientific literacy future physicians will be able to apply new knowledge in patient care.

AB  - Introduction: This paper describes implementation results as part of a larger three-arm, cluster randomized controlled trial that compared two curriculum interventions to prevent teen pregnancy with a control condition. The intervention of focus is an enhanced version of Reducing the Risk to Prevent Pregnancy, STD and HIV (Kirby, Barth, Leland, & Fetro, 1991; Langley et al., 2015), which is a comprehensive sex education program appropriate for youth ages 14-19. Method: In order to standardize the delivery of this teen pregnancy prevention education curriculum to high-risk youth across 39 presentations, in 23 different community-based organizations, by dyads involving 16 facilitators, researchers utilized two implementation frameworks to guide program delivery and developed several fidelity measurement tools to assess adherence, dosage, quality of intervention delivery, participant responsiveness, and program differentiation . Results: These efforts resulted in high fidelity to the curriculum. There also were high levels of youth engagement as indicated both by self-reports and observed by facilitators who created cohesive groups. Results also found that training quality, alliance with facilitators and group cohesion positively impacted attitude change and gains in knowledge. Discussion: Issues related to balancing adherence to evidence-based curricula and being responsive to youth needs are discussed.

AB  - This research examined the impact of a crisis on product attitudes and emotions of consumers in Norway and Russia, and the effectiveness of crisis marketing communication using authority endorsement across and within the two countries. Our research shows that not only are different communication strategies effective in the two markets, but also that those that work well in one country may actually worsen the crisis and lead to more negative attitudes and emotions in the other country. We conclude that research needs to incorporate country-level, individual-level dimensions of culture and consumer emotions in order to develop optimal marketing communication strategies.

AB  - Many disability advocates and professionals believe they will recognize community inclusion when they see it, yet inclusion is a nuanced subjective construct that may hold a somewhat different meaning for each person. A comparison of the disability movement and accessibility laws and policies reveals community inclusion to be an ideal repeatedly sought by individuals with disabilities and advocates alike. This article recounts national and international efforts toward inclusion and suggests some reasons why these have fallen short. Research has revealed that limited financial resources, inadequate social supports and transportation, and unwelcoming or negative reciprocal attitudes are important community barriers to inclusion. These barriers are significant to all individuals with disabilities but especially to persons with intellectual disabilities (ID). Regarding ID in the context of person-environment interactions, the authors suggest that other significant barriers to community inclusion may be found in the built environment and result from negative attitudes of the professionals responsible for its creation. Because the built environment plays a substantial role in community inclusion for individuals with ID, it is important to ensure the congruency of designers' attitudes with the philosophies that underlie accessible design and inclusion. The authors suggest that the negative attitudes of the creators of the built environment may be amenable to change through education. The authors highlight the need for an integrated and preventive interdisciplinary educational approach, particularly targeting design professionals, as one meaningful step toward creating truly inclusive and disability-friendly communities.

AB  - In this article, the authors analyse attitudes of Slovenian political elites towards EU and the process of European integration on general in the period of crisis. Namely, during the EU accession period, there was a strong consensus among political elites and in general public on desirability of country's integration into European institutional framework. However, the 2008 crisis that strongly affected Slovenian economy and society brought the rise of negative attitudes towards EU and other Western supra-national political entities. The main thesis is that the Europeanness of Slovenian political elites is rather ambivalent since its attitudes are diverging and often inconsistent.

AB  - Background: There is a paucity of evidence on how to train medical students to provide equitable, high quality care to racial and ethnic minority patients. We test the hypothesis that medical schools' ability to foster a learning orientation toward interracial interactions (i.e., that students can improve their ability to successfully interact with people of another race and learn from their mistakes), will contribute to white medical students' readiness to care for racial minority patients. We then test the hypothesis that white medical students who perceive their medical school environment as supporting a learning orientation will benefit more from disparities training.
   Methods: Prospective observational study involving web-based questionnaires administered during first (2010) and last (2014) semesters of medical school to 2394 white medical students from a stratified, random sample of 49 U.S. medical schools. Analysis used data from students' last semester to build mixed effects hierarchical models in order to assess the effects of medical school interracial learning orientation, calculated at both the school and individual (student) level, on key dependent measures.
   Results: School differences in learning orientation explained part of the school difference in readiness to care for minority patients. However, individual differences in learning orientation accounted for individual differences in readiness, even after controlling for school-level learning orientation. Individual differences in learning orientation significantly moderated the effect of disparities training on white students' readiness to care for minority patients. Specifically, white medical students who perceived a high level of learning orientation in their medical schools regarding interracial interactions benefited more from training to address disparities.
   Conclusions: Coursework aimed at reducing healthcare disparities and improving the care of racial minority patients was only effective when white medical students perceived their school as having a learning orientation toward interracial interactions. Results suggest that medical school faculty should present interracial encounters as opportunities to practice skills shown to reduce bias, and faculty and students should be encouraged to learn from one another about mistakes in interracial encounters. Future research should explore aspects of the medical school environment that contribute to an interracial learning orientation.

KW  - PERCEPTION
KW  - COUNTRY
AB  - This study aimed to investigate through free word association the perception of Brazilian consumers regarding the possibility of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus through food. One thousand individuals answered the questionnaire via an online platform. Most cited terms (hygiene-8%, fear-8%, caution-5%) and categories (negative attitudes and feeling-72% and sanitization-60%) were related to overall COVID-19 infection rather than their specific infection through the food. The perception of the possibility of risk of this type of cross-contamination was greater for male participants, within the food field, with high income (>10 minimum wages), and from the midwest region. Nonetheless, there are still doubts regarding this possibility, especially for participants with low income (<= 10 minimum wages), females, higher education (>= secondary school), who exercise professional activity outside the food sector and from most regions of Brazil. Practical applications Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was discovered 2 years ago, the emergence of new variants such as Omicron has increased infection and mortality rates worldwide. A possible way of COVID-19 infection is cross-contamination through food handling and contact surfaces if preventive measures are not applied. In this context, understanding the consumer perception from a continental-size country such as Brazil, with a wide variety of socioeconomic profiles, is crucial to minimize the severe impacts of the pandemic. Our study demonstrates the need to disseminate scientific information in different media to reduce misinformation, especially social media because most Brazilian consumers had doubts and uncertainties about the possibility of COVID-19 infection from cross-contamination through food.

AB  - Integrating psychoanalytic ideas of group idealisation with social identity and categorisation theories, this article discusses the distinction between secure and defensive in-group positivity. Narcissistic in-group positivity captures a belief in in-group greatness that is contingent on external validation. It reflects defensive in-group positivity, insofar as it stems from the frustration of individual needs, and predicts increased sensitivity to threats as well as undesirable consequences for out-groups and the in-group. Secure in-group positivity-that is, in-group positivity without the narcissistic component-is a confidently held positive evaluation of one's in-group that is independent of the recognition of the group in the eyes of others. It stems from the satisfaction of individual needs, is resilient to threats and has positive consequences for the in-group and out-groups. I review evidence for these two distinct ways people relate to their social groups and discuss theoretical and practical implications for understanding intra-and intergroup relations.

AB  - Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is an infectious disease of cattle which substantially contributes to poor productivity of the sub-Saharan pastoral livestock sector. In Nigeria and most of the West African countries, limited public funding for CBPP control have necessitated farmers to bear a bigger burden of managing the disease. Understanding the factors influencing decision of farmers to implement disease control programmes is therefore a key element in informing future policies aimed at improving CBPP management. This study explored perceptions of Nigerian Fulani pastoral herdsmen on the responsibility for cattle healthcare, and identified their circumstances and motivations in implementing CBPP management programmes. Field data were collected from 191 pastoral farmers using a semi-structured, interviewer-administered questionnaire. The results indicated that younger farmers were more likely than their older counterpart to accept the responsibility for CBPP management (p < 0.01). This may signal future prospects for improved CBPP management where upcoming farmers could be encouraged to implement CBPP control programmes and uphold the costs. 13.6% of the farmers had no intention of implementing any CBPP control programme on farm, while 81.2% either had a positive intention or implemented at least one programme aimed at controlling CBPP. Intention to implement CBPP control programmes was significantly associated with educational attainment of farmers (p < 0.01) and their access to CBPP control services offered by trained veterinarians (p < 0.01). Farmers with negative attitudes towards implementing CBPP control programmes could be motivated to change their perspectives by advice from trusted sources and improved access to veterinary services. Conversely, farmers with positive attitudes towards implementing CBPP control programmes were more likely to be motivated by affordable veterinary services and advocacy on specific CBPP control programmes. As such, the former group of farmers will be more likely to benefit from programmes which focus on providing credible information from trusted sources, such as extension agents, veterinarians or successful peers. On the contrary, interventions targeting the latter group of farmers should prioritize cost-effective delivery of improved CBPP control technologies.

AB  - Bruneau et al. show that a five-minute video intervention is able to effectively promote support for the reintegration of former Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces combatants into Colombian society.
   Whereas politicians broker peace deals, it falls to the public to embrace peace and help sustain it. The legacy of conflicts can make it difficult for people to support reconciling and reintegrating with former enemies. Here we create a five-minute media intervention from interviews we conducted with Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC) ex-combatants in a Colombian demobilization camp and non-FARC Colombians in neighbouring communities. We show that exposure to the media intervention humanizes FARC ex-combatants and increases support for peace and reintegration. These effects persisted at least three months post-exposure, were replicated in an independent sample of non-FARC Colombians and affected both attitudes (for example, support for reintegration policies) and behaviour (for example, donations to organizations supporting ex-combatants). As predicted, the intervention's effects were mediated by changing conflict-associated cognitions-reducing the belief that ex-combatants are unwilling and unable to change-beyond affective pathways (for example, increased empathy or reduced prejudice).

AB  - Collectively blaming groups for the actions of individuals can license vicarious retribution. Acts of terrorism by Muslim extremists against innocents, and the spikes in anti-Muslim hate crimes against innocent Muslims that follow, suggest that reciprocal bouts of collective blame can spark cycles of violence. How can this cycle be short-circuited? After establishing a link between collective blame of Muslims and anti-Muslim attitudes and behavior, we used an interventions tournament to identify a successful intervention (among many that failed). The winning intervention reduced collective blame of Muslims by highlighting hypocrisy in the ways individuals collectively blame Muslimsbut not other groups (White Americans, Christians)for individual group members' actions. After replicating the effect in an independent sample, we demonstrate that a novel interactive activity that isolates the psychological mechanism amplifies the effectiveness of the collective blame hypocrisy intervention and results in downstream reductions in anti-Muslim attitudes and anti-Muslim behavior.

Unlike general forums confrontation-initiated forums had more ad hominem acts. Posts with compared to posts without ad hominem acts had fewer reasoning activities and delimitors. General colorism forums were the most civil and developed, findings that have implications for designing online forums.

AB  - Many students continue in traditional (legacy) curricula during curricular reform. Little is known about the impact of the reform process on legacy students or about their perspectives on any new curriculum. In focus groups conducted 7-8 months following the introduction of an innovative curriculum, legacy students reported support for the new curriculum and perceived no negative impact on their education. The legacy students reported reduced ability to assist first year students, and negative attitudes from first years towards the legacy curriculum. They also perceived reduced participation in the student-run free clinic and other activities by students in the new curriculum.

AB  - Extending the group affirmation literature to the domain of prejudice, this study investigated whether group affirmation buffers the self-esteem of women exposed to blatant sexism. In accordance with Self-Affirmation Theory and group affirmation research, we hypothesized that when one aspect of the collective self is threatened (gender identity), self-esteem can be maintained via the affirmation of an alternative aspect of the collective self. In a 2 x 2 between-participants design, female students were randomly assigned to read about discrimination directed toward women or a non-self-relevant disadvantaged group (the Inuit). All then participated in a (fictitious) second study, in which half completed a group affirmation manipulation (wrote about the top three values of a self-defining group) and half completed a control writing exercise. The self-esteem of women who were threatened by sexism, but group affirmed, was protected from the negative effects of perceiving sexism.

AB  - Objective Depression is among the most common and debilitating nonmotor complaints in Parkinson's disease (PD), yet there is a paucity of controlled research to guide treatment. Little research has focused on the extent to which specific depressive symptom profiles may dictate unique clinical recommendations to ultimately improve treatment outcomes. The current study examined the impact of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) on different types of depressive symptoms in PD. It was hypothesized that the cognitive (eg, guilt, rumination, and negative attitudes towards self) and behavioral (eg, avoidance and procrastination) symptoms targeted most intensively by the treatment protocol would show the most robust response. The extent to which stabilized antidepressant use moderated specific symptom change was examined on an exploratory basis. Method Eighty depressed people with PD participated in a randomized controlled trial of CBT plus clinical management, versus clinical management only. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) subscale scores, reflecting depressive symptom heterogeneity in PD, were the focus of this investigation. Results CBT response was associated with significant improvements in mood, sleep, anxiety, and somatic symptoms (HAMD), and negative attitudes toward self, performance impairment, and somatic symptoms (BDI). As hypothesized, the largest effect sizes were observed for cognitive and behavioral (vs somatic) symptoms of depression. Stabilized antidepressant use moderated the effect of CBT on somatic complaints (HAMD and BDI). Conclusions CBT may improve a diverse array of depressive symptoms in PD. Cognitive and behavioral (vs somatic) symptoms showed the greatest change. Combining CBT with antidepressants may help optimize the management of somatic complaints in depression in PD (dPD).

AB  - The study aimed to validate the Health Care Provider HIV/AIDS Stigma Scale among medical staff in China. The validation was conducted in four steps from March to December 2017: translation and back-translation; content validity test with six experts; test-retest reliability testing with 63 medical staff with 2 weeks interval; and structural validation with 349 medical staff from 52 hospitals with a convenience sample,using exploratory factor analysis,including principal component analysis and varimax rotation. The scale content validity index average was 0.88, while for test-retest reliability, the ICC was 0.87. Three factors of "discrimination", "prejudice" and "stereotype" with 16 items were extracted and explained 59.61% variance. The Cronbach's alpha value for the total scale was of 0.88, and for the three factors, the values were 0.89, 0.86 and 0.74, respectively. The discrimination factor showed identical means between Canadian medical students and Chinese medical staff, while the prejudice and stereotype factors had higher mean scores in the Chinese sample. The three-factor structure of Health Care Provider HIV/AIDS Stigma Scale was confirmed in Chinese medical staff with a simpler solution. This could provide a basis for trans-cultural application and comparison.

AB  - Consumers have described retargeted ads as "creepy," possibly because these ads cue consumers that marketers are collecting personal data. Participants (N = 280) were either exposed to an ad that was targeted to past online behaviors or a general product ad. Behavioral targeting had a positive direct effect on purchase intent, but it also set off a negative indirect effect. Those exposed to behavioral targeting experienced increased perceived marketing surveillance, which led to increased threat, increased psychological reactance, negative attitudes toward the ad, and negative purchase intention. The indirect cost of perceived marketing surveillance on purchase intent was 4.5 percent.

AB  - Self-determination and the ability to express opinions and preferences are fundamental to all people. Some people with intellectual disability no longer accept a subordinated role as disabled and new self-advocacy groups have evolved. The aim of this study was to analyse the meaning and importance of engagement in a self-advocacy group for self-advocates daily life and identity. An interpretative abductive approach was used to analyse data from interviews with 26 self-advocates from six self-advocacy groups in Sweden in relation to the theoretical concepts; recognition, social capital, culture capital and self-determination. The key finding is that the vast majority of the participants experienced a changed self-perception, as more skilled, social and confident people, depending on group affiliation, their personal engagement and positions within the group. The conclusion is that self-advocacy is important for daily life and identity of people with intellectual disability. The self-organized movements indicate an important change in society and the results are of importance not only for the target group but for shaping future support and treatment from society of people with intellectual disability.

AB  - Background: The determinants of medical students' attitudes to communication skills training have for long been a concern among medical educationalists. The present study was undertaken to assess the attitudes of undergraduate medical students towards the teaching of learning communication skills courses and their determinants.
   Methods: A total of 472 undergraduate medical students from the Universiti Sains Malaysia participated in this study. Students' attitudes were measured using a modified communication skills attitude scale (CSAS). Univariate and multivariate statistics were applied to find the correlates to students' attitudes.
   Results: More than 95% of the students desired to learn communication skills. The majority of the students preferred formal courses on communication skills during their clinical training years. Demographic characteristics, e.g. gender and place of family residence, and education-related characteristics such as a preference for a formal communication skills training program during clinical years, and perception of a curriculum content overload were identified as the important determinants of students' attitudes towards learning communication skills.
   Conclusions: The demographic and education-related profiles of the participating medical students should be considered when designing a communication skills teaching program. Further studies are recommended to explore the underlying causes of less interest from rural students and the negative attitudes of male students towards learning communication skills.

KW  - PREJUDICE
AB  - This study models the effects on attitudes and behaviour of intergroup contact between minority-status Chinese residents and majority-status residents in the Tuscan city of Prato in Italy. The study contributes to theory by building upon Allport's original contact thesis through modelling the effects of intimate and non-intimate contact on behaviour, over and above their effects on attitudes in a setting in which a high proportion of the minority-status residents are international migrants. Results indicate that neither friendship nor non-friendship contact have significant effects on minority Chinese residents' attitudes towards majority-status residents; however, minority Chinese residents who report having more friends among majority-status residents report more positive behaviour towards them. This result demonstrates the utility of not only differentiating between more intimate friendship contact and incidental non-friendship contact, but also differentiating between attitudinal and behavioural measures in the assessment of intergroup relations.

AB  - Background The aging population has become a serious challenge for health care service and will lead to an increasing demand for nurses to work with older people. However, working with older people has always been an unpopular career choice among nursing students. This study aimed to further explore the willingness and associated factors of undergraduate nursing students to work with older people in China. Methods A convenience sampling method was employed from May to July 2017 among undergraduate nursing students from a nursing school in Nantong China. Demographic data, the Chinese version of the Kogan's Old Person's Scale, the Chinese version of the Facts of Aging Quiz and the motivation questionnaire were used to collect data. A series of Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, Spearman correlation test and Ordinal logistic regression analysis were applied to analyze the data. Results Of the 853 students surveyed, 38.1 % were willing to work with older people after graduation. Expectancy, interest, attainment value, cost, prejudice, whether they like nursing profession and whether they participated in elderly-related activities were the most significant predictors of the students' willingness to work with older people. Conclusions Nursing students expressed a low level of willingness to work with older people upon graduation. Nursing educators have an important part in challenging students' stereotype of older people and inspire their career choice in caring for older people through both well-designed curriculum and elderly-related activities, and relevant education departments should actively optimize aged-related courses, strengthen professional ethics and gratitude education, and improve nursing students' sense of identity and mission in caring for older people, so as to improve their willingness to work with older people.

AB  - Julien Freund (1921-93) was a French sociologist and political theorist who taught at the University of Strasbourg in the 1960s and 1970s. Although he is the author of over two dozen books, Freund remained throughout his lifetime something of a marginal figure in his own country. Yet, strangely, Freund is now receiving more scholarly attention in France than ever before. The question is why? This paper attempts to provide an answer by looking at Freund's attempt to establish an alternative intellectual canon in France that was heavily indebted to the German tradition of political realism. The story begins with Freund's early relationship with Raymond Aron, and suggests, perhaps provocatively, that Freund is responsible for luring Aron back into his studies on Max Weber dating from the 1930s. It then moves on to explore Freund's relationship with Carl Schmitt. Freund became Schmitt's closest French friend and, for forty years, exhibited a veritable obsession with disseminating Schmitt's work in France. Finally, it suggests that recent attempts by those who wish to place Freund within a current tradition of French liberalism are mistaken. Instead Freund must be placed within a German Neue Rechte context, and specifically his desire to introduce the German tradition of political realism into France. In the end the article argues that the French Nouvelle Droitewith its stress on the cultural and ethnic foundations of the nation-statepushed Freund's political thought in a decidedly anti-liberal and seemingly pseudo-fascist direction.

AB  - In 2012, the U.S. actress Cynthia Nixon was quoted in the New York Times Magazine as having stated that for me, it [being gay] is a choice. I understand that for many people it's not, but for me it's a choice, and you don't get to define my gayness for me. The interview attracted international media attention and public criticism by lesbian and gay activists. This article suggests a rhetorical approach to understanding etiological beliefs and provides a discursive analysis of 198 online comments by readers of Pink News, a gay news Web site that reported on Nixon's controversial interview. This article explores common arguments used in readers' comments about Nixon and examines the rhetorical construction of sexuality. The analysis examines three themes within the data. First, biological essentialism was treated by many readers as common knowledge; second, readers suggested that only bisexuals have choice; and, third, it was suggested by both Nixon's critics and her supporters that counterarguments colluded with homophobia. The article suggests that there is an ideological dilemma whereby both born-this-way and choice arguments can be understood as colluding with anti-gay prejudice.

AB  - Aim To determine changes in sexual behaviors and other relevant characteristics related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and sexually transmitted infection (STI) risks among young Croatian adults.
   Method We surveyed adults aged 18-24 in 2005 (n = 1092) and 18-25 in 2010 (n = 1005). Both samples were probabilistic and stratified by county, settlement size, age, and gender. The samples were non-matched. Trained interviewers conducted structured face-to-face interviews in participants' households. The part of the questionnaire assessing sensitive information was self-administered.
   Results A majority of participants at both survey points (85.2%-86.2%) were sexually active. Median age at sexual debut (17 years) remained unchanged. Lifetime number of sexual partners was also stable. More women than men reported only one lifetime sexual partner. The prevalence of condom use at first intercourse increased (from 62.6 to 70%, P = 0.002), while the prevalence of condom use at most recent sexual intercourse remained stable (54% in 2005 and 54.7% in 2010). Consistent condom use also remained unchanged. Consistent condom use in the past year was reported by 19.2% participants in 2005 nad 20% in 2010.. At both survey points for both genders, consistent condom use was associated with age (odds ratio [ OR] (W2005) = 0.74, P = 0.004; OR (W2010) = 0.72, P < 0.001; OR (M2005) = 0.73, P < 0.001; OR (M2010) = 0.80, P = 0.006), negative attitudes toward condom use (OR (W2005) = 0.84, P = 0.001; OR (W2010) = 0.90, P = 0.026; OR (M2005) = 0.92, P = 0.032; OR (M2010) = 0.90, P = 0.011)), and condom use at first intercourse (OR (W2005) = 3.87, P < 0.001; OR (W2010) = 4.64, P < 0.001; OR (M2005) = 5.85, P < 0.001; OR (M2010) = 4.03, P < 0.001). In the observed period, HIV/AIDS knowledge was stable.
   Conclusion Risky sexual practices remain common among young Croatian adults. Given the recently reported STI prevalence rates in this age cohort, introduction of school-based sex education that would focus on protective behavioral and communication skills seems to be of crucial epidemiological importance.

AB  - Blatant dehumanization has recently been demonstrated to predict negative outgroup attitudes and behaviors. Here, we examined blatant dehumanization of Muslim refugees during the Refugee Crisis' among large samples in four European countries: the Czech Republic (N=1307), Hungary (N=502), Spain (N=1049), and Greece (N=934). Our results suggest that blatant dehumanization of Muslim refugees is (a) prevalent among Europeans, and (b) uniquely associated with anti-refugee attitudes and behavior, beyond political ideology, prejudice, andof particular relevance to the refugee crisisempathy. We also find that blatant dehumanization of Muslim refugees is significantly higher and more strongly associated with intergroup behavior in the Eastern European countries (especially the Czech Republic) than in Spain and Greece. Examining a range of outgroup targets beyond refugees, our results further illustrate that blatant dehumanization is not purely an ethnocentric bias: while individuals across contexts feel warmer towards their group than all others, they rate several high-status outgroups as equally or more fully evolved and civilized' than the ingroup. Our research extends theoretical understanding of blatant dehumanization, and suggests that blatant dehumanization plays an important and independent role in the rejection of Muslim refugees throughout Europe.

AB  - Do single women avoid career-enhancing actions because these actions signal undesirable traits, like ambition, to the marriage market? While married and unmarried female MBA students perform similarly when their performance is unobserved by classmates (on exams and problem sets), unmarried women have lower participation grades. In a field experiment, single female students reported lower desired salaries and willingness to travel and work long hours on a real-stakes placement questionnaire when they expected their classmates to see their preferences. Other groups' responses were unaffected by peer observability. A second experiment indicates the effects are driven by observability by single male peers.

Using a 2 x 2 experimental survey, findings showed that ethical misconduct in primary values resulted in significantly decreased positive attitudes toward and donation intentions to the organization. Also, the patterns of unethical behaviors significantly increased stakeholders' negative attitudes toward the organization and willingness to assign the organization responsibility for unethical behavior. Perceived organizational responsibility for ethical misconduct and deteriorating organization-public relationships (OPRs) were significant mediators for the effects of primary ethical violations.

AB  - American military conflicts have not always been popular, exemplified through public opinion polls regarding U.S. military engagements and veterans of the Vietnam and post-9/11 eras. Drawing upon Allport's intergroup contact theory, this study identifies individual-level factors shaping perceptions of U.S. military veterans through the lens of advice given to potential military recruits. Utilizing Pew Research Center Veterans & Generational Change and Veterans Surveys (n = 3,856), this study examines the influence of familial exposure to military culture, views of military service, personal beliefs, and demographic characteristics. Ordinal logistic regression results indicate that greater exposure to military culture, whether firsthand or vicarious, will positively influence one's advice to a potential recruit. Additionally, nonveterans displayed lower levels of support for military enlistment than did veterans. Implications may enhance perceptions of veteran identity. societal support for veteran status and opportunities, and support for key facets of U.S. military operations and its various missions.

AB  - This article examines the dynamics of women's participation in the Communist Party of Uruguay (PCU) from the 1920s to the 1960s. Despite its commitment to women's emancipation and to equality between men and women, the PCU's attitudes towards gender equality were often contradictory and its messages were ambiguous. Though it promoted women's participation, the Party oscillated between seeking to overcome social prejudices, upholding principled and dogmatic positions, and accommodating the conservative habits prevalent among the working class. Women were encouraged to take part in activities but not to assume leadership positions. The 1960s, ironically a period characterised by openness and political success, was a decade of regression in gender equality that stood in contrast to the Uruguayan Communists' long trajectory concerning women's rights.

AB  - It has been a widely held notion that firms can benefit from using preferential treatment in their customer relationship management strategies. For example, many firms provide select customers (i.e., recipients) with exclusive promotional offers that they purposefully do not extend to other customers (i.e., non-recipients). However, today's empowered consumers are more socially aware than ever of such divisive practices (via social media, deal websites, etc.), and firms must now better account for the negative backlash from non-recipients that may ensue. In this research, we conceptually define exclusive promotions and outline how they differ from other more heavily-studied customer prioritization tools. We then take a divergent approach from the majority of the extant literature by focusing primarily on how and why non-recipients (rather than recipients) respond to exclusive promotions. Study 1a findings reveal that non-recipients have negative attitudes toward exclusive promotions, as well as negative attitudes and lower patronage intentions toward the firm using them. Perceived social exclusion was shown to underlie these unfavorable responses. In Study 1b, we rule out an alternative equity-based explanation of our findings by assessing loyalty to the firm as a potential moderator. We then extend our investigation to a field setting in Studies 2 and 3. There we replicate our Study 1a results, and assess consumers' actual purchasing behavior in response to a real exclusive offer for enhanced generalizability. Lastly, in Studies 4 and 5 we empirically test two strategies that firms can potentially use to mitigate the negative effects of exclusive promotions documented here.

AB  - Background: Women's access to abortion care is often denied or hampered due to a range of barriers, many of which are rooted in abortion stigma. Abortion values clarification and attitude transformation (VCAT) workshops are conducted with abortion providers, trainers, and policymakers and other stakeholders to mitigate the effects of abortion stigma and increase provision of and access to abortion care. This study assesses changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions of VCAT workshop participants.
   Methods: Pre- and post-workshop surveys from 43 VCAT workshops conducted in 12 countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America between 2006 and 2011 were analyzed to assess changes in three domains: knowledge, attitudes and behavioral intentions related to abortion care. A score was created for each domain (range: 0-100), and paired t-tests or Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks tests were used to test for significant differences between the pre- and post-workshop scores overall and by region and participant type (providers, trainers, and policymakers/other stakeholders). We also assessed changes in pre- and post-workshop scores for participants with the lowest knowledge and negative attitudes on the pre- workshop survey.
   Results: Overall, the mean knowledge score increased significantly from 49.0 to 67.1 (p < 0.001) out of a total possible score of 100. Attitudes and behavioral intentions showed more modest, but still statistically significant improvements between the pre- and post-workshop surveys. The mean attitudes score increased from 78.2 to 80.9 (p < 0.001), and the mean behavioral intentions score rose from 82.2 to 85.4 (p = 0.03). Among participants with negative attitudes pre-workshop, most shifted to positive attitudes on the post-workshop survey, ranging from 35.2% who switched to supporting unrestricted access to second-trimester abortion to 90.9% who switched to feeling comfortable working to increase access to contraceptive services in their country. Participants who began the workshop with the lowest level of knowledge experienced the greatest increase in mean knowledge score from 20.0 to 55.0 between pre- and post-workshop surveys (p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: VCAT workshop participants demonstrated improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions related to abortion care. Participants who entered the workshops with the lowest levels of knowledge and negative attitudes had the greatest gains in these domains.

TI  - 'The Worst Oratorio Ever!': Colonialist Condescension in the Critical Reception of George Tolhurst's Ruth (1864)
T2  - NINETEENTH-CENTURY MUSIC REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - The oratorio genre was regarded amongst the most edifying and instructive artforms of the Victorian era, and it was to these lofty ideals that George Tolhurst (1827-1877) aspired when composing his 1864 oratorio Ruth. The first work of its kind written in the British colony of Victoria, Australia, Ruth received an initially favourable local reception; Tolhurst was urged by the Melbourne press to aim higher and present his work to a wider and more discerning audience. Consequently, he took his work to London where it was roundly criticized, widely mocked and eventually dubbed 'the worst oratorio ever'. It might be assumed that a work so poorly received in the cultural metropolis of London would be, like so much other Victorian music, immediately forgotten. However, through its notoriously bad reception, Ruth - in what Percy Scholes describes as a 'succes de ridicule' - found a cult following that has spanned from the nineteenth century to the present day. This article examines the critical reception of Ruth through the lens of colonial social relations, arguing that the treatment of Ruth in both London and Melbourne is emblematic of broader trends in the nineteenth-century relationship between parent state and settler colony. It also explores the surprising phenomenon of twentieth- and twenty-first-century consumption of Ruth in Britain, questioning whether the legacies of certain Victorian social and cultural prejudices relating to the artistic products of the colonies have been mitigated. Aesthetic and representational decisions made in recent revivals of Ruth suggest that cultural hierarchies forged during the Victorian era continue to be reinforced in the present day.

AB  - Objectives: This study addresses a need for quantitative research examining factors supporting the frequent use of homophobic language (e.g., fag) in male team sports which has a range of negative health impacts on gay and bisexual males. Intervention methods are needed to stop this behaviour, but little is known about why this language remains common.
   Design: Cross-Sectional survey.
   Method: Male Rugby Union (n = 97; ages 16-18 years) and Ice Hockey players (n = 146; ages 16 - 31 years) self-reported their use of homophobic language and completed measures of homophobic attitudes and descriptive and injunctive norms related to language use on their team. Bivariate and multivariate analyses examined factors associated with this behaviour.
   Results: Over half of participants (53.8%) self-reported using homophobic language at least once in the previous two weeks. No relationship was found between homophobic attitudes and language use. In contrast, norm measures had a strong, positive relationship with this behaviour. In multivariate analyses, norms uniquely accounted for almost one-half of the variance in language use. The addition of descriptive norms into the full model led to the largest increase in R-2 of.340 (F(1,200) = 130.816, p<.001).
   Conclusions: Homophobic language use was related to norms, rather than homophobic attitudes. Interventions targeting changes to these norms could be an effective method to change this behaviour. This finding contributes to a growing body of evidence that norms are associated with a range of negative behaviours by male athletes. (C) 2020 Sports Medicine Australia. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective To explore medical student perceptions and experiences of gender bias within medical education. Setting Gender bias-'prejudiced actions or thoughts based on the perception that women are not equal to men'-is a widespread issue. Within medicine, the pay gap, under-representation of women in senior roles and sexual harassment are among the most concerning issues demonstrating its presence and impact. While research investigating experiences of clinicians is gaining traction, investigation of medical students' experiences is lacking. This qualitative study analyses medical students' experiences of gender bias within their education to discern any patterns to this bias. Illuminating the current state of medical education gender bias will hopefully highlight areas in which student experience could be improved. Constructivist thematic analysis was used to analyse data, informed by William's patterns of gender bias, intersectional feminism and communities of practice theory. Participants Thirty-two medical students from multiple UK medical schools participated in individual interviews. Nine faculty members were also interviewed to triangulate data. Results Gender bias has an overt presence during medical student education, manifesting in line with William's patterns of bias, impacting career aspirations. Physical environments serve to manifest organisational values, sending implicit messages regarding who is most welcome-currently, this imagery remains 'too male, too pale horizontal ellipsis too stale'. Existing gender initiatives require careful scrutiny, as this work identifies the superficial application of positive action, and a failure to affect meaningful change. Conclusions Despite progress having been made regarding overt gender discrimination, implicit bias persists, with existing positive action inadequate in promoting the advancement of women. Institutions should mandate participation in implicit bias education programmes for all staff and must strive to revise the imagery within physical environments to better represent society. Gender initiatives, like Athena Scientific Women's Academic Network, also require large-scale evaluation regarding their impact, which this work found to be lacking.

AB  - Objectives: The current study investigated clinicians' treatment preferences for chronic pain and depression and the extent to which these preferences were related to clinicians' experience and attitudes.
   Methods: Eighty-five participants (50 physicians, 35 medical students) made treatment recommendations for 8 virtual patients with chronic low back pain and depression. The 10 treatment options included pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches. Participants also provided information about their clinical experience and completed measures assessing their attitudes toward patients with pain and depression.
   Results: The highest recommended treatments were over-the-counter medications and topical modalities, whereas "no intervention," referral to a pain specialist, and opioid medication received the lowest ratings. Physicians gave higher ratings to physical therapy (P < 0.05) and lifestyle activities (P < 0.05) than did medical students. Students reported more negative attitudes about patients with depression (P < 0.05) than did physicians. After controlling for participants' attitudes, the treatment preference x training level interaction was no longer significant (P > 0.05).
   Discussion: Physicians and medical students shared a general preference for " low-risk," self-management approaches for chronic pain and depression; however, they differed in their recommendations for some specific treatments. Participants' attitudes toward patients with pain and depression were associated with their preferences and accounted for the differences in their treatment decisions. These results suggest a need for early and continuing education to reduce clinicians' negative attitudes toward and improve the management of patients with chronic pain and depression.

AB  - Background. Prescribing opioids for chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) has been strictly regulated in Taiwan. This study was undertaken to survey pain and non-pain related physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding prescribing opioids for CNCP.
   Methods. A questionnaire survey was conducted in this comparison study. All 66 physicians who were treating officially registered CNCP outpatients were visited and completed anonymous questionnaires. The other physicians (anesthesiologists, oncologists, and non-pain physicians) were surveyed by a mailed questionnaire.
   Results. A total of 266 (75%) questionnaires were received from 355 board-certified physicians. More CNCP physicians (81.8%) and anesthesiologists (69.7%) had received prior CNCP-related training courses than had oncologists (21.2%) and non-pain physicians (10.3%). Varied proportions of physicians by type were unfamiliar with the Taiwan opioid regulations (16.7-86.8%) and would accordingly skip or reduce dosage of opioid prescriptions (27.3-73.5%). In addition, non-pain physicians had a significantly lower knowledge level, more negative attitudes, and greater hesitation about prescribing opioids compared to the pain-related physicians (P<0.001). CNCP physicians who had received CNCP-related training courses had a higher knowledge score than did those not receiving training (P=0.002). Overall, the leading barriers for prescribing opioids were inadequate knowledge of pain management (76%), physician reluctance (73%), and family reluctance (78%).
   Conclusion. There are substantial knowledge gaps, negative attitudes, and hesitation toward prescribing long-term opioids for CNCP patients by physicians in Taiwan, suggesting that efforts are needed to improve postgraduate education regarding adequate opioid management for CNCP.

AB  - Background: The number of elderly caregivers is increasing in the world. It is important to know the attitudes toward the elderly, because they can influence a range of behaviors. Our aim was to determine factors associated with attitudes toward the elderly in a sample of older carers.
   Methods: Three hundred and thirteen elderly caregivers (75.4% women, mean age 69.7 7.1) who cared for a dependent older person at home completed a cross-sectional household interview. In addition to the four domains of the Neri Scale to Assess Attitudes Toward the Elderly, participants were evaluated regarding the demographics, care recipient (CR) characteristics, functional and cognitive status, general health, life satisfaction, perceived stress, and depressive symptoms.
   Results: Overall, attitudes toward the elderly were neutral in this sample. More negative attitudes in some Neri Scale domains were associated with being older, living in an urban setting, taking more medications per day, caring for an elderly dependent in basic Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), being more or less satisfied with life, and having higher levels of perceived stress. There was a negative association between positive attitudes and educational level.
   Conclusions: The results highlight the need for public policies to promote more positive attitudes toward aging and change negative stereotypes usually used to designate older people. These public policies can try to modify some predictors of negative attitudes, such as perceived stress, which was associated with all four domains of Neri Scale.

AB  - While negative perceptions of insects and other terrestrial arthropods (hereafter referred to collectively as 'insects') are widespread around the world, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain unknown. Negative attitudes towards insects manifest as the emotion disgust, which is regarded as a psychological adaptation to produce pathogen-avoidance behavior. Based on theories of evolutionary psychology (parasite avoidance theory of disgust and error management theory), we hypothesized that there are two pathways by which urbanization increases the intensity and breadth of feelings of disgust towards insects: (1) urbanization increases the extent to which people see insects indoors, and insects that are seen more often indoors induce stronger feelings of disgust than is induced by insects seen outdoors; and (2) urbanization reduces people's natural history knowledge about insects, and decreased knowledge results in a broader range of insects eliciting feelings of disgust. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a large-scale online questionnaire survey and questionnaire experiment (n = 13,000) across Japan to quantify the association between the level of urbanization, places of insect sightings (outdoor/ indoor), knowledge about insects, and respondents' feelings of disgust. Our results supported both hypothetical pathway and suggested that psychological mechanisms shaped by past evolutionary pressure to avoid pathogen infection may underlie the current prevalence of insect disgust, and this is being reinforced by urbanization. Because negative perceptions of nature can reduce motivation for its conservation, negative attitudes towards insects exacerbated by ongoing urbanization is a potential global risk for biodiversity.

AB  - Contact with individuals with disabilities influences positive attitudes toward such individuals. This research investigated if contact with individuals with specific disabilities has an effect on attitudes toward other disabilities. Specifically, this research investigated physical, developmental and behavioral disabilities. While participants reported the most contact with individuals with physical disabilities and the most negative attitudes toward individuals with developmental disabilities, contact with individuals with behavioral disabilities was the best predictor of positive attitudes toward all disability types. This demonstrates that the relation between contact and attitudes is more nuanced than originally thought and can help us better understand disability related bias.

AB  - This article adds to the small but growing body of hate crime legal scholarship in the United Kingdom by examining the meaning of the term 'hostility' as prescribed under section 28 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The article highlights the confusion which has occurred within the lower courts as to the distinction between section 28(1)(a), which proscribes 'demonstrations' of hostility, and section 28(1)(b), which proscribes offences 'motivated' by hostility. In addition to this confusion has been a clear reluctance to apply section 28(1)(a) by some judges in cases where the demonstration of hostility appears to be incidental, as against causal, to the offence committed. The article argues that in order to provide greater clarity in law, the words 'demonstrates ... hostility' must be interpreted to include, not only acts that are motivated by, or which are intended to express prejudice or hatred, but any conduct carried out during an offence where the offender is aware his behaviour is likely to be perceived by right-minded individuals as indicating hostility towards the victim's identity. The article concludes that such a broad approach to conceptualizing hostility is justified based on the need for the state to expressly denounce all public displays of identity-based prejudice. The approach also acknowledges the harmful effects that all expressions of hate (motivated by hostility or not) have on victims, minority communities and to the cohesiveness of Britain's multicultural society.

AB  - The present study reflects an exploration of student race and attitudes toward the legal system as predictors of teachers' and administrators' support for police-to-student physical intervention. We experimentally manipulated student race (Black vs. White) in a hypothetical scenario depicting physical police intervention stemming from a student's misbehavior. Teachers and administrators were significantly more punitive (i.e., requested juvenile detention and expulsion) toward the Black student than the White student. Moreover, endorsement of police legitimacy and legal authoritarianism (LA) predicted increased punitive attitudes toward the student, the belief that the student is dangerous, perceived likelihood that the student would recidivate, and perceived appropriateness of police officer behavior. Finally, the relationships between police legitimacy, LA, and perceived police behavior appropriateness were stronger when the student was portrayed as Black than White.

AB  - While knowledge learning about the outgroup has been regarded as one of the key mechanisms for the contact-prejudice relation since the contact hypothesis' first inception (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008), learning, more broadly, has rarely been used as an explanatory framework to investigate the consequences of intergroup contact. In this article, we lay the foundation of a learning model of anxiety and stress in ingroup-outgroup interactions. We distinguish between episodic and chronic anxiety responses to the outgroup and recommend investigations on the complexities of their dynamic interplay, as individuals accumulate and dynamically integrate their experiences with the outgroup over time. Through a review of established and emerging psychophysiological and behavioral research of anxiety during ingroup-outgroup interactions, we identify evidence consistent with this dynamic outlook of intergroup contact effects. In this context, we also advance novel and untested predictions for future investigations onto the temporal integration of contact effects during an individual's lifespan.

This may be because inadequate understanding of their ecosystem services leaves them undervalued by society. However, evidence of negative attitudes towards TRs is scant. We investigated the strength and extent of negative attitudes by surveying undergraduate students from Australia, UK, and USA on their agreement (positive attitude) or disagreement (negative attitude) with statements about the ecosystem services, moral consideration, and protection of perennial and TRs. Students were surveyed at the start and end of teaching units covering environmental topics. Disagreement with statements was uncommon (17% across all statements and surveys) and attitudes towards TRs were mostly positive. However, attitudes towards perennial rivers were more positive, particularly in comparison with non-flowing TRs and with regard to their aesthetic value and recreational amenity. There were no significant differences in attitudes towards perennial and TRs in one teaching unit in Australia, and responses were more often more positive at the end of teaching units in the UK. Our study indicates education can change attitudes. The overall positive response to statements may reflect underlying environmental awareness and pre-existing interest of participants enrolled in environmental and biology degrees, but not necessarily specific knowledge of TRs. General environmental education across the wider community could improve attitudes towards TRs, particularly when they are not flowing or in regions where they are uncommon or inconspicuous, and could support positive protection measures and innovative, inclusive management.

AB  - Willingness to donate organs is contingent upon knowledge about and attitude toward organ donation. In order to explore differences between members of the three monotheistic religions: Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, a nation-wide survey was conducted in Israel. Members of all three religions expressed a very low willingness to donate organs postmortem. They had similar levels of knowledge regarding organ donation and similar negative attitudes toward organ donation. The public feels negative regarding the issue, therefore education campaigns should be designed and implemented in order to refute potential misconceptions and hence increase the number of people who sign donor cards.

AB  - Objective: We explored the desire to be a parent, attachment avoidance and their associations in a sample of gay men and lesbians and their heterosexual counterparts. Background: Previous research suggested a link between minority stress and higher attachment avoidance. However, the association between attachment avoidance and parenthood desires as a function of sexual orientation was not studied. Methods: The sample was composed of 883 community-dwelling participants (51.1% women, 30.57% identified as gay men and 14.15% as lesbians) that were recruited through convenience sampling. Results: Gay men and lesbians reported less desire to be parents than their heterosexual counterparts and higher attachment avoidance. However, the association between attachment avoidance and less desire for parenthood was moderated by sexual orientation, such that the correlation between attachment avoidance and lesser desire for parenthood was only found for heterosexual men and women. Conclusion: These findings pinpoint the potential vulnerability of gay men and lesbians to develop greater attachment avoidance and the impact of sexual orientation on the association between attachment avoidance and the desire to be a parent. The moderation effect is discussed in terms of the specific reproductive alternatives available to gay men and lesbians vs. the heterosexual population.

AB  - This study examined the effects of semi-fictional biographical political films on political learning and attitude change in audiences of fictionalized accounts of female politicians. Data from 310 participants indicated that content-related political learning significantly increased and attitude toward female politicians positively changed after exposure. A conceptual model of the political entertainment effects indicated that initial political learning transported the audience into the biographical narrative, which led to greater enjoyment, as well as learning gain and a positive attitude toward female politicians. Our findings provide important clarification to existing research and offer both theoretical, methodological, and practical implications.

AB  - Diversity within health care organizations has many proven benefits, yet women and other groups remain underrepresented in cardiothoracic surgery. We sought to explore responses from a Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) survey to identify myths and barriers for informing organizational strategies in the STS and cardiothoracic surgery. We performed a qualitative review of narrative survey responses within three domains surrounding diversity in cardiothoracic surgery: myths, barriers, and strategies for improvement. Common diversity myths included diversity as a pipeline problem (24%), diversity equated to exclusivity (21%), and diversity not supporting meritocracy (18%). The most frequent barrier code was perceived prejudice (22%). Suggested strategies toward improvement were culture change prioritizing diversity (22%) and training the leaders (14%). Notably, 15% of response codes reflected the belief that disparities do not exist; thus, the issue should not be prioritized by the organization. The results do not necessarily reflect the beliefs of most of the STS membership; nonetheless, they provide important insight critical to guide any efforts toward eliminating disparities within cardiothoracic surgery and improving the care of our patients.

AB  - In among the silencing and invisibility of their stories, queer women operate as critical leaders in international affairs. They face multiple marginalisations: (1) challenging the archetypical diplomat or security leader as a heteronormative (white) male; and (2) operating in different cultural contexts with varying negative attitudes towards women in power and homosexuality in general. Providing both empirical and theoretical contributions to the fields of diplomacy, feminist and queer theory, this article gains unique access to Australian lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and gender diverse, and intersex diplomats and attaches to understand: what are the experiences of queer woman leaders in international affairs?

KW  - community participation
AB  - Individuals with traumatic brain injury (TBI) may experience stigma in the form of negative attitudes or discriminatory behaviors, which are external actions directed toward the individual with the disability. Awareness of these negative attitudes, behaviors, and stereotypes related to one's condition is known as perceived stigma. Perceived stigma has been shown to be problematic in other populations because of its association with various negative mental and physical health outcomes. However, further research is needed on the factors related to perceived stigma in individuals with TBI as well as its association with community participation. The present study explored the associations of experiential and affective factors with perceived stigma in a sample of 504 individuals with TBI as well as the association of perceived stigma with community participation. Independent variables included experiential factors (preinjury years of education, preinjury occupation) and postinjury affective factors (depression, anxiety); demographic characteristics (age, gender, race/ethnicity) and injury severity served as covariates. Outcome variables included perceived stigma and community participation. Results of structural regression modeling revealed that affective factors were associated with perceived stigma, which was associated with community participation. Affective factors were associated with community participation only when perceived stigma was removed from the model. The findings of this research hold significant treatment implications for individuals with TBI such that modifying evidence-based practices to include consideration of perceived stigma may increase community participation for individuals with TBI.

Largely forgotten, it is here reconstructed using contempormy newspaper accounts, letters, memoirs, and official reports. These reveal a traumatic event which deeply affected the young Colony of New South Mlles. It laid bare the helplessness felt by the public in the face of a new foe which claimed the vulnerable and innocent, exposed prejudices and wrong thinking about disease and us transmission, and revealed the lack of an organised response to public health threats in the colony.

Suicide was more highly stigmatized than most of the other mental and physical health conditions in both attitudes toward suicide and willingness to disclose. The current study highlights the need for further medical student education in suicide, as ongoing negative attitudes could negatively affect patient care and disclosure.

AB  - BackgroundThe COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue to inflect immense burdens of morbidity and mortality, not to mention the sever disruption of societies and economies worldwide. One of the major challenges to managing COVID-19 pandemic is the negative attitudes towards vaccines and the uncertainty or unwillingness to receive vaccinations. We evaluated the predictors and factors behind the negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines in 3 countries in the Middle East. MethodsA cross-sectional, self-administered survey was conducted between the 1(st) and the 25(th) of December, 2020. Representative sample of 8619 adults residing in Jordan, West Bank, and Syria, completed the survey via the Web or via telephone interview. The survey intended to assess intent to be vaccinated against COVID-19 and to identify predictors of and reasons among participants unwilling/hesitant to get vaccinated. ResultsThe total of the 8619 participants included in this study were the ones who answered the question on the intent to be vaccinated. Overall, 32.2% of participants (n = 2772) intended to be vaccinated, 41.6% (n = 3589) didn't intend to get vaccinated, and 26.2% (n = 2258) were not sure. The main factors associated with the willingness to take the vaccine (yes responses) included females, 18-35 years old, Syrians and Jordanians, a large family size, and having received a flu vaccine last year. Reasons for vaccine hesitancy included the lack of rigorous evaluation of the vaccine by the FDA and the possible long-term health risks associated with the vaccines (the wait-and-see approach). ConclusionThis survey, conducted in December when the number of cases and deaths per day due to COVID-19 were at or near peak levels of the initial surge in the three regions under investigation. The survey revealed that most of survey's participants (67.8%) were unwilling/hesitant to get vaccinated against COVID-19 with the lack of trust in the approval process of the vaccine being the main concern; the two main characteristics of those participants were more than 35 years old and participants holding a Bachelor's degree or higher. Targeted and multi-pronged efforts will be needed to increase acceptance of COVID-19 vaccine in Jordan, West Bank and Syria.
   Author summaryThis study investigated vaccine willingness, unwillingness, or hesitancy by assessing the intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. We found that a considerable percentage of participants are unwilling/hesitant to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Perceived barriers to vaccination, namely the lack of rigorous evaluation of the vaccines and the possible long-term health risks associated with it, were significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccination intent. A substantial proportion of participants willing to get vaccinated were the 18-35 years old and the participants with a high school diploma or less.

AB  - Introduction
   The evidence is mixed on the HIV knowledge, attitude, and practices of youth in Iran. The aim of the current study was to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Iranian youth towards HIV through a national survey.
   Materials and Methods
   Through a cross-sectional study with multistage cluster sampling, we administered a pilot-tested standard questionnaire to assess the levels of HIV knowledge, attitudes and practices of individuals aged 15-29 years old. Participants were recruited from 13 provinces in Iran and consisted of 2456 men and 2412 women.
   Results
   Only 37.3% of the participants had a high knowledge score. Most participants knew the main routes of HIV transmission; however, misconceptions existed about the transmission of HIV through mosquito bites across all age groups (31.7% correct response). Positive levels of attitude wereobserved among 20.7% of the participants. Most participants believed that people living with HIV (PLHIV) should be supported (88.3%) while only 46.3% were ready to share a table with them. Among those aged 19-29 years old, the main source of HIV information was mass media (69.1%), only 13.1% had ever tested for HIV, around 20.8% had ever had extramarital sex (31.7% male vs. 9.6% female), 1.8% ever injected drugs (2.9% male vs. and 0.7% female). Among sexually active subjects in this age group, only 21.8% (26.1% male vs. 7.1% female) were consistent condom users.
   Conclusions
   The findings showed that Iranian youth and young adults have relatively insufficient overall knowledge and negative attitudes about HIV and PLHIV. Novel strategies involving schools and youth's networks could be employed to deliver a culturally sensitive sexual health program.

AB  - Purpose Little research has explored the process of disclosure decision-making from antecedents to outcomes. This paper presents a model of decision-making about disclosure of a mental health condition to the immediate supervisor in the workplace shortly after starting a new job. Methods A qualitative descriptive design was employed to explore participants' experiences of the disclosure decision-making process, the disclosure event itself (if applicable), and their perceptions of the impact of the decision on personal, interpersonal, and organizational outcomes. The transcripts were coded and analyzed using directed content analysis. Results Twenty-eight participants were purposively selected to represent different disclosure decisions, sex, diagnoses, and maintenance of employment. Analysis identified goals and conditions/context were important antecedents for the disclosure decision. All participants discussed concerns about prejudice and discrimination if they disclosed, and, for those who chose to disclose, high stress and anxiety were described during the disclosure event; however, supervisor reactions were generally described as positive. Conclusions Regardless of the disclosure strategy adopted, participants reported that their disclosure decision helped to support their self-acceptance and recovery. For those who disclosed, most perceived a positive response by their supervisor. However, the pervasive concerns of prejudice indicate there is still much work to be done.

AB  - Background: Using our research findings, we explore Harm Reduction and Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) using an intersectional lens to provide a more complex understanding of Harm Reduction and MMT, particularly how Harm Reduction and MMT are experienced differently by people dependent on how they are positioned. Using the lens of intersectionality, we refine the notion of Harm Reduction by specifying the conditions in which both harm and benefit arise and how experiences of harm are continuous with wider experiences of domination and oppression;
   Methods: A qualitative design that uses ethnographic methods of in-depth individual and focus group interviews and naturalistic observation was conducted in a large city in Canada. Participants included Aboriginal clients accessing mainstream mental health and addictions care and primary health care settings and healthcare providers;
   Results: All client-participants had profound histories of abuse and violence, most often connected to the legacy of colonialism (e. g., residential schooling) and ongoing colonial practices (e. g., stigma & everyday racism). Participants lived with co-occurring illness (e. g., HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis C, PTSD, depression, diabetes and substance use) and most lived in poverty. Many participants expressed mistrust with the healthcare system due to everyday experiences both within and outside the system that further marginalize them. In this paper, we focus on three intersecting issues that impact access to MMT: stigma and prejudice, social and structural constraints influencing enactment of peoples' agency, and homelessness;
   Conclusions: Harm reduction must move beyond a narrow concern with the harms directly related to drugs and drug use practices to address the harms associated with the determinants of drug use and drug and health policy. An intersectional lens elucidates the need for harm reduction approaches that reflect an understanding of and commitment to addressing the historical, socio-cultural and political forces that shape responses to mental illness/health, addictions, including harm reduction and methadone maintenance treatment.

AB  - Authoritarianism has been an important explanatory concept for more than 60 years and a powerful predictor of social, political, and intergroup attitudes and behaviour. An important impediment to research on authoritarianism has been the length of the measures available, particularly with the contemporary emphasis on the need for social research to use larger, more representative samples and measure multiple constructs across multiple domains. We therefore developed a six-item Very Short Authoritarianism (VSA) scale that equally represented the three content subdimensions and two directions of wording of Altemeyer's widely used Right Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) scale. Over four samples (N = 1,601) from three countries the VSA scale showed satisfactory internal consistency and the expected hierarchical factor structure with three primary factors loading on a single higher-order factor. Additionally, the scale predicted variables such as nationalism, ethnocentrism, political orientation, political party/candidate support, attitudes towards ingroups or outgroups and anti-minority bias at moderate to strong levels with effects very close to those obtained for much longer established measures of RWA (including Altemeyer's scale). The VSA scale also showed clearly better reliability and validity than a short measure of authoritarian parental values that has been used to measure authoritarianism.

AB  - Background: The incidence of planned home birth is increasing in the United States. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists acknowledges a woman's right to make an informed choice about place of delivery, including home birth. This exploratory study measures obstetricians' attitudes, experiences, and knowledge about planned home birth, identifies associations between these factors, and compares obstetricians' responses in Ohio to those in Arizona and New Mexico. Methods: A survey about attitudes, experiences, and knowledge of planned home birth was distributed to obstetricians in Ohio, Arizona, and New Mexico. Attitude and knowledge scores were calculated for each respondent and used to evaluate associations through linear regression. Attitude and knowledge scores in states that have regulation of direct entry midwives (Arizona and New Mexico) were compared to a state which does not (Ohio). Results: Obstetricians in all three states reported little experience and knowledge of planned home birth and overall negative attitudes. Obstetricians with stronger knowledge did not differ in their attitudes from those with less knowledge. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing attitude and knowledge scores in Ohio to Arizona and New Mexico, but Ohio obstetricians responded most negatively to the attitude questions. Conclusions: Obstetricians have limited knowledge and experience and hold very negative attitudes about planned home birth. Research is necessary to determine: 1) whether negative obstetrician attitudes would be modified by exposure to home birth education and experience, and, 2) whether negative obstetrician beliefs deter safe and timely transfer from home or compromise hospital care for transferred parturients.

White fragility and tactics used to avoid race-based stress sustains privilege. The roots of Fragility are examined through the lens of three Whiteidentity theoretical models: the White Identity Development Process Model, the White Racial Identity Model, and the White Male Identity Development Model. Further, motivation theories are explored to tie privilege, White identity, and social work together cohesively. Recommendations for social work education, research, and practice are given for combating prejudice and racism.

AB  - Borrowing from intersectionality theory, this study aims to understand how experiences of arrest - alone or in combination with victimization and criminal justice ties - inform students' attitudes towards systems of justice, the major, and career motivations. Using a survey of 80 questions on a sample of students from urban colleges with large minority representation, the authors rely on ordered logit regressions to find: students with experiences of arrest hold more negative attitudes towards systems of justice; find the CJ major a more relevant subject matter; and are more motivated to make a community difference than students with no experiences of arrest. Differences are enhanced for students with experiences of arrest and victimization but reduced for students who know someone working in CJ fields. Experiences of arrest remain largely unvaried by demographic indicators. Results suggest student experiences of trauma are important dimensions of students' decisions about the major and profession.

AB  - This study tested the manner in which attitude toward an object of rumor affects people's epistemic motivation to solve a problem and to share a rumor, specifically on social media, using two rumors regarding food safety issues including McDonald's and genetically modified food. An online survey administered to 184 undergraduate students who use Twitter showed that negative attitudes increased the likelihood of rumor sharing, mediated by issue-related epistemic motivation. However, positive attitudes showed no effects on issue-related motivation and the likelihood of rumor sharing. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Victims of interpersonal transgressions often turn to friends, family, and trusted others when trying to make sense of negative events. This research explored the effect of two of the many ways that these informal third parties can respond: validating the victim's experience, and downplaying or minimizing the transgression. Two studies found that validation from a third party increases revenge motivations and that minimization of the transgression is more effective than validation at reducing revenge motivations. However, results also indicated that victims judge third parties more positively if they validate rather than minimize the transgression. These findings suggest that, when choosing between validation and minimization, third parties must make a choice between promoting forgiveness and promoting themselves.

AB  - Self-reported experiences of "everyday" discrimination have been linked to indices of cardiovascular disease and overall mortality and findings have been particularly pronounced for African-American populations. However, the biological mechanisms underlying these associations remain unclear. C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, is a known correlate of cardiovascular and other health outcomes and has also been linked to several psychosocial processes. To our knowledge, no studies have examined the association between experiences of discrimination and CRP. We examined the cross-sectional association between self-reported experiences of discrimination and CRP in a sample of 296 older African-American adults (70% female, mean age = 73.1). Experiences of discrimination were assessed with the 9-item everyday discrimination scale and CRP was assayed from blood samples. In linear regression models adjusted for age, sex and education, experiences of discrimination were associated with higher levels of CRP (B = .10, p = .03). This association remained significant after additional adjustments for depressive symptoms (B = .10, p = .04), smoking, and chronic health conditions (heart disease, diabetes, hypertension) that might influence inflammation (B = .11, p = .02). However, results were attenuated when body mass index (BMI) was added to the model (B = .09, p = .07). In conclusion, self-reported experiences of everyday discrimination are associated with higher levels of CRP in older African-American adults, although this association is not completely independent of BMI.

AB  - Despite the large number of studies that demonstrate the need for family involvement in addiction treatment, mental health professionals (MHPs) are often reluctant to collaborate with the affected family members (AFMs), while several times they enter-consciously or unconsciously-into a competitive relationship with the family of the person with addiction problems (PAPs). The present study presents the results of a thematic analysis of 42 vignettes provided by MHPs working in drug and alcohol addiction treatment. Participants' experiences were depicted by two overarching themes: the caring and the traumatizing triangle. Present findings suggest that MHPs' awareness of triadic influences and attempts to build alliances with AFMs supports PAPs' needs for reconciliation with AFMs and is supported by multidisciplinary need containment. In the attempt to collaborate with AFMs, MHPs need to avoid accepting the idealization of the PAPs and not to ally into the underestimation of the family, in order to resolve possible separation phenomena and to avoid therapeutic failure. Additionally, MHPs are called upon working out their own difficulties and possibly their prejudices about triangular interactions, so that the triangle MHPs-PAPs-AFMs can function therapeutically in a multidisciplinary context. Clinical supervision and Balint groups may support addiction professionals in these challenging tasks.

AB  - Two experiments investigated effects of perceived ingroup acculturation norms. Majority members read an article about their peers having specific acculturation preferences for minority members in public and private domains, which was the experimental manipulation. Dependent variables were liking for ingroup members, majority members' own preference for culture maintenance relative to their preference for culture adoption for public and private domains, and their investment in cultural maintenance relative to their investment in contact with the minority. In England (N=237) we focused on attitudes towards Muslims, while in Chile (N=291) the focus was on attitudes towards the indigenous Mapuche. Results reflect the political climates of the two countries: Chileans showed more reactance against their peers demanding assimilation from minority members than English people did - by increasing their preference for maintenance relative to adoption. Yet, in both countries, peers who demanded assimilation were liked the least. In England, responses on public acculturation preferences and acculturative investment were the same, whereas they differed in Chile. Overall, Chileans valued culture maintenance of Mapuche more than culture adoption for both public and private domains. For English people however, this was only the case for the private domain, while for the public domain they had opposite overall preferences. Finally, regardless of country, the more people preferred culture maintenance relative to adoption in the public domain, the higher their support for multiculturalism was too, highlighting the importance of investigating relative acculturation preferences.

AB  - Objective. In approaching the study of racial discrimination and health, the neighborhood- and individual-level antecedents of perceived discrimination need further exploration. We investigated the relationship between neighborhood- and individual-level socioeconomic position (SEP), neighborhood racial composition, and percevied racial discrimination in a cohort of African-American and White women age 40-79 from Connecticut, USA.
   Design. The logistic regression analysis included 1249 women (39% African-American and 61% White). Neighborhood-level SEP and racial composition were determined using 1990 census tract information. Individual-level SEP indicators included income, education, and occupation. Perceived racial discrimination was measured as lifetime experience in seven situations.
   Results. For African-American women, living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods was assocaited with fewer reports of racial discrimination (odds ratio (OR) 0.44; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26, 0.75), with results attenuated after adjustment for individual-level SEP (OR 0.54, CI: 0.29, 1.03), and additional adjustment for neighborhood racial composition (OR 0.70, CI: 0.30, 1.63). African-American women with 12 years of education or less were less likely to report racial discrimination, compared with women with more than 12 years of education (OR 0.57, CI: 0.33, 0.98 (12 years); OR 0.51, CI: 0.26, 0.99 (less than 12 years)) in the fully adjusted model. For White women, neither neighborhood-level SEP nor individual-level SEP was associated with perceived racial discrimination.
   Conclusion. Individual- and neighborhood-level SEP may be important in understanding how racial discrimination is perceived, reported, processed, and how it may influence health. In order to fully assess the role of racism in future studies, inclusio of additional dimensions of discrimination may be warranted

AB  - This study examines factors associated with screening of female patients for intimate partner violence (IPV) by orthosurgeons in a sample of 100 Israeli orthosurgeons. Findings reveal positive attitudes toward screening female patients but a significant lack of knowledge. Arab orthosurgeons held slightly more negative attitudes toward screening for IPV and had a more prominent lack of knowledge regarding screening for IPV, compared to their Jewish counterparts. Nationality and feeling uncomfortable asking female patients about IPV predicted screening for IPV. The importance of training orthosurgeons on the assessment and treatment of IPV cannot be overemphasized, especially among Arab orthosurgeons.

AB  - Objectives: Prejudice against transgender people is evident around the world with discrimination in many aspects of life, including access to health care. Even in Thailand, where male-to-female (MTF) transgender people are particularly visible and society is reputedly accepting, barriers to attaining appropriate health care still exist. The vast majority of MTF transgender people in Thailand are reported to be taking hormone therapy; however, most do not seek medical advice regarding these regimens, with the initiation and tailoring of medication often being guided by sympathetic peers instead. The objectives of this review are to consider hormone therapy in the context of the Thai population and provide recommendations regarding ways to improve practice and reduce health risks. Methods: The data analysis in this article represents a comprehensive literature review regarding hormone therapy for MTF transgender people including the guidelines for initiation, prescribing, and monitoring of hormone therapy, risks for serious adverse events and reported hormone use by the MTF transgender population in Thailand. Results: There is a notable lack of published research regarding hormone therapy in the transgender population. Guidelines, whilst relying considerably on expert opinion, do provide clear recommendations on the initiation, maintenance and monitoring of hormone therapy. Comparison of endocrine guidelines with reported practice in Thailand reveals significant opportunities for improvement in MTF transgender hormone therapy. Conclusions: The incautious use of hormone therapy may represent a considerable health risk behavior undoubtedly contributing to the morbidity and mortality in MTF transgender people. Although there is currently considerable focus on sexually transmitted infections in the MTF transgender population, a more comprehensive approach to health care is required, including education for transgender people and the health professionals who attend to them regarding appropriate hormone therapy.

AB  - A key underlying assumption of interprofessional education (IPE) is that if the professions are brought together they have the opportunity to learn about each other and dispel the negative stereotypes which are presumed to hamper interprofessional collaboration in practice. This article explores the application of contact theory in IPE with reference to eight evaluation studies (1995-2012) which adopted this theoretical perspective. It proposes that educators should pay explicit attention to an intergroup perspective in designing IPE programmes and specifically to the contact variables identified by social psychologists studying intergroup encounters. This would increase the chances of the planned contact having a positive effect on attitude change.

AB  - Does the Irinotecan metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecan (SN38) damage the gonads of male and female prepubertal mice?
   The Irinotecan metabolite SN38 reduces germ cell numbers within the seminiferous tubules of mouse testes at concentrations that are relevant to cancer patients, while in contrast it has little if any effect on the female germ cell population.
   Little is known about the role of the chemotherapeutic agent Irinotecan on female fertility, with only one article to date reporting menopausal symptoms in perimenopausal women treated with Irinotecan, while no data are available either on adult male fertility or on the impact of Irinotecan on the subsequent fertility of prepubertal cancer patients, female or male.
   Male and female gonads were obtained from postnatal day 5 C57BL/6 mice and exposed in vitro to a range of concentrations of the Irinotecan metabolite SN38: 0.002, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 or 1 A mu g ml(-1) for the testis and 0.1, 1, 2.5 or 5 A mu g ml(-1) for the ovary, with treated gonads compared to control gonads not exposed to SN38. SN38 was dissolved in 0.5% dimethyl sulfoxide, with controls exposed to the same concentration of diluent. The number of testis fragments used for each analysis ranged between 3 and 9 per treatment group, while the number of ovaries used for each analysis ranged between 4 and 12 per treatment group.
   Neonatal mouse gonads were developed in vitro, with tissue analysed at the end of the 4-6 day culture period, following immunofluorescence or hematoxylin and eosin staining. Statistical analyses were performed using one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc test for normally distributed data and Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunns post-test for non-parametric data.
   Abnormal testis morphology was observed when tissues were exposed to SN38, with a smaller seminiferous tubule diameter at the highest concentration of SN38 (1 A mu g ml(-1), p < 0.001 versus control) and increased number of Sertoli cell-only tubules at the two highest concentrations of SN38 (0.1 A mu g ml(-1), p < 0.001; 1 A mu g ml(-1), p < 0.0001, both versus control). Within seminiferous tubules, a dose response decrease was observed in both germ cell number (mouse vasa homologue (MVH)-positive cells) and in proliferating cell number (bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive cells), with significance reached at the two highest concentrations of SN38 (0.1 A mu g ml(-1), p < 0.01 for both; 1 A mu g ml(-1), p < 0.001-MVH, p < 0.01-BrdU; all versus control). No change was seen in protein expression of the apoptotic marker cleaved caspase 3. Double immunofluorescence showed that occasional proliferating germ cells were present in treated testes, even after exposure to the highest drug concentration. When prepubertal ovaries were treated with SN38, no effect was seen on germ cell number, apoptosis or cell proliferation, even after exposure to the highest drug concentrations.
   As with any study using in vitro experiments with an experimental animal model, caution is required when extrapolating the present findings to humans. Differences between human and mouse spermatogonial development also need to be considered when assessing the effect of chemotherapeutic exposure. However, the prepubertal testes and ovaries used in the present studies contain germ cell populations that are representative of those found in prepubertal patients, and experimental tissues were exposed to drug concentrations within the range found in patient plasma.
   Our findings demonstrate that the prepubertal mouse ovary is relatively insensitive to exposure to the Irinotecan metabolite SN38, while it induces a marked dose-dependent sensitivity in the testicular germ cell population. The study identifies the importance of further investigation to identify the risk of infertility in young male cancer patients treated with Irinotecan.

AB  - In the recent years, research on the conditions, under which members of the host countries such as Germany perceive refugees as threatening and respond with negative attitudes, has increased. However, little attention has been given to the implications that subjective perceptions of threat among the host community may have for their own psychological health. Using integrated threat theory, the current study examined the relationships between perceived threats, person-centered antecedents in intercultural settings, and psychological distress among Germans, who reflected on incoming refugees. Using a survey company, a sample (N = 1000) was recruited, which matched the German census regarding central demographics. Participants completed a cross-sectional online survey with validated self-report measures. Assessments covered four perceived threat types (intergroup anxiety, symbolic and realistic threat, negative stereotypes), person-related antecedents (social identity as German, quantity and quality of prior intercultural contact), and psychological distress. Applying structural equation modeling, we found that high social identification as German was related to greater perceptions of symbolic/realistic threat, stronger negative stereotypes and to more intergroup anxiety. Vice versa, high quality of prior intercultural contact experiences was associated with a decrease of all threat types. The quantity of prior intercultural contact showed almost no relations to perceived threats. In terms of indirect effects, greater quality of contact predicted less distress, and greater identity as German predicted more distress, both via symbolic/realistic threat and intergroup anxiety. Taken together, perceiving refugees as a threatening outgroup may signify a self-harming risk, while high quality of intercultural relations may indirectly enhance health.

AB  - We review John Turner's contribution to social psychology and his ongoing influence on the field. We provide an account of his research and theorising framed by the two major theoretical frameworks which he developed: social identity theory (together with Henri Tajfel) and self-categorisation theory. We elaborate the contribution of his work in developing an understanding of intergroup relations (in social identity theory) and specifying the social nature of the self, the salience of social identities, and of the importance of social identity for social influence, stereotyping, power, and leadership (within self-categorisation theory). We then locate these research programmes within Turner's broader meta-theoretical goal of addressing major problems, issues, and themes within social psychology. These centre on (a) a critique of the pervasive anti-collectivism within much of social psychology, (b) a normative/political agenda for social change, and (c) a commitment to the social nature of the individual mind. These themes explicitly or implicitly infused his research and continue to inspire much of the work in the theoretical tradition that he pioneered.

AB  - In this study, we use a randomized control trial to examine whether asking Vietnamese men to reflect on gender equality can reduce their gender bias. We randomly selected two groups of married men in four rural provinces and asked the first group to make comments on gender-related laws and the second group to write stories about gender equality. We find that commenting on gender-related laws does not reduce men's bias against women, while writing stories has a strong effect on reducing prejudice against women. Writing stories increases the index of gender attitudes of men in the second group by 0.29 standard deviations. The assignment also has a small effect on their contribution to housework. Changing men's behaviour in practice requires stronger and more sustained interventions.(c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose This study sheds light on a hitherto understudied group in family business literature: widows. We explore the roles a widow may take following the unexpected death of her owner-manager spouse when she had no salient role in the business prior to the death. Design/methodology/approach We used a qualitative approach to research, to study inductively the roles considered and taken by three widows who unexpectedly succeeded as owners of Swedish privately held family firms. We conducted semi-structured interviews with widows and children in top management. Findings We construct a typology of four main roles a widow can take and analyse the underlying dimensions that they represent. We also analyse to which extent the choice of role widow can be explained by psychological ownership and double-loss theory. The typology can be used as a tool for family business owners and their advisors as the basis of an open and non-prejudiced discussion of the choices available to a widow. Originality/value We have investigated the factors that influence a widow's decision whether to take over the business or not, as suggested in previous research by, for example, Martinez et al. (2009). We explore the roles a widow can consider and adopt. The study advances our understanding of how businesses can remain as family firms also in the event of the unexpected death of an owner-manager (De Massis et al., 2008). We hereby contribute to the literature on sudden successions and on women in family businesses.

AB  - This article reports on the qualitative findings of a UK-wide survey of learning technologists and their recent struggles of supporting attempts for digital resettlement of learning, teaching and assessment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, underlining the frailties of universities in the terms of crisis management and cultural and organisational change. We find broad attitude change towards the role and contribution of learning technology and technologists by higher education staff, yet a sense that institutions are neither grasping nor pursuing the potential of digital affordances and remain focused on returning to 'pre-COVID normality'. Furthermore, despite physical campus closures increasing demand on learning technologists, we see that their attempts for institutional boundary crossing remain frustrated.

AB  - Young people in Ethiopia face a number of risks to their sexual and reproductive health, including adolescent pregnancy, sexual violence, and unmet need for family planning. This study explores the extent to which current service provision addresses the SRH needs of young Ethiopians. Methods included a comprehensive review of the academic and policy literature on young people's SRH and service provision in Ethiopia; and 14 semi-structured Key Informant Interviews. Factors affecting utilization of sexual and reproductive services by young people include: limited SRH knowledge, lack of open discussion of sexual matters, low status of women, cultural and logistical barriers, competing priorities among community health professionals, limited resources for health facilities, and negative attitudes of providers towards unmarried youth. While the antenatal needs of young married women are somewhat addressed, gaps exist in terms of services for unmarried youth, young men, rural youth and vulnerable groups. The national policy platform has created an enabling environment for addressing youth SRH needs but challenges to implementing these policies still persist. The way forward requires a focus on reducing barriers to utilization of services, and attention to underserved groups. It also requires resource mobilization, strong leadership and effective coordination between stakeholders and donors.

AB  - This paper investigates the backfiring effects of waste-prevention advertising that blames consumers for waste. Five experimental studies provide evidence that message focus (on close versus distant social actors) has an impact on message perception and, further, on waste intentions and behaviors. Providing information on transgressions incurred by close social actors makes consumers hold less negative attitudes toward waste and feel less able to implement tasks that help reduce waste; this may explain higher transgression rates. Furthermore, simple manipulations of perceived task difficulty through advertising are shown to help mitigate these negative effects and increase the effectiveness of anti-waste campaigns.

AB  - This article investigates the local economic cost of hosting refugees. Using administrative data in France, we show that the opening of small housing centers for refugees decreases the economic activity in hosting municipalities. We demonstrate that this downturn is related to a decline in the population by around 2% due to fewer people moving to hosting municipalities. We show that this avoidance behavior of natives results from prejudices, and is unlikely to be driven by a labor market supply shock from the arrival of refugees. We also estimate the aggregate cost of hosting refugees.

AB  - ObjectiveThe marriage equality debate is becoming increasingly prominent in Australian political and media discourse. Moreover, as policy that would legislate marriage equality continues to be debated in political circles, public opinion on the topic appears to be becoming increasingly divided. This article presents a cross-sectional study exploring predictors of support for marriage equality.
   MethodA sample of 137 Australians (66% females) responded to a series of demographic items, a measure of attitudes towards gay men and lesbian women, and a forced-choice question asking whether or not they would support marriage between two peopleregardless of their gender.
   ResultsThe results revealed that support for marriage equality in this sample was predicted by religious affiliation, political orientation, and sexual prejudice. More specifically, individuals in support of marriage equality were more likely to be non-religious, politically liberal, and have more positive attitudes towards gay men (attitudes towards lesbian women were unrelated to support for marriage equality). Age and gender did not predict support for marriage equality.
   ConclusionsSupport for marriage equality in Australia can be predicted by social attitudes and demographic variables. These findings are discussed in terms of the implications of maintaining the legal status quo, which mandates marriage inequality.

AB  - Phenomenon Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a growing public health crisis. Many residents and physicians do not feel comfortable working with patients with OUD. Social stigma promotes negative attitudes toward these patients and is a roadblock to delivering equitable and effective care. This study sought to (1) characterize medical students' experiences with patients with OUD, (2) understand the features that make a patient encounter memorable, (3) explore factors that influence future practice, and (4) describe the influence on stigma toward patients with OUD. Approach: A study was conducted using qualitative descriptive theory and purposive sampling of fourth-year medical students (M4s) enrolled at Wake Forest School of Medicine (WFSOM). Data collection consisted of a free-text question as a part of a larger survey to M4s in the Class of 2019 and 2020, followed by semi-structured interviews. The goal of the survey was to gain a broad understanding of student encounters with patients with OUD. The goal of the interviews was to gain a deeper understanding of the impact of these encounters on future practice and stigma. Thematic analysis was used to analyze all data. Findings: One-hundred-seventy out of 237 students (RR = 71.7%) completed the free text question describing a memorable encounter with a patient with OUD. Twelve students then completed interviews. Patient encounters occurred in three primary settings: Emergency department, inpatient clerkship, or Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) meetings during psychiatry clerkship. Clinical encounters were memorable when there was: (1) conflict with patients or teams, (2) complicated care, (3) inadequate care, and (4) relevance to the student's future career. Memorable encounters influenced future practice by changing students' approaches to: (1) future treatment, (2) future communication, or (3) allowing students to practice professionalism. Regarding opioid stigma, students reported that these encounters made them: (1) more aware of stereotypes in medicine, (2) stereotypes in their personal lives, and (3) generated actions that students want to take in the future. Insights: A single, influential clinical encounter has the potential to substantially influence medical students' approach to patients with OUD, including both clinical management and attitudes toward care. Affecting encounters increased knowledge of OUD and fostered empathy and perspective-taking. Not all encounters had a defining impact on students' stigma toward OUD. Medical schools need to create opportunities that will have lasting impact by encouraging students to fully engage with patients with OUD.

AB  - Deepening understanding of public responses to large-scale renewable energy projects is of academic and practical importance, given policies to lessen fossil fuel use in many countries. Although the NIMBY (Not In My Back Yard) concept is commonly used to explain public opposition, the concept has been extensively critiqued. This study applies an alternative approach based upon the notion of disruption to place attachment, and the theory of social representations, with a focus upon the symbolic meanings associated with a proposed project and the places affected by it. Empirical data is provided from a case study of a proposed 750 MW offshore wind farm in North Wales, using group discussions and questionnaires distributed to local residents in two coastal towns (n = 488). Results indicate significant differences between each town's residents in their responses to the project, and how opposition arises from nature/industry symbolic contradictions: between a place represented in terms of scenic beauty that provides a restorative environment for residents and visitors, and a wind farm that will industrialise the area and 'fence' in the bay. In one of the towns, the data suggests that contradiction between project and place was experienced as a threat to identity for those with strong place attachment, leading to negative attitudes and oppositional behaviour. Levels of trust in key actors moderated the relation between place attachment and negative attitudes to the wind farm. The results provide further evidence of the role of place attachment in shaping so-called 'NIMBY' responses to development proposals, and challenge the assumption that offshore wind farms will prove less controversial than those onshore.

AB  - Research on inattentional blindness demonstrates that when attending to 1 set of stimuli, people often fail to consciously perceive a task-irrelevant object. In this experiment, we tested for selective inattentional blindness to racial outgroup members. We reasoned that some racial groups would be perceived as more relevant than others, depending on the interpersonal goal that was active. White participants were primed with interpersonal goals that ranged from psychologically distant (searching for a coworker) to psychologically close (searching for a romantic partner). In the control condition, no goal was explicitly activated. Then, participants watched a video of 2 teams passing a ball and were asked to count the ball passes of one of the teams. In the middle of the video, a Caucasian or an African American man walked through the scene. Participants were then asked to report whether they had seen the interloper. Results revealed that as interpersonal goals became closer to the self, participants were less likely to see the African American man. This research demonstrates a new form of social exclusion based on early attention processes that may perpetuate racial bias.

AB  - It is shown that, contrary to a widespread prejudice, massless higher spin (HS) field theories can be defined in flat space-time. Examples of Yang-Mills-like theories with infinite many local fields of any spin are constructed explicitly in any dimension, along with Chern-Simons-like models in any odd dimension. These theories are defined via actions invariant under HS gauge transformations and their equations of motion are derived. It is also briefly explained why these theories circumvent well-known no-go theorems.

AB  - This paper examines spatial differences in the attitudes of the public towards asylum seekers using data from the British Social Attitudes Survey. Initial analysis reveals some statistically significant variations across geographical areas, with people living in London, the South East of England and Scotland displaying the most tolerant views. The spatial variations are then further investigated by considering differences between rural and different types of urban areas. The estimation of regression models enables a range of socio-demographic influences on attitudes to be examined including whether an individual is a foreign national, belongs to ethnic minority group and possesses a higher education qualification. Members of each of these groups are more concentrated in urban areas, especially London, thus accounting for part of the observed differentials. However, even after controlling for these and other factors, some significant differences remain between rural and some urban areas, especially large cities. We discuss potential explanations and conclude that having opportunities for meaningful social contact with asylum seekers and other immigrants is a key factor underlying some of the unexplained rural-urban differences in attitudes. Given increasing diversity in rural areas, it is recommended that policy makers and civil society organisations concerned about the impacts of negative attitudes on social and community cohesion should invest resources in creating opportunities for meaningful social contact between different groups.

AB  - Purpose of the research: Pain is not only one of the most undesirable side effects of cancer but also one of its major complications. This study attempted to evaluate and describe the pain characteristics and pain control in patients with advanced cancer and to identify factors related to effective analgesic treatment.
   Methods and sample: A descriptive cross-sectional study involving the eight larger oncology centres in Greece was conducted in 2008. Cancer patients (n = 134) attending the oncology outpatient departments were interviewed using a 35-item questionnaire regarding pain- and treatment-related characteristics.
   Key results: The great majority of the patients (72%) with advanced malignancy reported high pain intensity and 66.4% experienced the pain as continuous. Although most patients (81%) responded to treatment, more than 30% reported side effects and asked for treatment to change. Better informed patients about the disease showed higher response to pain treatment (OR 3.21; 95%CI 1.28-8.01). Adherence to treatment was related to pain response (OR 3.05; 95%CI 1.06-8.75), whereas negative attitudes and feelings toward treatment were related with reluctance to take analgesic treatment (OR 4.27; 95%CI 1.31-13.89). Patients' request for changing medication was significantly related to the presence of side effects (OR 8.26; 95%CI 2.80-24.42) and pain response to treatment (OR 0.09; 95%CI 0.03-0.31).
   Conclusions: Negative attitudes and feelings toward treatment combined with deficits in patient education/information seem to influence both pain response and therapy compliance suggesting the need for more comprehensive approach to pain management of cancer patients.

TI  - Addressing Patient Bias and Discrimination Against Clinicians of Diverse Backgrounds
T2  - ACADEMIC MEDICINE
LA  - English
AB  - The duty to care for all patients is central to the health professions, but what happens when clinicians encounter patients who exhibit biased or discriminatory behaviors? While significant attention has focused on addressing clinician bias toward patients, incidents of patient bias toward clinicians also occur and are difficult to navigate.
   Clinicians anecdotally describe their experiences with patient bias, prejudice, and discrimination as profoundly painful and degrading. Though this phenomenon has not been rigorously studied, it is not unreasonable to postulate that the moral distress caused by patient bias may ultimately contribute to clinician burnout. Because women and minority clinicians are more likely to be targets of patient bias, this may worsen existing disparities for these groups and increase their risk for burnout. Biased behavior may also affect patient outcomes.
   Although some degree of ignoring derogatory comments is necessary to maintain professionalism and workflow, clinicians also have the right to a workplace free of mistreatment and abuse. How should clinicians reconcile the expectation to always "put patients first" with their basic right to be treated with dignity and respect? And how can health care organizations develop policies and training to mitigate the effects of these experiences?
   The authors discuss the ethical dilemmas associated with responding to prejudiced patients and then present a framework for clinicians to use when directly facing or witnessing biased behavior from patients. Finally, they describe strategies to address patient bias at the institutional level.

AB  - History can inconspicuously repeat itself through words and language. We explored the association between the "Black" and "African American" racial labels and the ideologies of the historical movements within which they gained prominence (Civil Rights and Black Power, respectively). Two content analyses and two preregistered experimental studies (N = 1,204 White American adults) show that the associations between "Black" and "bias and discrimination" and between "African American" and "civil rights and equality" are evident in images, op-eds, and perceptions of organizations. Google Images search results for "Black people" evoke more racially victimized imagery than search results for "African American people" (Study 1), and op-eds that use the Black label contain more bias and discrimination content than those that use the African American label (Study 2). Finally, White Americans infer the ideologies of organizations by the racial label within the organization's name (Studies 3 and 4). Consequently, these inferences guide the degree to which Whites support the organization financially.

AB  - The minimal group effect (MGE) is one of the most robust psychological findings in studies of intergroup conflict, yet there is little evidence comparing its magnitude across cultures. Recent evidence suggests that the MGE is due in part to a projection of one's own perceived characteristics onto the novel in-group. Because of cultural variability in self-enhancement motivations, we thus expected that those from East Asian cultures would exhibit a diminished MGE relative to Westerners. A large and diverse sample of Japanese and American participants completed a traditional minimal group study. American participants were more likely to show an in-group bias in group identification, perceived group intelligence, perceived group personality traits, and resource allocation. Furthermore, these cultural differences were partially mediated by self-esteem. We discuss the implication of these findings for theories of intergroup conflict and suggest multiple directions for future cross-cultural research on the MGE.

AB  - Objectives: To measure the 24-month impact on continuation, unintended pregnancy and satisfaction of trying long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) in a population seeking short-acting reversible contraception (SARC).
   Study design: We enrolled 916 women aged 18-29 who were seeking pills or injectables in a partially randomized patient preference trial. Women with strong preferences for pills or injectables started on those products, while others opted for randomization to LARC or SARC and received their methods gratis. We estimated continuation and unintended pregnancy rates through 24 months. Intent-to-treat principles were applied after method initiation for comparing incidence of unintended pregnancy. We also examined how satisfaction levels varied by cohort and how baseline negative LARC attitudes were associated with satisfaction over time.
   Results: Forty-three percent chose randomization, and 57% chose the preference option. Complete loss to followup was <2%. The 24-month LARC continuation probability was 64.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 56.6-70.9], statistically higher than SARC groups [25.5% (randomized) and 40.0% (preference)]. The 24-month cumulative unintended pregnancy probabilities were 9.9% (95% CI: 7.2-12.6) (preference-SARC), 6.9% (95% CI: 3.3-10.6) (randomized-SARC) and 3.6% (95% CI: 1.8-6.4) (randomized-LARC). Statistical tests for comparing randomized groups on unintended pregnancy were mixed: binomial at 24-month time point (p=.02) and log-rank survival probabilities (p=.14 for first pregnancies and p=.07 when including second pregnancies). LARC satisfaction was high (80% happy/neutral, 73% would use LARC again, 81% would recommend to a friend). Baseline negative attitudes toward LARC (27%) were not clearly associated with satisfaction or early discontinuation.
   Conclusions: The decision to try [ARC resulted in high continuation rates and substantial protection from unintended pregnancy over 24 months. Despite participants' initial desires to begin short-acting regimens, they had high satisfaction with [ARC. Voluntary decisions to try [ARC will benefit large proportions of typical SARC users.
   Implications: Even women who do not necessarily view LARC as a first choice may have a highly satisfying experience and avoid unintended pregnancy if they try it. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The efficacy of inoculation theory has been confirmed by decades of empirical research, yet optimizing its effectiveness remains a vibrant line of investigation. The present research turns to psychological reactance theory for a means of enhancing the core mechanisms of inoculation-threat and refutational preemption. Findings from a multisite study indicate reactance enhances key resistance outcomes, including: threat, anger at attack message source, negative cognitions, negative affect, anticipated threat to freedom, anticipated attack message source derogation, perceived threat to freedom, perceived attack message source derogation, and counterarguing. Most importantly, reactance-enhanced inoculations result in lesser attitude change-the ultimate measure of resistance.

AB  - Contrary to much boundary spanning research, we examined the negative consequences of boundary spanning contact in multi-organizational contexts. Results from a sample of 833 Dutch peacekeepers show that employees' boundary spanning contact with members of other organizations was associated with reports of negative relationships with external parties (e.g., work-specific problems, culture-specific problems). These negative relationships also had a spillover effect such that they mediated the effect of boundary spanning contact on boundary spanners' negative attitudes toward their own jobs and organization (e.g., job attractiveness and confidence in the organization).

AB  - Background: Drug abuse remains a serious problem in China, and has become a major threat to public health and social security. Since the issuance and enforcement of the new Anti-Drug law in 2008, the community has become the primary site for drug rehabilitation. However, the attitudes of members in community toward the people with drug use disorders are unclear.
   Methods: A random sample of household respondents was studied in two communities in Hunan province in China. A total of 848 individuals participated (response rate 83.7%). Respondents initially were asked a set of questions about their knowledge about dug dependence, and then were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 vignette conditions. Three vignettes described different type of drug dependence meeting diagnostic criteria, and the fourth depicted a "normal person."
   Results: Poor knowledge of drug dependence was common. Negative attitudes towards drug dependent people were widespread. Most respondents believed that drug dependence was caused by the person's own weak will (82.0%) and own hedonistic lifestyle (81.3%), and should be punished as illegal behavior (80.4%). The vast majority labeled the person with drug dependence as an addict, rated them as having undesirable characteristics, and expressed a strong desire for social distance. There were few socio-demographic predictors of both poor knowledge and negative attitudes.
   Conclusions: A community-based rehabilitation program in China should take into account the widespread stigmatization of people with drug dependence. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In comparison to heterosexual youth, sexual minority youth are more likely to experience victimization. Multiple studies have connected anti-gay prejudice and anti-gay victimization to negative outcomes. Research shows that social support may protect sexual minorities from the harmful effects of anti-gay victimization. However, rates of victimization and the negative outcomes linked to sexual identity within the sexual minority community have been relatively unexplored. Using data from three years of statewide data from heterosexual and sexual minority adolescents in grades 9-12, this study examines victimization, substance use, suicidality, and access to social support by sexuality. Results indicate that sexual minority youth are at increased risk for victimization, substance use, suicidality, and social isolation compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Results also indicate that there is very little bivariate difference within the sexual minority community. Multivariate results indicate differences among sexual minorities' experiences with victimization and substance use.

AB  - In the study reported on here we employed the interpretivist qualitative approach to explore the recruitment and retention of male educators in preschool centres. Purposive sampling was used to select 2 preschool owners, 2 principals, 4 preschool educators and 2 male educators in the Foundation Phase. Data were obtained by in-depth interviewing and were analysed thematically. Results showed no male educators in preschools in the education district where the study was conducted. Misinterpretation of cultural roles, stigma, fear and prejudice, low educator status within the preschool sector and a lack of male recruitment policies were found to be negatively affecting the recruitment of males into the preschool sector. A gender balance that ensures that both female and male educators are recruited within the preschool sector would appear to be congruent with the philosophical underpinnings of the Social Role Theory (SRT). The Departments of Education and Social Development should, therefore, embark on awareness campaigns to educate all stakeholders on the need for a gender balance within the preschool sector.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore university students' attitudes toward same-sex parenting and toward gay and lesbian rights. A total of 292 participants, aged between 18 and 27 (M = 21) responded to a questionnaire measuring attitudes toward parenting by gay men and lesbians, gay and lesbian rights, and beliefs about the etiology of homosexuality. Results revealed that the majority of students were against gay and lesbian parenting, gay and lesbian equal rights, and believed that homosexuality has a social/environmental basis. It was found that sexual prejudice is highly prevalent in Portuguese university students, and implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - To facilitate rigorous research on community programs to promote positive intergroup relations among youth, 2 studies were conducted to establish the psychometric properties of the Youth Diversity Acceptance Scale (YoDA). In Study 1, a unifactorial structure was identified for the YoDA using data provided by 126 high school youth involved in a community program to improve intergroup relations. Moreover, hypothesized correlations between YoDA scores and intergroup closeness, awareness of discrimination, distress over discrimination, and knowledge of bias were also found. In Study 2, a single-factor confirmatory factor analysis was run on data provided by 112 high school youth who participated in the same program. Although the analysis provided limited support for the single-factor solution, a subsequent exploratory factor analysis indicated that the single-factor solution was appropriate for the data. Overall, these studies provide initial evidence for the internal structure and convergent validity of the YoDA, supporting its use in research to examine the effects of community programs on the promotion of intergroup acceptance.

TI  - Constraints and prospects for contraceptive service provision to young people in Uganda: providers' perspectives

KW  - QUALITY
AB  - Background: Unintended pregnancies lead to unsafe abortions, which are a leading cause of preventable maternal mortality among young women in Uganda. There is a discrepancy between the desire to prevent pregnancy and actual contraceptive use. Health care providers' perspectives on factors influencing contraceptive use and service provision to young people aged 15-24 in two rural districts in Uganda were explored.
   Methods: Semi-structured questionnaires were used for face-to-face interviews with 102 providers of contraceptive service at public, private not-for-profit, and private for-profit health facilities in two rural districts in Uganda. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used in the analysis of data.
   Results: Providers identified service delivery, provider-focused, structural, and client-specific factors that influence contraceptive use among young people. Contraceptive use and provision to young people were constrained by sporadic contraceptive stocks, poor service organization, and the limited number of trained personnel, high costs, and unfriendly service. Most providers were not competent enough to provide long-acting methods. There were significant differences in providers' self-rated competence by facility type; private for-profit providers' competence was limited for most contraceptives. Providers had misconceptions about contraceptives, they had negative attitudes towards the provision of contraceptives to young people, and they imposed non-evidence-based age restrictions and consent requirements. Thus, most providers were not prepared or were hesitant to give young people contraceptives. Short-acting methods were, however, considered acceptable for young married women and those with children.
   Conclusion: Provider, client, and health system factors restricted contraceptive provision and use for young people. Their contraceptive use prospects are dependent on provider behavior and health system improvements.

AB  - We identify a novel cultural red king effect' that, in many cases, results in stable arrangements which are to the detriment of minority groups. In particular, we show inequalities disadvantaging minority groups can naturally arise under an adaptive process when minority and majority members must routinely determine how to divide resources amongst themselves. We contend that these results show how inequalities disadvantaging minorities can likely arise by dint of their relative size and need not be a result of either explicit nor implicit prejudices, nor due to intrinsic differences between minority and majority members.

AB  - Two studies investigated the role of personality factors in the amelioration of outgroup attitudes via intergroup contact. In study 1, the effect of extraversion on outgroup attitude operated via an increase in cross-group friendship, whereas openness to experience and agreeableness had a direct effect on outgroup attitude. In study 2, we included intergroup anxiety as a mediator explaining these relationships, and we ruled out ingroup friendship as a potential confound. We found that the relationships between openness to experience and agreeableness on the one hand and outgroup attitude on the other were mediated by reduced intergroup anxiety. In addition, the effect of extraversion on outgroup attitude operated via an increase in cross-group friendship that was in turn associated with lower levels of intergroup anxiety. Across both studies, the friendship-attitude relationship was stronger among those low in agreeableness and extraversion. We discuss the importance of integrating personality and situational approaches to prejudice reduction in optimizing the impact of contact-based interventions.

AB  - Intergroup contact plays a critical role in the reduction of prejudice; however, there is limited research examining the multiple ways through which contact can impact trajectories of development for adolescents in divided societies. Thus, the goal of the current study was to examine individual- and context-level effects of intergroup contact on change in intergroup bias through adolescence. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to analyze five waves of data from 933 youth (M (age) = 15.5, SD = 4.03; range: 10-20 years old; 52% female) living in 38 neighborhoods in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The results suggest that youth increase in bias with age. Adolescents with more frequent intergroup contact increase more quickly, and those who report higher quality of contact increase more slowly. Both frequency and quality of contact at the neighborhood level predicted slower increases in bias across adolescence. The results add to a growing literature that combines social and developmental approaches to understanding how intergroup processes and intergroup divide impact youth development of intergroup attitudes and behaviors. The results are discussed in terms of the importance of both individual experiences and the context of intergroup contact for youth development in divided contexts.

AB  - Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, the researchers conducted a qualitative exploration of transgender and gender-expansive students' experiences of genderism while attending women's colleges and universities. Genderism is understood as prejudice or bias that results from a binary view of gender. Ten participants shared their experiences of genderism related to gender identity, gender role, gender expression, relationships, academics, residence life, and university policies and practices. Six themes are presented with support from participant extracts. Implications for faculty. staff, and administrators at women's colleges and universities are discussed, along with considerations for advocacy efforts.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this repeated-measures study was to examine the roles of cultural mistrust and perceived mentor support for ethnic-racial identity in a sample of girls of color. It was hypothesized that mentors' support for ethnic-racial identity measured at baseline would influence relationship quality, as well as the girls' ethnic identity and cultural mistrust. at the end of the intervention, adjusting for baseline measures. It was also hypothesized that girls' cultural mistrust toward Whites at baseline would be negatively associated with mentoring relationship quality at the end of the intervention. Method: Participants were 40 adolescent girls of color who were matched with racially-ethnically diverse women mentors in a community-based mentoring program. Results: Mentor support for ethnic-racial identity as reported by youth significantly predicted relative increases in youth reports of relational but not instrumental satisfaction. Higher mentor support for ethnic-racial identity also significantly predicted increases in ethnic identity exploration. but only among girls with White mentors. Further, youth's reported greater cultural mistrust toward Whites was a significant predictor of decreased instrumental relationship satisfaction among girls with White mentors. Conclusions: Findings support the importance of further efforts to understand the roles of culturally relevant relationship processes and youth attitudes in mentoring interventions for girls of color.

AB  - The choice of casarean deliveries by mothers is highly influenced by inadequate knowldge and negative attitudes towards vaginal birth. In this semi-experimental study, we compared knowledge, attitude, and decision making about modes of delivery between nulliparous pregnant women who received eight sessions of group consultation and those who took routine prenatal education. Contrary to the control group, the improvement of knowledge and attitudes were significant in the consultation group (p < 0.001), as well as mothers' decisions for vaginal birth (p = 0.03). Group consultation is an appropriate approach to improving knowledge, attitudes, and tendencies of mothers toward natural birth.

AB  - It is widely believed that race divides the world into biologically distinct kinds of people-an essentialist belief inconsistent with reality. Essentialist views of race have been described as early emerging, but this study found that young children (n = 203, M-age = 5.45) hold only the more limited belief that the physical feature of skin color is inherited and stable. Overall, children rejected the causal essentialist view that behavioral and psychological characteristics are constrained by an inherited racial essence. Although average levels of children's causal essentialist beliefs about race were low, variation in these beliefs was related to children's own group membership, exposure to diversity, as well as children's own social attitudes.

AB  - Background
   Delay in help seeking for cancer 'alarm' symptoms has been identified as a contributor to delayed diagnosis.
   Aim
   To understand people's help-seeking decision making for cancer alarm symptoms, without imposing a cancer context.
   Design and setting
   Community-based, qualitative interview study in the UK, using purposive sampling by sex, socioeconomic status, and prior help seeking, with framework analysis of transcripts.
   Method
   Interviewees (n = 48) were recruited from a community-based sample (n = 1724) of adults aged = 50 years who completed a health survey that included a list of symptoms. Cancer was not mentioned. Participants reporting any of 10 cancer alarm symptoms (n = 915) and who had consented to contact (n = 482) formed the potential pool from which people were invited to an interview focusing on their symptom experiences.
   Results
   Reasons for help seeking included symptom persistence, social influence, awareness/fear of a link with cancer, and 'just instinct'. Perceiving the symptom as trivial or 'normal' was a deterrent, as was stoicism, adopting self-management strategies, and fear of investigations. Negative attitudes to help seeking were common. Participants did not want to be seen as making a fuss, did not want to waste the doctor's time, and were sometimes not confident that the GP could help.
   Conclusion
   Decision making about cancer alarm symptoms was complex. Recognition of cancer risk almost always motivated help seeking (more so than the fear of cancer being a deterrent), assisted by recent public-awareness campaigns. As well as symptom persistence motivating help seeking, it could also have the reverse effect. Negative attitudes to help seeking were significant deterrents.

AB  - When anticipating the imposition of the death penalty, jurors may be less inclined to convict defendants. On the other hand, minority defendants have been shown to be treated more punitively, particularly in capital cases. Given that the influence of anticipated sentence severity on verdicts may vary as a function of defendant race, the goal of this study was to test the independent and interactive effects of these factors. We conducted a survey-embedded experiment with a nationally representative sample to examine the effect on verdicts of sentence severity as a function of defendant race, presenting respondents with a triple murder trial summary that manipulated the maximum penalty (death vs. life without parole) and the race of the defendant. Respondents who were told life-without-parole was the maximum sentence were not significantly more likely to convict Black (67.7%) than White (66.7%) defendants. However, when death was the maximum sentence, respondents presented with Black defendants were significantly more likely to convict (80.0%) than were those with White defendants (55.1%). The results indicate that the death penalty may be a cause of racial disparities in criminal justice, and implicate threats to civil rights and to effective criminal justice.

AB  - Background: Dementia is the decline in cognitive function sufficient to impair one's accustomed functioning. Countries with aging populations, such as Singapore, face rising rates of dementia. Dementia patients and their caregivers endure great financial and emotional stress. With the broad aim of minimizing these stresses, this study provides a cross-sectional view of the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions (KAP) towards dementia in middle-aged Singaporean residents.
   Objective: We aim to examine 1) the associations between demographic correlates and KAP; and 2) the effect of dementia knowledge on attitudes and perceptions towards dementia.
   Methods: An online anonymous cross-sectional questionnaire was administered to Singaporeans and Permanent Residents aged 45 to 65 years old in English, Mandarin, and Malay. Knowledge was evaluated across three domains: symptoms, risk factors, and management. Total and domain scores were dichotomized as good or poor knowledge using median cut-offs. Attitudes/perceptions across six domains were evaluated on Likert scales, and responses to each question were dichotomized into positive or negative attitudes/perceptions.
   Results: From 1,733 responses, 1,209 valid complete responses were accepted (mean age +/- SD 54.8 +/- 5.12 years old, females = 69.6%). Lower socioeconomic status was associated with poorer knowledge and greater barriers to risk-mitigating lifestyle modifications. Lack of personal experience with dementia and poor knowledge were also associated with erroneous attitudes/perceptions.
   Conclusion: Socioeconomic status and personal experience affect KAP towards dementia. Policy and education campaigns to address KAP towards dementia should account for baseline differences across demographics, for greater improvements in dementia incidence and support.

AB  - Evaluating other people's social encounters from a third-person perspective is an ubiquitous activity of daily life. Yet little is known about how these evaluations are affected by racial bias. To overcome this empirical lacuna, two experiments were conducted. The first experiment used evaluative priming to show that both Black (n = 44) and White Americans (n = 44) assess the same mundane encounters (e.g. two people chatting) less favorably when they involve a Black and a White individual rather than two Black or two White individuals. The second experiment used functional magnetic resonance imaging to demonstrate that both Black (n = 46) and White Americans (n = 42) respond with reduced social reward processing (i.e. lower activity in the ventral striatum) and enhanced mentalizing (e.g. higher activity in the bilateral temporal-parietal junction) toward so-called cross-race relative to same-race encounters. By combining unobtrusive measures from social psychology and social neuroscience, this work demonstrates that racial bias can affect impression formation even at the level of the dyad.

KW  - PATTERNS
AB  - Candidate list positions have been shown to influence decision making when voters have limited candidate information. Here, a primacy advantage is observed owing to a greater number of positive arguments generated for early list candidates. The present study examined list position effects when an absence of information precludes such a confirmatory bias heuristic. We report the first large-scale low-information experimental election where candidate position is fully counterbalanced. Seven hundred and twenty participants voted in a mock election where the position of six fictitious and meaningless parties was counterbalanced across the electorate. Analysis by position revealed that significantly fewer votes were allocated to the terminal parties, and found preliminary evidence of an alphabetical bias. This positional bias was not present in a methodological replication using six genuine UK political parties. This suggests that in situations of pure guessing, the heuristic shifts from the primacy benefiting confirmatory bias to an alternative heuristic that prejudices the first and last parties. These findings suggest that while the UK general electoral process may be largely immune to positional prejudice, English local elections (in which there can be multiple candidates from the same party) and multiple preference ranking systems (Scottish Local Government and London Mayoral Elections) could be susceptible to both positional and alphabetical biases.

AB  - The development of world education is implemented in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disability and other regulations that determine the right of people with disability to receive quality education at all levels, including in the field of vocational training. Studying the experience of Ukraine will provide an opportunity to take into account the trends of inclusion in higher education in order to increase its effectiveness. The purpose of the article is to study the state of teachers' readiness of higher educational institutions (HEI) for implementing inclusive education. Methods of research: analysis of literary sources on the problems of inclusive education; questioning teachers of HEI; quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results of the research. The results of the study showed the insufficient readiness of teachers of HEI for implementing inclusive education as evidenced by the lack of understanding of the essence of inclusive education, special educational needs of children and the specifics of their education in inclusive institutions; prejudice against persons with SEN and inclusion processes; low self-esteem of inclusive competence and desire to increase it. According to the results of the questionnaire, the ways of development of inclusion in the HEI were outlined. The perspective task of the research is the development and testing of the content and methods of formation readiness of scientific and pedagogical workers for inclusive education.

AB  - Objective: To assess the association between perceived stigma and discrimination and caregiver strain, caregiver well-being, and patient community reintegration.
   Design: A cross-sectional survey study of 564 informal caregivers of U.S. military service veterans of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who experienced traumatic brain injuries or polytrauma (TBI/PT).
   Setting: Care settings of community-dwelling former inpatients of U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Polytrauma Rehabilitation Centers.
   Participants: Caregivers of former inpatients (N = 564), identified through next-of-kin records and subsequent nominations.
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Caregiver strain, depression, anxiety, loneliness, and self-esteem; as well as care recipient community reintegration, a key aspect of TBI/PT rehabilitation.
   Results: Family stigma was associated with strain, depression, anxiety, loneliness, lower self-esteem, and less community reintegration. Caregiver stigma-by-association was associated with strain, depression, anxiety, loneliness, and lower self-esteem. Care recipient stigma was associated with caregiver strain, depression, anxiety, loneliness, lower self-esteem, and less community reintegration.
   Conclusions: Perceived stigma may be a substantial source of stress for caregivers of U.S. military veterans with TBI/PT, and may contribute to poor outcomes for the health of caregivers and for the community reintegration of the veterans for whom they provide care.

AB  - Self-affirmation has shown promise in promoting prohealth attitudes following exposure to threatening health messages by reducing defensive processing of such messages. We examine the impact of self-affirmation prior to viewing graphic cigarette warning labels on implicit and explicit attitudes toward smoking in a sample of African American smokers (N = 151). Participants held negative explicit and implicit attitudes toward smoking. We found no direct effect of self-affirmation on either implicit or explicit attitudes. Self-affirmation and risk level did not interact to predict either attitude type. We discuss findings in terms of self-affirmation theory, attitude measurement, and the meta-cognitive model of attitude change.

AB  - Purpose Research demonstrates that anorexia nervosa (AN) takes a significant toll on affected families, yet the well-being of siblings has been largely overlooked. This study examines mental health symptoms in siblings of adolescents with AN and seeks to identify modifiable factors associated with well-being. Method Participants included 34 siblings (aged 11-19) of adolescents with AN and 47 age and sex matched controls. Participants and their caregivers completed assessments of anxiety, depression, internalizing and externalizing problems, and parentification. Siblings of adolescents with AN also completed the Sibling Perception Questionnaire, an assessment of perceptions and attitudes about AN. Results Analyses indicated that siblings of adolescents with AN reported greater anxiety and parentification than controls. On caregiver reports of participants' internalizing and externalizing symptoms, no significant differences were found across groups. In siblings of adolescents with AN, females were more vulnerable to anxiety, depression, and negative attitudes and perceptions about AN than males. Perceived negative interpersonal interactions, specific to having a brother or sister with AN, were associated with greater anxiety and depression among AN siblings. Conclusion Findings from this pilot study suggest that siblings of adolescents with AN are vulnerable to anxiety and parentification behaviors. Negative interpersonal interactions specific to having a brother or sister with AN may perpetuate risk for poorer well-being. Caregivers may not be attuned to these struggles, highlighting the importance of provider and family education about sibling vulnerabilities. Therapeutic interventions that target siblings of adolescents with AN are also indicated.

While the project of colonisation involves settling in a new country and confronting wild animals, the dog is one animal on which the settler can rely as an ally, protector and companion. Settler dogs whose breeds stem from Britain are in a sense the animal counterpart of the human settler. When these animals desert their owners either by cross-breeding with indigenous dogs or reverting to the wild, it can seem like a betrayal of their settler owners and of the colonial project. Doris Lessing explores this dilemma in "The Story of Two Dogs" which is a semi-autobiographical story of her family and their dogs. She grew up in the 1930s on a farm in colonial Rhodesia. Lessing creates an ironical narrative voice that undermines colonial discourse and exposes racial and class prejudice among the settler community. Through the lens of the dogs she also draws attention to gender conflict and the subjugation of women in matters of dog training and hunting. In addition, conflict between adults and children is brought out which points to possibilities of a more open approach to the question of dog breeding, training and ownership. She also raises questions about the ultimate nature of the dog and its status as a domesticated animal.

AB  - The 2012 gangrape of a young woman in Delhi, known as the Nirbhaya case, became an international media event that cast public spaces in India as unsafe, and situated sexual violence as a problem characterized by class difference and lack of development. This dominant media discourse reiterated long-standing neocolonial, classist and casteist tropes that signified a failure of transnational solidarity. At this time, Talk to Me, a public art intervention by the Bangalore-based feminist artist collective, Blank Noise, went viral on social media. The project took place near the Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology on a lane along which many women experience molestation and harassment. Students from Srishti engaged strangers - typically migrant and displaced men from the lower classes - in a conversation over tea and a snack. In this article, I analyse Talk to Me as an intervention that offered a counternarrative and countervisual to the dominant, fear-based characterization of public spaces in India. Talk to Me encouraged participants, through a process of dialogue and conversation, to identify and overcome their internalized biases about the lower-class, migrant men who are often constructed as sexual threats to upper-class women. These conversations, I argue, were designed to break down ingrained biases and internalized prejudice, and to attempt to create compassion and solidarity across the barriers of class, education, language, and gender. The intervention offers a model of building solidarity that is not passive or automatic, but rather requires the difficult and often uncomfortable labour of self-reflection and introspection.

AB  - The international literature shows that there are considerable deficits in nutritional care provision in nursing homes. Limited knowledge and negative attitudes can contribute to these deficits but international studies on knowledge and attitudes among nursing staff are rare.
   The study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of registered nurses and nurse aides towards malnutrition care in nursing homes.
   This study followed a multicentre, cross sectional design. Setting and Participants: The study was performed in 66 Austrian nursing homes with 1152 participants.
   The validated Knowledge of Malnutrition-Geriatric (KoM-G) questionnaire and the Staff Attitudes to Nutritional Nursing Care Geriatric (SANN-G) scale were used for data collection.
   On average, 60.6% of the respondents answered the questions correctly, whereas registered nurses knew significantly more (65.6%) than nurse aides (57.3%). The question that was answered correctly by most dealt with the factors that positively affect oral nutritional intake (87.2%) while the question which was incorrectly answered by most was on the professions involved in malnutrition treatment (26.1%). 39.2% of respondents had positive attitudes towards nutritional care. Registered nurses displayed more positive attitudes (48.1%) than nurse aides (33.6%). The most positive attitudes were shown in the 'Intervention' subscale while the least positive attitudes were indicated in the 'Norms' subscale. A medium positive correlation between knowledge and attitudes was found (r=.423, p < 0.000).
   This study identified specific knowledge deficits and areas of negative attitudes in registered nurses and nurse aides, which will enable tailored training programmes to be developed.

AB  - Background: Previous studies found that individuals who harbor hostile attitudes toward immigrants & refugees tend to vote for far right nationalist parties, and that the same individuals also tend to report worse health status. We sought to test these associations using the latest data from 21 EU countries, and also whether the associations were moderated by the share of unemployed people in each region and individuals' labor situation.Methods: We analyzed the second release of the 2016 European Social Survey which includes different questions about attitudes toward immigrants and refugees, as well as a rich variety of socioeconomic variables. Multilevel Poisson regression models were developed, regressing fair/poor health on attitudes towards immigrants & refugees.Results: For each one point increase in favorable attitudes toward immigrants, the prevalence of fair/poor health was reduced by 2 percentage points (PR = 0.98; 95%CI: 0.96-0.99). In analyses incorporating cross-level interactions, the association was not moderated by high background unemployment rates or individual labor market attachment.Conclusion: Positive attitudes toward immigrants are correlated with lower prevalence of fair/poor health in general, regardless of individuals' labor situation and the objective economic situation. Fostering empathy toward immigrants and refugees may thus promote a healthier society, especially among more prejudiced individuals.

AB  - Introduction: Unemployment is one of the factors that contribute to homelessness and the actions for productive inclusion is recommended as strategic to increase autonomy, social participation and overcoming this situation. Objective: To identify productive inclusion actions carried out by Centros Pop (Centers of Specialized Reference for Population in Street Situation) of the state of Sao Paulo and the view of the coordinators of this equipment about this dimension of the work with the homeless people. Method: This is qualitative research, carried out through the application of a protocol of personal and professional identification and identification of equipment and a semi-structured questionnaire with coordinators of 13 Centros Pop in the state of Sao Paulo. The data were analyzed descriptively and for the open questions, the thematic analysis was used. Results: The productive inclusion was associated with the overcoming of the street situation to access to the labor market and income and to social belonging. The role of the Centro Pop in the provision of information, referrals, and intersectoral articulation, especially for professional qualification and training, as well as challenges such as prejudice, low qualification and schooling, and the use of psychoactive substances were highlighted. Conclusion: Collective and intersectoral actions are needed that recognize access to work as a right, in line with the desires, needs, and singularities of street people, where productive inclusion, through the articulation between different policies and services, can contribute to the vulnerability reduction and creation of autonomy. In this scenario, Centros Pop can play an important role

AB  - The present survey study examined a sample of ethnic minority preadolescents (ages 9-13) and made the empirical distinction between their exposure to peer victimization and the extent to which they attributed this to discrimination. Both peer victimization and the attribution to discrimination were associated with lower self-esteem and more emotional problems, but the discrimination attribution buffered against the negative effect of victimization on self-esteem. Our findings concur with the widespread evidence for the harmful consequences of discrimination but also show that it can be self-protective to make attributions to discrimination in real life.

AB  - Purpose: The present study aimed to assess the current situation of Chinese dental bachelor interns on HIV/AIDS-related knowledge and their attitudes towards HIV/AIDS patients.
   Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional, paper-based survey involving 147 dental students from three Chinese dental schools was conducted. Students were recruited to complete the questionnaire regarding their knowledge, awareness and attitudes concerning HIV/AIDS anonymously and voluntarily.
   Results: A total of 144 students responded to the study, generating a response rate of 98.0%. Although 97.0% of the dental students believed dentists were at high risk of HIV infection, 97.2% of students expressed no prejudice towards HIV/AIDS patients and stated their willingness to provide oral healthcare service for such patients. No statistically significant differences in the responses on attitudes and some basic knowledge were found between students who had received the relevant education about infection control and the students who had not. However, regarding most questions about oral manifestations in adult and paediatric patients living with AIDS, the students who received relevant education showed more knowledge than the students who did not (p<0.05). The cognitive level about respecting HIV/AIDS patients' autonomy and privacy was generally low in all the students.
   Conclusions: Most of the dental students in this survey held positive attitudes towards HIV/AIDS patients and good grasp of some basic knowledge about HIV/AIDS. On the other hand, the questionnaire results reflected gaps in education, such as respecting HIV/AIDS patients' privacy.

AB  - Currently, most work in advertising assumes neutral or positive effects of exposed ads that are physically present, but not actively attended to by consumers. The primary justification for this assumption is the mere exposure effect. Recent work suggests that when people avoid distracting stimuli while engaged in a search or focused activity, however, negative affect for the distractor can occur. This distractor devaluation hypothesis was applied to banner ads. Results show that participants developed more negative attitudes toward avoided brands that appeared as distractor ads on a Web page, particularly when the ads were visually similar and near the target content.

AB  - Background: Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak, was locked down on January 23, 2020. We aimed to investigate the barriers to the physical prevention, negative attitudes, and anxiety levels. Methods: A online cross-sectional survey was conducted with the people living in Wuhan between March 12th and 23rd, 2020. Results: Of a total of 2411 complete responses, the mean and standard deviation for the total physical prevention barriers score was 19.73 (standard deviation +/- 5.3; range 12-45) out of a possible score of 48. Using a cut-off score of 44 for the State-Trait Inventory score, 79.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 78.2-81.5) of the participants reported moderate to severe anxiety during the early phase of the outbreak, and 51.3% (95% CI 49.2-53.3) reported moderate to severe anxiety after the peak of coronavirus disease 2019 was over (during the study period). Comparing anxiety levels in the early phase of the outbreak and after the peak of the outbreak, 58.5% (95% CI 56.5-60.5) recorded a decreased anxiety. Females reported a higher likelihood of having decreased levels of anxiety than males (odds ratio = 1.78, 95% CI 1.48-2.14). Low negative attitudes score were associated with a higher decrease in anxiety (odds ratio = 1.59, 95% CI 1.33-1.89). Conclusions: The attitudinal barriers to prevention of transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 are more prominent than physical prevention barriers after the peak of corona virus disease 2019. High anxiety levels even after the peak warrant serious attention.

TI  - Intercultural Identities: Addressing the Global Dimension through Art Education
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ART & DESIGN EDUCATION
LA  - English
AB  - Recent educational policy and practice have established an extended role for all subjects in addressing children and young peoples' academic and interpersonal development, with strategies facilitating key skills and wider learning across areas of Citizenship and Personal, Social and Health education providing an integrated approach to education and welfare. The significance of global development education within a holistic curriculum acknowledges the increased awareness of the interconnected nature of our relationship with each other and with the planet we share as world citizens. The arts have a strong track-record in addressing such key issues challenging hierarchical paradigms which reinforce prejudice and stereotyping, the arts encourage reflexive processes and critical engagement with diversity and pluralist perspectives. This article investigates curricular approaches to the global dimension within education in relation to theoretical perspectives and policies, presenting an intercultural art case study as a model of practice in engaging diverse participants in reflection on their own and others' experiences across a range of socio-cultural contexts. Current political shifts reaffirming the centrality of the discrete disciplines over cross-curricular practice could potentially undermine a more holistic approach to education. The article argues that policy and practice, implemented in response to changing political and philosophical ideology, must nevertheless maintain a commitment to fostering interdisciplinary values of cultural awareness. Such practice must form part of an inclusive internationalist educational vision, impacting on social cohesion.

TI  - Cannabis Regulatory Confusion and Its Impact on Consumer Adoption
T2  - AMERICAN BUSINESS LAW JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - The regulation of cannabis in the United States is inconsistent and contradictory, to put it mildly. While marijuana remains classified as a Schedule I substance under the federal Controlled Substance Act-in the same category as heroin and morphine, with accompanying criminal penalties up to and including life imprisonment for its production, distribution, and possession-as of the end of 2020, eleven states and the District of Columbia had legalized recreational marijuana use and thirty-six states and the District of Columbia had decriminalized the use of marijuana for medical purposes. Despite the trend toward legalization, however, marijuana is a stigmatized product. Stigmatized products are those toward which a significant portion of consumers hold negative attitudes and beliefs, whereas the concept of legitimacy is defined as a generalized perception or assumption that the actions of an entity are desirable, proper, or appropriate within some socially constructed system of norms, values, beliefs, and definitions. This article addresses how current legislation and regulations influence consumer perceptions of a product category, and how conflicting regulations (or the lack of regulations) influence the adoption of a stigmatized product such as cannabis (i.e., marijuana and cannabidiol products)

KW  - INTERNALIZED STIGMA
KW  - PREJUDICE
AB  - Research on the development of implicit intergroup attitudes has placed heavy emphasis on race, leaving open how social categories that are prominent in other cultures might operate. We investigate two of India's primary means of social distinction, caste and religion, and explore the development of implicit and explicit attitudes towards these groups in minority-status Muslim children and majority-status Hindu children, the latter drawn from various positions in the Hindu caste system. Results from two tests of implicit attitudes find that caste attitudes parallel previous findings for race: higher-caste children as well as lower-caste children have robust high-caste preferences. However, results for religion were strikingly different: both lower-status Muslim children and higher-status Hindu children show strong implicit ingroup preferences. We suggest that religion may play a protective role in insulating children from the internalization of stigma.

AB  - Mathematics is often taught covertly as a 'service' subject in geography departments, but can often be a cause of fear for students who may not have studied the subject post-GCSE. Negative attitudes are common and many students show signs of maths anxiety. This paper details how students' attitudes were changed by a new foundation mathematics course which taught numeracy in an applied context. By starting at an appropriate baseline level and working in a small-group teaching environment, overall feedback scores from module evaluation forms increased from 1.5/5.0 to 4.4/5.0 (where 1 is poor and 5 is good) over a period of two years.

AB  - Aims The aim of this study was to explore how registered nurses manage and deliver care to patients admitted to medical wards and Medical Assessment Units with complications of drug use and to elicit the experiences and views of those receiving that care. Background Illicit drug use is a major public health problem worldwide. The physical complications of problem drug use often result in admission to medical wards. Registered nurses working in these settings have been reported as possessing negative attitudes towards patients who use illicit drugs and lacking preparation to provide problem drug userelated care needs. Design Grounded theory. Methods A grounded theory approach was used to collect and analyse 41 semi-structured interviews. Data collection and analysis were undertaken in nine medical wards in the Northwest of England in 2008. A combination of purposive and theoretical sampling was adopted to recruit registered nurses (n=29) and medical ward patients (n=12) admitted for physical complications of problem drug use. Data were subjected to constant comparative analysis. Findings Two sub-categories emerged: Lack of knowledge to care' and Distrust and detachment' and these formed the core category Dissonant care'. The combination of lack of educational preparation, negative attitudes and experience of conflict, aggression, and untrustworthiness appeared to affect negatively the nursepatient relationship. Conclusions This study illuminated interplay of factors that complicated the delivery of care. The complexity of caring for patients who are pre-judged negatively by nurses appears to engender dissonance and disparities in care delivery. Better education and training, coupled with role support about problem drug use may reduce conflict, disruption, and violence and facilitate competent care for these patients.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the experiences of transgender and gender non-binary (TNB) physicians in medical residency training programs. Aim: To identify the self-reported experiences and needs of TNB individuals during medical residency in United States training programs. Methods: An online, anonymous survey of TNB current residents and recent graduates was designed. Results: A total of 26 respondents completed the survey. The most common reported gender identity was non-binary or gender queer (n = 11, 42.3%) and male or transgender man (n = 7, 26.9%). About half of participants (n = 14, 53.8%) had undergone gender affirming interventions prior to residency. Most participants (n = 19, 73.1%) did not know all the gender affirming healthcare benefits offered by their program. The majority (n = 21, 80.8%) also reported 2 hours or less of transgender-related didactics in residency. Respondents were most likely to disclose their gender identity to other residents (n = 19, 73.1%) and faculty (n = 19, 73.1%) and were least likely to disclose their identity to patients (n = 6, 23.1%). Most respondents (n = 15, 57.7%) stated that program faculty and staff communicated support for their gender identity. Most participants (n = 16, 61.5%) reported that they perceived transgender residents to be treated similarly to their non-transgender peers in their training program, while the remainder (n = 7, 26.9%) disagreed or strongly disagreed. Nevertheless, approximately three-quarters of trainees (n = 22, 84.6%) self-reported microaggressions during their training program and non-binary and transfeminine trainees were more likely to report these experiences than transmasculine people. Nearly a quarter of transfeminine and non-binary participants reported macroaggressions, with none of the transmasculine respondents reporting these negative experiences. Most macroaggressions were from program faculty. Discussion: This study highlights that while most physicians in residency report support from their program for their TNB identity, TNB physicians still experience significant barriers and prejudices throughout training and more action is needed among program faculty for support of TNB trainees.

AB  - Although Embodied Cognition and Performance Practice could be said to have in common that they live in the fields of hermeneutics and epistemology concurrently, and with this are interested in perception, knowledge, experience and agency without privileging any of them or presuming a linear or status relationship among them -- there still remains a divisive disciplinary gulf. This paper provides a critical history of the science/humanities divide, exposing prejudices and practices that often impede productive interdisciplinary relationships between Cognitive Science and Performance, and offers suggestions forward towards a more productive middle field allowing for the possibility of new knowledge(s).

AB  - Background: The efficacy of e-cigarette prevention ads among adolescents has seldom been studied. We examined the impact of ads from the The Real Cost vaping prevention media campaign on what adolescents think and believe about vaping. We also sought to test whether perceived message effectiveness (PME) served as a proxy for ad impact.
   Methods: Participants were 543 U.S. adolescents ages 13-17. In an online experiment, we randomized participants to either: 1) persuasive e-cigarette prevention video ads from the Food and Drug Administration's The Real Cost campaign that was targeted to adolescents or 2) information-only e-cigarette harms control videos (control condition). Participants in each condition viewed 2 videos in a random order. After ad exposure, the survey assessed PME (message and effects perceptions), risk beliefs about vaping, attitudes toward vaping, and intentions to vape.
   Results: The FDA's The Real Cost ads led to higher beliefs about the harms of vaping (p < .001), more negative attitudes toward vaping (p < .001), and lower intentions to vape (p < .05) compared to the control videos. The Real Cost ads also scored higher on both message perceptions (p < .001) and effects perceptions (p < .001) compared to control videos. Effects perceptions were associated with all three outcomes (all ps < 0.001, adjusting for both types of PME and covariates), but message perceptions did not offer additional predictive value.
   Conclusions: Exposure to The Real Cost vaping prevention ads gave adolescents a more negative view of vaping and lowered their intentions to vape compared to control videos. Effects perceptions may be superior to message perceptions as a proxy for e-cigarette prevention ad impact.

AB  - This article discusses a mixed-methods study that explored women's views about menopause and any relationship between these and several measures of body consciousness. A total of 270 women in the United Kingdom completed surveys of menopausal attitudes, self-objectification, body surveillance and body shame. There was a positive association between rating highly on body dissatisfaction scales and holding negative attitudes towards menopause. Interviews (n = 12) were conducted to investigate this further. Menopause was inextricably linked with aging for these women, and changing appearance was a particular concern for women who rated high on self-objectification. The implications of this are discussed.

AB  - Evidence shows that ageism negatively impacts the health of older adults. However, estimates of its prevalence are lacking. This study aimed to estimate the global prevalence of ageism towards older adults and to explore possible explanatory factors. Data were included from 57 countries that took part in Wave 6 of the World Values Survey. Multilevel Latent Class Analysis was performed to identify distinct classes of individuals and countries. Individuals were classified as having high, moderate or low ageist attitudes; and countries as being highly, moderately or minimally ageist, by aggregating individual responses. Individual-level (age, sex, education and wealth) and contextual-level factors (healthy life expectancy, population health status and proportion of the population aged over 60 years) were examined as potential explanatory factors in multinomial logistic regression. From the 83,034 participants included, 44%, 32% and 24% were classified as having low, moderate and high ageist attitudes, respectively. From the 57 countries, 34 were classified as moderately or highly ageist. The likelihood of an individual or a country being ageist was significantly reduced by increases in healthy life expectancy and the proportion of older people within a country. Certain personal characteristics-younger age, being male and having lower education-were significantly associated with an increased probability of an individual having high ageist attitudes. At least one in every two people included in this study had moderate or high ageist attitudes. Despite the issue's magnitude and negative health impacts, ageism remains a neglected global health issue.

AB  - Introduction. In high-income countries, sexual minorities are at a higher risk for disordered eating behaviors. It is not known whether these findings can be extrapolated to Mexico. Objective. Determine whether there are any differences in disordered eating behaviors among Mexican youth according to sexual orientation and analyze the potential role of experiences of violence and discrimination as mediators of these differences. Method. Data from a representative sample of Mexican youth (12 to 29 years old, n = 27,876) were analyzed. Three groups were identified: young people who were not in love (NIL), who were in love with people of the opposite sex (ILOS), or in love with people of the same sex (ILSS). Restrictive behaviors, secret eating, and self-induced vomiting were identified through a scale created for the survey. Results. ILSS men had a higher risk of restrictive thoughts and behaviors (B = .31), secret eating (OR = 2.21), and self-induced vomiting (OR = 3.65) than ILOS youth. Among women, there was only a difference in self-induced vomiting (RM = 2.49). In both sexes, being a young ILSS had an indirect effect on restrictive behaviors through its association with experiences of violence, discrimination at school, and sexual violence. Discussion and conclusion. Mexican sexual minority men are at a higher risk of disordered eating behaviors, whereas sexual minority women are at a higher risk of purging. Part of the differences in restrictive behaviors were explained by the increased risk for experiences of prejudice faced by sexual minority youth.

AB  - Purpose Implicit bias can adversely affect health disparities. The implicit association test (IAT) is a prompt to stimulate reflection; however, feedback about bias may trigger emotions that reduce the effectiveness of feedback interventions. Exploring how individuals process feedback about implicit bias may inform bias recognition and management curricula. The authors sought to explore how health professionals perceive the influence of the experience of taking the IAT and receiving their results.
   Method Using constructivist grounded theory methodology, the authors conducted semistructured interviews with 21 pediatric physicians and nurses at the Schulich School of Medicine and Dentistry, Western University, Ontario, Canada, from September 2015 to November 2016 after they completed the mental illness IAT and received their result. Data were analyzed using constant comparative procedures to work toward axial coding and development of an explanatory theory.
   Results When provided feedback about their implicit attitudes, participants described tensions between acceptance and justification, and between how IAT results relate to idealized and actual personal and professional identity. Participants acknowledged desire for change while accepting that change is difficult. Most participants described the experience of taking the IAT and receiving their result as positive, neutral, or interesting.
   Conclusions These findings contribute to emerging understandings of the relationship between emotions and feedback and may offer potential mediators to reconcile feedback that reveals discrepancies between an individual's actual and idealized identities. These results suggest that reflection informed by tensions between actual and aspirational aspects of professional identity may hold potential for implicit bias recognition and management curricula.

AB  - This article adds to our understanding of the gendered impact of informal rules and norms for party leaders. Specifically, it examines the gendered nature of party leader tenures and exits. Using original data collected on party leader experiences in Canada, we test for the existence of gender differences in leader tenures and exits, and examine two potential explanations for any differences. We find that leader tenures and exits are indeed gendered but only within parties with the potential to form government, ones where the political stakes are highest. Within these major parties, women's tenures as party leaders are significantly shorter than men's and they are significantly more likely to be forced to resign from the position. We find clear evidence of the existence of the glass cliff phenomenon in major parties but unclear evidence of its role in women's shorter tenures. Instead, women's shorter tenures are explained by the harsher set of standards being applied to women party leaders.

AB  - David Livingstone's Second Expedition to Africa (1858 to 1863) began with lavish promises and expectations and ended ignominiously, with official Britons castigating the once greatly esteemed explorer of Africa. To what extent did Charles Livingstone, an ordained Congregational minister and David's American-trained younger brother, help to diminish the Expedition's successes? Were David Livingstone's promising exploring and scientific efforts compromised by his seemingly troubled, racist, brother? American-trained and an ordained minister, with a supposed ascendancy' over his elder brother, how did Charles' prejudices and actions undermine his brother's leadership and the accomplishments of the Zambezi project?

AB  - This article explores how issues of race and prejudice permeate knowledge production. By way of theory-driven processing, this article examines how traditional positivist practices, entrenched more than half a century ago, continue to dominate and have set the foundations by which knowledge is acquired, disseminated, understood and naturalized in two aspects: academia (tenure) and the publication process. This article further discusses how social justice and activism figure into productivity and concludes with some practical steps and suggestions to advance a more inclusive critical pedagogy in research, teaching and service.

AB  - In U.S. society, Native Americans face invisibility, stereotypes, discrimination, and structural barriers. In this article, we employ a symbolic interactionist approach, embedded in critical analysis, to explore how this social context impacts the conveyance and interpretation of Native American identity among people who are not Native American. Participants, 213 White American and 104 Native American people, replied to open-ended questions about Native American identity conveyance and interpretation. We employed an inductive thematic approach to analyze their written replies. The majority of Native American participants discussed their identity in the context of limited public knowledge of, and/or oppression faced by, Native Americans. For most Native American participants, this context generated strain and struggle associated with conveyance and interpretation of their identities. Despite this, some Native American participants engaged in identity work to educate others and reduce oppression. Without prompting, some White participants expressed positive attitudes toward Native Americans and their identity revelation. These positive attitudes evidence both hope for social change and problematic fetishization based on romantic stereotypes of Native Americans. We argue that society-wide change is necessary to reduce strain in, and enhance the effectiveness of, identity work by Native American people.

AB  - Study objective: We determine whether emergency provider attitudes and demographics are associated with adherence to national guidelines for the management of acute sickle cell disease pain.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of emergency providers at the 2011 annual American College of Emergency Physicians Scientific Assembly, using a validated instrument to assess provider attitudes and self-reported analgesic practices toward patients with sickle cell disease. Multivariable, relative risk regressions were used to identify factors associated with adherence to guidelines.
   Results: There were 722 eligible participants, with a 93% complete response rate. Most providers self-reported adherence to the cornerstones of sickle cell disease pain management, including parenteral opioids (90%) and redosing opioids within 30 minutes if analgesia is inadequate (85%). Self-reported adherence was lower for other recommendations, including use of patient-controlled analgesia, acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and hypotonic fluids for euvolemic patients. Emergency providers in the highest quartile of negative attitudes were 20% less likely to redose opioids within 30 minutes for inadequate analgesia (risk ratio 0.8; 95% confidence interval [Cl] 0.7 to 0.9). High-volume providers (those who treat more than 1 sickle cell disease patient per week), were less likely to redose opioids within 30 minutes for inadequate analgesia (risk ratio 0.9; 95% Cl 0.8 to 0.9). Pediatric providers were 6.6 times more likely to use patient-controlled analgesia for analgesia (95% Cl 2.6 to 16.6).
   Conclusion: The majority of emergency providers report that they adhere to national guidelines about use of opioids for sickle cell disease related acute pain episodes. Other recommendations have less penetration. Negative attitudes toward individuals with sickle cell disease are associated with lower adherence to guidelines.

AB  - Few studies have investigated the reasons why pregnant and puerperal women fail to seek or accept treatment for perinatal depression in low- and middle-income countries, where there is a high prevalence of this disorder. To help fill this gap, this study investigated the factors influencing the decision not to seek or to refuse treatment for perinatal depression in a low-income community in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Qualitative research was conducted in two primary health care units in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 2017-2018. Five focus groups were held with 26 women. Convenience sampling was used, and the sample size was determined by data saturation. A content analysis methodology was used to identify theme categories to objectively describe the group's manifest contents. Ten categories were obtained: stigma and misconception, self-image as a mother, socioeconomic stigma, lack of knowledge, lack of a health service approach to mental health, difficulty recognising depression symptoms, fear of children being removed, negative reaction to patient referral, denial of the problem and previous experience with the care unit. Perinatal depression is permeated with stigma and prejudice, and there is a belief that women with depression are unable to be good mothers. It is important to conduct programmes disseminating information about perinatal depression and implementing an approach that includes routine consultations so that women can access perinatal mental health services.

AB  - Relationship health impacts many facets of both physical and mental well-being, including depression, heart health, and even children's health. For a variety of reasons, distressed couples often delay entering therapy despite its value in supporting wellness and preventing distress. One early intervention program, the marriage checkup (MC), aims to keep healthy couples healthy with a brief supportive checkup. The MC is based on motivational interviewing principles, and research on MC shows the program has a positive impact on relationship satisfaction, prevents decline, and improves health on other variables such as intimacy. However, past research on MCs has only focused on heterosexual couples. As such, this study explores the research question, "What is the impact of a relationship wellness checkup on lesbian couples' relationship satisfaction?" Using a single-subject design, specifically concurrent multiple-baseline, multiple-probe design, this study extends MC research to an underrepresented population. After conducting checkups over 10 weeks with three lesbian couples, findings show the intervention had a medium effect on satisfaction (nonoverlap of all pairs = .66). These results indicate a relationship checkup can increase satisfaction for lesbian couples. The findings also suggest checkups with lesbian couples can have a comparable impact to their use with heterosexual couples. This study concludes by advocating that the checkup may help lesbian couples stay healthy, providing support for this marginalized group of couples in a time of prejudice.

AB  - This study follows on from previous work (Pedersen et al., 2008) that examined the situation of the stateless asylum seeker, Wasim. In the present study, a blog discussion stemming from an editorial about Wasim (Adams, 2008) was analysed. Participants were identified as 'Do-Gooders' and 'Do-Badders'; categories that indicate their orientation to asylum seeker debates (labels originated from the blog itself). We identified several features of the blog discussion. While similar themes and discursive devices were used by the two groups, they were used very differently. The Do-Gooders were more likely to offer accurate information about asylum seekers or Wasim and to show humanitarian concerns for Wasim and others like him. The Do-Badders were more likely to display emotion, show the 'Phillip Adams Effect' (addressing the author of the editorial, Phillip Adams, in their submissions) and name-call. However, there was no significant difference with respect to whether participants addressed Wasim's situation specifically rather than focusing on the general issue of asylum seekers. The blog demonstrates, in microcosm, the divided orientation of Australians regarding asylum seekers.

AB  - Background Polypharmacy (>= 5 medications) is common in older patients and is associated with adverse outcomes. Patients' beliefs about medication can influence their expectations for medication, adherence, and willingness to deprescribe. Few studies have examined beliefs about prescribed medication among older patients with polypharmacy in primary care.
   Aim To explore medication-related beliefs in older patients with polypharmacy and factors that might influence beliefs.
   Design and setting A mixed methods study utilising data from a randomised controlled trial aiming to decrease potentially inappropriate prescribing in older patients (>= 70 years) in Ireland.
   Method Beliefs were assessed quantitatively and qualitatively. Participants completed the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire by indicating their degree of agreement with individual statements about medicines on a 5-point Likert scale. Semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of participants. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and a thematic analysis conducted. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed separately and triangulated during the interpretation stage.
   Results In total, 196 patients were included (mean age 76.7 years, SD 4.9, 54% male), with a mean of 9.5 (SD 4.1) medications per patient. The majority (96.3%) believed strongly in the necessity of their medication, while 33.9% reported strong concerns. Qualitative data confirmed these coexisting positive and negative attitudes to medications and suggested the importance of patients' trust in GPs in establishing positive beliefs and potential willingness to deprescribe.
   Conclusion Participants reported strong beliefs in medications with coexisting positive and negative attitudes. The doctor-patient relationship may have influenced beliefs and attitudes towards medicines, highlighting the importance of strong doctor-patient relationships, which need to be considered in the context of deprescribing.

AB  - Objective Attitude of healthcare providers toward older people is very important in the aging world. Neurologists contact older adults very frequently. We aimed to investigate the attitudes of neurologists toward older adults.
   Measurements We recorded participants age; sex; duration of clinical practice in neurology; existence of older adult relatives; and history of geriatrics education, nursing home visits, older adult patient density in their clinical practice, and participation in voluntary public activities. UCLA Geriatrics Attitude Scale was used to evaluate participants' attitudes.
   Results A total of 100 neurologists participated in this study. Seventy-seven percent had positive, 3 % had neutral, and 20 % had negative attitudes. Twenty-seven percent of the participants had history of geriatrics education, and these participants tended to have a higher rate of positive attitudes. Neurologists with positive attitudes tended to be older than those with negative attitudes. Participants with history of living with older adult relatives had lower rates of positive attitudes. The most common diagnoses of the patients the participants encountered were stroke and dementia. Independent factors associated with positive attitudes were history of geriatrics education and older age. History of living with older relatives tended to have a negative effect. Most of the negative items of the attitude scale were associated with the natural course and behavior of the common diseases in neurology practice.
   Conclusions Generalization of geriatrics education may translate into a better understanding and improved care for older patients. Development of instruments and implementation of qualitative studies to assess attitudes of neurologists toward older adults are needed.

AB  - In 2019, the HBO limited television series Watchmen aired to critical acclaim. A contemporary extension of the world established by the 1986-87 Watchmen comic, viewers and commentators alike have viewed the show as a critical commentary on racial politics in the United States. Using Nexis Uni's News Database, we conducted an inductive qualitative content analysis of 31 news articles written by mainstream television critics and/or writers about the show. Across reviews, three primary themes emerged-White supremacy, revisionist history (specifically pertaining to the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921), and the power of masks. The role of critics/writers in engaging audiences with themes about race is discussed.

AB  - Stereotype threat affects performance in many different groups across many different domains. Despite a large body of experimental research on situational stereotype threat, little attention has been paid to the consequences of repeated experience of stereotype threat. Using structural equation modeling on data from a representative sample of girls from secondary schools, the current research examined the relations of chronic stereotype threat with mathematical achievement, and effectiveness of working memory functions. Moving beyond past theory, this study examined a new mechanism by which chronic stereotype threat decreases school achievement - namely intellectual helplessness. We assumed that repeated experience of stereotype threat works as intellectual helplessness training. After the phase of cognitive mobilization, cognitive exhaustion appears, because the individual has no gain from intense cognitive effort. Corroborating previous research on acute stereotype threat, we demonstrated that chronic stereotype threat is negatively associated with mathematical achievement. Additionally, it was also associated with lower effectiveness of working memory functions, which seems to show depletion of working memory as an effect of chronic stereotype threat. The results also demonstrated that both mediational paths from chronic stereotype threat to mathematical achievement: through working memory depletion and through intellectual helplessness were significant but only for girls that were highly identified with their gender group. In sum, we extended a well-established model of acute stereotype threat to its chronic version and suggested a new mechanism of chronic stereotype threat, which involves intellectual helplessness. Implications for stereotype threat theory and educational practice are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: Beginning in the late 1970s, a very sharp decline in cigarette smoking prevalence was observed among African American (AA) high school seniors compared with a more modest decline among whites. This historic decline resulted in a lower prevalence of cigarette smoking among AA youth that has persisted for several decades.
   Methods: We synthesized information contained in the research literature and tobacco industry documents to provide an account of past influences on cigarette smoking behavior among AA youth to help understand the reasons for these historically lower rates of cigarette smoking.
   Results: While a number of protective factors including cigarette price increases, religiosity, parental opposition, sports participation, body image, and negative attitudes towards cigarette smoking may have all played a role in maintaining lower rates of cigarette smoking among AA youth as compared to white youth, the efforts of the tobacco industry seem to have prevented the effectiveness of these factors from carrying over into adulthood.
   Conclusion: Continuing public health efforts that prevent cigarette smoking initiation and maintain lower cigarette smoking rates among AA youth throughout adulthood have the potential to help reduce the negative health consequences of smoking in this population. Implications: While AA youth continue to have a lower prevalence of cigarette smoking than white youth, they are still at risk of increasing their smoking behavior due to aggressive targeted marketing by the tobacco industry. Because AAs suffer disproportionately from tobacco-related disease, and have higher incidence and mortality rates from lung cancer, efforts to prevent smoking initiation and maintain lower cigarette smoking rates among AA youth have the potential to significantly lower lung cancer death rates among AA adults.

AB  - The study replicates the first European field experiment on gay men's labor market prospects in Greece. Utilizing the same protocol as the original study in 2006-2007, two follow-up field experiments took place in 2013-2014 and 2018-2019. The study estimated that gay men experienced occupational access constraints and wage sorting in vacancies offering lower remuneration. It was found that in 2013-2014 and 2018-2019, gay men experienced increasingly biased treatment compared to 2006-2007. Moreover, the results suggested that monthly unemployment bore an association with occupational access constraints and wage sorting in vacancies offering lower remuneration for gay men. In each of the three experiments, this study captured recruiters' attitudes toward gay men. A one standard deviation increase in taste-discrimination attitudes against gay men decreased their access to occupations by 9.6%. Furthermore, a one standard deviation increase in statistical-discrimination attitudes against gay men decreased their access to occupations by 8.1%. According to the findings, in 2013-2014 and 2018-2019, firms excluding gay applicants expressed a higher level of taste- and statistical-discrimination attitudes compared to 2006-2007. A gay rights backlash due to the LGBTIQ+ group's attempt to advance its agenda, rising far-right rhetoric, and prejudice associated with economic downturns experienced in Greece might correspond with increasing biases against gay men. The current study contributes to the economics of sexual orientation when an economy deteriorates.

AB  - Background: The benefits of breastfeeding for babies, mothers and society have been demonstrated in a large scientific literature. Irish rates of breastfeeding are amongst the lowest in Europe (in 2010, Ireland had the lowest breastfeeding initiation rate of 14 European countries). One of the most distinctive features of breastfeeding behaviour in Ireland is the large difference in breastfeeding rates between immigrants to Ireland and the Irish-born. Data from the 2010 Irish National Perinatal Reporting System show that just 46.1% of Irish-born mothers were breastfeeding at hospital discharge, in comparison with 84.2% of immigrant mothers. Descriptive patterns suggest that breastfeeding behaviour in Ireland may exhibit a 'healthy immigrant' effect, whereby the health status and behaviours of immigrants are better than the native-born on arrival, but converge to native levels as length of time since migration increases. Methods: Using nationally representative data from two cohorts of children in Ireland, the purpose of this article is to examine the evidence for a ` healthy immigrant' effect with respect to breastfeeding behaviour. Results: The results indicate that immigrants are significantly more likely to breastfeed than Irish-born mothers, but that immigrant breastfeeding rates converge towards Irish-born rates of breastfeeding as length of time since migration increases. Conclusion: The decline in breastfeeding behaviour among immigrants to Ireland with length of time since migration highlights the need for appropriate interventions aimed at countering the particular negative attitudes to breastfeeding that are observed in Irish society.

AB  - This study explored stereotype constructions people may impute on to others in the context of a contagious disease epidemic. Participants were 30 undergraduate students from a large university in Johannesburg, South Africa. They completed the open-ended Build-A-Character Questionnaire, which described the "typical" person in South Africa who they currently believed to be at particular risk of HIV infection. The data were thematically analysed and interpreted. Seven themes resulted, based on the stereotyping of marginalised groups in South Africa considered as being at higher risk for HIV due to historical disadvantage: blacks, women, and the poor. A social cognitive framework explains these stereotypes as they apply to perceived out-groups, and they carry risk to undermine public health interventions regarding the HIV pandemic in South Africa across population segments.

AB  - Objective. Effective patient -clinician communication at diagnosis is important, yet decreased provider time for face-to-face interactions makes traditional paradigms in cancer care difficult. We evaluated the effects of an educational video on patients' distress, cancer knowledge, coping skills and attitudes regarding learning about cancer at the time of ovarian cancer diagnosis.
   Methods. An educational video was developed in which oncology professionals, women with ovarian cancer, and their relatives discussed cancer information and experiences. Women admitted for initial diagnostic surgical staging for ovarian cancer were randomized to the educational or placebo video. Before and after the video, patients completed measures of (1) ovarian cancer information, (2) emotional distress, (3) learning attitudes, and (4) coping self-efficacy. Outcomes were analyzed for differences in mean change between intervention and placebo groups using t-tests.
   Results. Fifty-nine subjects were randomized (30 intervention/29 placebo). The majority were advanced staged, white, insured, high school educated, employed, and rated their disease seriousness as high. Anxiety, general distress and cancer-specific distress were high. Pre-post video: distress and self-efficacy between groups were unchanged, intervention subjects answered more knowledge items correctly (p = 0.0004) and developed more negative learning attitudes (p = 0.037). Following the educational video, patients who developed more negative attitudes also had increased intrusive thinking (p = 0.046), a sign of increased distress.
   Conclusions. Video presentation of cancer-related information increases learning under conditions of high distress and disease threat however, it is not without risk for some. Differing information needs may affect women's emotional response under these conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Ageism is an important phenomenon that affects individuals and how society relates to older adults. It is important to evaluate ageism in the medical staff because of its potential effect on treatment for older adults. A cross-sectional study to assess the negative attitudes of doctors and nurses toward older adults was conducted using the Fraboni Scale of Ageism (FSA), a method for evaluating attitudes toward ageism in medical teams. Additional variables associated with ageism such as aging anxiety, and death and dying anxiety were also assessed. The study population included doctors and nurses working in a large university hospital or in community clinics in southern Israel. In all, 431 questionnaires were collected, 203 from the hospital (47.5%) and 224 from the community (52.5%). Of these, 216 (50.1%) were from doctors and 215 (49.9%) from nurses. The mean ageism score in the FSA was 2.8. In a linear regression model, doctors were less ageist than nurses; ageism was directly associated with aging anxiety, and dying anxiety, and was inversely associated with death anxiety. Among doctors, prominent ageist attitudes were directly associated with aging and dying anxiety, inversely associated with graduation from medical school in Israel, and death anxiety. Among nurses, prominent ageism attitudes were directly associated with dying anxiety and inversely associated with work in the hospital. Ageist attitudes were found among doctors and nurses in both the hospital and community clinics. The results emphasize the need to raise awareness of ageism in medical teams and to include this subject in professional training programs designed to reduce its prevalence.

AB  - This study aims to investigate English language learning motivation and English language learning anxiety in Saudi military cadets. Some 174 Saudi military cadets completed a questionnaire specifically developed to be used in the context of Saudi Arabia. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to analyse a proposed model using Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) version 21. The study found that the students' language learning effort was determined by their Ideal L2 Self and their positive attitudes towards their immediate learning environment. However, the students' imposed social ideal-self as well as their negative attitudes towards their immediate learning environment contributed to their Ought-to L2 Self, which in turn increased their English learning anxiety. Parental encouragement and religious interest impacted on the Saudi L2 learners' Ideal L2 Self and their language learning attitudes, which might have helped them to see themselves as future L2 users and to adopt positive attitudes to their immediate learning environment. This in turn motivated them to invest more effort and be more persistent in learning English.

AB  - Negative attitudes of non-Singaporeans towards Singapore Colloquial English (SCE) are often used to support the "Speak Good English Movement" in Singapore. This article examines spontaneous metalinguistic discourse about SCE in an online Facebook group where Taiwanese migrants in Singapore gather for mutual support. Based on the idea that metalinguistic discourse is mediated through the social relation between interlocutors, this study reveals how the language ideologies surfacing in the investigated online space are formed through stance-taking processes between people sharing a nationality. We argue that this spatial context elicits and escalates negative ideologies of SCE, which are situated in popular hierarchies of varieties of English, and also hierarchies of Mandarin.

AB  - Aims and objectivesTo examine whether and how stigma influences attitudes towards seeking treatment for urinary incontinence, and whether its effect varies by symptom severity.
   BackgroundUrinary incontinence is prevalent among women, but few seek treatment. Negative attitudes towards urinary incontinence treatment inhibit from seeking care. Urinary incontinence is a stigmatised attribute. However, the relationship between stigma and attitudes towards seeking treatment for urinary incontinence has not been well understood.
   DesignThis was a cross-sectional community-based study.
   MethodsWe enrolled a sample of 305 women aged 40-65years with stress urinary incontinence from three communities in a Chinese city between May-October in 2011. Data were collected on socio-demographic characteristics, urinary incontinence symptoms, stigma and attitudes towards seeking treatment for urinary incontinence using a self-reported questionnaire. Effects of stigma were analysed using path analysis.
   ResultsAttitudes towards seeking treatment for urinary incontinence were generally negative. For the total sample, all the stigma domains of social rejection, social isolation and internalised shame had direct negative effects on treatment-seeking attitudes. The public stigma domain of social rejection also indirectly affected treatment-seeking attitudes through increasing social isolation, as well as through increasing social isolation and then internalised shame. The final model accounted for 28% of the variance of treatment-seeking attitudes. Symptom severity influenced the strength of paths: the effect of internalised shame was higher in women with more severe urinary incontinence.
   ConclusionsStigma enhances the formation of negative attitudes towards seeking treatment for urinary incontinence; public stigma affects treatment-seeking attitudes through internalisation of social messages.
   Relevance to clinical practiceStigma reduction may help incontinent women to form positive treatment-seeking attitudes and engage them in treatment. Interventions should specifically target the self-stigma domains of social isolation and internalised shame in women with urinary incontinence to most efficiently increase their use of health care.

AB  - Objective The emotional impact of the tobacco-warning images proposed by the European Commission to reduce tobacco consumption is evaluated in the context of the International Affective Picture System, a well-established procedure for investigating appetitive (approach) and defensive (avoidance) motivational tendencies evoked by images.
   Methods In a cross-sectional study, 597 healthy male and female volunteers (from the University of Granada, the University of Balearic Islands and four different schools of Valencia and Balearic Islands) distributed in six age groups (13-14, 15-16, 17-18, 19-20, 21-22 and over 23 years old) and four smoking status groups (non-smokers, one-time smokers, occasional smokers and heavy smokers) rated their emotional responses to 35 European tobacco-warning images together with 42 pleasant and 42 unpleasant International Affective Picture System pictures using the valence and arousal scales of the Self-Assessment Manikin.
   Findings The results of the study indicate that the majority of the tobacco-warning images (83%) were distributed within the unpleasant space and ranged from moderately unpleasant to very unpleasant. However, a small but significant number of images (17%) were also distributed within the pleasant space, ranging from moderately pleasant to very pleasant. Only four unpleasant pictures were rated as highly arousing (11.4%). Women, the older age groups (over 17 years old), and occasional smokers evaluated these images as significantly more arousing than the other groups.
   Conclusion Findings suggest that the capability of the European tobacco-warning images to prompt negative attitudes to reduce tobacco consumption might not extend to the general population but would be limited to specific target groups.

AB  - Background: The World Health Organization (WHO)/UNICEF Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative step number five of the "Ten steps to successful breastfeeding" states "Show mothers how to breastfeed and how to maintain lactation even if they should be separated from their infants." Urban mothers in Nairobi have low rates of exclusive breastfeeding after returning to work but there are no published data on rural Kenya mothers' infant feeding practices when working or schooling away from home.
   Methods: We explored knowledge of, and attitudes to, the practice of giving expressed breastmilk in a mixed methods observational study of breastfeeding in rural Kenyan mothers. Fifty mothers with newborns, identified by nurses and community health workers, were asked questions about their experiences of breastfeeding and who they had sought or received advice from on breastfeeding. Focus group discussions, one with community health workers, and four each with mothers and their named advisers were held. Recordings were analyzed using a thematic framework approach.
   Results: The main themes were: the baby's right to feed from the breast, lack of knowledge about expressing and giving breastmilk, negative attitudes towards expressed breastmilk, and traditional customs for disposing of expressed breast milk. Most participants did not have any experience of giving expressed breastmilk to infants. They described practices of expressing and discarding milk when the mother or baby was ill, to relieve discomfort from engorgement or after the baby had died.
   Conclusions: Feeding expressed breastmilk to infants is a new concept in this context. Promotion of, and training in this practice would help mothers to maintain their milk supply when away from their babies and benefit the infants of working and schoolgirl mothers.

AB  - Background: Schizophrenia is one of the most stigmatized psychiatric disorders, and disclosing it is often a source of stress to individuals with the disorder. The Coming Out Proud (COP) group intervention is designed to reduce the stigma's negative impact and help participants decide if they want to disclose their disorder. Aims: To assess the effect of the COP intervention in individuals with the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Methods: A pilot study of 3 2-hour group lessons (6-12 participants) per week. Individuals were selected from three specialized outpatient services in Sao Paulo, Brazil; 46 people were willing to participate, 11 dropped out during the intervention and 4 were excluded due to low intelligence quotient (IQ), resulting in a final sample of 31 participants. Outcomes were assessed before (T0/baseline) and after (T1/directly) after the COP intervention, and at 3-week follow-up (T2/3 weeks after T1). We applied eight scales, of which four scales are analyzed in this article (Coming Out with Mental Illness Scale (COMIS), Cognitive Appraisal of Stigma as a Stressor (CogApp), Self-Stigma of Mental Illness Scale-Short Form (SSMIS) and Perceived Devaluation-Discrimination Questionnaire (PDDQ)). Results: People who completed the COP intervention showed a significant increase in the decision to disclose their diagnosis (22.5% in T0 vs 67.7% in T2). As to the perception of stigma as a stressor, mean values significantly increased after the intervention (T0 = 3.83, standard deviation (SD) = .92 vs T2 = 4.44, SD = 1.05; p = .006). Two results had marginal significance: self-stigma was reduced (T0 = 3.10, SD = 1.70 vs T2 = 2.73, SD = 1.87; p = .063), while perceived discrimination increased (T0 = 2.68, SD = .55 vs T2 = 2.93, SD = .75; p = .063). Conclusion: This study suggests that the COP group intervention facilitated participants' disclosure decisions, and the increasing awareness of stigma as a stressor in life may have facilitated their decision to eventually disclose their disorder. The results raise questions that require further analysis, taking sociocultural factors into account, as stigma is experienced differently across cultures.

AB  - ObjectivesMen who have sex with men (MSM) are at risk of genital warts and anal cancer due to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. This study explores MSMs' perceptions of HPV and HPV vaccination prior to the introduction of this programme.
   DesignFocus groups and one-to-one interviews with self-identified MSM were conducted between November 2014 and March 2015 in Brighton, UK.
   MethodsParticipants were recruited from community-based lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender (LGBT) venues and organizations. Discussions were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using framework analysis.
   ResultsThirty-three men took part (median age 25years, IQR: 21-27), most of whom (n=25) did not know about HPV, anal cancer (31), or HPV vaccination (26). While genital warts and anal cancer were perceived as severe, men did not perceive themselves at risk of HPV. All MSM would accept the HPV vaccine if offered by a health care professional. The challenges of accessing sexual health services or openly discussing same-sex experiences with health care professionals were perceived as barriers to accessing HPV vaccination. Two participants were concerned that selective HPV vaccination could increase stigma and prejudice against MSM, comparable to the AIDS epidemic. Ten MSM were unsure about the effectiveness of HPV vaccination for sexually active men and were in favour of vaccinating all adolescent boys at school.
   ConclusionsMost MSM have poor knowledge about HPV and associated anal cancer. Despite the lack of concern about HPV, most MSM expressed willingness to receive HPV vaccination. There is a need for health education about the risks of HPV and HPV-related diseases so that MSM can appraise the benefits of being vaccinated. Concerns about HPV vaccine effectiveness in sexually active men and possible stigmatization need to be addressed to optimize HPV vaccine acceptability.

AB  - Background Genomic medicine is rapidly evolving, particularly in the domain of reproduction. Population carrier screening for a range of disorders is becoming possible using whole genome/exome sequencing. However, very little is known about the views of genetically disabled adults toward selective reproduction. Methods Forty-three in-depth qualitative interviews were carried out with adults living with different types of genetic condition, recruited through support groups and clinics. Interviews covered participants' experiences of their condition and their views toward genetic intervention in reproduction. Thematic analysis of the data using NVivo 11 was undertaken, and participants were assigned categories as either supporting, not-supporting, or having ambivalent views toward selective reproduction. Results The majority of participants (65%) expressed either disapproval of, or held ambivalent views toward, selective reproduction. Key reasons for non-support included regarding genetic impairment as part of personal identity and the prioritization of social and environmental barrier removal. Key reasons for support of selective reproduction included negative and externalizing attitudes toward genetic impairment and a belief in the importance of informed reproductive decision-making. Conclusion The degree to which participants identified with their impairment, more so than how they valued it, was significant in determining attitudes toward selective reproduction. Those who supported genetic screening viewed their impairment as separate to themselves, while participants who considered their impairment as integral to their identity were most likely to report ambivalent or negative attitudes. Policymakers and stakeholders considering the role of genetic carrier screening panels might usefully engage with adults affected by heritable disease as well as disability identity politics when considering the acceptability and social impact of genetic screening programs.

AB  - Objectives Older adults (OA; 65+) can become cognitively fused with negative attitudes and stereotypes. Given the verbal nature of ageist stereotypes, mindfulness and acceptance-based practices (MABPs) may help the impact of negative aging attitudes by increasing non-judgmental awareness, cognitive defusion, and acceptance. As part of a larger study, this project examined whether an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) consistent MABP would reduce negative aging attitudes using an experimental design. We hypothesized that assignment to the MABP condition would be associated with lower negative aging attitudes for both OAs and university undergraduates (18-25). Method Both OAs (N = 60) and undergraduate student (N = 60) participants were assigned to the experimental or comparison condition (MABP vs. sit-and-think task) and were then presented negative ageist stereotypes assessed with two ageism measures. Results Following the MABP, undergraduates who received a MABP had significantly lower ageism scores than did undergraduates who did not, while OAs endorsed higher scores on ageism after receiving the MABP (vs comparison group; ps < .05). There was no significant condition by age sample interaction effect. Conclusion Results suggest that undergraduates and OAs may have different strategies for recontextualizing ageist attitudes, with OAs possibly employing different strategies when confronted with ageism in an experimental context. Overall, aging education, OA experimental research, and evidence-based interventions for negative beliefs about aging are needed. Limitations and future directions are discussed.

AB  - Ethnopharmacological relevance: Evidence of phytochemical roles in infant development and maternal recovery offers insights into beneficial functions of traditional plant use during lactation and the postpartum period. Ethnopharmacological research has relevance to global priorities on maternal and child health, to understanding origins and determinants of human self-medication, and for reconciling traditional postpartum practices and mainstream healthcare. Aim of the study: Present emerging evidence, within evolutionary and socio-cultural contexts, on the role of maternal consumption on transfer of phytochemicals into breast milk with impacts on maternal and child health, and on infant development. Establish current state of knowledge and an ethnopharmacological research agenda that is attentive to cross-cultural and regional differences in postpartum plant use. Materials and methods: An extensive literature review using Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science focused on traditional and contemporary use and socio-cultural context, as well as physiological, pharmacological, toxicological, and behavioral activities of plants used medicinally by women during postpartum recovery and lactation. Results: The most widely reported postpartum plants show antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, immunological, and neurophysiological activities, with low toxicity. Phytochemicals transfer from maternal consumption into breast milk in physiological concentrations, while animal studies demonstrate immunomodulation and other actions of medicinal plants during lactation. Reporting on the use and diverse traditional knowledge of women about plants during the postpartum period is obscured by the marginal place of obstetric issues and by gender biases in ethnobotanical research. In many contemporary contexts use is prejudiced by precautionary risk warnings in health literature and practice that confound lactation with pregnancy. Conclusions: Although systematic investigation of postpartum plant use is lacking, known pharmacological activities support potential benefits on infant development and maternal health with immediate and long-term consequences in relation to allergic, inflammatory, autoimmune, and other diseases. An ethnopharmacological agenda focused on the perinatal period requires directed methodologies and a regional approach in relation to culturally-specific knowledge and practices, traditional plant use, and local health needs. Testing the hypothesis that phytochemicals transferred from medicinal plants into breast milk impact the human immune system and other aspects of infant development requires extended analysis of phytochemicals in human milk and infant lumen and plasma, as well as effects on gastrointestinal and milk microbiome.

AB  - Primary teachers, despite their critical role in fostering student interest in science, lack confidence and have negative attitudes towards teaching science, with this trend starting during initial teacher education. Though research on attitudes towards teaching science is well established, less is known about attitudes towards learning science. In order to advance our understanding in this area, this study mapped the entry and evolution of attitudinal profiles towards learning science of 108 primary education pre-service teachers undertaking a first-year science unit. Participants completed an online survey tapping on self-determination, grade motivation, self-efficacy, difficulty, interest, anxiety and enjoyment in science before the commencement of the unit (T1) and at the end of it (T2). Clustering methods were used to group participants into homogenous attitudinal profiles at both points in time. Subsequently, daughter profile analysis was used to examine qualitative changes in final profiles respective to entry. Four distinct attitudinal profiles were identified with 47% of the participants exhibiting the least favourable profiles at the start of the science unit. Migration (T1 to T2) was more prevalent from the least to the most favourable profiles, however, it did occur in the opposite direction. Findings revealed that, though pre-service teachers increased their confidence in their ability to learn science, their self-determination decreased in all but one of the eight resulting daughter profiles.

AB  - A shared identity has been shown to reduce prejudice between conflicting social groups. One such common national category is the 'Northern Irish' identity which can be inclusive of both Catholics and Protestants. This study analyses the plenary sessions of the Northern Ireland Assembly to show how the national category 'Northern Irish' is framed by politicians. Content analysis shows that it is used more often by centrist parties who tend to frame it positively and as part of their political viewpoint. There is also evidence of the instrumental use of this identity by unionists in line with the ingroup projection model.

AB  - Fishermen who inject drugs represent an understudied group at high risk for HIV in Malaysia. This study describes fishing, drug use, and attitudes toward medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use disorders. Thirty-four male ethnic Malay fishermen completed semistructured interviews analyzed by content analysis. Analysis revealed four themes surrounding opioids, which they called ubat ("medicine"): (a) the fishing lifestyle facilitating substance use, (b) previous unsuccessful attempts to quit, (c) categorizing substances as haram or halal, and (d) attitudes toward MAT. Fishermen's environment permits substance use, including injecting drugs on boats. Fishermen expressed more positive attitudes toward methadone and negative attitudes toward buprenorphine.

AB  - Ageist attitudes have been identified across different industries. The nursing profession has a high proportion of older workers. As this facilitates regular contact with, as well as exposure to, older nurses, it may be expected to show less ageism. This study investigated 163 Western Australian nursing recruiters' attitudes toward older nurses. Results showed clear evidence of both negative and positive stereotyping of older nurses. Nursing recruiters indicated that they would be more than likely to hire older nurses and that age was less relevant in making hiring decisions. These findings suggest that enhancing the employability of older workers does not necessarily change ageist attitudes. This is relevant to policy formulation, attitude change interventions, and the well-being of older workers.

AB  - This research explores the effects of visual representations of immigrants and refugees in U.S. news outlets. Study 1 examined news photographs about immigrants and refugees that were shared on Twitter by regional news outlets in all 50 states. Most photos contained either a human interest frame, featuring immigrants and refugees as everyday people, or a political frame, showcasing politicians. Study 2's experiment determined the effects of these visuals on participants' emotions and, in turn, their attitudes toward immigrants and refugees. The political frame increased negative emotions, leading to negative attitudes. The human interest frame increased positive emotions, enhancing positive attitudes.

AB  - Objective: This study investigated the impact of a new mortality salience (MS) manipulation on the intentions of young adults to drive a motor vehicle while texting or using a cell phone.
   Methods: Four hundred and eight participants were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions. Participants in the MS condition were shown a color photograph of a gravesite and tombstone on which the participant's name was inscribed. Participants in the quasi-MS condition viewed a color photograph of a grave site and tombstone on which the participant's family name was inscribed. Participants in the two remaining non-MS conditions viewed color photographs depicting scenes unrelated to death. A 10-item scale assessed the extent to which a participant's self-image was linked to their cell phone use. The 20-item Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) served as the distractor task, enabling images of death to fade from conscious awareness prior to completing the dependent measures.
   Results: Both mortality salience manipulations increased negative attitudes toward driving while using a cell phone (DWCP) and decreased DWCP behavioral intentions. A subsequent test of an interaction between experimental condition and self-image scores on DWCP attitudes and intentions was non-significant.
   Conclusion: Public health campaigns that personalize the risk of DWCP and link images of death to one's own health threatening behavior may increase negative attitudes towards DWCP and reduce DWCP intentions even after these images fade from conscious awareness. This finding is based on a new method of increasing mortality salience, which has implications for future morality salience research, terror management theory, and the development of risky driving interventions.

AB  - Background: Waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS) is increasing in popularity despite evidence of harm and potential for dependence. Intervention development has been hampered by a lack of longitudinal, nationally representative data on usage patterns and factors independently associated with WTS initiation. Therefore, we aimed to characterize key transitions between WTS states in a nationally representative group of young adults, with particular attention to factors independently associated with initiation.
   Methods: Participants were randomly selected from a national probability-based panel representing 97% of the United States. A total of 1,785 adults ages 18 to 30 at baseline completed two Web-based surveys 18 months apart in 2013 and 2014. Assessments included knowledge of waterpipe tobacco smoke composition, positive and negative attitudes toward WTS, normative beliefs, intention to use waterpipe, and WTS behavior. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the association between predictive factors and subsequent WTS initiation.
   Results: In fully adjusted models, overall knowledge about toxicants associated with WTS was not associated with subsequent WTS initiation. Similarly, negative attitudes and normative beliefs were not associated with WTS uptake. However, baseline positive attitudes were strongly and significantly associated with WTS initiation [adjusted OR (AOR) = 1.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-2.3]. Similarly, baseline intention to use WTS was strongly associated with subsequent initiation (AOR = 7.0; 95% CI, 3.5-13.7).
   Conclusions: Prevention efforts may be most successful if they target individuals with clear intentions to use WTS and challenge positive attitudes surrounding WTS.
   Impact: Surveillance ofWTStrajectories will help inform health care and policy surrounding this emerging risk behavior among U.S. young adults. (C) 2017 AACR.

AB  - Nostalgia-evoking messages are used to promote consumer products, but their use for encouraging healthy behaviors is not well understood. This study examines the use of nostalgia as an emotional appeal to influence attitudes and reduce smoking behavior. The study hypothesized that exposure to a nostalgic public service announcement (PSA) will result in (a) more negative attitude toward smoking; and (b) increased intention to limit smoking, relative to a control. Participants exposed to the nostalgia-evoking PSA expressed more negative attitudes toward smoking and stronger intentions to limit smoking than did participants exposed to nonnostalgic messages. The findings suggest nostalgic appeals as a promising strategy for smoking prevention messages.

AB  - Fluid performances of gender online by gender-diverse individuals facing discrimination and fetishization raises questions about whether these acts are a source of empowerment or reinforce prevailing prejudice. We combine virtual ethnography and interviews with transwomen sex workers in Singapore (n=14) to explore the dynamic between sociostructural oppression and agentic resistance. First, heterosexual power relations manifest online via digital practices of access, surveillance, and intervention to discriminate against and objectify respondents' identities and bodies. Second, the online response can be categorized into specific digital practices of avoidance involving privacy and anonymity, accommodation via subtle practices of submission, and collaboration via community mobilization. Finally, gender performativity on sites for sex solicitation manifests in the presentation of both essentialist (submissive femininity) and provocative (hyper-sexual) embodiments, defying simplistic characterization into the structure-agency dynamic. We discuss the co-constructive nature of socially situated gender performances and the potential for challenging normative regimes of gender.
   Lay Summary
   Online spaces allow people to perform their gender more fluidly. We studied how gender-diverse people's online media use can lead to both personal empowerment and social oppression. Social forces oppress gender-diverse people through online harassment and abuse. We classify these progressively intrusive digital practices as access, surveillance, and intervention. However, gender-diverse people also respond to such oppression through digital strategies such as avoidance, accommodation, and collaboration. Transwomen sex workers in Singapore perform femininity online in submissive and hyper-sexual ways. Our material suggests that they do this to both affirm their transgender identities and also to attract customers. These nuances blur the line between individual choice and compliance with social demands. Indeed, the informants' quotes suggest that the digital strategies that seem to accommodate client desires may in fact empower these transwomen sex workers. Yet, it is uncertain if this individual empowerment leads to broader social change for gender-diverse communities.

AB  - Anti-black bias is an important focal point in conversations about the sources of racial inequality in schools. Much of the empirical research on this issue has focused on the racial biases of individual teachers, finding that racial inequality in student outcomes is generally worse when teachers have more racial bias. Less is known, however, about how racial inequality in schools relates to anti-black biases that play out at a larger scale within communities. This study begins to fill this gap by examining the relationship between county-level estimates of racial bias and black-white test score gaps in U.S. schools. Data from over 1 million respondents from across the United States who completed an online survey of explicit and implicit racial attitudes were combined with data from the Education Opportunity Project covering over 300 million test scores from U.S. schoolchildren in grades 3 through 8. Results indicated that counties with higher levels of racial bias had larger black-white test score disparities. The magnitude of these associations was on par with other widely accepted predictors of racial test score gaps, including racial gaps in family income and racial gaps in single parenthood. This study also found that the observed relation between collective rates of racial bias and racial test score gaps was largely accounted for when controlling for between-school segregation and racial gaps in discipline, gifted assignment, and special education placement. This pattern is consistent with a theoretical model in which collective rates of racial bias relate to educational opportunity through sorting mechanisms that operate both within and beyond schools.

AB  - Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, there has been considerable concern about whether Muslims living in Western countries are targets of prejudice. A considerable amount of survey-based evidence suggests that Muslims are victims of discrimination. This paper tested this hypothesis. Two lost-letter experiments were conducted to test whether the difference in returned letters would be attributable to whether the addressee was Muslim or Swedish. The results show that Muslims receive far fewer letters than do Swedes. However, this discrimination only appears when the lost letters contain money; in which case, the finder gains by not posting the letter.

AB  - There is ample evidence of the beneficial effects of intergroup contact in reducing negative attitudes towards immigrants. Although the valuable role of institutional support, one of the initial optimal conditions for contact, has been demonstrated, the impact of actual immigration integration policies, as a manifestation of institutional support, remains unknown. In the current study, we examine how country-level migrant integration policies, assessed by the MIPEX indicator, shape the relationship between everyday contact and threat perceptions associated to immigration. Multilevel regression analyses were conducted with European Social Survey Round 7 data from 20 European countries (N = 32,093 citizens). Everyday contact was related to less symbolic and realistic threat perceptions. Moreover, on the country level, tolerant policies (a high MIPEX score) were related to higher everyday contact and lower symbolic threat perceptions. Confirming that institutional support facilitates the effects of contact, a cross-level interaction revealed that the link between everyday contact and symbolic threat was stronger in high rather than low MIPEX countries. The pattern of results was partially replicated when contact quality and cross-group friendships were assessed, though integration policies did not moderate the effects of these intergroup contact measures. These findings extend the body of multilevel contact research and are crucial for application as they show that integration policies have the potential to guide national majority members' perceptions regarding immigrants.

AB  - Aims and objectives: To examine professional stigma and attitudes of parenthood towards postpartum women with severe mental illness and the association between postpartum nurses' attitudes and nursing interventions that promote motherhood.
   Background: Stigma and attitudes towards parenthood of women with severe mental illness may influence nurses' clinical practices.
   Design: Cross-sectional, mixed methods.
   Methods: The Stigma among Health Professionals towards People with Severe Mental Illness, Attitudes towards Parenthood among People with Severe Mental Illness and Nursing Interventions that Promote Becoming a Mother Questionnaires were used in the study, as well as qualitative analysis.
   Results: Sixty-one postpartum nurses participated in the study. Increased stigma was associated with an increase in negative attitudes towards parenthood among people with severe mental illness, in general, and towards their parenthood skills, in particular. Postpartum nurses reported a decrease in nursing interventions and a therapeutic nurse-client relationship that fosters mother's empowerment. Themes that emerged from the qualitative analysis were postpartum nurse's perceptions of inadequacy, difficulty of postpartum nurses taking responsibility for managing women with severe mental illness and a paternalistic approach to these women, rather than empowerment, regarding infant care.
   Conclusion: Nurses providing care to postpartum women with severe mental illness and their infants may provide fewer routine postpartum interventions due to professional stigma and negative attitudes concerning parenting skills. Nurses should provide individualised, tailored care that allows women with severe mental illness to become a mother to the best of her ability.
   Relevance to clinical practice: Not all women with severe mental illness are capable of caring for themselves and/or their baby. Nurses should provide individualised, tailored care that allows the women with severe mental illness to become a mother to the best of her ability.

AB  - This article explores Leonard and Virginia Woolf's early interactions with the Women's Co-operative Guild and supplies a contextualised analysis of Virginia Woolf's preface to Life as We Have Known It (1931). Written to introduce a volume of autobiographical sketches by Co-operative Guildswomen and published in a variant form in the Yale Review, this essay has generated conflicting debate in Woolf studies. In this article I argue that the essay fictionalises Virginia Woolf's relationship with the Guild, concealing her familiarity with Guild activities to better engage an anticipated middle-class readership and promote frank interrogation of class prejudice.

AB  - Male sexual assault is an understudied area. Interventions aimed at reducing negative attitudes toward male survivors have received relatively little attention in the field of sexual assault and violence. This may be related to underreported or insufficient data on male survivors or possibly the acceptance of male rape myths. The current research examines the effect of a hypothetical male sexual assault survivor story and empathy writing task on changes in male rape myth acceptance (MRMA) among U.S. men and women (N = 95). Further, the researchers sought to understand the differences between men and women in MRMA change scores and state emotional empathy for the hypothetical survivor after the empathy induction. Finally, the researchers examined whether state emotional empathy would predict reductions in MRMA and whether participant sex would predict state emotional empathy for the hypothetical survivor after accounting for knowing a male survivor and preinduction MRMA. The results indicated that both men and women experienced significant decreases in MRMA postinduction, and men and women experienced similar levels of change. Additionally, state emotional empathy and preinduction MRMA were the only significant predictors of change scores. Although women reported higher state emotional empathy for the hypothetical survivor, sex was not a significant predictor of state emotional empathy after accounting for personally knowing a male survivor and preinduction MRMA. This research fills a gap in the literature by identifying men's stories of sexual assault and empathy writing as potential methods to reduce MRMA.

KW  - CREES
AB  - The Editorial Board of the journal is rightly proud that it managed to persuade Professor Maureen Perrie, the eminent British historian of Russia, to write this memoir, intriguingly entitled 'From Poetry to Peasantry: my Early Adventures in Russian Studies'. The memoir is written with such candour, and in such a lively and entertaining style, that its appeal will extend beyond specialists in the humanities. The reader is presented with a portrait of an entire generation, with its insights and its delusions, its loyalty to its parents' moral code and its aspiration towards new visions of humanity. Maureen Perrie's remarkable memory for detail enables her to create a complex and dynamic picture of the attitude of British society towards Russia, of cultural interactions and the cruel political prejudice that played such a pernicious role. At the same time we have a valuable account of her youthful enthusiasms, heartfelt experiences and the role of personal relationships in her development as a historian. The author followed a complex path, beginning with an interest in Russian literature and the Symbolists (her favourite poet was Alexander Blok), and leading on to research on the Russian peasantry, pretenderism and the Russian monarchy. This trajectory provides evidence of her inquiring mind and her desire to get to the very heart of a phenomenon - because a true understanding of Russia involves first and foremost an understanding of the patriarchal mindset, the peasant world, popular utopias and the cruelty of the regime towards its own people. Maureen Perrie has brilliantly succeeded in her task. Her publications make a major contribution to international Russian Studies; and this autobiographical essay, which is so revealing of the author's personality, provides entertaining and moving reading for all lovers of Russian culture.

AB  - This article reports a qualitative investigation of the perceptions on cross-community music education activities of 14 key practitioners with experience with the two main communities in Northern Ireland (NI), Protestant and Catholic. The segregation of the NI education system is outlined in the first section, which is followed by a review of literature, cross-community projects, and the research methodology. Two hundred and sixteen pages of interview transcripts were analysed with NVivo. Interviewees reflected on current activities and on memories of their own experiences when younger, their fears and hopes. They explained how such projects are and have been organised in NI. The participants' perceptions are discussed, including their comments on 'Project processes and effectiveness', 'Music education potential' and 'Music as a sign of identity'. The reported educational activities and aims vary depending on a number of factors, one of the most important being the level of acknowledgement of integration of the educational setting, which appears to be influenced by the socio-economic environment. It is apparent that cross-community music education projects have been and continue to be an effective means of addressing prejudice amongst young people. Nevertheless, the context of each educational setting delimits the potential of such projects. Educational implications are examined in the conclusion.

This in turn has affected recruitment of graduate medical students into the specialty Little is known about the impact of psychiatry rotations during undergraduate medical training on students' attitudes about psychiatry and eventual specialty choice in developing countries. This study examined the impact of a psychiatry clinical rotation on medical students' attitudes to psychiatry and possible career choice. Method: Eighty-one and one hundred and six fifth year medical students completed the ATP-30, socio-demographic and career choice questionnaires at the beginning and the end of a four week clinical rotation respectively Results: The overall attitude of the students to psychiatry was favourable at the beginning of the rotation with significant improvement following the rotation (p=0.003). Significant improvement in attitude was observed among female and younger students. Students who indicated preference for specialties other than psychiatry showed a greater improvement in their attitude to psychiatry following the rotation (p=0.011). The rotation however did not enhance students' preference for psychiatry as a future career. Conclusion: The four-week clinical rotation in psychiatry resulted in increased mean attitudinal score, but not in enhanced preference for psychiatry as a career.

AB  - The naming of pathogens and their associated syndromes is a thorny process which unfolds in a complex geopolitical environment. This brief piece offers perspective on the multitude of forces that shape the name of a pathogen and summarizes the story of Sin Nombre Virus, with some reference to the ongoing saga of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A monopoly on names and circulating monikers rarely exists, and certain communities become disproportionately impacted by misunderstandings or stigmatization. By acknowledging these processes, we can better serve as allies to affected communities dealing with both pandemic and prejudice.

AB  - Indicators of collective user behavior and opinion are increasingly common features of online news stories and may include information about how the story made users feel. An experiment (N = 298) examined the effects of the presence and valence of a "mood meter" posted alongside an online human-interest story on memory for, attitude toward, emotional response to, and intentions to share the story. The presence of a mood meter led to lower recall of story content, more negative attitudes toward the story, and less positive emotional responses. The results suggest that participating in a mood meter may attenuate positive responses to human-interest stories.

AB  - Background: Moral philosophers have debated the extent to which persons are individually responsible for the onset of and recovery from addiction. Empirical investigators have begun to explore counselors' attitudes on these questions. Meanwhile, a separate literature has investigated counselors' negative attitudes towards naltrexone, an important element of medication-assisted treatment for alcohol addiction. The present study bridges the literature on counselor views about responsibility for addiction with the literature on attitudes towards naltrexone. It investigates the extent to which a counselor's views of individual responsibility for alcohol addiction are related to that counselor's views of naltrexone.
   Methods: Using a vignette-based survey of 117 addiction treatment professionals, the study analyzes the relationship between an addiction counselor's views about individual responsibility for alcohol addiction and using naltrexone to treat it.
   Results: We find a significant difference in counselors who assign greater responsibility to a person for the onset of alcohol addiction. They agreed more strongly with several objections to naltrexone, including worries about compliance, naltrexone's side effects outweighing its benefits, naltrexone treating symptoms but not underlying causes, and the idea that medication may undermine a person's motivation to recover. Combined views of greater responsibility for addiction's onset and recovery also significantly predicted stronger agreement with objections.
   Conclusions: We conclude that there is a strong relationship between a counselor assigning higher individual responsibility for addiction and holding more negative views about naltrexone. The study also sheds light on one reason why the model of addiction as a brain disease has had limited impact on clinical practice.

AB  - Using a mixed-method approach of econometric and ethnographic field research, this article examines the social and economic costs and benefits of increases in soybean production in the Brazilian Amazon. Statistical analysis suggests that increased soy production both reduces poverty indicators and raises median rural incomes, but is also associated with increased measures of inequality. Qualitative fieldwork sheds light on the wider political and social causes and consequences of this increasing inequality, pointing to ethnic differences between large soy farmers and local populations that raise long standing prejudices and tensions.

AB  - Aerodynamic coefficients of a cube depending on a broad-range attitude change have been measured using the free-flight technique in a hypersonic flowfield. Experiments were performed therefore in the hypersonic wind tunnel H2K at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Cologne. The free- flight technique in H2K has allowed achieving a continuous rotation of the cube without any sting interferences in a broad angular range of 90 degrees. This motion of themodel during the free flight has been acquired using a nonintrusive high-speed stereo tracking system. A marker- based tracking algorithm has been applied to reconstruct the three-dimensional flight trajectories and attitudes to determine the resulting forces andmoments. By using high- speed schlieren photography, the unsteady flow structures have been recorded. Pitch-angle-dependent aerodynamic coefficients of rotating cubes have been observed.

AB  - Purpose
   There has been little research into the use and efficacy of Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) across UK workplaces. This paper aims to investigate the implementation of MHFA across six UK organisations, identifying key barriers and facilitators.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Twenty-seven workplace representatives were recruited from six organisations through purposive sampling and took part in semi-structured interviews exploring their experiences of workplace MHFA. The data underwent thematic analysis, identifying key themes around implementation.
   Findings
   Implementation varied across organisations, including different reasons for initial interest in the programme, and variable ways that MHFA-trained employees operated post-training. Key barriers to successful implementation included negative attitudes around mental health, the perception that MHFA roles were onerous, and employees' reluctance to engage in the MHFA programme. Successful implementation was perceived to be based on individual qualities of MHFA instructors and good practice demonstrated by trained individuals in the workplace. The role of the inner organisational setting and employee characteristics were further highlighted as barriers and facilitators to effective implementation.
   Research limitations/implications
   MHFA is a complex intervention, presenting in different ways when implemented into complex workplace settings. As such, traditional evaluation methods may not be appropriate for gaining insights into its effectiveness.

TI  - The Promise of Anonymity: An Investigation of the Practices of ELA Teachers Facilitating Discourse About LGBTQ Topics
T2  - TEACHERS COLLEGE RECORD
LA  - English
KW  - QUEER
AB  - Background/Context: As states and districts have begun adopting texts inclusive of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people, debates about how LGBTQ issues should be represented in the curricular canon have emerged. While existing research investigates curricular questions that are arising as a result of LGBTQ curricular inclusion, scholarship has been slow to address the instructional questions presented by the introduction of inclusive curricula.
   Purpose: This study explored how seven secondary English Language Arts teachers facilitated student engagement with LGBTQ-related topics. Analysis of data on teachers' instructional practice and related decision-making sought to (a) determine what instructional dilemmas arose for teachers as they taught LGBTQ-inclusive content and (b) analyze the instructional decisions that teachers made to address these dilemmas.
   Participants: Participants in this study were seven secondary English Language Arts teachers who (a) held strong reputations in their professional communities for supporting LGBTQ students and (b) had strong intentions to support LGBTQ students through LGBTQ curricular inclusion, reducing student prejudice, and advocating for and with LGBTQ students.
   Research Design: This comparative case study was embedded in a larger qualitative study that investigated the instructional practice of LGBTQ-supportive teachers. This article reports on findings from an analysis of all data from this project that pertained to how teachers engaged students when teaching LGBTQ content. Data was collected over a six-month period and includes 22 teacher interviews, 28 observations of classroom instruction, 70 teacher log entries, and 25 teacher questionnaires.
   Findings/Results: Analysis showed that participants felt a tension between a desire to make LGBTQ identity visible and a desire to offer LGBTQ students privacy. Participants employed two different approaches to navigating the visibility-privacy tension. Some created parallel engagement strategies for students, some public and some private, while others simultaneously allowed for privacy and visibility through the use of anonymity.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: As conceptions of diversity expand to include sexual diversity, this study has implications for teacher preparation and professional development aimed at supporting teachers to attend to the unique needs of LGBTQ students within instructional practice.

AB  - This article reports on the relationship of personality and euthanasia attitudes. Results from a survey of 165 Iranian students showed that religiosity, honesty-humility, agreeableness, and extraversion were related to negative attitudes toward euthanasia, whereas openness was related to acceptance of euthanasia, with the unconventionality facet driving this relationship. Moreover, openness explained additional variance when added to a multivariate model containing religiosity and HEXACO factors. This study illustrates the possibility of accounting for variation beyond the traditional group level predictors of attitudes toward euthanasia and promoting future cross-cultural studies into personality and end-of-life issues and informing end-of-life conversations at the bedside.

AB  - We study the long-term effects of intergroup contact on nation building by exploiting a national lottery that randomly allocated conscripts to different military areas across Spain. For men born in regions that feature a weak Spanish identity, we find that being assigned to military service in a different region substantially increases self-identification as Spanish, increases the likelihood of voting in national elections and reduces the probability of voting for a regionalist party. Moreover, in support of intergroup contact as the main mechanism behind these results, we find that movers are more likely than nonmovers to have friends from other regions. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The study investigates the ways in which Black female pilots experience and manage their elite status as airline transport pilots (ATPs) and as co-cultural group members. Accordingly, Orbe's (1998b) co-cultural theory is used as a frame to understand how women of color negotiate workplaces where White male cultural norms are omnipresent. Using a phenomenological approach, the communicative lived experiences of two Black female ATPs are analyzed to reveal specific co-cultural communication practices enacted. The study is offered here as a testament to engaged research-that which advances theory (i.e., extending co-cultural theorizing in a new setting) and provides pragmatic insight into important contemporary issues (i.e., increased diversity in a historically White male profession).

AB  - This preliminary study applied Self-Categorization Theory (SCT) to the sexual bullying of high school girls by boys. Seventy-five Year 9 boys responded to vignettes portraying sexual bullying in which gender was a more or a less salient feature of the social context described. As predicted, boys were more likely to engage in sexual bullying when gender was more salient. Masculine sex role was not correlated with engagement in sexual bullying. Controlling for social desirability, pro-bullying attitude was predictive of such engagement, but only when the social context rendered gender less salient. This suggests the power of the perceived social context for determining which individual characteristics will gain expression. It is concluded that SCT is a promising avenue for advancing understanding of bullying, a field of research that has previously largely lacked a theoretical focus.

AB  - There is a high prevalence of gender gap in Bangladesh which might affect women's likelihood to receive maternal healthcare services. In this backdrop, we aim to investigate how gender inequality measured by intrahousehold bargaining power (or autonomy) of women and their attitudes towards intimate partner violence (IPV) affects accessing and utilizing maternal health care services. We used Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) data of 2014 covering 5460 women who gave birth at least one child in the last three years preceding the survey. We performed logistic regression to estimate the effect of women's autonomy and their attitude towards IPV on access to and utilization of maternal healthcare services. Besides, we employed different channels to understand the heterogeneous effect of gender inequality on access to maternal healthcare services. We observed that women having autonomy positively influenced attaining five required antenatal care (ANC) services (AOR: 1.17; 95% CI: 0.98-1.41) and women's negative attitudes towards IPV were positively associated with five ANC services (AOR: 1.42; 95% CI: 1.02-1.97), sufficient ANC visits (COR: 1.55; CI: 1.19-2.01), skilled birth attendant (SBA) (AOR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.05-1.94) and postnatal care (PNC) services (AOR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.12-1.84). Besides, rural residency, religion, household wealth, education of both women and husband were found to have some of the important channels which were making stronger effect of gender inequality on access to maternal healthcare services. The findings of our study indicate a significant association between access to maternal healthcare services and women's autonomy as well as attitude towards IPV in Bangladesh. We, therefore, recommend to protect women from violence at home and mprove their intrahousehold bargaining power to increase their access to and utilization of required maternal healthcare services.

AB  - Cyclists are vulnerable road users who are more likely than others to be involved and injured in accidents and crashes. To enhance cyclists' safety, governments around the world have introduced bicycle passing distance laws, yet research into the effectiveness of these laws is still limited. This study examines the changes in driver behaviour (passing distance, aggressive behaviour) and negative attitudes towards cyclists, as well as cyclist numbers on the roads following the introduction of a cyclist minimum passing distance law in Western Australia in 2017. The study employs a quasi-experimental design using self-reported survey data on driver behaviour and attitudes from two independent samples collected before (N-2016 = 302) and after (N-2020 = 426) the introduction of the law. Average daily cyclist numbers per month were retrieved from Western Australia's Mainroads Government Agency for 35 cycle counters on shared paths (803 data entries prior to the law and 737 data entries post its's introduction) and one cycle counter on a road in the CBD of the state capital (data entries for 349 days pre-law and 657 days post-law). Results showed that the introduction of the law was followed by an increase in self-reported passing distances by car drivers. However, the results also indicated that aggressive behaviour and negative attitudes towards cyclists had increased between 2016 and 2020, while cycling numbers remained stable. Taken together, the results indicate that the cyclist minimum passing distance law effectively addresses its targeted outcome, while it appears less effective and potentially counterproductive in addressing attitudes, related behaviours and cycling numbers in the short term. The findings have implications for policy makers looking to introduce cyclist minimum passing distance laws. Specifically, such laws may need to be rigorously enforced and to be accompanied with other interventions targeted at changing attitudes and norms concerning cyclists.

AB  - George Orwell's initial response to wartime internment is characterised by his silence. Uncertainty, desire for government work, wartime necessity, political prejudice and faith in English reasonableness contributed to his toleration of the policy, in the specific context of total war. Orwell worried that criticising internment could undermine public trust in civil liberties, which performatively protected England from the excesses of totalitarianism. Unlike others on the Left, he therefore placed his faith not in the vigilance of parliament, but in an illusion embraced by the English people: that they remained guardians of civil liberties, despite a need in wartime to curtail them.

AB  - Young Latino gay and bisexual men experience discrimination due to heterosexism and racism from within and beyond their communities. Although most research has emphasised overt forms of discrimination, a growing body of research is examining the effects of microaggressions, or indirect forms of discrimination, on racial and sexual minorities. The purpose of this study was to explore the contexts of various types of microaggressions, as well as describe the resilience strategies used by young adult Latino gay and bisexual men living in Los Angeles, California. A sample of 21 young Latino gay and bisexual men aged 18 to 29years were recruited to complete qualitative, in-depth, semi-structured interviews following a phenomenological approach. Three contextual themes relevant to microaggressions emerged: (1) microassaults, (2) microinsults and (3) microinvalidations. Three themes emerged around the resilience strategies to overcome these experiences: (1) self-discovery, (2) adaptive socialisation and (3) self-advocacy. Family and community-based efforts to reinforce and expand resilience repertoires are needed to help young Latino gay and bisexual men. ResumeLes jeunes hommes latinos, gays ou bisexuels, sont victimes de discriminations en raison de l'heterosexisme et du racisme existant au sein et au-dela de leur communaute. Si la plupart des etudes ont mis l'accent sur les formes manifestes de la discrimination, un nombre croissant de recherches examine les effets de la micro-agression, ou des formes indirectes de la discrimination, sur les minorites raciales et sexuelles. L'objectif de cette etude etait d'explorer les contextes des divers types de micro-agression, ainsi que de decrire les strategies de resilience adoptees par les jeunes latinos, gays ou bisexuels, vivant a Los Angeles. 21 jeunes issus de cette population et ages de 18 a 29 ans ont ete recrutes pour participer a des entretiens qualitatifs, en profondeur et semi-structures, conduits dans une approche phenomenologique. Trois themes contextuels relevant de la micro-agression ont emerge : (a) les micro-assauts, (b) les micro-insultes, et (c) les micro-invalidations. Trois themes ont emerge, relativement aux strategies de resilience adoptees pour surmonter ces experiences : (a) l'auto-decouverte, (b) la socialisation adaptive, et (c) l'autonomie sociale. Des efforts fondes sur la famille et la communaute visant a renforcer et elargir le repertoire des strategies de resilience sont necessaires pour aider les jeunes hommes latinos gays ou bisexuels. ResumenLos hombres jovenes homosexuales y bisexuales de origen hispano sufren discriminacion debido a heterosexismo y racismo dentro y fuera de sus comunidades. Aunque en la mayoria de los estudios se ha hecho hincapie en las formas evidentes de discriminacion, en cada vez mas estudios se analizan los efectos de la micro agresion, o formas indirectas de discriminacion, en minorias raciales y sexuales. La finalidad de este estudio fue analizar los contextos de varios tipos de micro agresion, asi como describir las estrategias de resiliencia que utilizan los hombres jovenes adultos homosexuales y bisexuales de origen hispano que viven en Los angeles, California. Se capto una muestra de 21 hombres jovenes homosexuales y bisexuales de origen hispano con edades comprendidas entre los 18 y los 29 anos para participar en entrevistas semiestructuras cualitativas y exhaustivas con enfoque fenomenologico.
   Surgieron tres temas contextuales que eran relevantes para la micro agresion: (a) micro asaltos, (b) micro insultos, y (c) micro invalidaciones. Surgieron tres temas como estrategias de resiliencia para superar estas experiencias: (a) autodescubrimiento, (b) socializacion adaptable, y (c) autodefensa de sus derechos. Es necesario el apoyo de la familia y la comunidad para fortalecer y ampliar los repertorios de resiliencia con el fin de ayudar a los hombres jovenes homosexuales y bisexuales de origen hispano.

AB  - Against the backdrop of an increase in reported hate crimes, we present the development of a U.K.-focussed instrument designed to evaluate the nature of public beliefs about hate crime, legislation, offenders and victims. In Study 1, 438 participants completed an Anglicized version of the Hate Crime Beliefs Scale (HCBS). Factor analyses revealed three subfactors: Denial (high scores represent a denial of hate crime severity and need for legislation), Compassion (high score reflect compassion toward victims and affected communities) and Sentencing (higher scores reflect more punitive attitudes). In Study 2 (N = 134) we show that scores on Denial are positively associated with those on Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), ideologies known to be associated with prejudice. Compassion was negatively associated with these ideologies. Mediation analyses showed that Big Five personality traits Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness predicted Denial and Compassion via RWA, whereas Agreeableness and Openness predicted scores via SDO, consistent with a dual-process motivation model of hate crime beliefs. Results are discussed in terms of the nature of hate crime beliefs and the importance of understanding public attitudes which may support undesirable social norms and influence jury decision making in trials of hate related offenses.

AB  - Background: Informal payments were reported in Bulgaria before and after the introduction of formal co-payments for services included in the basic benefits package in 2000. The aim of our study was to establish the current scale and type of informal payments, as well as public attitudes towards these payments. Methods: A nationally representative survey of 1003 individuals was conducted in Bulgaria in July 2010 using face-to-face interviews based on a standardized questionnaire. Respondents were selected through a multi-stage random probability method. The questionnaire included questions on total informal payments (in cash and in kind) for health services used by the respondent during the preceding 12 months. Results: About 13% of users reported informal payments for outpatient visits and 33% of users reported to have paid informally for hospitalizations. The average amount paid informally for inpatient services was nearly twice higher than that for outpatient services. More than 50% of the sample had negative attitudes towards informal payments in both cash and kind, but about 27% of respondents had a positive attitude towards giving gifts in kind. Regression analysis showed that respondents with higher levels of education had more negative attitudes towards informal cash payments. Positive attitudes towards gifts in kind were more often stated by citizens of larger cities. Conclusion: Informal payments continue to exist in Bulgaria irrespective of the formal co-payments introduced in 2000. Although the problem has been recognized in Bulgaria, policies should aim to eliminate the underlying structural reasons for such payments.

AB  - Studies show that Whites tend to show the lowest level of support for affirmative action (AA) policies. Opponents of AA often argue that this is because it violates principles of meritocracy. However, self-interest (based on social identification with those adversely affected) could also explain their opposition. In three studies, we varied whether an Asian or White male is adversely affected by AA to test another explanation; namely, that Whites' fairness judgments are based on both the adversely affected person's race and the fairness evaluator's ideological beliefs. Although we found some support for the meritocratic explanation, this was not sufficient to explain why Whites view AA as (un)fair. Instead, we found strong support for our prediction that Whites who are opposed to equality perceive more unfairness when a White (vs. Asian) was harmed by AA, whereas Whites who endorse egalitarian ideologies perceive the opposite. This finding suggests that neither self-interest nor meritocratic explanations can fully account for Whites' opposition to AA. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - A positive interracial interaction can create a foundation for friendships, improved intergroup attitudes and reduced prejudice. Recent research has demonstrated that what people talk about in important. Here, two studies expand the interaction content model of interracial interactions to reveal that Black and White Americans perceive interaction content in similar and different ways. As expected, Black and White participants evaluated conversation topics along the same three dimensions, but differed in their perceptions of specific conversation topics. These convergences and differences emerged for pre-generated (Study 1) and self-generated (Study 2) topics. Factor analyses revealed that conversation attributes similarly distilled to the predicted underlying content dimensions of intimacy, valence, and controversy for Black and White Americans. However, Black individuals found interaction content, in general, to be more controversial, race-related, enjoyable, and predictable than White individuals. Although both groups found race-related content more controversial, Black individuals were less bothered by discussing race and found race-related topics to be more predictable and enjoyable to discuss. These findings supported the interaction content model which may provide a framework for future research on interracial interactions. We conclude with the importance of considering differences in perceptions of interaction content, as well as suggestions for how intergroup interaction research could benefit from systematically incorporating such content.

AB  - Objective: To examine attitudes towards self-harm patients and need for training about self-harm amongst health-care staff in Christchurch, New Zealand.
   Methods: Health-care staff from a general and a psychiatric hospital completed a questionnaire about their attitudes towards self-harm patients and their need for training about self-harm
   Results: A total of 195 staff members completed the questionnaire (response rate 64.4%). Overall, health-care staff had both positive and negative attitudes towards self-harm patients. Staff believed that their contact was helpful to self-harm patients, that they were patient and understanding, and were optimistic about patients' outcomes However, staff did not feel confident working with self-harm patients and believed that their training in this area was inadequate Attitudes were not significantly associated with age, gender, or experience. However, more negative attitudes were significantly associated with higher levels of burnout (through high emotional exhaustion (p < 0 0002) and low personal accomplishment (p < 0 003)). Staff comments indicated that their greatest difficulties working with self-harm patients included repetitive self-harm, frustrating and difficult patient behaviour, communication difficulties, and time pressure Staff suggestions for improvement included more training, provision of a handbook or guidelines, and greater flexibility with patient allocations.
   Conclusions: Overall, health-care staff had positive attitudes towards self-harm patients, and a strong desire to help such patients However, staff did not feel confident working with self-harm patients and had a strong desire for additional training in this area Additional staff training in working with self-harm patients could have the potential to increase staff confidence and attitudes and enhance patient care

AB  - Student sex work is a current phenomenon all over the world, increasingly reported by the media in recent years. However, student sex work remains under-researched in Germany and is lacking direct first-hand reports from the people involved. Further, sex work remains stigmatized, and therefore, students practicing it could be at risk of social isolation and emotional or physical danger. Therefore, this study examines students working in the sex industry focusing on their personal experiences and attitudes toward them. An online questionnaire was completed by 4386 students from Berlin universities. Students who identified themselves as sex workers (n = 227) were questioned with respect to their motivations to enter the sex industry, characteristics of their job, feelings after the intercourse, and perceived risks. Student non-sex workers (n = 2998) were questioned regarding knowledge of and attitudes toward student sex workers. Most student sex workers reported that they entered the sex industry due to financial reasons (35.7%). The majority reported offering services involving direct sexual intercourse. Disclosing their job to friends, family, or others was associated with less problems with social isolation and in romantic relationships. With a total of 22.9%, student non-sex workers reported never having heard about students working in the sex industry. The most frequent emotions mentioned by them with regard to student sex workers were compassion and dismay (48.9%). There was no difference in happiness between student sex workers and non-sex working students. Through this research, it becomes evident that there are similarities between the student's motivations to enter the sex industry, their feelings, and the problems they have to face. Moreover, prejudices still prevail about the life of student sex workers. Increasing understanding of student sex work might help those sex workers to live a less stigmatized life and thereby to make use of support from others. The universities as institutions could form the basis for this, e.g., by openly supporting student sex workers. This could help to encourage the rights of student sex workers and to gain perspective with respect to the sex industry.

AB  - Purpose - Studies show the benefits of supplier integration, yet negative attitudes toward supplier integration exist that research fails to explain. The purpose of this paper is to investigate managerial attitudes toward supplier integration and how intra-firm processes and culture affect the formation of such attitudes. In particular, the paper aims to examine the differing influences between the USA and China.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using multi-group structural equation modeling, the authors re-analyzed the data collected by Nahm et al. (2004) and Li et al. (2014) comprised of responses from 224 US and 117 Chinese manufacturing managers.
   Findings - The study finds that managerial attitudes toward supplier integration depend on the degree to which a collaborative organizational culture and synchronous manufacturing practices exist within a firm. Moreover, in the Chinese context, the influence of a collaborative organizational culture is lower than the influence of synchronous manufacturing practices. The opposite is found in the US context.
   Practical implications - The results suggest that overcoming negative attitudes of supplier integration requires more than simply espousing the benefits of supplier integration; looking deeper into an organization's internal characteristics and situational context is required. In particular, if the country context already emphasizes the collaborative culture, the organization should focus on synchronous manufacturing practices in order to form a positive attitude toward supplier integration.
   Originality/value - This paper is the first to examine how managerial attitudes toward supplier integration are formed. The work is novel because the authors suggest that the formation of managerial attitudes toward supplier integration inter-firm management can be affected by intra-firm management in the minds of managers, which are influenced by country contexts.

AB  - African American women are disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS compared with other ethnicities, accounting for two-thirds (67%) of all women diagnosed with HIV. Despite their increased risk of HIV infection, few studies have been conducted to understand culture-specific factors leading to their vulnerability. Given the central role of religious organizations in African American communities, this study explored whether and to what extent religiosity plays a role in stigma toward HIV/AIDS. Results of hierarchical regression showed that after controlling for key factors, religiosity was a significant factor predicting the level of religious stigma. Those with high religiosity displayed significantly higher stigma, associating HIV/AIDS with a curse or punishment from God. Verbatim responses to an open-ended question also revealed seemingly ingrained prejudice against HIV/AIDS from a religious perspective. The findings point to the important role of faith-based organizations (FBOs) in addressing HIV/AIDS issues within African American communities.

AB  - Objective: Initiatives to reduce neighborhood-based health disparities require access to meaningful, timely, and local information regarding health behavior and its determinants. We examined the validity of Twitter as a source of information for neighborhood-level analysis of dietary choices and attitudes.
   Materials and Methods: We analyzed the "healthiness" quotient and sentiment in food-related tweets at the census tract level, and associated them with neighborhood characteristics and health outcomes. We analyzed keywords driving the differences in food healthiness between the most and least-affluent tracts, and qualitatively analyzed contents of a random sample of tweets.
   Results: Significant, albeit weak, correlations existed between healthiness and sentiment in food-related tweets and tract-level measures of affluence, disadvantage, race, age, U.S. density, and mortality from conditions associated with obesity. Analyses of keywords driving the differences in food healthiness revealed foods high in saturated fat (eg, pizza, bacon, fries) were mentioned more frequently in less-affluent tracts. Food-related discussion referred to activities (eating, drinking, cooking), locations where food was consumed, and positive (affection, cravings, enjoyment) and negative attitudes (dislike, personal struggles, complaints).
   Discussion: Tweet-based healthiness scores largely correlated with offline phenomena in the expected directions. Social media offer less resource-intensive data collection methods than traditional surveys do. Twitter may assist in informing local health programs that focus on drivers of food consumption and could inform interventions focused on attitudes and the food environment.
   Conclusions: Twitter provided weak but significant signals concerning food-related behavior and attitudes at the neighborhood level, suggesting its potential usefulness for informing local health disparity reduction efforts.

AB  - Introduction Nurses represent an important link in mediating between the potential donors and their relatives'consent to organ and tissue transplantation.The message of the Health Department to potential donors about the importance of organ donation was supported by the Serbian Orthodox Church, the army and other institutions through media campaigns. Nurses could contribute to this action by their personal example.
   Objective The aim of this study was identification and bivariate analysis of nurse attitude about organ donation, their knowledge about the importance of transplantation as treatment methods, as well as the connection between work experience and education level with the formation of attitudes and new skills.
   Methods In this cross-sectional study, 291 nurses from the Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, filled in the questionnaire on the effect of correlation between the length of the service and level of education on knowledge and attitudes toward organ transplantation and organ donation.
   Results Out of 291 respondents, 67.4% have completed the nursing school and 32.6% have higher education. The majority (63.9%) of respondents knew that the EEG was the most valid method for determining brain death. The question regarding the possibility of buying organs was answered correctly by 68.7% of respondents. A large majority (91%) would accept organ transplant, if needed, but only 32.0% would be organ donors, and only 0.3% owned a donor card. In contrast, one third of nurses were already blood donors.
   Conclusion In case of necessary transplantation, nurses would accept someone else's organ, though they do not possess donor cards, but just few would donate their organs. It is possible that prejudice arises from ignorance and distrust in the health policy of the Republic of Serbia. However, besides negative attitude, nurses have expressed interest in learning and professional development in the area of transplantation.

AB  - This literature review critically synthesizes 10 years of international teacher expectations research using a simplified "expectation effect process" model. New developments in teacher expectation research are outlined, including effects of teacher expectations on students, teachers' development of expectations, teachers' differential treatment of students, and students' reactions to teacher expectations. A brief overview of pre-2008 research presents the foundations of the post-2008 research using the same "expectation effect process" model. A separate section about Australian research is also included. Results of the literature review show that while qualitative research on the topic has increased from 2008 to 2018, quantitative studies still prevail and qualitative studies on the topic-particularly those which consider students' perspectives-are rare. Hence, this article argues that the development of a more holistic, in-depth understanding of how teacher expectations affect student outcomes is possible through contextually embedded qualitative research that includes exploration of students' reactions to teacher expectations. In this way, further understandings about how and why expectation effects vary between students could be gained.

AB  - Internet and related new communication environments have also caused many changes in social and cultural structures. Games which are a mass communication medium, provide a space where players can easily obtain images, ideas, and evaluations to determine their own behavioral schedules. There are a number of studies that have included a variety of methodologies and data sources to determine whether or not video games, are also a direct influence on people's thoughts and behaviors such as traditional media environments that address millions of people. Today, MMORPGs are becoming more and more difficult with increasingly difficult tasks and wars. Different types of media such as visual and print media are the platforms that people can meet different stereotypes. Stereotypes are common thoughts that they are not private and carried on by sharing within the same community. While stereotype has a more uniform quality, prejudice can encompass a large number of stereotypes (ex, race, religion, sex stereotypes). This study aims to determine whether or not there is a relationship between gender and racial stereotypes of video game characters and variables such as race, gender, body types, and sexual portrayal-attire. Of the 107 RPG games that were examined, there were a total of 273 (46.2%) male characters and 318 (53.8%) female characters. Results of the chi-square analysis indicated that there were significant distribution differences between dependent and independent variables.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to develop actionable strategies designed for law enforcement agencies seeking to reduce fear of crime among those living within their jurisdictions. A conjunctive analysis of case configurations is conducted on data collected from residents living in southeast Queensland (Australia) (N = 713) in order to identify context-specific typologies of victimization worry. Main effects for each component of the typologies are examined in order to identify the impact each has on reducing negative attitudes towards crime. Current findings suggest that agencies will likely reduce fear of crime among community residents the most by focusing on decreasing concerns related to the consequences of victimization. Results are consistent for both crimes against persons and property offenses.

AB  - The political backlash against multiculturalism alongside the media portrayal of the global refugee crisis would suggest that the spaces for cultural difference have contracted and moved into a mode of transnational crisis management. This article addresses the moral panic over cultural difference by challenging some of the philosophical frameworks that have justified naturalized negative attitudes towards migrants and dismissed the viability of cosmopolitan perspectives. In particular, the author will critically evaluate the antagonistic perspective developed in Peter Sloterdijk's writings and Chantal Mouffe's theory of agonism. To grasp the complex and hybrid forms of cross-cultural exchanges, the author argues that a more robust vision of cosmopolitanism is necessary.

AB  - This analysis of U.S.-based survey data from the Pew Research Center profiles and categorizes online daters and garners to determine the factors predicting whether an individual has experience of online dating or gaming. The profiles of online daters and gamers show sociodemographic differences by user type (both daters and garners, daters only, garners only, and neither daters nor garners). Attitudinal differences are also identified across those user types and sociodemographic categories. The binary logistic regression analysis found that positive and negative attitudes about online dating and gaming exert a significant influence on whether an individual has experience with either.

AB  - BackgroundThis study reviews the attitudes and behaviours in rural Nepalese society towards women with disabilities, their pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood. Society often perceives people with disabilities as different from the norm, and women with disabilities are frequently considered to be doubly discriminated against. Studies show that negative perceptions held in many societies undervalue women with disabilities and that there is discomfort with questions of their control over pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood, thus limiting their sexual and reproductive rights. Public attitudes towards women with disabilities have a significant impact on their life experiences, opportunities and help-seeking behaviours. Numerous studies in the global literature concentrate on attitudes towards persons with disabilities, however there have been few studies in Nepal and fewer still specifically on women.MethodsA qualitative approach, with six focus group discussions among Dalit and non-Dalit women without disabilities and female community health volunteers on their views and understandings about sexual and reproductive health among women with disabilities, and 17 face-to-face semi-structured interviews with women with physical and sensory disabilities who have had the experience of pregnancy and childbirth was conducted in Rupandehi district in 2015. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated into English before being analysed thematically.ResultsThe study found negative societal attitudes with misconceptions about disability based on negative stereotyping and a prejudiced social environment. Issues around the marriage of women with disabilities, their ability to conceive, give birth and safely raise a child were prime concerns identified by the non-disabled study participants. Moreover, many participants with and without disabilities reported anxieties and fears that a disabled woman's impairment, no matter what type of impairment, would be transmitted to her baby, Participants - both disabled and non-disabled, reported that pregnancy and childbirth of women with disabilities were often viewed as an additional burden for the family and society. Insufficient public knowledge about disability leading to inaccurate blanket assumptions resulted in discrimination, rejection, exclusion and violence against women with disabilities inside and outside their homes. Stigma, stereotyping and prejudice among non-disabled people resulted to exclusion, discrimination and rejection of women with disabilities. Myths, folklore and misconceptions in culture, tradition and religion about disability were found to be deeply rooted and often cited as the basis for individual beliefs and attitudes.ConclusionWomen with disabilities face significant challenges from family and society in every sphere of their reproductive lives including pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood. There is a need for social policy to raise public awareness and for improved advocacy to mitigate misconception about disability and promote disabled women's sexual and reproductive rights.

AB  - This study examines how household composition and news media consumption and trust are related to attitudes towards two minority groups-immigrants and refugees-in a representative sample of the adult population (n = 6000) in Belgium, Sweden, France, and the Netherlands. We find that Swedes hold the most positive attitudes towards both groups, while the French are found to be most negative. The Belgians and Dutch hold moderate attitudes. There is also evidence that attitudes on refugees are more negative than attitudes on immigrants in Sweden and France, but not in Belgium and the Netherlands. Using structural equation modeling, we find that household composition is not directly related to attitudes, but indirect effects through socio-economic status and media consumption indicate that singles hold more negative attitudes than couples. Public television consumption, popular online news consumption, and trust in media are positively related to attitudes, whereas commercial television consumption is negatively associated with them.

AB  - Hate crime creates significant problems for individual victims and the social fabric of a community more broadly. Victimisation is most likely to occur around the victim's own neighbourhood, yet few studies examine how the neighbourhood context influences hate crime. This study uses data from the Australian Community Capacity Study involving 4,400 participants in 148 neighbourhoods in Brisbane. It examines whether it is characteristics of place (such as attitudes toward diversity, place attachment and social cohesion) that reduce hate crime, or whether it is interactions with fellow residents (such as frequency of neighbourly exchanges, number of friends, and number of acquaintances in the neighbourhood) that shelter residents from hate crime. Results demonstrate that characteristics of a place provide important protective factors against hate crime in the neighbourhood, rather than the number of social-interactions between residents.

AB  - As with phrenology and the polygraph, society is again confronted with a device that the media claims is capable of reading our minds. Functional magnetic resonance imaging ('fMRI'), along with other types of functional brain imaging technologies, is currently being introduced at various stages of a criminal trial as evidence of a defendant's past mental state. This Article demonstrates that functional brain images should not currently be admitted as evidence into courts for this purpose. Using the analytical framework provided by Federal Rule of Evidence 403 as a threshold to a Daubert/Frye analysis, we demonstrate that, when fMRI methodology is properly understood, brain images are only minimally probative of a defendant's past mental states and are almost certainly more unfairly prejudicial than probative on balance. Careful and detailed explanation of the underlying science separates this Article from others, which have tended to paint fMRI with a gloss of credibility and certainty for all courtroom-relevant applications. Instead, we argue that this technology may present a particularly strong/arm of unfair prejudice in addition to its potential to mislead jurors and waste the court's resources. Finally, since fMRI methodology may one day improve such that its probative value is no longer eclipsed by its extreme potential for unfair prejudice, we offer a nonexhaustive checklist that judges and counsel can use to authenticate functional brain images and assess the weight these images are to be accorded by fact finders.

AB  - This study examines the prevalence and context of alcohol references in rap music lyrics from 1979 through 2009. Four hundred nine top-ranked rap music songs released were sampled from Billboard magazine rating charts. Songs were analyzed using systematic content analysis and were coded for alcohol beverage types and brand names, drinking behaviors, drinking contexts, attitudes towards alcohol, and consequences of drinking. Trends were analyzed using regression analyses. The results of the study reveal significant increases in the presence of alcohol in rap songs; a decline in negative attitudes towards alcohol; decreases in consequences attributed to alcohol; increases in the association of alcohol with glamour and wealth, drugs, and nightclubs; and increases in references to liquor and champagne.

AB  - Objectives: Typically, older people are viewed via a single health condition, yet health outcomes are likely impacted by the intersection of many individual characteristics. Promoting inclusive health care is underpinned by reducing bias, respectful communication and supporting individual needs and preferences. This study explores perspectives of community aged care workers on diversity training and implementing training into practice.
   Methods: Ninety community aged care workers were telephone-interviewed three months after a one-day diversity training workshop. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically.
   Results: Five themes emerged: 'raising awareness'; 'reserving judgement'; 'confidence and empowerment to embed diversity into practice'; 'communicating effectively'; and 'thinking about change ... but'.
   Conclusions: Diversity concepts were positively received, but applying diversity principles into practice is more difficult. Recommendations to promote inclusive health care included raising awareness of bias, communicating with inclusive language and embedding diversity concepts into community aged care practice by addressing individual, organisational and wider system constraints.
   Policy Impact: Diversity should be everyone's business, from individual community aged care workers through to organisational management and policymakers. An inclusive environment, with minimal bias and prejudice, needs an organisation-wide approach to ensure diversity principles are consistently applied in policy and practice.
   Practice Impact: Community aged care workers are well positioned to promote inclusive health care, through raising awareness of bias and prejudice, challenging assumptions, communicating effectively and embedding diversity principles through individual and organisational practice change.

Two experimental studies found that consumers, indeed, may find advertising insulting to their intelligence and, consequently, rate such advertising lower. Inferring that the advertiser does not think very highly of their intelligence, consumers expected the offered products to be of lower quality and rated the advertiser lower. The tests extended across three different product categories and ruled out competing explanations.

AB  - Allies are members of an ingroup who work toward fairness for people in an outgroup. Ally behaviors include calling out discrimination and fighting for inclusion of outgroup members, and it includes public and private behaviors. As such, White allies can be an important means of reducing racism against people of color. There are few means of assessing and quantifying allyship in ingroup members, and as such, there is a need for methods for assessing allyship that can be used to better understand characteristics of allies and determine if interventions designed to reduce prejudice can improve allyship. To that end we describe an innovative scenario-based measurement technique to quantify interpersonal allyship, with White students as ingroup members (N = 987) and Black students as outgroup members (N = 61). Measurement of allyship is conducted based on participant responses to hypothetical racially-sensitive scenarios where microaggressions are occurring or likely to occur. Items were developed based focus group input, and rated by diversity experts for relevance. The factor structure of allyship items was examined by exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The final 10-item Interpersonal Racial Allyship Scale (IRAS) was negatively correlated to 3 measures of racist attitudes and 1 measure of microaggressive behaviors, and it was positively correlated to 2 measures of outgroup liking. It also predicted making racially supportive statements in a laboratory task. We report on characteristics of allies, noting that allied behaviors are correlated with less prejudice, stronger positive feelings toward outgroup members, and a greater likelihood of having other marginalized identities. Implications of findings and applications of the scale are discussed.

AB  - Purpose: Medical students have higher rates of depression and psychologic distress than the general population, which may negatively impact academic performance and professional conduct. This study assessed whether 10-20 min of daily mindfulness meditation for 30 days, using a mobile phone application, could decrease perceived stress and improve well-being for medical students.
   Methods: Eighty-eight medical students were stratified by class year and randomized to either intervention or control groups to use the mobile application Headspace, an audio-guided mindfulness meditation program, for 30 days. All participants completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), and General Well-Being Schedule (GWBS) at baseline (T1), 30 days (T2), and 60 days (T3). Repeated measures analysis of variance (rANOVA) was conducted for intervention versus control groups across T1, T2, and T3 to examine differences in stress, mindfulness, and well-being.
   Results: There was a significant interaction between time and treatment group for perceived stress and well-being. Perceived stress significantly decreased for the intervention group from T1 to T3 (F[2,142]=3.98, p < 0.05). General well-being significantly increased for the intervention group compared to the control group from T1 to T2, and the increase was sustained through T3 (F[2,144]=3.36, p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: These results highlight that a mobile audio-guided mindfulness meditation program is an effective means to decrease perceived stress in medical students, which may have implications on patient care. Integrating mindfulness training into medical school curricula for management of school- and work-related stress may lead to fewer negative physician outcomes (e.g., burnout, anxiety, and depression) and improved physician and patient outcomes. This has implications for a broad group of therapists and healthcare providers, ultimately improving quality of healing and patient care.

AB  - In this article, we propose the conceptualization of family structure as an important socially stratified grouping within a social determinants of health (SDOH) framework. We explore how family science literature supports this conceptualization of family structure through evidence of inequity in health outcomes across structurally diverse families that can and ought to be addressed; social stratification across family structures in which some family forms have greater prestige and power than others; and internalized, personally mediated, and institutional prejudices and discriminations that operate on the basis of these social stratifications. Ultimately, we contend that conceptualizing family structure as a socially stratified grouping within an SDOH framework can help enhance family science scholarship and assist family professionals in more effectively serving contemporary families.

AB  - Media images of walls being erected or dismantled symbolize the global dilemma at the heart of the approach toward diversity during economically challenging times. Will communities, organizations, and nations become more isolated, exclusionary, and protective of scarce resources? Or will they embrace diversity for humanistic reasons and its potential to drive economic growth? This paper first critically examines the paradox of diversity and deems it false because it omits the important role of inclusion climate. It then presents a systematic review of the research. Findings indicate that people are more likely to blame 'the other' for their economic hardships, and as a result are more likely to express racism, prejudice, and xenophobia, giving rise to intergroup conflicts and strife. Yet research also links diversity with innovation and its potential to uplift and energize economies, a quality that is particularly important during times of economic hardship. Finally, the paper presents a theory-based conceptual model, highlighting the central role of inclusion, and proposes directions for future research.

AB  - What factors influence attitudes towards refugees? Do negative attitudes towards refugees also influence attitudes towards conflict in the host countries? Previous studies suggest that an influx of refugees, and locals' reaction to them, may destabilize receiving countries and lead to conflict. In particular, actual or perceived negative effects of refugees' presence, such as increased economic competition with the locals, disruption of ethnic balance in the host country, and arrival of people with ties to rebel groups may lead to an increased likelihood of civil conflict in countries that receive refugees. These effects can lead to instability by changing the locals' incentives and opportunities of engaging in violence. Indeed, some studies find a positive correlation at the cross-national level between influx of refugees and conflict in receiving countries. We contribute to this literature by experimentally manipulating information about the externalities of hosting refugees. We conducted a survey-experiment in the summer of 2014 in Turkey, a country that hosts the largest number of Syrian refugees. We examine how different messages about the possible effects of hosting refugees - increased economic burden, disruption of ethnic balance, and ties with rebels, as well as a positive message of saving innocent women and children - affect locals' perceptions of the refugees and their attitudes towards the Turkish-Kurdish peace process. We find that some messages cause locals, especially majority non-Kurds, to hold more negative views of the refugees, and in some cases to view them as a threat. Generally speaking, this information does not affect support for the peace process within Turkey. Rather, fundamental factors, such as partisanship, and previous exposure to conflict are better predictors of attitudes towards peace.

AB  - The non-native English-speaking teachers' (NNESTs) beliefs about the monolingual approach have not been sufficiently studied in the teaching of English as a foreign language (EFL). In examining the NNESTs' beliefs about that issue, the present study adapts Guy Cook's recent framework, according to which the monolingual approach is based upon four untested, yet influential assumptions in English teaching (i.e. monolingualism, naturalism, native-speakerism, and absolutism). These theoretically intertwined assumptions lend powerful support to the monolingual approach. The participant questionnaire based on the aforementioned framework was administered to 207 Korean pre-service and in-service teachers of English, along with a post-survey interview with a subset of the participants. In general, the results showed that the in-service teachers were more oriented towards the bilingual approach, but less in agreement with the ideas centring on the monolingual approach, than their pre-service counterparts. It was further found that the in-service teachers' negative attitudes towards the monolingual approach may come from their actual teaching experience, rather than from teacher variables, such as the amount of experience abroad and English proficiency.

AB  - Introduction: Negative attitudes between pharmacists, doctors and nurses can impact adversely on patients' medicines management. A seven-week interprofessional learning (IPL) intervention was delivered to foster positive attitudes.
   Methods: First-year pharmacy, nursing and medical students' attitudes were assessed using the Attitudes to Health Professionals Questionnaire before and after IPL intervention.
   Results: Students viewed pharmacists, doctors and nurses as more 'caring' after IPL. Nurses were viewed as most 'caring'. Nursing and pharmacy students perceived doctors as least 'caring' before and after IPL whereas medical students viewed pharmacists as least 'caring'. Students perceived their own profession as more 'caring' than others did. The three-way analysis of variance showed a significant difference between student groups (p < 0.0001), professions (p < 0.0001) and before-and-after IPL (p < 0.005).
   Conclusion: Findings suggest that students' attitudes are more positive after they have worked together during seven weeks of IPL. Each student group view their own profession more positively than others. Views become more aligned after this IPL intervention. Time may be an important factor in allowing for attitudes to change. IPL can help foster positive attitudes between doctors, pharmacists and nurses, which may facilitate effective collaboration and thus enhance patients' medicines management.

AB  - While negative attitudes within the social work community toward clients struggling with addiction may not be ubiquitous, there is evidence that such attitudes remain problematic. Interestingly, while extant research suggests social workers may demonstrate low empathy toward clients with Substance Use Disorders (SUDs), there is very little research available concerning factors that may be involved with these adverse attitudes. This study explored the relationship between spirituality, religiosity and attitudes toward clients with SUDs utilizing a sample of social work students and practitioners from two unique geographical locations. Results demonstrated that dimensions of spirituality, including religiosity, have some predictive potential for attitudes toward addiction. Further, the direction can be either positive or negative.

AB  - Public Significance Statement Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals described their lived experience of hypervigilance, a chronic and pervasive stress response to direct and indirect experiences of stigma and discrimination.They were hypervigilant for potential harm as they interacted in public and private and when interacting with certain family members, coworkers, community members, and strangers they perceived to be prejudiced against LGBTQ people. Hypervigilance was often accompanied by negative emotions and social avoidance/isolation.
   Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) individuals are at risk for poorer health outcomes in part because of stigma, discrimination, victimization, and resulting trauma and stress. Stigma-related stress can lead to hypervigilance, or a chronic and pervasive state of alertness and readiness to respond to potential threats in the environment. The current study is one of the first to explore LGBTQ-identified individuals' lived experiences of hypervigilance. In a brief online format, participants (N = 245) completed demographic items and were asked to describe their experiences of hypervigilance and its impact on their lives. Participants reported over 30 negative emotions that accompanied hypervigilance; anxiety, fear, and exhaustion were the most common. Negative emotional reactions occurred in public and private settings and with family, coworkers, strangers, and others perceived to be prejudiced. Participants self-monitored and socially withdrew in efforts to protect themselves from stress and risk of harm. Service providers and researchers should assess hypervigilance in LGBTQ individuals and examine the impact on health and well-being while working to combat stigma and advocate for protective and equitable social policies.

AB  - This research examines how heterosexual consumers react to advertising featuring same-sex couples. Across three studies, we find that heterosexual consumers report higher levels of disgust in response to advertising featuring same-sex couples in comparison to mixed-sex couples, which results in more negative attitudes toward the advertisement and the advertised brand. We also find that moral-identity priming reduces disgust elicited by advertising featuring same-sex couples and improves attitudes toward the advertisement and the brand. However, we find that moral-identity priming is ineffective for consumers with high social dominance orientation. For these consumers, portraying same-sex couples as possessing Protestant work ethic traits decreases disgust and improves attitudes toward the advertisement and the brand.

AB  - Introduction: This study's aim was to investigate the attitudes of first- and sixth-year medical students on ageism and related factors, and to examine their willingness to work with older patients in their professional lives.
   Materials and Method: In this cross-sectional study, the target population comprised 637 students, 352 of whom were first-year and 285 were sixth-year medical students, studying at Akdeniz University Faculty of Medicine in the 2018-2019 academic year. The dependent variable was their attitudes on ageism. The Ageism Attitude Scale was used to assess the students' attitudes. The Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis, Spearman correlation, and multiple regression analyses were used for data evaluation.
   Results: At total of 524 students were included (access rate 82.3%), 53.8% were first-year students. The mean Ageism Attitude Scale score was 84.1 +/- 8.9 (33-107). Forty-six percent of the study group stated that they would rather not work with older patients. In Agesim Attitude Scale scoring, the determinants of a positive attitude are: being a female, having good/very good communication with grandparents, desire to live with parents when their parents are very old, and desire to work with elderly patients in their professional life.
   Conclusion: The attitudes of medical students toward older patients were generally positive but their reluctance to work with them in their professional life was high, a determinant of having a negative attitude. From the first year of education, the curriculum and social activities should support increased communication with healthy older people to raise awareness about ageism.

AB  - There is little research on brief training for care staff who work with people with an intellectual disability who display challenging behaviour. Existing research has demonstrated mixed evidence for attributional change and little evidence in relation to attitude change. A one-day challenging behaviour training taking a Positive Behavioural Support (PBS) approach was investigated. Staff attributions and attitudes were measured at four time points (1 week before training, immediately before and after training and at 2-month follow-up). Following training, statistically significant changes in staff attributions and attitudes were recorded. These results suggest that brief training using PBS may be sufficient to change the attributions and attitudes of care staff towards clients with challenging behaviour so that they are able to offer more effective support.

AB  - Introduction This study compared childless Israeli lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals to their heterosexual counterparts on anticipation of stigma upon parenthood and assessed its mediating role in the association between being a member of a sexual minority and lower parenting desires, intentions, and likelihood estimations. Methods A total of 612 childless participants (174 self-reported as LGB people) ranging in age from 18 to 49 (M = 31.18, SD = 3.89) were recruited through convenience sampling between November 2019 and February 2020. They completed online questionnaires assessing their anticipation of stigma upon parenthood, parenting desires, intentions, and likelihood estimations. Results LGB individuals reported a higher anticipation of stigma upon parenthood than their heterosexual counterparts. The anticipation of stigma upon parenthood fully mediated the association between being a sexual minority and lower parenting desires and intentions and partially mediated the association between being a sexual minority and lower estimated likelihood of parenthood. Conclusions and Policy Implications The findings are interpreted in light of LGB possible awareness of prejudice and discrimination by local legislation that prohibits or impedes sexual minorities from pursuing parenthood. Policymakers and health professionals should be alerted to the impact of anticipation of stigma when accounting for the disparities in parenting aspirations between LGB individuals and heterosexual counterparts and its possible connections to discriminatory Israeli social policies toward LGB rights.

AB  - This study explored a persuasive message strategy for aid promotion by considering the structure of donors' attitudes toward international aid. Traditional studies on aid campaigns have usually overlooked the dynamics of inter-attitudinal structure and have focused on message framings rather than quality message. The Galileo spatial-linkage model represents the attitudinal structure within a spatial coordinate system. A public opinion survey with 218 college students was conducted. The results indicated that potential donors are unconcerned about international aid; however, the attitude can be changed into a well-disposed attitude. In this study, a persuasive message strategy was suggested. A compound message focusing on relatively close issues to donors would facilitate positive attitude change to participate in international aid projects.

AB  - Native Americans are members of sovereign nations that predate colonial settler societies. In settler societies, inclusion has often meant assimilation, a form of forced or coerced participation in the larger society and loss of Indigenous identity. On the other hand, inclusion can counterbalance prejudice and bigotry, thus, helping reduce stereotypes and oppression. The challenge is to provide opportunities for inclusion without mandating incorporation at the cost of Indigenous distinctiveness and ways of being. This article explores how Indigenous Peoples can reap the benefits of social inclusion while avoiding its pitfalls, including loss of identity and legal status.

AB  - We propose a model of how messages about groups one personally dislikes affect individual attitudes. We build upon theories of message persuasion and out-group acceptance to account for evidence type (numerical vs. narrative), facilitating conditions (encouraging empathy vs. objectivity), and the underlying mechanisms (immersion). We test this model in a pretest-posttest experiment, in which a sample of Americans (N = 601) read counter-attitudinal commentaries below articles presenting either narrative or numerical evidence about illegal immigrants or same-sex couples. Narratives led to greater message acceptance and greater immersion, especially in the empathetic condition. In turn, numerical messages led to self-perceived attitude change in the objective condition. Persuasive effects of narratives in the empathetic, but not the objective, condition were mediated by immersion.

AB  - Many attitudes are acquired in early childhood. However, due to a lack of experimental research, little is known about the processes of how they are acquired. Two experiments were therefore conducted with 153 German kindergarten children aged 3-6years that provide first evidence for childhood attitude formation in terms of evaluative conditioning. Specifically, it was found that children preferred novel stimuli previously paired with liked stimuli over novel stimuli previously paired with disliked stimuli. This effect occurred independently of age, generalized toward similar novel stimuli, and did not depend on children's recollection of how stimuli were paired. The findings are discussed in terms of the processes underlying childhood attitude formation, and implications for related research areas are highlighted.

AB  - Accessible summary
   What is known on the subject
   A serious mental illness influences sexual life and people affected have worries about their sexual health.
   People living with a serious mental illness can and want to participate in interventions related to sexual health.
   What the paper adds to existing knowledge
   People who suffer a serious mental illness are interested in maintaining an active sex life.
   People who suffer a serious mental illness experience rejection when they open up and they lose intimate relationships or possibilities of meeting other people because of ignorance and prejudices surrounding mental health.
   What are the implications for practice
   Mental health services must respond to this need, that is including sexual needs assessment among routine standard practices or training nurses on sexual education to allow them to advise patients and their families and friends.
   Health systems should promote awareness programmes and reduce the stigma surrounding mental health and sexuality.
   Introduction Sexuality-related nursing care is scarce and mainly focuses on biological issues. There is also a lack of knowledge about how serious mental illnesses affect sexuality.
   Aim To explain how people with a serious mental illness perceive and experience their sexuality.
   Method A meta-synthesis was conducted to integrate qualitative studies. Four databases were used to perform the search, focused in the last ten years. Nine articles were included, and their results analysed thematically.
   Results Four categories were identified: "Pathologized sexuality," which explains how the disorder and treatment affect sexuality; "Not my sexuality anymore," which describes feelings emerging from the perceived limitations and the role of self-acceptance; "Learning to manage intimate relationships," which explains the desire to establish intimate personal relationships and define their meaning; and "Reconstructing my sexuality," which elucidates the influence of the environment on sexuality.
   Discussion Sexuality is influenced by several factors, the main ones being: the clinical complications, the side effects of drug treatment, the social support, the relationship with the health sector and stigma.
   Implications for practice Having a serious mental illness affects sexuality and can provoke suffering and social isolation. Mental health services should address this issue and carry out community interventions to reduce stigma.

Results revealed significant improvement in student knowledge and general attitudes after the course and indicated that increased knowledge about schizophrenia was only related to general attitudinal improvement when accompanied by increased personal social contact. Implications for education on severe mental illnesses and value and attitude development in social work education are discussed.

AB  - There is evidence of health disparities between sexual minority and heterosexual populations. Although the focus of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender health research has been human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and sexually transmitted infection among men who have sex with men, there are health disparities among sexual minority women. Using the minority stress framework, these disparities may in part be caused by individual prejudice, social stigma, and discrimination. To ensure equitable health for all, there is urgent need for targeted culturally sensitive health promotion, cultural sensitivity training for health care providers, and intervention-focused research.

TI  - Padilla v. Kentucky: The Effect of Plea Colloquy Warnings on Defendants' Ability To Bring Successful Padilla Claims
T2  - YALE LAW JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - CONSEQUENCES
KW  - COUNSEL
AB  - In Padilla v. Kentucky, the Supreme Court held that a lawyer's failure to advise her noncitizen client of the deportation consequences of a guilty plea constitutes deficient performance of counsel in violation of a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. In the plea context, defendants are also protected by the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and the Due Process Clause, which requires that judges and defendants engage in a conversation regarding the consequences of the plea-the so-called "plea colloquy"-before the defendant can enter a valid guilty plea.
   In many plea colloquies, judges issue general warnings to defendants regarding the immigration consequences of a guilty plea. Since Padilla, a number of lower courts have held that such general court warnings prevent a defendant from proving prejudice and prevailing on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim where there might otherwise be a Padilla Sixth Amendment violation.
   This Note argues that those rulings mistakenly conflate the role of the court in a Fifth Amendment plea colloquy and the role of counsel under the Sixth Amendment and, further, that they misread the clear directives of Padilla. In the plea context, the court and defense counsel serve complementary but distinct functions in our constitutional structure; neither can replace the other, and the failure of either court or counsel constitutes a breakdown in our system. Circumscribing Padilla's requirements by allowing plea colloquies to "cure" the prejudice created by Sixth Amendment Padilla violations is problematic because the Fifth Amendment plea colloquy provides significantly less protection to criminal defendants. Thus, the substitution of the plea colloquy for advice from counsel will substantially undercut the Padilla decision.

In recognition of their social and political agency, the article focuses on the Kurdish young people's framing of both the conflict and peace, based on their individual everyday observations and experiences, and seeks to understand how they frame the Kurdish issue by defining the root causes of the conflict and imagining solutions for its resolution, particularly vis-a-vis the dominant frames regarding the Kurdish issue in Turkey.

AB  - The Implicit Association Test (IAT) is a popular means of examining "hidden" biases. However, some express concerns about classroom use of the IAT, citing students' potentially negative affective reactions to taking the IAT and discovering their implicit biases. To investigate the validity of this criticism, 35 social psychology students completed affect measures after taking and discussing the Race IAT. Students reported more positive than negative affect both immediately after taking the IAT and 1 week later. They also reported greater awareness of their own and others' implicit racial biases, knowledge of implicit processes, and perceived value of the IAT demonstration.

AB  - Introduction: Millennials is a term referring to the people born between 1981-2000. Members of this demographic cohort are known as millennials because they were born around the turn of the third millennium A.D. This generation is generally associated with heightened technical knowledge and most of their active hours are spent on social media. It is a generation which claims to break all stereotypes engrained into our minds by society in the name of "culture".
   Seeing that the reason for women being discriminated within households revolves around the closed, backward concepts of dowry and patriarchy, we targeted an audience of extremely privileged, well educated, socially and culturally aware university students to determine their view point on the issue at hand.
   Objective : To determine the perceptions of millennials of twenty first century regarding position of women in Pakistani society in Karachi.
   Material and method: A Cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of 330 participants from various universities of Karachi. The study was conducted for a period of ten months from February 2019 To November 2019.The Data was collected from Aligarh Institute of Technology, Bahria University, DHA Suffa University and Institute of Business Administration Karachi. The sample was taken through Non-Probability Purposive Sampling. A Pilot study was conducted to assess the authenticity of the questionnaire. Data collected was entered and analyzed using SPSS version 20, with 95% confidence interval. All ethical considerations were observed.
   Results: Regarding faculties of the participants, 48.2% were from Engineering, 17.6% from Commerce, 3.3% from Arts and 30% from other fields. 100% of them were single. 65.5% of our participants thought women in Pakistan are treated differently than men of the same society. 89.1% thought mothers of sons get more respect in family matters and decision making than mothers of daughters while 10.9% thought they didn't. 85.2% of the participants believe women in Pakistan get treated differently if they become pregnant with daughters as compared to sons. When asked to specify what they meant by being treated differently, 16.97% said that society makes daughter bearing women feel bad, 34.85% thought society made them feel like they are bringing a burden into this world, 22.42% felt that the same level of health care wasn't provided to such women whereas 25.76% felt that women carrying daughters were treated better than those carrying sons. Only 3.6% of participants said that they would have a softer spot for a woman if she were having a boy, 7.6% said they would have a softer spot if she were having a girl, 24.8% said it wouldn't matter, 61.5% would care for any expecting woman while 2.4% would not care for any. When asked which parent can naturally decide the gender of a child 58% had misconceptions. 83.33% said men should not remarry a second or third time if they were having only daughters from their first marriage, 4.24% said men should be allowed to do so without prejudice and 12.42% refrained from sharing their point of view. When asked about their ideal family, 5.5% said only 1 child (daughter), 2.1% said only 1 child (son), 87% said both sons and daughters, 2.1% said only sons and 3.3% said they would ideally want only daughters.
   Conclusion: The youth of Pakistan are well aware of the social stigmas around them. Even our targeted audience that comprised people living in urban areas have grown up seeing women mistreated for bearing daughters, but our study shows that this generation has realized the fault of their ancestors and there is hope that these young adults would bring a positive change in the future.

AB  - The neuroscientific literature reveals that the brain changes over time, and the type of change (plasticity) that results is not random. While the brain exhibits certain evolutionary prejudices, individual plasticity and the kind of thinking enabled can be shaped by, and can shape, organizational priorities and operations. Organizational focus on structure and procedural efficiency is shown to foster fixed thinking, while cultivation of practiced varying skills encourages thinking agility. Agile thinking is shown to be essential for the development of organizational plasticity, the foundation for organizational agility. Finally, suggestions for incorporating variability in the workplace are offered.

AB  - Purpose While past studies have shown that corporate social responsibility (CSR) influences brand equity, loyalty and brand attitudes, research about CSR effects on the responsible and active dimensions of brand personality remains limited. This study aims to address this gap and examine how brands with different personality strength benefit from CSR communication, providing novel insights about CSR's branding payoffs to firms. Design/methodology/approach Three experiments were conducted. Study 1 tested if CSR communication influenced responsible and active brand personality dimensions compared to non-CSR communication. Study 2 examined how varying CSR spending allocations affect personality perceptions of weak and strong brands. Studies 1 and 2 measured responsible and active brand personalities before and after exposure to experimental manipulations, assessing immediate changes in brand personality. Study 3 replicated the results of Study 2 using fictitious brands whose initial brand personalities were manipulated as either weak or strong. Findings CSR communication has the potential to influence brands' responsible and active personalities compared to non-CSR communication. However, changes in brand personalities were contingent on CSR manipulations (smaller vs larger CSR spending) and initial brand strength. Brands that lacked strongly responsible and strong active personalities experienced an improvement in these perceptions after exposure to any CSR spending message. However, brands with strong responsible or strong active personalities experienced brand erosion after exposure to smaller CSR spending message or no improvement when the CSR message was aligned with the responsible and active conduct (e.g. mentioned larger CSR spending). Originality/value This study is the first to examine how CSR affects brand personality. By combining signalling and attitude change/congruity principle theories, it provides novel theoretical contributions to explain when CSR can improve, erode or exert no effect on the responsible and active brand personalities, providing insights for effective brand management.

AB  - Abortion is legal in South Africa, but over half of abortions remain unsafe there. Evidence suggests women who are (Black) African, of lower socioeconomic status, living with HIV, or residents of Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, or Limpopo provinces are disproportionately vulnerable to morbidity or mortality from unsafe abortion. Negative attitudes toward abortion have been documented in purposively sampled studies, yet it remains unclear what attitudes exist nationally or whether they differ across sociodemographic groups, with implications for inequities in service accessibility and health. In the current study, we analysed nationally representative data from 2013 to estimate the prevalence of negative abortion attitudes in South Africa and to identify racial, socioeconomic and geographic differences. More respondents felt abortion was always wrong' in the case of family poverty (75.4%) as compared to foetal anomaly (55%), and over half of respondents felt abortion was always wrong' in both cases (52.5%). Using binary logistic regression models, we found significantly higher odds of negative abortion attitudes among non-Xhosa African and Coloured respondents (compared to Xhosa respondents), those with primary education or less, and residents of Gauteng and Limpopo (compared to Western Cape). We contextualise and discuss these findings using a human rights-based approach to health.

AB  - The established method of understanding power in dentistry is based on the early Foucauldian discourse that dentistry enforces oral health discipline to the people on behalf of state power. This exhibits the hierarchy between dentists and patients, which clearly appears in clinical dentistry and effectively explains the responsibility of oral care assigned to patients. However, there presents no way to becoming free from the framework in the discourse as a resistance. Beyond the political aspect of the medico-sociological framework, this paper seeks a different way to understand power in dentistry through ???care of the self???, a late Foucauldian concept. First, based on the current discussion of the dentist-patient relationship (DPR), the paper examines two trends of clinical dental treatments in South Korea. The high prevalence of dental implant and orthognathic surgery indicates that traditional prejudices including ableism and pursuit of Western beauty still remain in South Korea albeit with the society overcoming paternalism in DPRs. These dental phenomena, however, contain excesses that cannot be explained only by traditional prejudice, and this paper attempts to interpret them as the pursuit of care of the self that appears in the dentist???s professionalism and the patient???s self-determination. In dentistry, care of the self can be introduced in the form of empowerment, which is implemented through the improvement of oral health literacy and shared decision-making. This paper argues that this interpretation helps surmount the traditional dyadic model of the DPR and revise the understanding of power in dentistry.

AB  - Over the past two decades, research examining the impact of self-reported experiences of discrimination on mental and physical health has increased dramatically. Studies have found consistent associations between exposure to discrimination and a wide range of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-diagnosed mental disorders as well as objective physical health outcomes. Associations are seen in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal studies and persist even after adjustment for confounding variables, including personality characteristics and other threats to validity. However, controversies remain, particularly around the best approach to measuring experiences of discrimination, the significance of racial/ethnic discrimination versus overall mistreatment, the need to account for "intersectionalities," and the importance of comprehensive assessments. These issues are discussed in detail, along with emerging areas of emphasis including cyber discrimination, anticipatory stress or vigilance around discrimination, and interventions with potential to reduce the negative effects of discrimination on health. We also discuss priorities for future research and implications for interventions and policy.

AB  - Intergroup contact has been demonstrated to reduce prejudice toward out-groups under the right conditions; however, real contact experiences are often difficult to arrange. Imagined contact may be an alternative. The current study randomly assigned participants to imagine or to have real contact with a person with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Results demonstrated that both imagined and real contact had positive effects on attitudes toward people with schizophrenia, as compared to the effects of imagined and real interactions with an age-matched control person. We discuss the strengths and limitations of imagined contact interventions with an eye toward future research.

AB  - Human dimensions are a critical part of large carnivore conservation. We investigated how the historical presence of wolves (Canis lupus) influences public attitudes toward the carnivore and its management in rural areas of Poland. From March 2016 to March 2017, we used a self-administered questionnaire to assess attitudes of rural residents (n = 292) and foresters (n = 325) in 6 regions where wolves have either been continuously present, or where they have recently recovered after a period of absence. While we found that attitudes toward wolves were generally neutral or positive, differences in attitudes did exist across target groups and regions with long and short histories of wolf presence. Foresters tended to have more negative attitudes toward wolves than did rural residents, and their attitudes remained stable across regions. In contrast, rural residents from the regions with an uninterrupted history of wolf presence, which also suffer greater rates of livestock depredation, tended to have less positive attitudes than did residents from regions where wolves have recovered more recently. Knowledge of wolves and wildlife value orientations were also positive predictors of attitudes. Negative attitudes among local residents and lower support for wolf conservation in response to wolf attacks on livestock could be a major obstacle for the continued recovery of wolves in Europe. Our results reinforce the need for proactive approaches, involving both information campaigns and actions to mitigate wolf predation on livestock, to maintain local support for wolf conservation.

AB  - Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) has engaged the interest of social and personality psychologists as it has deep implications for the psychology of intergroup conflict, particularly regarding factors such as prejudice and discrimination, as well as international conflict resolution. Nevertheless, few studies have directly assessed how SDO relates to intergroup reconciliation. This study (effective N = 819) measured participants' SDO along with their attitudes toward various governmental apologies to test the hypothesis that SDO is associated with unwillingness to issue intergroup apologies. The results showed that SDO was negatively correlated with supportive attitudes toward government-issued international apologies. This negative correlation remained intact after controlling for the effects of political conservatism and militarism.

AB  - A new method is presented to calibrate a low-quality, MEMS-based Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The proposed method consists of a novel dynamic test-setup with a combination of a single-axis rate-table and an attitude change mount, to overcome the limitations in the conventional calibrations with the static or quasi-static test-setups. A Fourier Transform method is deployed in the proposed scheme to estimate the error parameters including bias, scale factor, and misalignment of the accelerometers and rate gyros. Compared to the commonly used Recursive Least Squares method, the Fourier Transform method is more efficient in terms of the computation time, yet it resulted in comparable or improved results in the series of verification tests in this study.

AB  - Clinician attitudes toward patients are associated with variability in the quality of health care. Attitudes are typically considered difficult to change, and few interventions have attempted to do so. Negative attitudes toward adults with sickle cell disease have been identified as an important barrier to the receipt of appropriate pain management for this patient population.
   To test the effect of a video-intervention designed to improve clinician attitudes toward adults with sickle cell disease.
   An 8-minute video depicting a clinician expert and patients discussing challenges in seeking treatment for sickle cell pain.
   A randomized post-test only control group design was used to assess the impact of the intervention on the attitudes of 276 nurses and housestaff working at a large, urban, academic medical center.
   Attitudes toward adult sickle cell patients assessed using 5- and 6-point Likert-scale items. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify underlying attitudinal domains and develop scales. Examples of the negative and positive attitudes assessed include clinician estimates of the percentage of SCD patients that exaggerate pain (negative) or make clinicians glad they went into medicine (positive).
   Compared to the control group, the intervention group exhibited decreased negative attitudes (Difference in means = -8.9, 95%CI [-14.2, -3.6]; Cohen's d = 0.41), decreased endorsement of certain patient behaviors as "concern-raising" (Difference in means = -7.8, 95%CI [-13.1, -2.5]; Cohen's d = 0.36), and increased positive attitudes toward sickle cell patients (Difference in means = 6.6, 95% CI [0.6, 12.6]; Cohen's d = 0.27).
   Our results suggest that the attitudes of clinicians toward sickle cell patients may be improved through a short and relatively easy to implement intervention. Whether the attitudinal differences associated with our intervention are sustainable or are linked to clinical outcomes remains to be seen.

AB  - Background: Scaling up HIV prevention for people who inject drugs (PWID) using opioid agonist therapies (OAT) in Ukraine has been restricted by individual and structural factors. Extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), however, provides new opportunities for treating opioid use disorders (OUDs) in this region, where both HIV incidence and mortality continue to increase.
   Methods: Survey results from 1613 randomly selected PWID from 5 regions in Ukraine who were currently, previously or never on OAT were analyzed for their preference of pharmacological therapies for treating OUDs. For those preferring XR-NTX, independent correlates of their willingness to initiate XR-NTX were examined.
   Results: Among the 1613 PWID, 449 (27.8%) were interested in initiating XR-NTX. Independent correlates associated with interest in XR-NTX included: being from Mykolaiv (AOR = 3.7, 95% CI = 2.3-6.1) or Dnipro (AOR = 1.8, 95% CI = 1.1-2.9); never having been on OAT (AOR = 3.4, 95% CI = 2.1-5.4); shorter-term injectors (AOR = 0.9, 95% CI 0.9-0.98); and inversely for both positive (AOR = 0.8, CI = 0.8-0.9), and negative attitudes toward OAT (AOR = 1.3, CI = 1.2-1.4), respectively.
   Conclusions: In the context of Eastern Europe and Central Asia where HIV is concentrated in PWID and where HIV prevention with OAT is under-scaled, new options for treating OUDs are urgently needed.
   Findings: here suggest that XR-NTX could become an option for addiction treatment and HIV prevention especially for PWID who have shorter duration of injection and who harbor negative attitudes to OAT. Decision aids that inform patient preferences with accurate information about the various treatment options are likely to guide patients toward better, patient-centered treatments and improve treatment entry and retention.

This paper draws particular attention to the interpersonal and cultural domains of power. We examine how hair prejudice has endured within families and in the Turkish Cypriot community by focusing on space and time differences. We compare the experiences of five women who were born in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1980s. We aim to connect the history of slavery and colonialism to show how the unique experiences of Black women in Cyprus are also tied to global racism.

AB  - To diversify the creative thinking of preschool education students and improve their ability to innovate and start a business, a survey of preschool education students under entrepreneurial psychology theory was conducted in this research. Based on the theoretical foundation of entrepreneurial psychology, this article analyzed the entrepreneurial psychological quality and psychological education of college students. By investigating preschool education students in a certain college in Sichuan as the research object, the author explored the current entrepreneurial intentions of college students and their entrepreneurial psychological problems. In response to the current entrepreneurial situation of college graduates, relevant countermeasures were proposed from the perspective of the school to support their entrepreneurial psychology. Among the 205 preschool education college students, the students were more willing to give full play to their professional expertise in terms of employment intentions. At the same time, there were still situations in which students were dissatisfied with the prospects of preschool education career development and wanted to achieve the value of life through other approaches. Most students in preschool education had a wait-and-see attitude toward entrepreneurship. Only 35% of students had a clear intention to start a business and made their plans for entrepreneurship. More than 90% of students held that they had developed inadequate entrepreneurial ability, and 80% of students believed that they lacked the required professional knowledge. These two factors constitute the main reasons for students' negative attitudes toward entrepreneurship. Nevertheless, colleges may stimulate the potential of students' self-development through the improvement of entrepreneurial psychological education courses, the construction of psychological consultation institutions on campus, and the establishment of interactive platforms for entrepreneurship. In this way, students' entrepreneurial psychology can be cultivated in an all-round way. Therefore, to deal with the weak overall entrepreneurial consciousness of college students, the colleges should cultivate entrepreneurial innovative talents by strengthening the psychological education of entrepreneurship for students, and help college students achieve entrepreneurial success.

AB  - This longitudinal study among ethnic migrants from Russia to Finland (N?=?127) examined the relationships between anticipated and perceived discrimination, ethnic and national identities, and outgroup attitudes towards the national majority group. The study included one pre-migration and two post-migration assessments. First, associations between the variables studied were tested using a conventional autoregressive sample-level modelling approach. Second, individual trajectories and the associations between the individual-level changes in the variables included in the models were tested. Although there were no sample-level effects over time, there were significant relationships between changes in discrimination and changes in identification and outgroup attitudes at the individual level. The results indicated that changes in perceived discrimination were not reflected in increased ethnic identification. However, participants who perceived higher levels of discrimination after migration than they anticipated before migration were, in the post-migration stage, more likely to disidentify from and to increasingly show negative attitudes towards the national majority group. The study complements previous research by examining the identity and attitudinal reactions to perceived ethnic discrimination starting from the pre-migration stage and highlights the value of incorporating both group and individual perspectives to the research on perceived discrimination.

TI  - Quebec v A and Taypotat: Unpacking the Supreme Court's Latest Decisions on Section 15 of the Charter
T2  - OSGOODE HALL LAW JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - SUBSTANTIVE EQUALITY
KW  - DISCRIMINATION
AB  - The Supreme Court of Canada's articulation for the test for discrimination under section 15 of the Charter has undergone numerous permutations over the past twenty-five years. The Supreme Court introduced its latest round of changes in its 2013 decision in Quebec (Attorney General) v A and its 2015 decision in Kahkewistahaw First Nation v Taypotat. Together, these two decisions clarified that the appropriate approach to section 15 was not one focused strictly on stereotype and prejudice, but rather on all contextual factors that may inform whether an impugned law violates the norm of substantive equality. T T his paper critically analyzes the impact of Quebec v A and Taypotat by examining how courts across the country have articulated the doctrinal messages of these two decisions, and applied them in practice. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses are employed. Under the quantitative approach, the likelihood of mounting a successful s. 15 challenge under the new framework set by Quebec v Aand Taypotat as compared to the prior test from Kapp and Withler is considered. Under the qualitative approach, a number of key questions are asked, including: what the meaning of theQuebec v A and Taypotat touchstone for discrimination - "arbitrary disadvantage" - is; what role stereotype and prejudice continue to play as indicia of discrimination; and what other contextual factors courts will examine in assessing whether discrimination has occured. The author concludes that although the approach under Quebec v A and Taypotat requires some fine-tuning, overall it is a positive move toward a less formalistic, less onerous standard for equality claimants that better reflects section 15's focus on substantive equality.

AB  - Introduction Stigma towards alcohol use disorders is prevalent in India and can lead to social exclusion and hamper treatment access and outcomes. Family members of individuals with dependent drinking are often their primary caregivers and play a key role in decisions around help-seeking, treatment and recovery. The nature and role of stigma in caregiving, and the consequent burden on family caregivers of those with dependent drinking, has not been qualitatively studied in India. Methods We conducted in-depth interviews with: (i) men with probable alcohol dependence (n = 11); (ii) family caregivers (n = 12); and (iii) doctors with experience of treating alcohol dependence (n = 13) in community settings in Goa. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Results Two primary themes were identified from the data: (i) stigma in the form of ignorance, prejudice and discrimination; and (ii) the impact of this stigma on caregiving decisions and the mental health of caregivers. Discussion and Conclusions We found that stigma functioned as a barrier to a proper course of treatment and care, as well as a detrimental factor for caregiver's mental health and caregiving decision-making. Stigma towards dependent drinking in the forms of ignorance, prejudice and discrimination is prevalent within homes, workplaces and health systems and might exacerbate the caregiving burden among female family caregivers. Policies, educational programs and campaigns aimed at preventing stigma in these forms would likely enable access to more inclusive and appropriate health services, benefit the health of family caregivers and improve the treatment outcomes of drinkers.

AB  - Background: The rates of people being overweight and obese are recognised as global public health concerns. Negative attitudes towards obese and overweight people are prevalent among health care professionals. Nurses and nursing students have a significant role in health promotion of people who are obese or overweight and can assist people in achieving healthy lifestyles. However, evidence suggests that nurses and nursing students fail to engage in healthy lifestyles themselves and display negative attitudes towards obese and overweight people. Such negative behaviours put nurses and nursing students in a precarious position when advising overweight and obese people to adopt healthy lifestyles.
   Objectives: This study aimed to ascertain nursing students' obesity risk knowledge, their attitudes towards obese and overweight people, and their own health promoting lifestyle behaviours.
   Design: A descriptive correlational study was used.
   Setting: One university in the United Kingdom.
   Participants: A total of 210 nursing students enrolled on a university degree course in Adult or Mental Health Nursing in years 1, 2 and 3.
   Methods: Data were collected using three valid and reliable questionnaires: Obesity Risk Knowledge Scale, Attitudes Towards Obese Persons Scale and the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile. Dependent variables were correlated with independent variables on field of study, year of study, and gender.
   Results: Results showed that nursing students engage in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours and fail to meet government recommended levels for physical activity. Nursing students had poor knowledge on obesity risk and displayed neutral attitudes towards overweight and obese people.
   Conclusions: Educational providers of nursing courses should embrace the need for nursing students to interrogate and enhance their own healthy lifestyle behaviours as an integral component of the pre-registration education course. This may strengthen the credibility and suitability of nursing students as future nurses in health promoting activities of patients who are overweight and obese.

TI  - REPLY OR PERISH: THE FEDERAL RULE 83(A)(1) PROBLEM WITH LOCAL RULES REQUIRING RESPONSES TO 12(B)(6) MOTIONS
T2  - FORDHAM LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - The federal courts of appeals are divided over whether district courts have the legal authority to grant Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss solely for lack of reply pursuant to local rules requiring responses to motions. Seven circuits hold that district courts must always consider the merits of an unopposed Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. However, the First and D.C. Circuits allow district courts to dismiss Rule 12(b)(6) motions for lack of response pursuant to local rules in certain circumstances. The majority view is that the use of these local rules in the First and D.C. Circuits effectively shifts the Rule 12(b)(6) movants ' burden of proof onto the nonmovant and thus violates Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 83(a)(1)'s requirement of consistency between federal and local rules.
   This Note examines this split and the federal and local rules issues underlying the circuits' diverging holdings. This Note then proposes a bifurcated solution, implemented through either the adoption of a model local rule or the interpretation of existing local rules as implicitly adopting the solution. First, district courts may grant Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss solely for lack of response pursuant to a local rule only when dismissed without prejudice. However, when dismissing with prejudice, courts must conduct an analysis of the underlying merits. This solution aims to bring these local rules into compliance with Rule 83(a)(1) and give litigants and courts alike uniform expectations when parties fail to respond to Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss.

AB  - Introduction: One of the main problems of patients with eating disorders is their body dissatisfaction. Although these individuals usually are not satisfied with their bodies there are not many investigations that focus on how these patients see people with real weight problems. For this reason, in this study it is analyzed how women with eating disorders see obese people.
   Methods: A total of 104 participants (35 with anorexia nervosa, 28 with bulimia nervosa, 16 with eating disorder not otherwise specified and 25 controls) were selected to conduct the study. To measure anti-fat attitudes the Spanish version of the Antifat Attitudes Questionnaire was used. To measure if participants had body dissatisfaction it was used the Spanish versions of the Body Shape Questionnaire. Finally, anthropometric measures (height and weight) were taken in order to calculate the BMI (kg/m(2)), as well as some socio-demographic information.
   Results: It was found that participants with bulimia nervosa showed scores higher on antifat attitudes than the rest of the participants. Additionally, it was found that this result was influenced by the body dissatisfaction of the participants.
   Discussion: These results suggest that negative attitudes toward obese people may influence an individual's body image. One way of maintaining a positive body image (especially, the subjective dimension, body satisfaction) is to compare oneself with those perceived as physically inferior (people with weight problems), a strategy that is especially relevant when the mass media insists in depict extreme thin women.

AB  - Evidence that local exposure to Chinese import competition favors right-wing parties has often been attributed to the success of economic nationalism. We test an alternative account. Trade shocks catalyze cultural backlash, which drives support for conservative candidates, as they compete electorally by targeting out-groups. We assess this hypothesis in the 2008-2016 US presidential elections. Using individual-level survey data, we provide evidence that Chinese import shocks drive negative attitudes towards minorities and positive feelings towards in-groups. Opinions about free trade and redistribution are not affected. Results indicate that this rightward shift is primarily driven by non-Hispanic white and male respondents. These findings point to the role played by trade-induced cultural backlash in shaping political outcomes in the US.

We examined stigmatizing attributions concerning a GTS patient in an online study with participants randomly assigned to one of two video clip conditions: the experimental group saw to a person with Tourette syndrome; the control group watched a nature scenic footage. Results revealed that participants in the experimental condition exhibited higher scores on a stigma questionnaire. Clinicians should be aware that GTS patients are prone to being stigmatized by general public.

AB  - Natural selection favoured survival of individuals who were able to avoid disease. The behavioural immune system is activated especially when our sensory system comes into contact with disease-connoting cues and/or when these cues resemble disease threat. We investigated whether or not perception of modern risky technologies, risky behaviour, expected reproductive goals and food neophobia are associated with the behavioural immune system related to specific attitudes toward genetically modified (GM) products. We found that respondents who felt themselves more vulnerable to infectious diseases had significantly more negative attitudes toward GM products. Females had less positive attitudes toward GM products, but engaging in risky behaviours, the expected reproductive goals of females and food neophobia did not predict attitudes toward GM products. Our results suggest that evolved psychological mechanisms primarily designed to protect us against pathogen threat are activated by modern technologies possessing potential health risks.

AB  - The Finnish far-right music scene has grown and become more ideological during the past ten years. Today there are more Rock Against Communism (RAC) bands whose messages are more political and ideological than those of old-school bands. One peculiarity of the Finnish white power music scene is that bands representing different genres, such as RAC, black metal and power electronics, often perform at the same events. Ideas and forms of expression spread between genres and, as this case analysis of the lyrics of the Finnish RAC band Vapaudenristi shows, genre crossing may result in novel but also paradoxical ideological combinations. In order to contextualize the reading of RAC lyrics, Kotonen's article traces changes in Finnish white power music culture, and highlights the most important ideological sources of inspiration, among them the growing interest in the writings of Julius Evola.

AB  - Teachers' attitudes towards disabled students seem to define the extent to which teaching practices are inclusive. Aiming to explore Cyprus secondary education teachers' attitudes and practice, and the consequent implications for the future of disabled students and inclusive education, we conducted mixed methods research. Our research typology was sequential and integrated. First, we conducted a survey, during which we received 536 questionnaires from our randomly selected stratified sample of Cyprus secondary education teachers. The survey was followed by interviews with 21 Greek Philology teachers that enriched the findings from the quantitative phase. Data analysis revealed that even though Cyprus secondary education teachers have a rather positive attitude towards disabled students, they have low expectations from them and do not employ inclusive teaching practice. In addition, they tend to categorise students based on abstract notions about ability. Stereotypes and prejudice are more evident regarding students with cognitive disabilities. Despite the observed disabling practices, participants postulated that there is hope to implement inclusive education, if teachers are trained for inclusion and thereby begin to see the person and not the disability.

AB  - Cancer pain presents in approximately 66% of patients in advanced stages. Although several guidelines and pharmacological options are available for cancer pain management (CPM), assessment and treatment of cancer pain remain inadequate globally, particularly in developing countries. Lack of knowledge and negative attitudes towards CPM among healthcare professionals (HCPs) are important barriers to CPM. This survey aimed to evaluate nurses' and physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and potential barriers regarding CPM in Libya. This cross-sectional survey involved a convenience sample of 152 oncology nurses and physicians working in six oncology settings in Libya. The response rate was 76%. The Barriers Questionnaire II (BQ-II) was used for data collection (higher scores signify greater attitudinal barriers and poorer knowledge). Data analysis was carried out using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 26 software. An independent t-test (unadjusted estimate) indicated that Libyan nurses showed higher mean barrier scores (mean = 3.8, SD = 0.7) to CPM than physicians (mean = 2.9, SD = 0.8), p < 0.001. The six most common differences in attitudinal barriers between nurses and physicians were "opioid side effects," "poor tolerance," "strong patient endures pain," "distract the physician," "drug addiction," and "opioids impair immune function,"p < 0.001. Multiple regression results (adjusted estimate) indicated that nurses had more barrier scores to CPM than physicians (B = - 0.530, p < 0.05), and participants with higher educational levels were associated with lower barrier scores to CPM (B = - 0.641, p < 0.05). Our results suggest that Libyan oncology HCPs hold perceived barriers, lack of knowledge, and negative attitudes towards CPM. Professional education and training in CPM, addressing phobia and myths on opioid usage, and the benefits and complications of using opioids are likely to result in reduced barriers to CPM in Libya.

AB  - News media helps individuals think about the impacts of hosting the Olympic Games, enabling them to clarify or construct their own opinions toward an Olympic bid. This study aims to unveil the rationale underlying such media influence with the help of agenda setting theory. An experimental study was conducted in both China with 505 respondents and the US with 449 respondents in which media content was manipulated and framed as either positive or negative. The result confirmed the causal relationship between media content and resident attitude change. Although the moderating role of nation on media effect was not supported, it was found that the more initial interest the individual had in the Olympic Games, the more evident the media effect was.

AB  - This study investigates the physiological consequences of derogation. In the face of an ingroup threat, an opportunity to derogate the outgroup is associated with increases in salivary cortisol, a stress biomarker. These findings support the intergroup anxiety model, which suggests that following an anxiety-inducing threatening experience, outgroup evaluations can amplify emotional reactions and stress. In this study, we investigated whether threatened participants who derogated would show higher cortisol levels. Canadian undergraduates (N = 169) read either a threatening or favourable passage about Canadians. They then engaged in either a linguistic intergroup bias (LIB) or control task. Salivary samples were collected prethreat, postthreat, and posttask. The results suggest that ingroup threat was associated with increases in cortisol levels. Threatened participants who displayed LIB showed higher cortisol levels than those who were threatened and did not show LIB. These findings illustrate the importance of incorporating a neuroscientific approach.

Focusing on the fantasy saga of The Hunger Games, we examined the effects of negative vicarious contact on collective action across two studies. Specifically, we tested whether reading about fantasy characters living in a postapocalyptic conflictual society with large social disparities between advantaged and disadvantaged groups leads advantaged group members to display greater willingness to engage in collective action on behalf of the disadvantaged group. Results from Study 1 (correlational survey in the United Kingdom and United States) and Study 2 (experimental intervention in Italy) revealed that reading The Hunger Games is indirectly associated with greater collective action intentions via increased anger toward injustice. In both studies social dominance orientation (SDO) acted as a moderator, but in opposite directions: mediation was significant for low-SDOs in Study 1, and for high-SDOs in Study 2. Results are discussed in relation to the importance of media vicarious contact via book reading for social change, and to the need to identify the contextual conditions allowing to anticipate the specific moderation pattern that is more likely to emerge.

AB  - This article expands the discourse of the impact of the passage of the Civil Rights Act (CRA) of 1964 to sexual orientation minorities (SOM).
   We first discuss the challenges faced by SOM in the workplace. We then present a model adapted from Edelman's "Handbook of employment discrimination research (pp. 337-352). Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Springer (2005)" theory of endogeneity of law to discuss the impact that such leaders and their supportive organizational SOM policies can have on the passage of nationwide SOM legislation. Finally, we discuss how organizational leaders' beliefs and actions can play a major role in affecting organizational SOM policies.
   We argue that the presence of organizational protective policies can facilitate the passage of federal SOM legislation by establishing and legitimizing social norms. We also highlight how beliefs about religion, morality, controllability, and occupational stereotypes contribute to prejudice and lack of support for SOM-protective organizational policies.
   We discuss the importance that organizational SOM policies have on larger societal legislative issues, and outline how specific individual-level beliefs can impact organizational-level support for SOM.
   We take a novel approach by focusing on what organizational leaders can do to enact SOM policies that may further influence protective laws. We also draw upon neo-institutional theory to show specifically how organizations can affect legislation; a topic often ignored in organizational psychology.

AB  - Poor outcomes for breast cancer in Ghana have been attributed to late presentation of symptoms at biomedical facilities. This study explored factors accounting for delays in initiation of breast cancer treatment at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra. Focus group discussions were conducted with 20 women with breast cancer. A theory-driven thematic analysis identified three multilevel factors influencing treatment seeking delays: (1) patient (e.g. misinterpretation of symptoms, fear), (2) healthcare provider (e.g. negative attitudes) and (3) health systems (e.g. shortage of medicines). Addressing treatment delays will require multilevel interventions, including culturally congruent education, psychosocial counselling/support and strengthening health systems.

AB  - The authors conducted a content analysis of 1,159 images of male models published on high-traffic gay male-oriented blogs. They focused on a range of body image-related variables, as well as the race of models. Results showed that most models were White and, almost uniformly, models had low levels of body fat. Models' level of muscularity varied significantly by race: Black models had the highest levels of muscularity, Asian models had the lowest levels of muscularity, and White and Latino models had moderate levels of muscularity. Drawing on existing research about race and body image, implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that external threats, such as financial crises and natural disasters, might fuel negative attitudes, emotions, and behaviors towards outgroup members. However, it is unclear what types of outgroups are likely to be targeted when an external threat is taking its toll. In this study, we examine two types of outgroups that might be at risk of becoming victims of intergroup hostility. The first is the "ultimate scapegoat" outgroup which has a long history of negative relations with the ingroup. The second is the "context-dependent" outgroup which is viewed as an outgroup only in certain contexts. We utilized the COVID-19 crisis and the highly diverse social makeup of Israeli society to explore the extent to which each type of outgroup would be targeted. Results from our study (N = 664), conducted during the first peak of COVID-19 in Israel, show that higher levels of exposure to COVID-19 predicted lower willingness to aid outgroups and that outgroup dehumanization mediated this association. However, this held true only when the target outgroup was a context-dependent outgroup. When the target group was the ultimate scapegoat, exposure to COVID-19 did not predict ingroup willingness to aid them. Our findings contribute to our theoretical and practical knowledge on how intergroup hostility proliferates during external threats and, as such, are valuable to scholars, practitioners, and policymakers working to reduce intergroup tensions during large-scale crises.

AB  - Stigma towards people with substance use disorders is pervasive and imbedded in our US culture. Prejudicial attitudes that are part of a health care practitioner's value system are a barrier to people accessing health care and substance use treatment. This study aimed to reduce stigmatizing attitudes of graduate health care professional students by implementing an innovative curriculum combining multiple teaching methods.
   Physician assistant students received a 3-h educational intervention that consisted of lecture and discussion sessions, direct interaction with a recovering substance user, viewing a film portrayal of addiction and addiction treatment, and written self-reflection. Changes in student attitudes were measured using a subscale of the Attitudes to Mental Illness Questionnaire (AMIQ) instrument and analysis of coded written reflections. A follow-up focus group resulted in additional qualitative insight into attitudes.
   Post-intervention scores for the "heroin" AMIQ vignette significantly improved compared to pre-test scores (p < 0.007), but the effect was small and the mean post-test scores still reflected very negative attitudes. Students' neutral attitude towards alcohol use did not change as a result of the intervention. Written reflections demonstrated that this sample of students continued to harbor stigma towards people with substance use following the intervention. Focus group data suggested students believed that stigma beliefs about substance use were common among health care professionals, though they believed that their own level and quality of care would not be influenced by these beliefs.
   The persistence of negative attitudes following this and others' educational interventions suggests the need for a new approach to changing health care professionals' stigma towards substance users.

AB  - Background:Chronic pain (CP) is a common symptom in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. This study aimed to examine its prevalence, severity, clinical associations, and impact on psychological well-being and to identify patient factors that independently predict the presence of severe/disabling pain.Methods:One hundred and twenty consecutive patients with inflammatory bowel disease attending a hospital-based clinic provided information through questionnaires on quality of life, mood disturbance, and functional gut symptoms. Those who had CP (pain occurring every day for 3 months within the past 6 months) provided additional information on the pain's intensity and associated disability and management and coping strategies.Results:Forty-six patients (38%) had CP, most commonly in the abdomen (91%), and they had higher disease activity, reduced quality of life, and more depression and anxiety and took more paracetamol and opiates than those without. These indices were worse in the subgroup of 23 with moderate-severe pain/disability. Criteria for irritable bowel syndrome were met in 70% of those with pain irrespective of its severity. Multivariate analysis identified 4 independent associations with moderate-severe pain/disability: active disease (odds ratio, 49 [95% confidence intervals, 1.6-1455]), catastrophizing tendency (35 [3-228]), medication belief score (0.05 [0.005-0.55], and depression score (1.80 [1.02-3.17]).Conclusions:CP has major effects on quality of life and functional and social outcomes. Active disease and maladaptive coping strategies and negative attitudes and beliefs toward symptoms are independently associated with more severe pain. Management strategies should move the focus away from analgesic dependence toward psychosocial intervention and nonpharmacologic therapy.

AB  - This article considers the beginnings of the British actor Roddy McDowall's career as a child star in Hollywood. Following his relocation to the United States in October 1940 and signing a contract with Twentieth Century-Fox, McDowall quickly became one of Hollywood's most popular juvenile actors. For the duration of the Second World War, McDowall's star image was indissoluble from his status as a war guest: he was 'a British evacuee star'. McDowall thus became an unofficial ambassador for the British nation, much like his fellow evacuees, who were widely recognised for their work improving Anglo-American relations. In the management of McDowall's image, and in his screen performances, there is a discernible effort to substantiate certain attitudes about the character and attributes of the British nation but also to challenge certain prejudices about English sissy boys. McDowall's star text was carefully managed so that the image of the actor presented by the media and the fictional characters he played on screen congealed in a productive way to inspire among American audiences specific sentiments about the British and America's relationship with the British nation during wartime. Analysing the representation of McDowall in American film magazines during the early 1940s, as well as his performances in three war-themed productions - Confirm or Deny (1941), On the Sunny Side (1942) and The White Cliffs of Dover (1944) - I explore the ways McDowall's star text functioned in its geopolitical and bio-political contexts.

AB  - Two studies test the assumption that the tendency to preferentially communicate stereotype-consistent information about individuals can be explained in terms of communicational grounding. In Study 1, this bias was stronger when communicators told a story to a friend than to a stranger. In Study 2, dyads either discussed a stereotype about a novel group (discussion condition) or merely thought individually about this stereotype (thinking condition). Participants then reproduced a story involving a group member performing both stereotype-consistent and inconsistent behaviors to one of two audiences. One member addressed the other dyad member whereas the latter wrote the story for an unknown audience. Participants in the discussion condition were more likely to emphasize stereotype-consistent behaviors when addressing the other dyad member (with whom they had grounded the stereotype) than an unknown audience. These findings suggest that stereotype-consistent communication is more likely when stereotypes are part of the personal common ground.

AB  - Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women in India; however, participation in prevention and screening is low and the reasons for this are not well understood. In a cross-sectional survey in August 2008, 202 healthy women in Karnataka, India completed a questionnaire regarding knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer. Factors associated with vaccination and Papanicolau (Pap) smear screening acceptance were explored. Thirty-six percent of women had heard of HPV while 15 % had heard of cervical cancer. Five percent of women reported ever having a Pap smear, and 4 % of women felt at risk of HPV infection. Forty-six percent of women were accepting of vaccination, but fewer (21 %) were willing to have a Pap smear. Overall, knowledge related to HPV and cervical cancer topics was low. Women with negative attitudes toward HPV infection were 5.3 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 2.8-10) times more likely to accept vaccination but were not significantly more likely to accept Pap smear (odds ratio 1.5, 95 % CI 0.7-3.0). Cost and a low level of perceived risk were the most frequent factors cited as potential barriers. Improving awareness of HPV and cervical cancer through health care providers in addition to increasing access to vaccination and screening through government-sponsored programs may be feasible and effective methods to reduce cervical cancer burden in India.

AB  - Using mixed design analysis of variance (ANOVA), this paper investigates the effects of a subtle simulated increase in adiposity on women's employment chances in the service sector. Employing a unique simulation of altering individuals' BMIs and the literature on "aesthetic labour", the study suggests that, especially for women, being heavier, but still within a healthy BMI, deleteriously impacts on hireability ratings. The paper explores the gendered dimension of this prejudice by asking whether female employees at the upper end of a healthy BMI range are likely to be viewed more negatively than their overtly overweight male counterparts. The paper concludes by considering the implications of these findings.

AB  - The social adoption of change is usually hard because in reality, forces opposing the social adoption of change manifest. This situation of organizational conflict corresponds to the case where two competing groups of influential agents ("promoters" versus "adversaries" of change) operate concurrently within the same organizational network. We model and explore the co-evolution of interpersonal ties and attitudes in the presence of conflict, taking into account explicitly the microscopic "agent-to-agent" interactions. In this perspective, we propose a new ties-attitudes co-evolution model where the diffusion of attitudes depends on the weights and the evolution of weights is formulated as a "learning mechanism" (weight updates depend on the previous values of both weights and attitudes). As a result, the co-evolution is intrinsic/endogenous. We simulate representative scenarios of conflict in 4 real organizational networks. In order to formulate structural balance in directed networks, we extended Heider's definition of balance considering directed triangles. The evolution of balance involves two stages: first, negative links pop up disorderly and destroy balance, but after some time, as new negative links are formed, a "new" balance is re-established. This "new" balance is emerging concurrently with the polarization of attitudes or domination of one attitude. Moreover, same-minded agents are positively linked and different-minded agents are negatively-linked. This macroscopic self-organization of the system is due only to agent-to-agent interactions, involving feedbacks on weight updates at the local microscopic level.

AB  - Anti-transgender policies and state legislative initiatives that focus on school bathroom use and hormone use have emerged in recent years. These policies are generally written by and voted on by cisgender people, and as such, it is crucial to understand influences on nonaffirming attitudes toward policies that can impact trans youth. The present study aimed to extend research on transphobic attitudes in general to attitudes toward policies that impact youth undergoing transition. Latent variable covariances and structural equation modeling were used to test the relations between transphobia, genderism, homophobia, need for closure, sexual orientation, social dominance orientation, attitudes toward sexual minorities, beliefs about gender roles, aggression, religious fundamentalism, and contact with sexual and gender minority individuals, as they are related to attitudes toward hormone use and bathroom use for trans youth. Analyses of data from a sample of 248 cisgender adults indicated that genderism and transphobia was associated with attitudes toward gender-affirming hormone use and bathroom use for trans youth; need for closure was associated with gender-affirming attitudes toward bathroom use, but was not associated with hormone use. Sexual orientation was linked to attitudes toward gender-affirming policies, such that nonheterosexual participants had more affirming attitudes toward trans youths' bathroom use, but not hormone use. Implications for future research, advocacy efforts to promote rights for trans youth, and clinical work with trans youth and/or parents/guardians of trans youth are discussed.
   Public Significance Statement This study advances the understanding of factors related to supporting affirming social and medical transition for transgender youth. It demonstrates the role of transphobia and the need for closure as they relate to nonaffirming attitudes.

AB  - Explicit negative attitudes toward obese individuals are well documented and seem to modulate the activity of perceptual areas, such as the Extrastriate Body Area (EBA) in the lateral occipito-temporal cortex, which is critical for body-shape perception. Nevertheless, it is still unclear whether EBA serves a role in implicit weight stereotypical bias, thus reflecting stereotypical trait attribution on the basis of perceptual cues. Here, we used an Implicit Association Test (IAT) to investigate whether applying transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over bilateral extrastriate visual cortex reduces pre-existing implicit weight stereotypical associations (i.e. "Bad" with Fat and "Good" with Slim, valence-IAT). Furthermore, an esthetic-IAT, which focused on body-concepts related to esthetic dimensions (i.e. "Ugly" and "Beauty"), was developed as a control condition. Anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS (2 mA, 10 min) over the right and left lateral occipito-temporal (extrastriate visual) cortex was administered to 13 female and 12 male participants, before performing the IATs. Results showed that cathodal stimulation over the left extrastriate visual cortex reduced weight-bias for the evaluative dimensions (Bad vs. Good) as compared to sham stimulation over the same hemisphere. Furthermore, the effect was specific for the polarity and hemisphere of stimulation. Importantly, tDCS affected the responses only in male participants, who presented a reliable weight-bias during sham condition, but not in female participants, who did not show reliable weight-bias at sham condition. The present results suggest that negative attitudes toward obese individuals may reflect neural signals from the extrastriate visual cortex. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant concern for some lesbian households with children. Yet we know of only one study that has examined lesbian mothers' experiences with IPV. In the current study we analyzed the counseling experiences of participants in our prior study. Interviews with 24 lesbian mothers (12 Black, 9 White, and 3 Latina) 23 to 54 years of age (M = 39.5) were coded using thematic analysis. Overall, lesbian mothers experiencing IPV did seek help from counselors (n = 15, 63%), typically after reaching a breaking point. Counselors were most helpful when addressing the abuse and promoting self-empowerment, and least helpful when victim-blaming or ignoring the abuse and/or the same-sex relationship. Lesbian mothers' perceptions that mental health professionals were sometimes ineffective have implications for provider training. In order to work effectively with this population, providers should attempt to eliminate or correct personal biases or prejudices with self-exploration and education. By becoming more aware and knowledgeable of the nuances, struggles, and strengths of the lesbian community, providers can gain competency in providing therapeutic services to such clients. Mental health professionals can also adopt an advocacy stance to assist in spreading cultural awareness to others and support policy or institutional changes to include same-sex IPV. Competencies can be assessed through future studies that identify the knowledge and skills gap among mental health professionals who frequently work with the lesbian population.

AB  - This paper builds new theory and provides supporting evidence to contain the Not-Invented-Here Syndrome (NIHS) - a persistent decision-making error arising from an attitude-based bias against external knowledge. Conceptually, we draw on the 4i framework of organizational learning to develop a novel process perspective on NIHS. This allows us not only to unpack how and where NIHS impedes organizational learning, but also to identify the key requirements for effective NIHS countermeasures. Importantly, countermeasures fall into two categories: those that seek to change the negative attitude directly (direct NIHS countermeasures) and those that seek to attenuate the behavioral impact of negative attitudes without addressing the attitudes as such (indirect NIHS countermeasures). While the evidence base on direct NIHS countermeasures has grown over the last decade, indirect NIHS countermeasures have received little research attention. To address this gap, we adopt a mixed methods research design composed of two complementary empirical studies - the first qualitative and the second quantitative. Study 1 explores the prevalence of distinct NIHS countermeasures in collaborative R&D practice. Based on 32 interviews and three focus group meetings with R&D employees, we find that a broad array of primarily direct NIHS countermeasures is employed in R&D practice. Study 2 addresses the scarcity of scholarly and managerial insights on indirect NIHS countermeasures by testing the effectiveness of perspective taking as a debiasing technique to contain negative attitudes at the level of the individual. Based on quantitative survey data from 565 global R&D projects, it provides empirical evidence not only for the prevalence and negative effects of NIHS on project success as mediated by external knowledge absorption, but also for the effectiveness of perspective taking as an exemplary indirect NIHS countermeasure.

AB  - Negative attitudes about and behaviours towards women with disability are harmful and give shape to an identity that is imposed by others. Our research sought to challenge these attitudes and behaviours through self-portraits, narratives and photovoice methodology. Six women with disability participated in our feminist photovoice project on identity, producing data that we interrogated through thematic analysis. Our findings indicate that remarks and actions directed at women with disability can be intrusive, judgmental and exclusionary. They also give shape to an identity defined or imposed by others. However, to (re)define the self and claim space, these six women engaged in the 'work of disability' by 1) articulating identity, 2) challenging expectations and disabling attitudes and 3) explaining disability. By countering pervasive and disabling attitudes with photographic self-portraits and accompanying stories, these six women of diverse shapes, sizes, and abilities artfully lead us on a pathway to a more inclusive society. Points of interest In our study, six Australian women with physical disability photographed aspects of themselves, focusing on their strengths and issues affecting them. Their photographs inspired group discussions and video interviews, offering thought-provoking ideas of what it is like to be a woman with disability today in Australia. The women described their frequent experiences of being stereotyped and excluded through remarks, actions and the environment they negotiate every day. Through photographs, words, actions and thoughts they challenged stereotyping and negative attitudes to define who they are and how they want to be viewed. Often, they actively worked to educate others about disability to claim their rightful place in our communities.

AB  - Does the consumption of ideologically congruent news on social media exacerbate polarization? I estimate the effects of social media news exposure by conducting a large field experiment randomly offering participants subscriptions to conservative or liberal news outlets on Facebook. I collect data on the causal chain of media effects: subscriptions to outlets, exposure to news on Facebook, visits to online news sites, and sharing of posts, as well as changes in political opinions and attitudes. Four main findings emerge. First, random variation in exposure to news on social media substantially affects the slant of news sites that individuals visit. Second, exposure to counter-attitudinal news decreases negative attitudes toward the opposing political party. Third, in contrast to the effect on attitudes, I find no evidence that the political leanings of news outlets affect political opinions. Fourth, Facebook's algorithm is less likely to supply individuals with posts from -counter-attitudinal outlets, conditional on individuals subscribing to them. Together, the results suggest that social media algorithms may limit exposure to -counter-attitudinal news and thus increase polarization.

AB  - How do messages from political elites interact with individual traits of citizens to spur intergroup aggression? Building on research in social psychology, we expect that in places of protracted conflict, violent rhetoric from elites will be enough to mobilize antagonism toward an outgroup, especially among those who are generally less apt to be hostile toward the outgroup. We present results from two large survey experiments, the first conducted with young Jewish-Israeli adults across Israel and the second with a nationally diverse sample of adults in India. The results show that mild fighting words (e.g. battle, fight), combined with a reference to the outgroup, provoke significantly greater support for policies that harm the outgroup among some citizens. This effect is largest among individuals low in outgroup prejudice and low in aggressive personality traits, people who are usually less inclined to support policies that hurt the outgroup. Effects of violent rhetoric persist even with policies and rhetoric to help the outgroup. This work highlights the importance of considering both individual traits and contextual factors together to understand their full impact in the study of intergroup conflict.

AB  - Background: This study is the first to explore the relations between attachment styles, ageism, and quality of life (QoL) among elderly people. The attachment theory describes how human beings relate to each other, according to their attachment style. Previous studies have examined the connection between attachment styles and prejudice toward distinctive social groups and minorities. Ageism as a form of prejudice is a way of relating negatively to people because they are old. QoL among the elderly was found to be associated with negative age-perceptions. It was therefore hypothesized that QoL, attachments styles, and demographic characteristics can explain ageism among the elderly.
   Methods: Four questionnaires were administered: Fraboni Scale of Ageism (FSA), which comprises four scales (separation, affective, stereotype, and intergeneration); Experiences in Close Relationships Scale, which measures four attachment styles (secure, dismissive, fearful, and preoccupied); SF-36 health status inventory (eight scales); and sociodemographic questions. Ninety-four elderly men and women aged 64-85 years living in the community completed the questionnaires.
   Results: MANCOVAS indicated that securely attached individuals score higher on separation than fearfully attached individuals, and that securely and dismissively attached individuals score higher than fearful and preoccupied individuals on seven QoL scales. Multiple regression analyses showed that attachment styles, age, gender, and some QoL scales contribute to the explained variance of ageism.
   Conclusions: Secure attachment in late life seems to be related to less ageism and a better QoL. The enhancement of a secure attachment base in elderly people may assist in moderating ageism and improving older people's QoL.

AB  - This research examines the effects of racial stereotypes embedded within sports media. An experiment was conducted to examine the impact of racialized "brawn" and "brain" frames on perceptions of student-athletes among their potential peers. College student participants (N = 232) were exposed to one of eight versions of a news article about a college football recruit that manipulated the athlete's race (White vs. Black) and the frame used to describe him (brawn vs. brain vs. mixed vs. control). Results showed a college admittance essay was evaluated more positively when the author was a Black athlete compared to a White athlete. In addition, the brawn frame elicited lower levels of social attraction and greater athlete stereotype endorsement compared to all other frames. No interaction effects were revealed. These findings suggest that how the media frame student-athletes affects expectations of their academic performance, which has practical implications for interpersonal dynamics between student-athletes and their peers, as well as public perceptions of student-athletes writ large.

AB  - Purpose: Black breast cancer patients delay and underutilize adjuvant breast cancer therapies; yet, very few studies have specifically examined Black women's attitudes toward breast cancer therapy. This study observed the influence of self-reported interpersonal processes of care (e.g. self-efficacy) clinical and sociodemographic factors and sociocultural {e.g. religiosity), related to Black breast cancer patients' attitudes toward radiation and systemic therapies (chemotherapy and adjuvant endocrine therapy - "AET").
   Methods: This was a secondary analysis of data from the Narrowing Gaps in Adjuvant Therapy Study (2006-2011). The analysis included 210 Black women who were newly diagnosed with breast cancer. Bivariate and multiple regression analyses were performed between independent variables (e.g., demographics) and three outcome variables (chemotherapy, AET, and radiation therapy) to asses women's perceptions of therapy type. The Lasso method was used to select variables correlated with therapy attitudes.
   Results: Most women reported negative attitudes toward AET (56%) and radiation (54%); fewer negative attitudes were observed toward chemotherapy (47%). Higher education and greater perceived susceptibility of a recurrence were associated with more positive attitudes toward chemotherapy. Regarding radiation therapy, women with greater patient satisfaction were more likely to have more positive attitudes.
   Conclusions: Our study findings may aid in the development of behavioral interventions targeted to mitigate Black women breast cancer treatment disparities. We found modifiable factors (e.g. communication, satisfaction ratings) that support opportunities for clinicians to better address Black women's needs regarding adjuvant treatment options. The development of tailored interventions for newly diagnosed Black breast cancer patients on patient related factors in health care are warranted fa Black women with lower educational levels.

AB  - Background: Throughout Africa, epilepsy is a highly stigmatized condition. It is often considered to be contagious. This study aimed to assess community knowledge, attitude, and practices toward epilepsy in four villages namely Mdindo, Msogezi, Mzelezi, and Sali within Mahenge division, in Morogoro region, Tanzania. These villages are located in an onchocerciasis-endemic area with a high prevalence of epilepsy. Methods: A qualitative cross-sectional study was conducted between June and July 2019 within the framework of a multi-disciplinary research project investigating the association between onchocerciasis and epilepsy. Focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) were held with persons with epilepsy (PWE) and their caretakers, community resource persons, and program coordinators of the neglected tropical diseases program. Results: The main symptoms of epilepsy were well described by all participants in all villages. PWE and caretakers in all villages considered epilepsy to be a major health problem and some participants ranked it second in importance after malaria. The reported perceived causes of epilepsy included febrile seizures during childhood (locally known as degedege), heredity, evil spirits, and inhaling flatus or touching secretions from PWE, especially during seizures. Knowledge about the association between epilepsy and onchocerciasis was low. People with epilepsy are disregarded, stigmatized, and marginalized from various opportunities such as conjugal rights, schooling, leadership roles, and property inheritance. Traditional healers are often the first contact when seeking care after a person develops epilepsy. Conclusion: Epilepsy is a major health burden and public health concern in the Mahenge area. The negative attitudes toward PWE and misconceptions about the causes of epilepsy contribute to delays in seeking care at health facilities. Findings from this study will be used to optimize the comprehensive community-based epilepsy treatment program that was recently initiated in the area . (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this essay, we explore the various aspects of hermeneutic relativity that have rarely been explicitly discussed. Our notion of hermeneutic relativity can be seen as an extension, with significant revisions, of Gadamer's notion of Vorurteil. It refers to various choices and constraints of the interpreter, including beliefs concerning the best way of doing philosophy, what criteria are to be used to evaluate competing interpretations, and so on. The interpreter cannot completely eliminate the guidance and constraint originating from his/her background. However, in principle the interpreter can choose to be guided by other constraints. Hence, we speak of choices or commitments. Hermeneutic relativity is the major cause for the variation of competing interpretations.

AB  - Virtual Reality (VR) has often been referred to as an "empathy machine." This is mostly because it can induce empathy through embodiment experiences in outgroup membership. However, the potential of intergroup contact with an outgroup avatar in VR to increase empathy is less studied. Even though intergroup contact literature suggests that less threatening and more prosocial emotions are the key to understanding why intergroup contact is a powerful mean to decrease prejudice, few studies have investigated the effect of intergroup contact on empathy in VR. In this study, we developed a between-participants design to investigate how VR can be used to create a positive intergroup contact with a member of a stigmatized outgroup (ethnic minority) and present the results of the effect of intergroup contact in VR on empathy. Sixty four participants experienced either positive contact (i.e., equal intergroup status, collaborative) with a black (experimenter-controlled) avatar (experimental condition) or no intergroup contact (i.e., ingroup contact with a white avatar; control condition), with situational empathy (personal distress and empathic interest) being measured through a self-report questionnaire up to a week before and right after the VR contact experience. The experiment showed that satisfying degrees of body ownership of participants' own avatar and co-presence with the contacted avatar can be achieved in simple and universally accessible virtual environments such as AltspaceVR. The results indicated that while VR intergroup contact had no significant direct effect on empathy, exploratory analyses indicated that post-intervention empathic interest increased with stronger feelings of co-presence in the intergroup contact condition.

AB  - Attitude determination of the space vehicle always plays a pivotal role in space missions. Usually, the fourth-order Runge Kutta algorithm is taken as more common attitude integration algorithm. However, more appropriate algorithms are desired in order to meet variable requirement. This paper investigates the performance of the fourth-order Runge Kutta and Taylor series algorithms in coning environment, and presents a new algorithm which takes advantages from above both. Series of simulation experiments have been conducted to verify the effect of the new algorithm. Their results show that the new algorithm outperforms the fourth-order Runge Kutta and the four-sample rotation vector algorithms over long-duration run even in complex engineering applications where the attitude change is not too fast.

TI  - Four in every ten infants in Northwest Ethiopia exposed to sub-optimal breastfeeding practice
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - RURAL COMMUNITIES
AB  - Background
   Improper breastfeeding practices significantly impair the health, development, and survival of infants, children, and mothers. A Breastfeeding Performance Index (BPI) is a composite index to describe overall maternal breastfeeding practice with infants under six months of age. To date, there is insufficient evidence on breastfeeding performance index and its associated factors in Ethiopia.
   Objective
   To assess the breastfeeding performance index and its associated factors in Sekela District, Northwest Ethiopia, 2019.
   Methods
   A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 605 randomly selected mothers having infants aged 6 to 12 months from April 02, 2019 to May 13, 2019. Data was collected using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire. Multivariable logistic regressions were used to identify independent predictors of BPI.
   Results
   Two hundred forty-six (40.7%) of mothers had low BPI scores. Mothers who lived alone (AOR = 3.18; 95%CI: 1.15, 8.82), mothers who were merchants (AOR = 2.75; 95%CI:1.05, 7.15), attended three antenatal care (ANC) visits (AOR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.82), attended four antenatal care visits (AOR = 0.35; 95%CI: 0.12, 0.82), received postnatal care (PNC) (AOR = 0.35; 95%CI: 0.19, 0.64), had poor knowledge on breastfeeding (AOR = 3.19;95%CI: 1.14, 8.89) or negative attitudes towards breastfeeding (AOR = 2.70;95%CI: 1.13, 6.45), were independent predictors of low BPI scores.
   Conclusions
   The prevalence of sub-optimal breastfeeding practice in northwest Ethiopia was very high. A mother living alone, maternal occupation, ANC visits, PNC, maternal breastfeeding knowledge, and attitude towards breastfeeding were independent predictors of low BPI scores. Nutrition promotion should be implemented by considering the above significant factors to decrease inappropriate breastfeeding practice in Northwest Ethiopia.

AB  - Multiculturalism has been criticized and rejected by an increasing number of politicians, and social psychological research has shown that it can Lead to outgroup stereotyping, essentialist thinking, and negative attitudes. Interculturalism has been proposed as an alternative diversity ideology, but there is almost no systematic empirical evidence about the impact of interculturalism on the acceptance of migrants and minority groups. Using data from a survey experiment conducted in the Netherlands, we examined the situational effect of promoting interculturalism on acceptance. The results show that for liberals, but not for conservatives, interculturalism leads to more positive attitudes toward immigrant-origin groups and increased willingness to engage in contact, relative to multiculturalism.

AB  - Background: Emerging evidence indicates the extreme forms of violence and acute and longer-term mental health consequences associated with trafficking and exploitation. However, there has been little research on post-trafficking mental health and psychosocial support services for survivors. This study explored the availability and accessibility of mental health and psychosocial support services in Cambodia for women, men and children trafficked and exploited for sex or labour purposes.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposively selected sample of representatives from seven service organizations providing mental health and psychosocial support services for people who have been trafficked. This qualitative method was selected to gain insights into the service approaches and challenges faced by the small number of post-trafficking service providers in Cambodia. A conceptual framework outlining access dimensions associated with service provision guided the structure of the study.
   Results: Findings indicate that among the available post-trafficking services, there are few trained mental health specialists, an over-representation of shelter services in urban versus rural areas and limited services for males, people with disabilities, individuals exploited for labour (versus sexual exploitation) and those with more serious mental illnesses. Providers believe that discrimination and stigma related to both mental health and human trafficking hinder trafficked people's willingness to access services, but suggest that awareness-raising may reduce these prejudices. Care in this sector is precarious due to over-reliance on financial support by donors versus government. Recent increases in newly qualified professionals and providers suggest potential improvements in the quality and availability of psychological support for trafficking survivors.
   Conclusions: Psychological support for the growing number of identified trafficking survivors in Cambodia will depend on improved geographical distribution of services, more mental health support professionals and growing acceptability of mental health service use among trafficked people and the Cambodian public.

AB  - Language used in health care, particularly with vulnerable populations such as those with mental illness, is often violent, rising from historical prejudices and politics of power over others. This creates disharmony and distrust between health care providers and patients and families. Peace involves relationships that nurture ongoing harmony, trust, and constructive solutions. In this descriptive philosophical article, we discuss connections between and among the concepts of peace, health, relational ethics, in relation to nurses' responsibilities, current health care realities, and the language of nursing. We propose a shift in discourse within nurse-patient relationships from oppressive and stigmatizing language to the discourse of peace.

AB  - We argue that psychologists who conduct experiments with long lags between the manipulation and the outcome measure should pay more attention to behavioral processes that intervene between the manipulation and the outcome measure. Neglect of such processes, we contend, stems from psychology's long tradition of short-lag lab experiments where there is little scope for intervening behavioral processes. Studying process in the lab invariably involves studying psychological processes, but in long-lag field experiments it is important to study causally relevant behavioral processes as well as psychological ones. To illustrate the roles that behavioral processes can play in long-lag experiments we examine field experiments motivated by three policy-relevant goals: prejudice reduction, health promotion, and educational achievement. In each of the experiments discussed we identify various behavioral pathways through which the manipulated psychological state could have produced the observed outcome. We argue that if psychologists conducting long-lag interventions posited a theory of change that linked manipulated psychological states to outcomes via behavioral pathways, the result would be richer theory and more practically useful research. Movement in this direction would also permit more opportunities for productive collaborations between psychologists and other social scientists interested in similar social problems.

AB  - Academic stakeholders' (primarily mental health researchers and clinicians) practices and attitudes related to the translation of genetic information into mental health care were assessed. A three-part survey was administered at two large, urban universities. Response frequencies were calculated. Participants (N = 64) reported moderate levels of translational practice, adequate levels of genetic knowledge, and variable levels of genetic competence. They held positive attitudes toward translating genetic information about mental health broadly but negative attitudes about the impact that such information would have on specific aspects of care. The current study lays the groundwork for further inquiry into translating genetic information to mental health care.

AB  - This study examined the conditions affecting the math performance of French female student nurses in a setting where they were likely to experience stereotype threat (supposedly poor scientific skills), but in a context which enhanced their status as women and strengthened their self-affirmation. We hypothesized that self-affirmation through their nursing identity would deflect the negative impact of the stereotype threat on performance and would reduce the threat's harmful impact on attentional processes, as reflected in perceived stress, perceived concentration and self-estimate of performance. Ninety-five female students enrolled in a nursing school in France carried out a dosage calculation-a typical nursing task-which drew directly on their math skills. They were assigned to one of four experimental conditions: 2 (threat: task presented as being diagnostic of women's difficulty in math calculation compared to men vs. no threat: task presented as a typical nursing-school exercise) x 2 (self-affirmation: choosing from a list and describing the most important characteristics for them as women and as nurses vs. control condition: same task but for the characteristics that were least important for them but important for other people). As expected, under stereotype threat relating to their math skills, women performed better under the self-affirmation condition than under the control condition. However, this improved performance was associated with a lower self-estimate of their performance. We discuss the consequences, in this specific occupational and cultural context, on the way women can overcome the negative impact of gender stereotypes.

AB  - Three studies examined the role of need for affect (NFA) and need for cognition (NFC) in intergroup perception. We hypothesized that NFA predicts a preference for stereotypically warm groups over stereotypically cold groups, whereas NFC predicts a preference for stereotypically competent groups over stereotypically incompetent groups. Study 1 supported these hypotheses for attitudes toward stereotypically ambivalent groups, which are stereotyped as high on one of the trait dimensions (e.g., high warmth) and low on the other (e.g., low competence), but not for stereotypically univalent groups, which are seen as high or low on both dimensions. Studies 2 and 3 replicated this pattern for stereotypically ambivalent groups, and yielded provocative evidence regarding several putative mechanisms underlying these associations. Together, these findings help integrate and extend past evidence on attitude-relevant individual differences with research on intergroup perception.

AB  - In two studies, we tested a model in which the perceived (in)compatibility of being British and Muslim (identity incompatibility) was expected to mediate between group-based discrimination and the identifications and attitudes of British Muslims. In Study 1 (N = 76), anti-Muslim discrimination was associated with lower national identification and more negative attitudes toward non-Muslims, and these relationships were mediated by perceived identity incompatibility. In Study 2 (N = 70), we additionally found that anti-Muslim discrimination predicted stronger endorsement of Islamic group rights, and this relationship was also mediated by perceived identity incompatibility. The studies highlight the importance of group-based discrimination in shaping the perceived (in)compatibility of being British and Muslim, and, in turn, the identifications and attitudes of British Muslims.

AB  - Purpose: Human rights education is vital for democratic societies. For an effective human rights education, teachers need to have an in-depth comprehension regarding human rights in the first place. Accordingly, this study aimed to develop, implement and evaluate the Human Rights Curriculum Based on Socioscientific issues as Part of the Environmental Education Course (HRCSEC) for pre-service primary school teachers (PPSTs). Method: This study was designed as a quasi-experimental study with non-equivalent pre-test/post-test control group. The participants of the study include 77 PSPTs 38 of whom were included in the experimental group and 39 of whom were included in the control group. The implementation lasted for 14 weeks within the scope of the study. Results: The study results showed that following the implementation the experimental group pre-service teachers had significantly higher knowledge and attitudes regarding human rights compared to the control group pre-service teachers. In addition, the experimental group pre-service teachers were equipped with various acquisitions, in addition to knowledge and attitude development regarding human rights, such as, the relationship between environment and human rights and knowledge development. Implications for Research and Practice: According to the results of the research, it can be suggested to establish a human rights connection with SSI in environmental education courses for PSPTs to gain a holistic understanding of environment and human rights and in order to gain knowledge and attitude about human rights. For comprehensive information on the situation, studies can be conducted in environmental courses at different levels of education. (c) 2018 Ani Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved

AB  - Empathy is a familiar term in social work education, although how to teach and learn empathy is not well documented. Equally, how non-indigenous Australian practitioners learn empathic regard for indigenous peoples living with the crippling legacies of colonialism is not commonly described in the literature. The primary aim of the classroom-based inquiry described here was to explore and reflect on the concept of empathy with social work students at a regional Australian university using selected real-life vignettes. These findings suggest greater cultivation of empathy is needed for respectful social work intervention by non-indigenous practitioners working with Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and, by implication, with indigenous peoples worldwide.

AB  - While there are several studies that have tested efficacy of implicit bias trainings, none have tested how working within a justice profession or how one's racial identity impact outcomes following participation in such a training. Additionally, though empathy influences bias, no studies have tested for the effect of implicit bias training on ethnocultural empathy. The present study is a program evaluation of an implicit bias training program that examines the effects of profession and racial identity on outcomes, including ethnocultural empathy. The implicit bias training was a 3-h standardized training that described how implicit biases are formed, how they impact children in the school-to-prison pipeline and adults in society, the short- and long-term consequences of those biases, and strategies for responding to one's own implicit biases. Participants who completed implicit bias trainings were 243 justice professionals and 274 non-justice professionals. Results indicated training outcomes were significantly associated with participant gender, race, racial identity, and whether participants worked in justice or non-justice professions. In addition, participants indicated several strengths and assets of the program; how receptive participants were to implicit bias training components was significantly associated with gender, race, and whether the participants worked in justice settings. The current study provides a necessary but incomplete picture of the strengths and weaknesses of this implicit bias training, lending support for continued trainings with more in-depth and longitudinal study of them.

TI  - Selective Exposure, Political Polarization, and Possible Mediators: Evidence From the Netherlands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC OPINION RESEARCH

KW  - NEWS
AB  - One of the main lines of reasoning in the contemporary debate on media effects is the notion that selective exposure to congruent information can lead to political polarization. Most studies are correlational, potentially plagued with self-report biases, and cannot demonstrate time order. Even less is known about the mechanisms behind such an effect. We conducted an online quasi-experiment with a sample matching the characteristics of the Dutch population closely (N = 501). We investigate how selective exposure can lead to polarized attitudes and which role frames, facts, and public opinion cues play. While we find that facts learned can help explaining attitude change and that selectivity can influence the perception of public opinion, we cannot confirm that people generally polarize.

AB  - This study aimed at examining social appearance anxiety levels of male nursing students and their coping attitudes and identifying the relationship between them. A cross-sectional research approach was adopted in a study population of 180; the sample comprised 129 students. Data were collected using a socio-demographic information form, the Social Appearance Anxiety Scale (SAAS), and the Assessment of Coping Attitudes Inventory (COPE). The average age of students was 20.54 +/- 1.49 years. The male students' average score obtained from the SAAS measure was 32.64 +/- 13.07, while that of the COPE Inventory was 138.11 +/- 14.47. Significant correlations were detected between students' SAAS scores and COPE scale scores. There were negative relationships between social anxiety scores and COPE subscales of positive reinterpretation and growth (p < .05), use of instrumental social support (p < .05), active coping (p <= .01), and planning (p <= .01). In contrast, there were positive relationships between social anxiety scores and COPE subscales of mental disengagement (p <= .01), denial (p <= .01), behavioral disengagement (p <= .01), restraint (p <= .01), use of emotional social support (p < .05), substance use (p <= .01), and acceptance (p < .05). The conclusion was that male students who do not perceive themselves as having an ideal body image face high social appearance anxiety. There is a prejudice that social appearance anxiety has negative effects on these students' self-confidence. In this context, this research revealed concrete results about how male nursing students have battled the prejudices that they have faced throughout their student life.

AB  - Good clinical decision-making is important in dermatologic surgery. Experience and knowledge help considerably, but take time to acquire. However, how the clinician thinks is also a significant contributory factor. How we think is influenced by many factors, including our beliefs, prejudices, confidence and variables like how we are feeling at that moment physically and emotionally. Thought process can be either fast and subconscious or slow and analytical. Fast thinking contributes to the majority of decision-making and is especially prone to a range of biases which may contribute to suboptimal clinical outcomes. We wish to highlight and illustrate common biases in thinking encountered by the dermatologic surgeon.

AB  - Objectives Stigma against mental illnesses is one of the significant obstacles faced by mental health service users and providers. It can develop at a young age and is also influenced by culture. Youths in Southeast Asian countries are under-represented in mental health research, thus this study aims to explore the dimensions of stigma and social tolerance and examine its correlates in the younger, multiethnic population of Singapore.
   Design An online survey collected data with sociodemographic questions, the Attitudes Towards Serious Mental Illness (Adolescent version) Scale, Social Tolerance Scale and an open-text question on words or phrases participants associated with the term 'mental illness'. Principal component analysis and multiple regression models were conducted to investigate the factor structure of the attitudes and social tolerance scales and their sociodemographic correlates.
   Participants Participants included 940 youths aged 1418 years old who were residing in Singapore at the time of the survey and were recruited through local schools.
   Results About a quarter of the students (22.6%) reported participating in mental health awareness campaigns while nearly half (44.5%) associated pejorative words and phrases with the term mental illness. The Attitudes Towards Serious Mental Illness (Adolescent version) Scale yielded five factors while the Social Tolerance Scale yielded two. Ethnicity, gender and nationality were significantly correlated with factors of both scales. Chinese youths showed higher sense of 'physical threat' and lower 'social tolerance' than those of other ethnicities. Females showed more 'wishful thinking', 'social concern' and 'social responsibility' towards the mentally ill than males.
   Conclusions The dimensions of stigma and social tolerance are different in Asian cultures compared with Western cultures. Sociodemographic differences in attitudes towards the mentally ill were found among youths living in Singapore. Misconceptions and negative attitudes towards mental illness are common, demonstrating a clear need for effective stigma reduction campaigns.

TI  - Decoherence and the retrieval of lost information
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW B
LA  - English
AB  - We show that, contrary to common prejudice, a measurement of an open quantum system can reduce its decoherence rate. We demonstrate this in an example of indirect measurement of a qubit, where information regarding its state is hidden in the environment. This information is extracted by a distant device, coupled with the environment only. We also show that the reduction of decoherence generated by this device is accompanied by diminution of the environmental noise in the vicinity of the qubit. An interpretation of these results in terms of quantum interference on large scales is presented.

AB  - Drawing on previous studies, this article examines faculty beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions of students with learning disabilities at a historically Black university. Surveys were distributed to 150 faculty members to explore their understandings of Americans with Disabilities Act. use of accommodations, knowledge of learning disabilities, and perceived willingness to implement instructional accommodations. The faculty members surveyed demonstrated overall positive perceptions in their willingness to personally invest in supporting students with learning disabilities. Faculty members demonstrated neither positive nor negative attitudes regarding the implementation of major accommodations. Results have implications for further research about college context and college persistence for racially/ethnically diverse postsecondary students with learning disabilities and professional development for university faculty members.

AB  - Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a global public health and human rights issue that affects millions of women and girls. While disaggregated national statistics are crucial to assess inequalities, little evidence exists on inequalities in exposure to violence against adolescents and young women (AYW). The aim of this study was to determine inequalities in physical or sexual IPV against AYW and beliefs about gender based violence (GBV) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
   Methods: We used data from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in 27 countries in SSA. Only data from surveys conducted after 2010 were included. Our analysis focused on married or cohabiting AYW aged 15-24 years and compared inequalities in physical or sexual IPV by place of residence, education and wealth. We also examined IPV variations by AYW's beliefs about GBV and the association of country characteristics such as gender inequality with IPV prevalence.
   Results: The proportion of AYW reporting IPV in the year before the survey ranged from 6.5% in Comoros to 43.3% in Gabon, with a median of 25.2%. Overall, reported IPV levels were higher in countries in the Central Africa region than other sub-regions. Although the prevalence of IPV varied by place of residence, education and wealth, there was no clear pattern of inequalities. In many countries with high prevalence of IPV, a higher proportion of AYW from rural areas, with lower education and from the poorest wealth quintile reported IPV. In almost all countries, a greater proportion of AYW who approved wife beating for any reason reported IPV compared to their counterparts who disapproved wife beating. Reporting of IPV was weakly correlated with the Gender Inequality Index and other societal level variables but was moderately positively correlated with adult alcohol consumption (r = 0.48) and negative attitudes towards GBV (r = 0.38).
   Conclusion: IPV is pervasive among AYW, with substantial variation across and within countries reflecting the role of contextual and structural factors in shaping the vulnerability to IPV. The lack of consistent patterns of inequalities by the stratifiers within countries shows that IPV against women and girls cuts across socio-economic boundaries suggesting the need for comprehensive and multi-sectoral approaches to preventing and responding to IPV.

AB  - When claimants press their claims without counsel, they fail at virtually every stage of civil litigation and overwhelmingly fail to obtain meaningful access to justice. This research program harnesses psychological science to experimentally test a novel hypothesis: mainly, a claimant's pro se status itself sends a signal that biases decision making about the claimant and her claim. We conducted social psychological experiments with the public (N=157), law students (N=198), and employment discrimination lawyers (N=39), holding the quality and merit of a Title VII sex discrimination case constant. In so doing, we examined whether a claimant's pro se status itself shapes stereotypes held about the claimant and biases decision making about settlement awards. These experiments reveal that pro se status influences stereotypes of claimants and settlement awards received. Moreover, the signaling effect of pro se status is exacerbated by socialization in the legal profession. Among law-trained individuals (i.e., law students and lawyers), a claimant's pro se status generates negative stereotypes about the claimant and these negative stereotypes explain the adverse effect of pro se status on decision making about settlement awards.

AB  - Simple Summary Despite higher loss due to disease, human-carnivore conflicts over livestock depredation is one of the major problems in carnivore conservation, both locally and globally. Locals share negative attitudes towards the wolf due to conflicts over livestock depredation. Using semi-structured questionnaires, we found that grey wolf is in a serious conflict with the locals, causing economic loss to them at the expanse of its own life. The locals considered the species a serious threat to their livestock, causing them economic losses, and wanted to reduce or even eliminate it from their area. Respondents having larger herd size and higher dependency on livestock for earning livelihoods shared more negative attitudes towards the wolves. In our study area the economic loss of the locals due to livestock mortalities from diseases was higher than that from wolf depredation. Therefore, we suggested that vaccination of the livestock and compensation schemes will help to change the perception of locals towards wolf.
   Abstract Pastoralist-wolf conflict over livestock depredation is the main factor affecting conservation of grey wolf worldwide. Very limited research has been carried out to evaluate the pattern and nature of livestock depredation by wolf. This study aims to determine the status and nature of human-wolf conflict across different villages in the Hind Kush region of Pakistan during the period January 2016-December 2016. For this purpose, a total of 110 local male respondents from all walks of life were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. The grey wolf was declared as a common species in the area by 51.3% of the locals with an annual sighting rate of 0.46 each. During the year (2016), a total of 358 livestock were lost to grey wolf predation and disease. Of the total livestock loss, grey wolf was held responsible for a total 101 livestock losses. Goat and sheep were the most vulnerable prey species as they accounted for 80 (79.2%) of the total reported depredations. Out of the total economic loss (USD 46,736, USD 424.87/household), grey wolf was accountable for USD 11,910 (USD 108.27 per household), while disease contributed 34,826 (USD 316.6 per household). High depredation was observed during the summer season 58.42% (n = 59) followed by spring and autumn. Unattended livestock were more prone to grey wolf attack during free grazing in forests. Most of the respondents (75.45%) showed aggressive and negative attitudes towards grey wolf. The herders shared more negative attitude (z = -3.21, p = 0.001) than businessman towards the species. Herders having larger herd size displayed more deleterious behavior towards wolves than those having smaller herd size. Active herding techniques, vaccinating livestock, educating locals about wildlife importance, and initiating compensating schemes for affected families could be helpful to decrease negative perceptions.

AB  - Background: With the increased number of older people globally, caring for older people has become a challenge for many countries. Nurses have a pivotal role in providing quality care for older people and care is affected by their attitudes. The preparation of nurses to deliver quality care needs to be instilled during their studying in the Schools of Nursing.
   Objective: To examine the attitudes of nursing students toward and their willingness to work with older people in Sri Lanka.
   Methodology: A purposive sample of 98 first to fourth year undergraduate nursing students in the Department of Nursing, University of Peradeniya completed a self-administered questionnaire consisting of socio-demographic variables, Kogan's Attitudes toward Older People Scale, and questions related to willingness to work with older people.
   Results: Fifty percent of the respondents (n = 49) held slightly positive attitudes toward older people while 45% (n = 44) held slightly negative attitudes. About one-third of the respondents (29.9%, n = 29) selected the elderly group as the least preferred group for their future career from the categorized seven age groups. Only 5.1% (n = 5) of the respondents ranked the elderly group as the first preferred group. There was a significant difference in attitudes between students who lived with older people and students who did not live with older people (t = 2.565, p = .012). There was a positive relationship between attitudes and preference for working with older people (r = .342, p = .001).
   Conclusion: Nursing students have moderately positive attitudes toward older people; however, they show little interest in working with older people. Living with older people develops positive attitudes of young people toward older people. Attitudes are related to the selection in area of specialty in nursing. Nursing curricula need to include Gerontological Nursing as a major area. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents the results of two experiments designed to test a susceptibility threshold in the shark cage diving context, positing that persons who are high relative to low sensation-seekers are more likely to approach risks that are portrayed as scary and moderately probable. The results of study one provide evidence for the susceptibility threshold showing high sensation-seekers having greater behavioral intent to engage in risk behaviors when a message portrays a scary but only moderately probable risk. The second experiment finds high susceptibility messages result in more negative attitudes and behavioral intentions. Implications for risk message design and theory are addressed.

AB  - The purpose of this study, which was conducted through a survey, is to describe the ownership and use of mobile medical apps (MMAs) by Egyptian patients. Findings revealed that 65.4% of Egyptian patients did not use MMAs, of whom 69.7% were male and 30.3% female, older, with at least a high school education and working mainly as farmers and non-government workers. The study also found that 34.6% of Egyptian patients tended to be MMA users, of whom 61.8% were also male and 38.2% female, older, educated and working mainly as businessmen/women and accountants. Many MMA users showed that they had been using these apps for less than five years. The number of MMAs owned was described to be moderate, accessed mostly from home/dormitory and work. Reminder apps, healthy life apps and general facility information apps were found to be mostly used by Egyptian patients who adopted these apps for reasons such as finding specific information, checking materials and communication. To meet these reasons, 97.1% of them were spending from one to three hours a day. Almost two-thirds of Egyptian patients confirmed that the use of these apps was at least fairly easy to them and all of them saw these apps as at least fairly useful. A large number of MMA users showed very positive attitudes towards the use of these apps, since they allow for easy dissemination of information and are described as easily accessed. They also showed some negative attitudes, since they are addictive, violate privacy, are frustrating and require language skill. Users faced some significant barriers, such as lack of awareness of MMAs, lack of language and technical skills and lack of training in the use of MMAs.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to evaluate the attitudes of healthcare professionals toward the COVID -19 vaccine, which has been introduced to healthcare professionals at the beginning of 2021 and give information to them on the disease and vaccine. This cross-sectional analytical study has been performed by conducting an online survey to the healthcare professionals who work at the healthcare institutions in the province of Samsun in Turkey between December 2020 and January 2021. In addition to sixteen questions about the demographic characteristics, the "Attitudes towards the COVID -19 vaccine" scale has been used. MANOVA test and Spearman rho correlation coefficient were used in analytical examinations. A total of 1426 healthcare professional have been reached. 64.3% of participants were female, 44.1% were nurse/midwife and 66.6% were public employees. Regarding the questions in the sub-dimension of positive attitude, the rate of response of "I agree/I strongly agree" was between 40.6% and 54.6%. Positive attitude mean values differ according to gender, age, institution, presence of children, smoking status, being a relative who died due to COVID -19, and profession (respectively p < .001, p < .001, p < .001, p < .001, p = .002, p = .019, p < .001). It has been observed that positive and negative attitudes toward COVID -19 vaccination are almost equally distributed and some demographic factors affect the attitude. The opinions of healthcare professionals on the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, which are the main elements of the vaccination effort, may affect the public perception of vaccination.

AB  - Although it is generally assumed that support for democratic values and beliefs develops as a result of social learning, the concrete socializing circumstances through which this occurs are less obvious. This study investigated the relationship between democratic family functioning and democratic values of adolescents. Adolescents' (N - 1,341, 16- to 17-year-olds) reports on their parents' psychological control, autonomy granting, warmth, and behavioural control were considered predictors of adolescents' democratic orientation. The results demonstrated that the democratic functioning of families was positively related to adolescents' support for democratic values when controlling for the effects of gender, political experience, authoritarianism, empathy, and political activism. Additionally, this study examined the possible role of empathy as a mediator in the relation between democratic family functioning and adolescent's democratic values. The results show that empathy was a partial mediator of a family's contribution to adolescents' democratic orientation.

TI  - Attitudes, Anxiety, and Behavioral Practices Regarding COVID-19 among University Students in Jordan: A Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
LA  - English
KW  - CORONAVIRUS
KW  - SARS
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic represents a major public health, economic, political, and scientific concern in most countries around the globe where COVID-19 cases and deaths have been confirmed. This study assessed the attitudes, anxiety, and behavioral practices of university students in Jordan regarding COVID-19 during the early period of the infection (March 19-21, 2020) using a validated, self-administered survey questionnaire. Positive attitudes or low-risk practices were given 1 point, whereas negative attitudes or high-risk practices were scored 0. Percentages of the total score were used for categorizing data into negative attitudes or high-risk practices (<= 60%), moderate attitudes or moderate-risk practices (60.01-80%), and positive attitudes or low-risk practices (> 80%). Generally, the university students displayed positive attitudes and low-risk practices toward preventing COVID-19, with an average score of 81.1% and 84.3%, respectively. Approximately two-thirds (69.1%) of the students showed a positive attitude toward COVID-19 seriousness, concern of contracting the virus, and the appropriate prevention measures, and low-risk practices (67.6%) toward preventing COVID-19 including implementation of social distancing and good hygiene. Female, older, medical, or postgraduate students practiced significantly more (P <= 0.05) appropriate hygiene and social distancing behaviors toward COVID-19 than their counterparts of each group. More than two-thirds (69.2%) of the students were anxious that they might become infected with COVID-19. These results are important for health authorities to develop appropriate educational programs and protective health measures including good respiratory etiquette and handwashing practices, to enhance safer lifestyles and prevent COVID-19 transmission.

AB  - These three studies found support for a process termed hedonic contamination, whereby exposure to advertisements before a movie or television show activates persuasion knowledge, directs attention to the product placements, and reduces consumption enjoyment. Study 1 showed that exposure to in-theater commercials led to more negative attitudes toward product placements in the feature movie and reduced overall enjoyment of the movie. Study 2 implemented an eye-tracking experiment showing that advertising exposure increased eye fixations on product placements in a subsequent television episode. Study 3 identified the activation of persuasion knowledge as the underlying process driving hedonic contamination. The collective results suggest new research directions for understanding the interplay between advertising exposures and how consumers respond to subsequent entertainment content and marketing messages.

AB  - The literature indicates that ethnic minority and faith groups are under-represented in therapy services, report higher levels of dissatisfaction with mental health services, have higher disengagement rates, and poor recovery rates compared to the general population. This service evaluation explores the barriers encountered in accessing professional psychological help for a group of bereaved British Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) Muslim women who were affected by the Grenfell Tower fire(2). A trauma-informed culturally appropriate faith-informed therapeutic group intervention, called the Hand of Hope, was coproduced with the community to address the barriers reported and to improve access to mental health services, and service experience for Grenfell-affected Muslim MENA communities who were not engaging with services. Two Hand of Hope therapeutic group interventions were piloted and mixed methods service evaluations were conducted which included focus groups and outcome measures. A thematic analysis was conducted. The findings indicated that participants were requesting informal culturally appropriate faith-informed therapeutic interventions. The service evaluation findings indicated that an informal, coproduced, culturally appropriate, and faith-informed therapeutic group intervention encouraged engagement and retention of MENA Muslim participants who previously held negative attitudes toward therapy; it challenged the stigma attached to mental health and seeking therapy; it improved the participants' attitude toward therapy, and it increased the uptake of participants and their children accessing therapy. The findings also indicated reduced distress and improved service user experience, psychological and social wellbeing, trust, stabilization, emotional regulation, resilience, and coping. The implications of this study and the relevance of the findings to mental health are considered.

AB  - The problem of loneliness is caused by a disunity and alienation of modern society, dissatisfaction with the basic social needs for acceptance and support. The fact that the subjective feeling of loneliness does not coincide with the real degree of social isolation determines the need to study the cognitive aspects. The aim of this study is to show the role of cognitive structures in loneliness in women. A survey of 144 women aged 26-55 years was conducted. Using the UCLA Loneliness Scale and the Differential Loneliness Experience Questionnaire, loneliness was measured as a global experience, positive and negative attitudes towards it. Cognitive models were studied using the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale, Young Schema Questionnaire, the author's questionnaire that reveals cultural myths and gender stereotypes about loneliness. A comparative analysis of the groups showed no differences in the perception of loneliness among women with different family situations; it also does not depend on having children and their number. Age was found to be a significant determinant of perceptions of loneliness and family circumstances. Cognitive models influence women's loneliness to a greater extent than family situation. The publication describes correlations between perceived loneliness and individual dysfunctional attitudes, and builds regression models of predictors of loneliness in different age groups. The study shows the prevalence of cultural stereotypes about the need for marriage and motherhood, and a special female vulnerability in relationships. The construct "tolerance to loneliness" is proposed and described, which reveals the positive potential of this experience for selfknowledge and self-development.

AB  - This article explores the changing relationships between the USDA Forest Service and 10 small, forest-based communities in the Northwest Forest Plan area in Washington, Oregon, and California. Interviews with 158 community members and agency personnel indicated that community member interviewees were largely dissatisfied with the agency's current level of community engagement. Interviewees believed that loss of staff was the primary factor contributing to declining engagement, along with increasing turnover and long-distance commuting. Interviewees offered explanations for increasing employee turnover and commuting, including lack of housing, lack of employment for spouses, lack of services for children, social isolation, improving road conditions making long-distance commuting easier, agency incentives and culture, decreasing social cohesion among agency staff, unpaid overtime responsibilities, and agency hiring practices. Community member perceptions regarding long-term changes in community well-being and agency-community relationships were more negative than agency staff's perceptions.
   Study Implications: We found evidence that staffing declines, turnover, and long-distance commuting may contribute to decreasing agency engagement in some communities, and that diminished engagement by federal forest management agency employees may contribute to negative attitudes toward the agency. Agency employee interviewees suggested that incentives (i.e., promotions, opportunities to live elsewhere), internal conflicts, and a lack of opportunities and services for their families are reasons that staff commute from neighboring communities or leave their jobs. Our findings suggest that the USDA Forest Service may improve agency-community relationships by supporting its staff in ways that reduce turnover and long-distance commuting and incentivize community engagement.

AB  - Introduction: In recent decades western countries have become more open about sexuality and sexual relations, and adolescents get information about these issues mainly through the internet, TV and social networks. Often such information is incomplete, wrong or even contradicts itself. What favors them to develop myths, false beliefs and/or negative attitudes about sexuality, love, equality in relationships, or Sexually Transmitted Infections. At the same time, the presence of myths favors double standards, sexism, and a negative attitude toward toward personal, partner and/or social sexuality.
   Objectives: To create a scale for evaluating the permanence of myths about sexuality in adolescents, and to analyze the structural reliability and validity of this scale.
   Method: The sample was formed by a pilot group (n=216) and a final group (n=661), both with adolescents from high schools in the province of Malaga, obtained by non-probability cluster sampling. The first 69 initial items were given to the pilot sample to determine the final questions making up the "Escata de Mitos sobre la Sexualidad".
   Result: All final items have an item-total correlation over 0.29. A final questionnaire was obtained of 27 items, grouped into 6 components. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient indicated a high internal consistency of the test (0.881). Moreover, it confirms a significant difference between the sexes and between grades (cohorts).
   Conclusion: The Scale has appropriate parameters for use in sex education and research. The use of this scale would help to discover adherence to the myths of adolescents, in order to eliminate them and build a solid, free and personal concept of sexuality.

AB  - Objectives: Ageing populations are a global phenomenon resulting from increasing life expectancy and decreasing fertility rates. Thus, investigation into the factors affecting the quality of life (QOL) of the elderly has become important. This study aimed to assess the association between active ageing and health literacy, and QOL in a sample of elderly people in Northeast Thailand. Methods: Cross-sectional data were collected from 1,226 persons aged 60 years and above from Northeast Thailand. A general linear mixed model (GLMM) was used to determine the association between active ageing, health literacy and sociodemographic factors and the outcome variable, good QOL, as determined using the WHOQOL-BREF. Results: Overall, 42.09% of participants had a good QOL. After adjusting for the effects of the other covariates, a multivariable analysis indicated that a high level of active ageing (adj. odds ratio [OR] = 4.51; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.27-6.23), adequate health literacy (adj. OR = 2.53; 95% CI: 1.79-3.59), age < 70 years (adj. OR = 4.09; 95% CI: 3.03-5.50), having completed secondary school or higher education (adj. OR = 2.43; 95% CI: 1.57-3.76), and having a monthly household income > 15,000 baht (adj. OR = 3.01; 95% CI: 1.73-5.22) were significantly associated with good QOL in the sample. Conclusion: The QOL of the elderly must be prioritised. Active ageing and health literacy should be promoted as part of socioeconomic and health policies. Negative attitudes and 'ageism' towards the elderly should be reduced among populations of all ages. Health communication for members of a demographic with limited health literacy should be enhanced, and employment of the elderly encouraged.

AB  - Background: While more women with physical disabilities are becoming mothers, many encounter barriers to perinatal care and experience poor outcomes. Little is known about the perinatal care experiences and outcomes of women with physical disabilities in Canada.
   Objective: This qualitative study sought to understand the perinatal care experiences and outcomes of women with physical disabilities in one Canadian province, with an emphasis on identifying barriers to care.
   Methods: In-depth interviews were conducted with 13 women with physical disabilities who had given birth in the last 5 years. Follow-up interviews were conducted with 10 of the 13 participants. All interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis was informed by a constructivist grounded theory approach.
   Results: Based on analysis of participants' interviews, five themes regarding barriers to care were identified: (1) Inaccessible care settings, (2) Negative attitudes, (3) Lack of knowledge and experience, (4) Lack of communication and collaboration among providers, and (5) Misunderstandings of disability and disability-related needs.
   Conclusions: Study findings reveal that the perinatal care system is not set up with women with physical disabilities in mind and that barriers to perinatal care may contribute to poor outcomes. More research and training are needed to address barriers to perinatal care for women with physical disabilities. Collaboration among perinatal and disability-related providers and meaningful inclusion of women with physical disabilities in educational initiatives and care plans are vital to improve care experiences and outcomes.

AB  - Background There is research evidence regarding the presence of stigmatising attitudes in psychiatrists towards people with mental illness, but a lack of studies and interventions focused on this issue in low and middle-income countries. Aims To assess the feasibility of implementing an anti-stigma intervention for Mexican psychiatric trainees, and its potential effects. Methods This study comprised a pre-post design with outcome measures compared between baseline and 3-month follow-up. Quantitative outcome measures were used to evaluate the potential effects of the intervention, whilst the process evaluation required the collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. Results Twenty-nine trainees (25% of those invited) participated in the intervention, of whom 18 also participated in the follow-up assessment. Outcome measures showed the intervention had moderately large effects on reducing stereotypes and the influence of other co-workers on trainees' own attitudes. The main mechanisms of impact identified were recognition of negative attitudes in oneself and colleagues, self-reflection about the impact of stigma, one's own negative attitudes and recognition of one's ability to make change. Participants accepted and were satisfied with the intervention, which many considered should be part of their routine training. However, trainees' work overload and lack of support from the host organisation were identified as barriers to implement the intervention. Conclusions A brief anti-stigma intervention for Mexican psychiatric trainees is feasible, potentially effective, well accepted and was considered necessary by participants. This study also suggests mechanisms of impact and mediators should be considered for developing further interventions, contributing to reducing the damaging effects that mental health-related stigma has on people's lives.

AB  - Prosocial games often utilize a direct, explicit approach to engage players with serious real-life scenarios and present information about key societal issues. This approach, however, may limit a game's persuasive impact and ability to produce beneficial outcomes, particularly when the apparent aims of the game trigger players' psychological defenses or reduce players' potential engagement with - and enjoyment of - the game experience. In contrast, the "Embedded Design" approach that we introduce here offers effective, evidence-based strategies for more stealthily or covertly delivering persuasive content in a game in a fashion that circumvents players' psychological defenses and triggers a more receptive mindset. This paper provides an in-depth exploration of two key Embedded Design strategies: (1) intermixing: combining "on-topic" and "off-topic" game content in order to make the focal message or theme less obvious and more accessible and (2) obfuscating: using game genres or framing devices that direct players' attention or expectations away from the game's true aims. To illustrate the implementation and effectiveness of these strategies, we detail the design of two games that utilize a number of these techniques to reduce stereotypes and biases and present the methods and results of a set of empirical studies testing the prosocial impact of these games. In addition, we introduce a number of other Embedded Design strategies that have emerged in our work and discuss the most viable contexts for the use of this design approach.

AB  - This study addresses Douglas Pratt's 2010 claim that New Zealand's non-Muslim majority experience "angst" in relation to a growing Muslim population. Based on interviews with non-Muslim New Zealanders we identified two key discourses. Firstly, participants constructed New Zealand as a safe haven and as tolerant and accepting of different religions and cultures. However, this tolerance and acceptance was conditional on Muslim assimilation and on participants' sense of security and safety. Secondly, in constructing Muslims, gender-based oppression was created as problematic. Further, Muslims were constructed as not all terrorists, suggesting a default link between Islam and terrorism. Media was constructed as deliberately overplaying this link. Overall, angst about the increasing numbers of Muslims in New Zealand society was not identified. However, the core underlying stance was that, to be accepted, those with different social norms should assimilate and not threaten current cultural norms. Covert racism was highlighted in this study.

AB  - Value incongruence between employees and organizations has been identified as a negative work condition. An attitude-based account suggests that value incongruence gives rise to negative attitudes toward organizations and thus causes low performance. To complement this mechanism, we propose a resource-based account based on ego-depletion theory, which suggests that value incongruence consumes an individual's regulatory resources and leads to low work performance. In support of this view, results from 2 survey studies and a vignette experiment reveal that value incongruence is positively associated with ego depletion, which in turn is negatively related to work performance. The mediation effect of ego depletion is independent of the attitude-based mechanism as represented by job satisfaction and affective commitment. Consistent with the affective consistency perspective, the relationship between value incongruence and ego depletion is stronger among employees high in positive affectivity and weaker among employees high in negative affectivity. The corresponding moderated mediation analysis shows that the indirect effects of value incongruence on work performance through ego depletion vary as a function of positive and negative affectivity. This investigation unravels the self-regulatory consequence of value incongruence and shows that the resource-based mechanism of value incongruence operates differentially as a function of dispositional affectivity.

AB  - Multicultural experience has been shown to lead to greater intergroup tolerance via reduced need for cognitive closure (NFCC). However, the requisite metacognitive conditions that facilitate this effect have yet to be examined. In 6 studies, we systematically demonstrated that the ameliorative effects of multicultural experience on intergroup bias are achieved only when individuals perceived that they had sufficient mental resources. Mental resources were either (a) measured during the Hong Kong "Umbrella Revolution" (Study 1), (b) experimentally manipulated in the lab through a classic depletion task (Study 2), or (c) subjectively recalled (Studies 3, 4, 5, and 6). We further showed that the moderating effects of perceived resource availability on the tolerance benefits of multicultural experience were mediated by reduced levels of NFCC (Studies 1, 5, and 6). This effect was consistent across a variety of targeted outgroups (Mainland Chinese, Arabs, Russians, Blacks, Asian Americans, and homosexuals), regardless of whether multicultural experience was measured or manipulated, and across samples (Hong Kongers, Jewish Israelis, and U.S.-born Americans). Overall, by integrating the literature on multicultural experiences with that on perceived resource depletion, we demonstrate the state-dependent nature of the advantages of multicultural experiences as well as afford a more nuanced view of the downstream influence of perceived mental depletion.

AB  - This research was undertaken to explore experiences of xenophobia by refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with the health care system in Durban, South Africa. The study adopted a qualitative methodology consisting of 31 in-depth interviews with refugees from the DRC. Framework analysis was conducted. The findings revealed that refugees face medical xenophobia during their encounter with health care workers with language barriers and documentation as the first stumbling block in efforts to seek health care services. The pervasiveness of xenophobia is also experienced in prejudice evident in ethnic slurs, unwelcome and insensitive comments and discriminatory practices, including denial of treatment, contributing to inequality in health care delivery.

AB  - Graphite dust is an important safety concern of high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTR). The graphite dust could adsorb fission products, and the radioactive dust is transported by the coolant gas and deposited on the surface of the primary loop. The simulation of coagulation, aggregation, deposition, and resuspension behavior of graphite dust requires parameters such as particle size distribution and particle shape, but currently very limited data on graphite dust is available. The only data we have are from AVR and THTR-300, however, the AVR result is likely to be prejudiced by the oil ingress. In pebble-bed HTR, graphite dust is generally produced by mechanical abrasion, in particular, by the abrasion of graphite pebbles in the lifting pipe of the fuel handling system. Here we demonstrate the generation and characterization of graphite dust that were produced by pneumatic lift. This graphite dust could substitute the real dust in HTR for characterization. The dust, exhibiting a lamellar morphology, showed a number-weighted average particle size of 2.38 mu m and a volume-weighted average size of 14.62 mu m. These two sizes were larger than the AVR and THTR results. The discrepancy is possibly due to the irradiation effect and prejudice caused by the oil ingress accident. It is also confirmed by the Raman spectrum that both the filler particle and binder contribute to the dust generation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background People with learning disabilities are frequently denied or restricted in their right to express their sexuality by restrictive policies, negative attitudes or lack of awareness of their needs. They also tend to have differing and unrecognised sexual health needs to those of the general population. Evidence suggests that acquiring a greater knowledge and awareness of sexuality and relationship issues helps to decrease these disadvantages and to promote a greater sense of well-being for this group.
   Methods The experiences of eight adults with learning disabilities attending a sexuality and relationship group, based on a mixture of validated and established sexuality and relationship programmes, were explored using a case study approach. Participants' experiences were gathered through semi-structured interviews and analysed using qualitative content analysis supported by participant observation and pre-and post-group assessment of knowledge.
   Results Participant experiences were unique and individual, with few shared opinions. All participants demonstrated increases in their total knowledge scores in the post-group assessment and felt that attending the group had changed their views on relationships; they felt that they were more able to talk to others, to trust someone, to feel confident to want longer relationships and to be married with children.
   Conclusions Sexuality and relationship groups can offer participants a beneficial and positive experience to explore such issues. The experiences of participants could be enhanced through adopting a person-centred approach and through recognising that participants have individual experiences that may not be shared within the group environment.

AB  - BackgroundImplicit attitudes are outside of conscious awareness and are thought to affect automatic responses outside of one's deliberate control, with the potential to impact physician-patient relationships.ObjectiveTo measure the nature and extent of implicit biases towards depression in internal medicine and psychiatry residents.DesignDescriptive and comparative study.ParticipantsFifty-one residents from three internal medicine programs and 35 residents from three psychiatry programs located in two states.InterventionsParticipants were sent a link to voluntarily participate in four online implicit association tests. Residents' identities were anonymous.Main MeasuresFour implicit association tests to measure the association of (1) attitude (good/bad), (2) permanence, (3) controllability, and (4) etiology with depression/physical illness.Key ResultsInternal medicine residents demonstrated a significant association between depression and negative attitudes (t(38)=6.01, p<.001, Cohen's d=.95), uncontrollability (t(35)=4.80, p<.001, Cohen's d=.79), temporariness (t(37)=2.94, p=.006, Cohen's d=.48), and a psychologic etiology (t(1)=6.91, p<.001, Cohen's d=1.24). Psychiatry residents only demonstrated an association between depression and a psychologic etiology (t(2)=4.79, p<.001, Cohen's d=4.5). When comparing the two specialties, internal medicine and psychiatry differed on two of the IATs. Internal medicine residents were more likely to associate negative attitudes with depression than psychiatry residents (t(63)=4.66, p<.001, Cohen's d=1.18) and to associate depression with being uncontrollable (t(57)=3.17, p=.002, Cohen's d=.81).ConclusionsInternal medicine residents demonstrated biases in their attitudes towards depression and significantly differed in some areas from psychiatry residents. This pilot study needs to be replicated to confirm our findings and further work needs to be done to determine the effect of these attitudes on the provision of clinical care.

AB  - This study presents the development and initial psychometric evaluation of the Religious Discrimination Scale (RDS). This 11-item instrument identified three dimensions based on perceived discrimination experiences of members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS): Perceived Prejudice, Closet Symptoms, and Negative Labels. The psychometric evaluations of the RDS indicated a strong and clear factor structure as well as good internal consistency reliability. The test of measurement and structural invariance across gender also suggested that the RDS scale is equally appropriate to be used with both men and women. Implications for practice and research as well as future directions are discussed.

AB  - Background: Many studies have been performed on the use of intergenerational programs to improve the negative attitudes and misunderstandings of adolescents toward older people with dementia. However, the findings of these studies are inconclusive. The aim of this study was to compare the long-term effects of exergaming (Kinect) and companionship programs on attitudes toward dementia and the elderly among adolescents.
   Methods: A quasi-experimental longitudinal design was used. A total of 200 adolescents aged 12-18 years old were recruited from nine schools in northern Taiwan. The adolescents were assigned to five different groups, namely, a 5-week exergaming group, a 5-week companion group, an 8-week exergaming group, an 8-week companion group, and a control group, using a single blinding procedure. Data collection was performed pretest, post-test and at 1, 3 and 6 months after the post-test. The long-term effects of the two programs (i.e., exergaming and companionship) were analyzed using a generalized estimating equation.
   Results: Regarding attitudes toward dementia, the 8-week exergaming group had a significantly better attitude than the control group at the 6-month follow-up (p < 0.001). Similarly, the results of the 8-week companion group also showed a significantly improved attitude compared with the control group at the 6-month follow-up (p = 0.041). Regarding attitudes toward the elderly, the 8-week exergaming group had a significantly better attitude than the control group at the 6-month follow-up (p < 0.001). The 8-week companion group had a similar effect on better attitude compared with the control group at the 6-month follow-up (p = 0.016). Furthermore, the 5-week companion group showed a significant improvement compared with the control group at the 6-month follow-up (p=0.004).
   Conclusions: Spending companionship time with older adults is beneficial for improving the attitudes of adolescents toward the elderly. Furthermore, exergaming improves the attitudes of adolescents toward both dementia and older adults.

AB  - The attitudes of the general British population towards Muslims changed post 2001, and this change led to a significant increase in Anti-Muslim discrimination. We use this exogenous attitude change to estimate the causal impact of increased discrimination on a range of objective and subjective health outcomes. The difference-in-differences estimates indicate that discrimination worsens blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI and self-assessed general health. Thus, discrimination is a potentially important determinant of the large racial and ethnic health gaps observed in many countries. We also investigate the pathways through which discrimination impacts upon health, and find that discrimination has a negative effect on employment, perceived social support, and health-producing behaviours. Crucially, our results hold for different control groups and model specifications. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Gestures are the first signs of intentional communication within prelinguistic infants and can reflect various motives, including a declarative motive to share attention and interest. The ability to use gestures declaratively has been linked to later language development; therefore, it is important to understand the origins of this motive. Previous research has focused on the use of declarative pointing at around 12 months; however, other potential forms of declarative communication, such as holdout gestures, are yet to be studied in detail. The purpose of this study was to examine whether from 10 months, infants use holdouts declaratively. We elicited holdouts from 36 infants and then reacted to these gestures in four different conditions: (1) joint attention: shared interest; (2) infant attention: attended to infant; (3) toy attention: attended to toy; (4) ignore: gesture was not attended to. Infants' behavioral responses were recorded. When the experimenter engaged in joint attention, infants were significantly more likely to display a positive attitude and produced fewer re-engagement attempts. In contrast, the three non-joint attention conditions displayed significantly higher negative attitudes and attempts to re-engage the experimenter. We conclude that infants display declarative communication prior to 12 months, resetting the age at which these more complex skills emerge.

AB  - Background and aims: Weight bias contributes to the production of health disparities. This study aims to investigate attitudes and professional practice patterns of primary health care providers towards obese patients. Methods: This study was designed as a cross-sectional survey carried out among primary care health professionals (PCHP) in one district of Istanbul. Among the total 134 doctors and nurses approached, 104 gave consent to participate (77.6%). All participants filled in a 24 item obesity perception survey (OPS) which contained two subtopics: personal attitudes and professional practice patterns. Participants were asked to rate each statement in the survey according to a 5 point Likert scale (from 0: totally disagree, to 5: totally agree). Results: Among the participants 23.1% (n=24) were male and 50.9% were physicians (n=53). The Cronbach's alpha for the whole perception scale was 0.86. Significantly more nurses than physicians do not want to work with (chi(2)=4.62; p=0.032) and prefer not to provide service to an obese person (chi(2)=8.17; p=0.004). When independent variables such as the personal attitudes subtopic score, body mass index, age, gender, professional status (nurse or doctor) and years of work experience were put in the stepwise linear regression analysis, the personal attitudes score was found to be accountable for 64% of the variance for professional practice patterns score (adjusted R(2)=0.64, p<0.000; B +/- SE: 0.69 +/- 0.05). Conclusions: Our findings showed that obesity elicited some negative attitudes from PCHPs and the professional practice patterns towards obese patients were associated with personal attitudes to a large extent.

AB  - This article considers some of the impacts of armed political conflicts on field supervision where supervisor and student are affiliated with different sides, as exemplified by the Jewish supervisor/Arab student dyad in social work training in Israel. This conflict, it suggests, impedes the development of a trusting supervisory bond, makes it difficult for supervisors to provide candid feedback and evaluation, and impairs the students' development of professional identity. The article ends with detailed recommendations for dealing with the many practical issues that arise in field supervision in the context of armed conflicts.

AB  - Lesbian, bisexual and queer (LBQ) women experience pervasive sexual stigma that harms wellbeing. Stigma is a multi-dimensional construct and includes perceived stigma, awareness of negative attitudes towards one's group, and enacted stigma, overt experiences of discrimination. Despite its complexity, sexual stigma research has generally explored singular forms of sexual stigma among LBQ women. The study objective was to develop a scale to assess perceived and enacted sexual stigma among LBQ women. We adapted a sexual stigma scale for use with LBQ women. The validation process involved 3 phases. First, we held a focus group where we engaged a purposively selected group of key informants in cognitive interviewing techniques to modify the survey items to enhance relevance to LBQ women. Second, we implemented an internet-based, cross-sectional survey with LBQ women (n = 466) in Toronto, Canada. Third, we administered an internet-based survey at baseline and 6-week follow-up with LBQ women in Toronto (n = 24) and Calgary (n = 20). We conducted an exploratory factor analysis using principal components analysis and descriptive statistics to explore health and demographic correlates of the sexual stigma scale. Analyses yielded one scale with two factors: perceived and enacted sexual stigma. The total scale and subscales demonstrated adequate internal reliability (total scale alpha coefficient: 0.78; perceived sub-scale: 0.70; enacted sub-scale: 0.72), test-retest reliability, and construct validity. Perceived and enacted sexual stigma were associated with higher rates of depressive symptoms and lower self-esteem, social support, and self-rated health scores. Results suggest this sexual stigma scale adapted for LBQ women has good psychometric properties and addresses enacted and perceived stigma dimensions. The overwhelming majority of participants reported experiences of perceived sexual stigma. This underscores the importance of moving beyond a singular focus on discrimination to explore perceptions of social judgment, negative attitudes and social norms.

TI  - THE ROLE OF THE DOCTRINE OF LACHES IN UNDERMINING THE HOLOCAUST EXPROPRIATED ART RECOVERY ACT
T2  - VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - GOOD-FAITH
AB  - From 1933 to 1945, the Nazi regime looted art on a scale with few historical competitors. The Nazis used this state-sanctioned theft to dehumanize the Jewish population and carry out the "Aryanization" of German society.
   To provide redress for the victims of Nazi looting, the United States and the international community adopted the Washington Principles in 1998 a set of guidelines intended to promote a 'just and fair" solution for claims over Nazi-looted art. Unfortunately, despite this commitment, lawsuits to recover stolen artwork are often barred by time-based defenses.
   In 2016, Congress passed the Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act ("HEAR Act") to promote resolution on the merits by effectively removing the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense. Surprisingly, however, Congress left the doctrine of laches available, thereby frustrating the effectiveness and stated purpose of the HEAR Act. The doctrine of laches bars a claim upon a showing that the claimant unreasonably delayed in bringing suit, and that the delay caused the artwork's possessor to suffer prejudice. Yet because lawsuits for restitution of Nazi-looted artwork have only recently become viable, delay and the resulting prejudice taking the form of lost evidence are inherent in these claims. The doctrine of laches thereby undermines resolution on the merits, which is antithetical to the HEAR Act's putative goals.
   This Note argues that for the HEAR Act to provide the relief it ostensibly envisions, the doctrine of laches should be precluded as an available defense. Alternatively, the ability to assert the defense should be restricted to those parties who acquired contested artwork in true good faith. By revising the HEAR Act accordingly, a "just and fair" solution can be achieved.

AB  - The extreme pressure resulting from modern-day disasters in terms of severe shortages of resources, mass casualties, infrastructure breakdown, large-scale damage and their impact necessitate coordination between all the agencies involved in disaster response. Better coordination in international disaster response operations will make them more effective in organizing the different phases of relief, rehabilitation and recovery. Recent disasters such as the hurricane Katrina, the Indian Ocean tsunami and the earthquake in Haiti have seen multiple civil agencies and the military working together. However, challenges have been identified in civil-military coordination. Differences in working procedures and a lack of knowledge on the other's organizational identities resulted in stereotyping and prejudices, which are root obstacles to coordination. The aim of this study was to identify the perception-related challenges in civil-military coordination, and how they are perceived in the field by civil and military teams, and to investigate whether perception-related challenges and their implications have been reported in the international literature. A systematic literature review and 12 semi-structured interviews were carried out to answer these questions. Nine out of the 12 respondents were practitioners from the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB) and the Swedish military, with experience of international disaster response missions that involved civil-military interactions, and 3 were trainees from Karlberg Military Academy, Stockholm, who were expected to participate in similar operations in the near future. The questions asked during the interviews were based on the systematic literature review. National backgrounds, attitudes and perceptions of the professionals towards the other organization were found to be key factors influencing civil-military coordination. This indicates that comparisons between the perceptions of professionals from both civil and military teams with different nationalities and different political histories should be carried out in future research.

AB  - This article proposes that addressing the complex ethnic and racial issues of the 21st century will require a diversity science. A diversity science will consider how people create, interpret, and maintain group differences among individuals, as well as the psychological and societal consequences of these distinctions. A diversity science will recognize that these significant social distinctions (in the case of this article, race and ethnicity) are not simply natural, neutral, or abstract. Instead they are created and re-created in the process of everyday social interactions that are grounded in historically derived ideas and beliefs about difference and in a set of practices and institutions that reflect these ideas and beliefs and that therefore shape psychological experience and behavior. According to this osocioculturalo framework, psychological experience and behavior, in turn, reinforce particular cultural and structural realities. As an initial step toward a diversity science, this article reviews the roots and consequences of two examples of how to think about difference, color blindness and multiculturalism. Through this sociocultural lens, intergroup behaviors can be understood as more than just products of individual prejudice. This article also proposes that a comprehensive diversity science requires a critical examination of majority group perspectives, minority group perspectives, and their dynamic interaction beyond the typical Black-White binary. Such a diversity science has the potential to help meaningfully inform race-related policy.

AB  - Information technology has brought with it many advantages for organisations, but information security is still a major concern for organisations which rely on such technology. Users, whether with intent or through negligence, are a great source of potential of risk to information assets. A lack of awareness, negligence, resistance, disobedience, apathy and mischievousness are root causes of information security incidents in organisations. As such, insider threats have attracted the attention of a number of experts in this domain. Two particularly important considerations when exploring insider threats are motivation and opportunity. Two fundamental theories relating to these phenomena, and on which the research presented in this paper relies, are Social Bond Theory (SBT), which can be used to help undermine motivation to engage in misbehaviour, and Situational Crime Prevention Theory (SCPT), which can be used to reduce opportunities for misbehaviour. The results of our data analysis show that situational prevention factors such as increasing the effort and risk involved in a crime, reducing the rewards and removing excuses can significantly promotes the adoption of negative attitudes towards misbehaviour, though reducing provocations does not have any effect on attitudes. Further, social bond factors such as a commitment to organisational policies and procedures, involvement in information security activities and personal norms also significantly promotes the adoption of negative attitudes towards misbehaviour. Flowever, attachment does not significantly promote an attitude of misbehaviour avoidance on the part of employees. Finally, our findings also show that a negative attitude towards misbehaviour influences the employees' intentions towards engaging in misbehaviour positively, and this in turn reduces insider threat behaviour. The outputs of this study shed some light on factors which play a role in reducing misbehaviour in the domain of information security for academics and practitioners. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to evaluate the students' perception of their learning experiences concerning serious gaming and gamification instructions and determines whether they were motivated enough and engaged during the educative process in a resource-poor context. Moreover, the study evaluated the impact of interactive instructional environment outcomes in terms of students' perceptions of the learning catalysed by gamified systems, particularly in enhancing attitude change coupled with knowledge acquisition.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study used a qualitative research design technique to collect the data. A total of 108 first year secondary school students participated in a sexual health literacy course that lasted for a five-week learning period. Using a Cluster-sampling technique, three classes were randomly ' assigned to serious gaming, gamification and teacher-centred instructions. Individual face-to-face interviews were used to assess students' perceives required satisfaction with three instructions. Data were audio-recorded, and coding analysis was used using NVivo software facilitated qualitative data analysis.
   Findings - The results show that serious gaming and gamification instructions trumped the traditional teacher-centred instruction method. While intervention students were all positive about the serious gaming and gamification instructions, non-intervention students were negative about conservative teacher-centered learning whose limited interactivity also undermined learning relative to the two innovative interventions.
   Research limitations/implications - As a justification to limit face-to-face classes. this study may be useful during an emergency phenomenon, including the current situation of amid COVID-19. The implementation of serious gaming and gamilication as remotely instructional options could be among the measures to protect educational communities through reducing close-proximity, and eventually, control contamination and the spread of viruses.
   Originality/value - The application of serious gaming and game elements should not be conceptualised as universal but context-specific. This study shows that particularism is essential to optimise the results in terms of coming up with a specific design based on the scope of evaluation for positive results and develop an intervention that will work, especially in the resource-poor context of the developing world.

AB  - Background: Online grocery stores offer opportunities to encourage healthier food choices at the moment that consumers place a product of their choice in their basket. This study assessed the effect of a swap offer, Nutri-Score labeling, and a descriptive norm message on the nutrient profiling (NP) score of food choices in an online food basket. Additionally explored was whether these interventions made it more motivating and easier for consumers to select healthier foods and whether potential effects were moderated by consumer health interest.
   Methods: Hypotheses were tested with a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in a simulated online supermarket. Dutch participants (n = 550) chose their preferred product out of six product options for four different categories (breakfast cereals, crackers, pizza, and muesli bars). Participants were randomly allocated to one of eight groups based on the interventions in a 2 (Nutri-Score: present, not present) X 2 (swap offer: present, not present) X 2 (norm message: present, not present) between subject design. The primary outcome was the difference in combined NP score of product choices, for which a lower score represented a healthier product.
   Results: Swap offer (B = - 9.58, 95% CI: [- 12.026; - 7.132], eta(2) = 0.098) and Nutri-Score labeling (B = - 3.28, 95% CI: [- 5.724; -.829], eta(2) = 0.013) significantly improved the combined NP score compared to the control condition (NP score M = 18.03, SD = 14.02), whereas a norm message did not have a significant effect (B = - 1.378, 95% CI [- 3.825; 1.070], eta(2) = 0.002). No evidence was found that interventions made it more motivating or easier for consumers to select healthier food, but situational motivation significantly influenced the healthiness score of food choices for both swap offer (b = - 3.40, p < .001) and Nutri-Score (b = - 3.25, p < .001). Consumer health interest only significantly moderated the influence of Nutri-Score on ease of identifying the healthy food option (b = .23, p = .04).
   Conclusions: Swap offer and Nutri-Score labeling were effective in enhancing healthy purchase behavior in the online store environment.

AB  - We integrate the Dual Process Model of Ideology and Prejudice to examine the motivations associated with attitudes toward intergroup relations with Chinese people in New Zealand. We conducted a Structural Equation Model using data from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (N=15,608) to predict (a) warmth toward Chinese people, (b) support for policies promoting increased immigration from China, and (c) support for policies promoting greater trade ties between China and New Zealand. Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) were uniquely negatively associated with warmth toward Chinese and support for Chinese immigration. However, and as predicted, SDO was positively associated with support for increased trade, whereas RWA was negatively associated. Overall, SDO was most strongly related with low warmth, while RWA was most strongly associated with anti-immigration attitudes. Our model identifies key motives of group-based dominance (SDO) and threat-driven social cohesion (RWA) that inform prejudicial attitudes toward Chinese people in New Zealand. More generally, our model identifies nuances within the DPM framework, revealing subtle differences in the ways SDO and RWA are associated with closely related yet distinct aspects of New Zealanders' attitudes toward intergroup relations with China and Chinese peoples.

AB  - We sought to determine who the public perceives as most contributing to the rise in obesity and to identify the determinants of such perceptions. A nationwide survey was conducted among 800 US individuals. Respondents were asked to place each of seven entities (food manufacturers, grocery stores, restaurants, government policies, farmers, individuals, and parents) into three categories: primarily, somewhat, and not to blame for the rise in obesity. Eighty percent said individuals were primarily to blame for the rise in obesity. Parents were the next-most blameworthy group, with 59% ascribing primary blame. Responses fell along three dimensions related to individual responsibility, agribusiness responsibility, and government-farm policy. A number of individual-specific factors were associated with perceptions of blame. For example, individuals with a more statist score on the economic political ideology scale were more likely to blame the government and agribusiness for obesity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Intergroup contact is key to social cohesion, yet psychological barriers block engagement with diversity even when contact opportunities are abundant. We lack an advanced understanding of contact seeking because intergroup contact is often an independent variable in research, and studies on contact seeking have favoured experimental probing of selected factors or measured only broad behavioural intentions. This research carried out the first ecological tests of a novel multilayer-multivariate framework to contact seeking/avoiding. These tests were centred on a Muslim-led community contact-based initiative with visible support from local authorities following a terrorist attack. Non-Muslim Australian women (N = 1,347) contributed field data on their situated contact motivations, choices, and attendance at an intercultural educational stall; many (N = 559) completed a profiling test battery. Among those who responded to the initiative invite, the rate of taking up the high-salience contact opportunity in this heated setting was high and reflected multiple approach/avoidance motivations. Contact seeking/avoiding was not just allophilia/prejudice; it presented as new typologies of politicized solidarity, courage, apathy, and moral outrage. While intergroup predictors were significant across all profiling analyses, intrapersonal and interpersonal predictors also regularly contributed to explain variance in non-Muslims' contact motivations and choices, confirming their multilayer-multivariate nature.

AB  - Compassion underlies kindness and as such, is important for creating harmonious societies. We examined children and adolescents' personal experiences of compassion and then how youth with different compassion profiles differed in their kindness (i.e., dispositional sympathy and prosocial behavior). An ethnically diverse sample of 8-, 11-, and 15-year-olds (N = 32; 66% girls) provided narratives of times they felt compassion. Next, in another diverse sample of 7-, 11-, and 15-year-olds (N = 168; 49% girls), we assessed youths' potential for global compassion (i.e., compassion that transcends intergroup boundaries) using a novel interview procedure. We also collected self- and caregiver-reports of dispositional sympathy and prosocial behavior. Youths' narratives revealed that youth often experienced compassion toward peers and relatives following both physical and psychological sufferance and often mentioned responding to the suffering other with helping behavior. On average, youth reported moderate levels of global compassion (i.e., compassion toward a suffering victimizer) and developmental trends revealed that 15-year-olds reported lower feelings of compassion than 11-year-olds. Next, latent profile analysis showed that compassion-oriented youth (i.e., youth who displayed moderate-high levels of global compassion) were rated as more prosocial than non-compassion-oriented youth (i.e., those who displayed low levels of global compassion). We discuss findings in relation to theory and research on the development of kindness in general and in intergroup contexts.

AB  - This study explored the impact of white space in advertisements on consumers' perception of and attitude toward the advertisement. Participants (N= 333) took part in two studies online. The results show that more (vs. less) white space increased independent self-construal consumers' positive attitudes toward the advertisement by increasing the relative effect of freedom on advertisement attitudes (Study 1). Moreover, print advertisements with more (vs. less) white space increased interdependent self-construal consumers' negative attitudes toward the advertisement by increasing the relative effect of loneliness on advertisement attitudes (Study 2). The findings contribute to the literature on symbolic associations by demonstrating the multiple effects of white space in visual design. Effective visual design can meet consumers' needs and enhance their preference for an advertisement.

AB  - Objectives: Human biologists are increasingly engaging with current global trends toward obesity. However, little is considered about how variation in cultural views of fat might shape the biology of obesity, such as through pathways related to socially induced stress. Recent research indicates elevated levels of explicit fat-stigma in middle income nations, suggesting potentially high levels of psychosocial stress around being fat. We use the case of Paraguay to test if high levels of explicit prejudice around being fat also suggest internalization of those ideas in ways that might predict stress effects. Methods: Using a sample of women in Paraguay (N = 200), we test if the statement of anti-fat beliefs on standard scales correlates with similarly strong level of cognitive bias against fat based on an implicit association test. We confirm reasonable comparability of the findings to prior published studies by collecting data for U. S. undergraduates (N = 66) using the same set of tools. Results: Women in Paraguay reveal high levels of explicit anti-fat bias in an interview on a standard (Attitudes to Obese People) scale, suggesting a shared cultural norm of fat-is-bad. However, Paraguayan women display, on average, no anti-fat stigma in cognitive testing. Conclusion: In contrast to what has been observed in industrialized nations, the high levels of explicit fat-stigma does not necessarily correlate with high levels of implicit fat-stigma. This means that pathways between obesity, psychosocial stress, and health outcomes may be very different across socioecological contexts. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 24: 332-338, 2012.

AB  - This article argues that traditional Christology is intimately bound up with a triumphalist agenda that denies Jesus Jewishness and is structurally antisemitic. Taking an antiracist stance, the article argues that systemic rethinking of Christianitys theological resources is needed, which must be anti-antisemitic and antiracist. This involves reconfiguring how we take on board Jesus Jewishness in a post-Holocaust context and recognizing Jesus as a Jewish prophet. From this, it is tentatively suggested that rethinking the role of the Messiah involves understanding a Levinasian Messiah who does not come, but rather calls upon us to act in a Messianic role before the Other as an ethical imperative.

AB  - Study Objective: Long acting reversible contraceptives, including etonogestrel implants, are top tier contraceptives for adolescents, yet they remained underutilized. This study aimed to assess awareness of and attitudes toward etonogestrel implants among adolescent and young adult women.
   Design, Main Outcome Measures: This is a cross sectional study. We distributed an original, self-administered survey to a convenience sample of anonymous subjects. The survey assessed demographic information, pregnancy and sexual history, general contraceptive preferences, and awareness of implants. Subjects then read a brief description of implants before completing the section assessing attitudes toward them. We used chi-square and t-test analyses to identify factors associated with awareness of and positive attitudes toward implants.
   Setting, Participants: Women aged 10-24 attending a birth control education group at an adolescent health center in New York City.
   Results: Of the 129 participants, only 40% had heard of etonogestrel implants. Some (33%) reported positive attitudes toward implants. Positive attitudes were associated with preferences for birth control convenience (OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 1.1-9.5) and privacy (OR = 2.2, 95% Cl = 1.0-4.8). Neutral or negative attitudes were associated with a preference for birth control that maintained menstrual regularity (OR = 0.4, 95% Cl = 0.2-0.8) and with having experienced at least 1 unintended pregnancy (OR = 0.4, 95% Cl = 0.2-0.9). Age, race, and education were not associated with participants' attitudes toward implants.
   Conclusions: Women who value convenience and privacy are more likely to report positive attitudes toward implants, and thus may represent especially receptive candidates for them.

AB  - Can intergroup contact build social cohesion after war? I randomly assigned Iraqi Christians displaced by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) to an all-Christian soccer team or to a team mixed with Muslims. The intervention improved behaviors toward Muslim peers: Christians with Muslim teammates were more likely to vote for a Muslim (not on their team) to receive a sportsmanship award, register for a mixed team next season, and train with Muslims 6 months after the intervention. The intervention did not substantially affect behaviors in other social contexts, such as patronizing a restaurant in Muslim-dominated Mosul or attending a mixed social event, nor did it yield consistent effects on intergroup attitudes. Although contact can build tolerant behaviors toward peers within an intervention, building broader social cohesion outside of it is more challenging.

AB  - Purpose
   Microaggressions are subtle verbal or nonverbal everyday behaviors that arise from unconscious bias, covert prejudice, or hostility. They may contribute to the persistent disparities faced by women in medicine. In this study, the authors sought to identify common microaggressions experienced by women faculty in medicine and to determine if specific demographic characteristics affect the reported frequencies of these microaggressions.
   Method
   The authors used chain referral sampling to collect real-life anecdotes about microaggressions from women faculty across the nation. Thirty-four unique experiences from those reported were identified and scripted then reenacted using professional actors to create 34 videos of the real-life microaggressions and 34 corresponding fictional "control" versions of the same situations. The videos, presented in a random order, were evaluated by faculty from 4 academic medical centers from 2016 to 2018.
   Results
   A total of 124 faculty (79 women, 45 men) participated. Women reported higher frequencies of microaggressions than men in 33 of the 34 videos depicting microaggressions (P value range: < .001 to .042, area under the curve range: 0.60-0.69). No such differences were seen with the control videos. Women identified 21 microaggressions as occurring frequently. No significant differences were found with respect to participants' age, race/ethnicity, academic rank, or years in medicine. Post hoc analyses showed that the microaggressions fell into 6 themes: encountering sexism, encountering pregnancy- and child care-related bias, having abilities underestimated, encountering sexually inappropriate comments, being relegated to mundane tasks, and feeling excluded/marginalized.
   Conclusions
   Privilege is often invisible to those who have it, whereas bias and discrimination are readily apparent to those who experience it. Knowledge of common microaggressions will allow for targeted individual, interpersonal, and institutional solutions to mitigate disparities in medicine.

AB  - Purpose: Disapproval of homosexuality is the cause of tremendous suffering among sexual minorities. No research has examined determinants of Vietnamese attitudes toward homosexuality. This article examined predictors of such attitudes among Vietnamese youth.
   Methods: Data were from Vietnamese youth aged 15-24 years nationally surveyed in 2009 (Survey Assessment of Vietnamese Youth II). We evaluated structural equation models in which homosexuality tolerance was conceptualized to be influenced by two tiers of predictors: tier 1 (more proximal) including traditional sexual values and self-esteem and tier 2 (more distal) including demographic/contextual variables (urban residence, college education, Internet use, age, and marital status). Female (n = 3,135) and male (n = 3,072) data were analyzed separately.
   Results: Sexual conservativeness predicted intolerance in both men and women; value of fidelity also predicted intolerance in women. Self-esteem was nonsignificant for women; for men, positive self-perception was nonsignificant, but negative self-perception predicted tolerance. College education, urban residence, and Internet use predicted tolerance, with gender differences.
   Conclusions: Findings about traditional sexual values, college education, urban residence, and the gender difference in whether self-esteem matters are consistent with the literature. The positive association of Internet use with tolerance was first theorized and tested in this study. The study informs discussions on practice, in terms of tailoring/targeting attitude change interventions to rural versus urban youth and male versus female youth, capitalizing on the Internet to promote respect of sexual diversity, and locating attitudes toward homosexuality within the broader approach to sexuality.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to examine the relationship between socioeconomic status, parental control, and authoritarianism in Iran. A sample of 460 students was surveyed from Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz in Iran. Results demonstrated that subjective socioeconomic status, parental control, and parents' education have significant influence on authoritarianism. Further analysis showed that parental control partially mediates parents' education association with authoritarianism with a relatively high effect size. These findings highlight the importance of parental control and socioeconomic status in the development of authoritarianism in Iran. Furthermore, the higher authoritarianism of low socioeconomic status is mostly due to lower education levels rather than the income of the family. The findings were discussed with regards to literature as well as the socio-cultural sphere of Iran.

AB  - Rape is the most demoralizing type of crime violating human rights worldwide. Research has primarily focused on children and women's experiences of rape, even though victims include men and little documentation available concerning their experiences of reporting these incidents. The study aimed to investigate men's experiences when reporting rape to the police. An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis was used to collect and analyze qualitative data from a purposive sample of eleven men who were rape victims. The findings of the study revealed three superordinate and twenty-two subordinate themes. First, motivation for reporting rape to the police included self-protection from re-victimization, being killed, and prevalent prison cultural practice, seeking justice and answers for rape, moral duty, family support, and encouraging reports of the crime. Second, perceived barriers for reporting rape included fear of stigmatization and ridicule, unknown perpetrators, internalized homophobia, men's preconceived prejudices, perceived justice system delays, fear of being killed, and protecting their reputation. Third, negative experiences when reporting rape included a long waiting period at the reception before opening a case file and the delayed responses of police investigating the rape scene. Also, there was discouragement from the police, disparaging behavior of police, victim-blaming, lack of communication with the victim about case progress and experiences of police homosexual intolerance. The findings show that most men were motivated to report rape to the police despite the perceived barriers and negative experiences they had with the police. Thus, this provides baseline evidence for strategies to be developed to encourage the reporting of rape. Each police station must provide dedicated personnel for professional and sensitive handling of all rape victims, including men. Furthermore, future studies should be conducted to evaluate rape victims' satisfaction with the services provided by the police.

AB  - The assessment of students by the social work academy measures their performances on standardized tests. Accusations of racial bias and other prejudices have long challenged the legitimacy of such tests, which may be unofficially used as indicators of an applicant's intellectual and scholastic potential. When combined with GPA, the highest integrity is assumed. GPA is an acronym for a student's grade point average. Most commonly, GPAs are used to give account of academic achievement. Thus, GPAs may be more valued by students than their standardized test score or subject matter, given the institutional weight placed upon such information. GRE is an acronym that stands for Graduate Record Examination, which, in social work, often contrasts with GPA. It is a standardized test designed to predict how well a student applicant might perform in postsecondary education. The significance of GPA to students cannot be overstated. Subsequently, student evaluations of faculty teaching empower students to cultivate instructors for inflated grades. In the aftermath, this poses a challenge to the academy: how much authority capital is it willing to assign to investigation? This is an investment in maintaining prestige of the social work profession commensurate with the future of its ethical ideals.

AB  - This study utilized a comparative case study analysis to investigate how gender influenced the experiences of participants in a leadership development program (principal preparation program) designed to lead public K-12 schools identified as requiring turnaround. We closely focused on two participants, a man and a woman, and compared the ways each participant made meaning of his/her experiences as developing leaders in the program. Although both participants conceptualized effective leadership in similar communally-oriented ways, the way they came to construct their identities as leaders varied greatly. These differences were largely influenced by different and, what appeared to be, gendered feedback occurring during the program and when participants entered the job market.

AB  - Rationale: Physician bias against sexual minorities can hinder the delivery of high-quality health care and thus contribute to the disproportionate prevalence of negative health outcomes within this population. Medical students' interpersonal experiences within the context of medical school may contribute to this bias.
   Objective: The goal of the current research was to examine the relationship between these interpersonal experiences, reported by heterosexual, cisgender medical students, and explicit and implicit bias against lesbians and gay individuals, reported two years later during second year of medical residency.
   Method: Data were collected by surveying students (n = 2940) from a stratified sample of U.S. medical schools in fall 2010 (first semester of medical school), spring 2014 (final semester of medical school), and spring 2016 (second year of medical residency).
   Results: Amount and favorability of contact with LGBT individuals, reported during the final semester of medical school, predicted lower levels of explicit bias against lesbian and gay individuals during second year of medical residency. Additionally, exposure to negative role modeling, also reported during the final semester of medical school, predicted higher levels of explicit bias against lesbian and gay individuals during second year of medical residency. Amount of contact with LGBT individuals - and in particular, with LGBT medical students - predicted lower levels of implicit bias against lesbian and gay individuals during second year of medical residency. Neither favorability of contact with LGBT individuals nor exposure to negative role modeling predicted implicit bias against lesbian and gay individuals during second year of medical residency.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that interpersonal experiences during medical school can systematically shape heterosexual, cisgender physicians' subsequent explicit and implicit bias against lesbian and gay individuals.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the barriers Turkish women academics working in state universities face throughout their career progression. The research was formed in qualitative research design. Data was collected through face-to-face interviews with a semi-structured interview form. 20 women academics in total including nine professors, one assistant professor, two doctors and eight instructors from a variety of disciplines participated in the research. Content analysis was conducted and the themes that emerged as a result of the data analysis were "Support", "Career Breaks", and "Social Factors: Self-Confidence, Prejudice, and Role Conflict". The themes were supported by direct quotations from the participants' responses. Recommendations were made related to the findings of the research.

AB  - Past research has shown that intergroup contact can be a promising intervention to improve intergroup relations and that contact-based interventions might be most effective during adolescence. In postconflict Northern Ireland, widespread residential segregation and a largely separate school system limit opportunities for intergroup contact between adolescents from the Catholic and Protestant communities. We evaluated whether a large-scale intervention to facilitate intergroup contact between students attending separate schools (the 'Shared Education' program) improves a range of outcomes relevant for intergroup relations in Northern Ireland. We conducted a 5-wave longitudinal, quasi-experimental study that followed a large sample of school students (N = 5,159, M-age = 12.4, age range: 10-14 years; 2,988 girls, 2,044 boys) from 56 predominantly Catholic or Protestant schools from sixth to tenth grade. We compared the developmental trajectories of students who, in 9th (14-15 years) and 10th (15-16 years) grade, shared some classes with students from the other community, as part of the program, to students who did not. We found that participating in shared classes had a medium-size, positive effect on the amount of intergroup contact students had outside of class, and small, positive effects on students' outgroup attitudes, outgroup trust, and intergroup empathy (but not on their intergroup anxiety, future contact intentions, deprovincialization, or multicultural beliefs). Our findings show that a school-based program of shared education can provide a viable and effective intervention to facilitate intergroup contact, improve intergroup relations, and foster social integration among adolescents at a large scale in a postconflict society.

AB  - Objectives To answer four questions: What are attitudes, knowledge and social norms around sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs)? What are current levels of trust in messages on SSBs? What is current support for, and perceived effectiveness of, the UK soft drinks industry levy (SDIL)? What is the association between attitudes, knowledge, social norms, trust, SSB consumption and sociodemographic factors; and support for, and perceived effectiveness of, the SDIL?
   Design Cross-sectional online survey.
   Setting UK.
   Participants UK respondents to the 2017 International Food Policy Study aged 18-64 years who provided information on all variables of interest (n=3104).
   Outcome measures Self-reported perceived effectiveness of, and support for, the SDIL.
   Results Most participants supported the SDIL (70%), believed it would be effective (71%), had a positive attitude to SSBs (62%), had knowledge of the link between SSBs and obesity (90%), and trusted messages from health experts (61%), but not those from the food and beverage industry (73%). Nearly half (46%) had negative social norms about drinking SSBs. In adjusted models, older age, non-consumption of SSBs, social norms to not drinks SSBs, knowledge of the link between SSBs and obesity and trust in health expert messages were associated with greater support for the SDIL, whereas having dependent children and trusting messages from the food and beverage industry were associated with less support. In adjusted models, older age was associated with lower perceived effectiveness of the SDIL, whereas social norms to not drink SSBs, negative attitudes to SSBs and trusting messages from health experts and the food and beverage industry were associated with greater perceived effectiveness.
   Conclusions There was strong support for the SDIL and belief that it would be effective. Those with more 'public health' orientated norms and trust were generally more likely to support the SDIL or believe that it would be effective.

AB  - The aim of this article is to explicate a terror management theory (TMT) analysis of the poor social and psychological well-being of African Americans by drawing upon a model of cultural trauma to explain the antecedents and effects of posttraumatic slave syndrome. Cultural trauma is defined as a state that occurs when a people's cultural worldview has been destabilized to the point where it does not effectively meet its TMT function of providing a buffer against basic anxiety and uncertainty. The article outlines how the impact of slavery was a significant trauma to African American people, which was carried forward through successive generations; providing an explanation of their current anxiety-related conditions, poor health, and maladaptive behaviors. Findings from health and justice research and qualitative data from narratives of African Americans are presented to substantiate the adaptation of a model of cultural trauma for understanding the contemporary situation of African Americans.

AB  - Residents-as-teachers (RaT) is a theoretical framework emphasizing the significance of the similar learning background of teachers and learners. In Japan, community-based medical education (CBME) is a practical approach to teaching family medicine. This study aimed to investigate the impact and challenges of RaT on the learning of medical students and residents in CBME at a rural community hospital in Japan. Over the course of a year, the researchers conducted one-on-one interviews with three residents and ten medical students participating in family medicine training at the hospital. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Grounded theory was used in the data analysis to clarify the findings. Three key themes emerged from the research: lack of educational experience with RaT, effectiveness of RaT, and challenges of RaT. Although participants were prejudiced against RaT, they felt its implementation could facilitate the establishment of beneficial relationships between learners and teachers. They were also able to participate in medical teams effectively. The findings suggest that the increased participation of senior doctors in RaT could strengthen its learning effects. RaT in rural CBME should be applied in various contexts, and its effectiveness should be further investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively.

AB  - Attitudes toward robots influence the tendency to accept or reject robotic devices. Thus it is important to investigate whether and how attitudes toward robots can change. In this pilot study we investigate attitudinal changes in elderly citizens toward a tele-operated robot in relation to three parameters: (i) the information provided about robot functionality, (ii) the number of encounters, (iii) personality type. Fourteen elderly residents at a rehabilitation center participated. Pre encounter attitudes toward robots, anthropomorphic thinking, and personality were assessed. Thereafter the participants interacted with a tele-operated robot (Telenoid) during their lunch (c. 30 min.) for up to 3 days. Half of the participants were informed that the robot was teleoperated (IC) whilst the other half were naive to its functioning (UC). Post-encounter assessments of attitudes toward robots and anthropomorphic thinking were undertaken to assess change. Attitudes toward robots were assessed with a new generic 35-items questionnaire (attitudes toward social robots scale: ASOR-5), offering a differentiated conceptualization of the conditions for social interaction. There was no significant difference between the IC and UC groups in attitude change toward robots though trends were observed. Personality was correlated with some tendencies for attitude changes; Extraversion correlated with positive attitude changes to intimate personal relatedness with the robot (r = 0.619) and to psychological relatedness (r = 0.581) whilst Neuroticism correlated negatively (r = 0.582) with mental relatedness with the robot. The results tentatively suggest that neither information about functionality nor direct repeated encounters are pivotal in changing attitudes toward robots in elderly citizens. This may reflect a cognitive congruence bias where the robot is experienced in congruence with initial attitudes, or it may support action-based explanations of cognitive dissonance reductions, given that robots, unlike computers, are not yet perceived as action targets. Specific personality traits may be indicators of attitude change relating to specific domains of social interaction. Implications and future directions are discussed.

AB  - Objective: People with mental illness (PMI) are often stigmatized or experience negative attitudes from society. In particular, nursing students' attitudes toward PMI will influence the quality of care these patients receive. Some factors influencing attitudes toward PMI among nursing students have been identified. The present study aimed to examine factors influencing attitudes toward mental illness among nursing students in Indonesia.
   Methods: Nursing students (n = 317) were assessed for attitudes toward mental illness using the Community Attitude toward the Mentally Ill questionnaire. Details regarding sociodemographic variables (age, gender, ethnicity, year of study, monthly family income, personal experience with mental illness, family history of mental illness, and knowing or having direct contact with PMI) and knowledge about mental illness by using Mental Health Knowledge Schedule questionnaire were also obtained.
   Results: The mean Community Attitude toward the Mentally Ill questionnaire score was 103.75 +/- 9.15, with the highest mean of the four subscales being that of authoritarianism 27.97 +/- 2.87 followed by social restrictiveness, community mental health ideology, and benevolence 27.52 +/- 3.68, 24.38 +/- 3.80, and 23.89 +/- 3.27, respectively. The factors significantly associated with nursing students' attitudes toward mental illness were age (r = -0.18, P = 0.001), year of study (H = 16.65, P < 0.001), knowing or having direct contact with PMI (Z = -2.35, P = 0.019), and knowledge of mental illness (r = -0.22, P < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Several demographic variables, direct contact with PMI, and level of knowledge about mental illness can contribute to variations in attitudes toward PMI among nursing students in Indonesia. Education and direct contact with PMI serve as intervention strategies to reduce negative attitudes and stigma associated with mental illness among nursing students.

AB  - Purpose: To compare the acceptability of computed tomographic (CT) colonography and flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) screening and the factors predicting CT colonographic screening participation, targeting participants in a randomized screening trial.
   Materials and Methods: Eligible individuals aged 58 years (n = 1984) living in Turin, Italy, were randomly assigned to be invited to screening for colorectal cancer with FS or CT colonography. After individuals who had died or moved away (n = 28) were excluded, 264 of 976 (27.0%) underwent screening with FS and 298 of 980 (30.4%) underwent CT colonography. All attendees and a sample of CT colonography nonattendees (n = 299) were contacted for a telephone interview 3- 6 months after invitation for screening, and screening experience and factors affecting participation were investigated. Odds ratios (ORs) were computed by means of multivariable logistic regression.
   Results: For the telephone interviews, 239 of 264 (90.6%) FS attendees, 237 of 298 (79.5%) CT colonography attendees, and 182 of 299 (60.9%) CT colonography nonattendees responded. The percentage of attendees who would recommend the test to friends or relatives was 99.1% among FS and 93.3% among CT colonography attendees. Discomfort associated with bowel preparation was higher among CT colonography than FS attendees (OR, 2.77; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.47, 5.24). CT colonography nonattendees were less likely to be men (OR, 0.36; 95% CI: 0.18, 0.71), retired (OR, 0.31; 95% CI: 0.13, 0.75), to report regular physical activity (OR, 0.37; 95% CI: 0.20, 0.70), or to have read the information leaflet (OR, 0.18; 95% CI: 0.08, 0.41). They were more likely to mention screening- related anxiety (mild: OR, 6.30; 95% CI: 2.48, 15.97; moderate or severe: OR, 3.63; 95% CI: 1.87, 7.04), erroneous beliefs about screening (OR, 32.15; 95% CI: 6.26, 165.19), or having undergone a recent fecal occult blood test (OR, 13.69; 95% CI: 3.66, 51.29).
   Conclusion: CT colonography and FS screening are well accepted, but further reducing the discomfort from bowel preparation may increase CT colonography screening acceptability. Negative attitudes, erroneous beliefs about screening, and organizational barriers are limiting screening uptake; all these factors are modifiable and therefore potentially susceptible to interventions.

AB  - It is popular to assume that there is a link between skill and performance, yet the evidence is tenuous. Both terms defy simple definition and much current work aggregates findings, conflating firms that compete on the basis of skill with those that do not. This article provides a detailed review of the difficulties involved. Skill may indeed contribute to performance on the shop floor but the performance of the organization as a whole is not the same as that of the shop-floor writ large, while soft skills are difficult to assess and judgments may be contaminated by prejudice. It concludes with suggestions for better research designs that could capture this relationship.

AB  - Saudi Arabia has two types of police forces: general police and religious police, also known as the Mutaween. While the general police are tasked with investigating criminal matters and providing national security, the Mutaween specialize in enforcing the strict religious customs of Sharia law. This study explores the factors that predict both Mutaween and general police stops, as well as general police arrests among juveniles. Additionally, we examine whether the factors that influence Mutaween stops differ from those that affect general police stops. We find that respondents reporting higher levels of delinquency are more likely to be stopped by both forces and to be arrested. Comparatively, the factors that influence police decision-making in Saudi Arabia are analogous to those found in the Western world. There appears to be little difference in the proximal effects of police action, even in a nation that affords greater potential influence to authority, prejudice, and extralegal criteria. Moreover, the factors that influence Mutaween stops are not significantly different overall from those that result in general police stops. In a nation where religious laws are legal laws, both enforcement agencies appear to share similar objectives.

AB  - Background: Although strong relationships between primary care providers (PCPs) and patients with addictive disease are essential for care, these relationships are often strained. Providers frequently have negative attitudes about treating these patients, in part due to the practical and psychosocial challenges that come with addictive disease. Resulting hostility frequently causes avoidance of primary care by patients with potentially increased morbidity. However, gaining knowledge of patient perspectives on these relationships could improve physician attitudes toward patients with addictive disease and relatedly improve care. Methods: The authors conducted 18 semistructured interviews of patients with current or prior debilitating addictive disease recruited from a primary care practice in East Baltimore. Interview transcripts were analyzed using editing analysis to reveal major themes. Results: Participants elucidated several provider characteristics that were essential for successful relationships. Providers needed to be knowledgeable about addiction, feel responsible for treating these patients, emphasize overall health, and engage patients in their own care. Additionally, participants strongly desired providers who treated them as "people" that they cared about. Interestingly, interviewees also frequently cited patient characteristics that could affect the strength of patient-provider relationships. These included being concerned about their health, feeling deserving of care, and having appropriate psychiatric care for concomitant mental health conditions. Practical obstacles and a disorganized mindset impeded patient-provider relationships. Conclusions: The interpersonal dynamics of the patient-provider relationship are particularly important for patients with addictive disease, as this relationship may be one of the most stable and rewarding in their lives. Patients felt that greater understanding of the practical and psychosocial challenges of addiction enabled providers to more effectively address their health concerns and to be more caring and less judgmental. It is hoped that this work will contribute to providers' understanding of patients with addictions, thus allowing them to form stronger relationships and ultimately provide better care.

AB  - Given the previously documented higher rates of smoking among 2-year college students in comparison with 4-year university students, this study compares smoking patterns, attitudes and motives among 2-year and 4-year college students. Two thousand two hundred and sixty-five undergraduate students aged 18-25 years at a 2-year college and a 4-year university completed an online survey in 2008. Current (past 30-day) smoking was reported by 43.5% of 2-year and 31.9% of 4-year college students, and daily smoking was reported by 19.9% of 2-year and 8.3% of 4-year college students. Attending a 2-year college was associated with higher rates of current smoking [odds ratio (OR) = 1.72] and daily smoking (OR = 2.84), and with less negative attitudes regarding smoking, controlling for age, gender, ethnicity and parental education. Also, compared with 4-year college student smokers, 2-year college smokers had lower motivation to smoke for social reasons, but more motivation to smoke for affect regulation, after controlling for age, gender, ethnicity and parental education. Two- and 4-year college students report different smoking patterns, attitudes and motives. These distinctions might inform tobacco control messages and interventions targeting these groups of young adults.

AB  - Xenophobic attitudes and actions are all-pervasive in South Africa in civil society and the state. Medical xenophobia refers to the negative attitudes and practices of health professionals and employees towards migrants and refugees based purely on their identity as non-South African. This paper examines the extent to which xenophobia manifests itself within the public institutions that offer health services to citizens and non-citizens, based on primary research with Zimbabwean migrants who try to access the system. The paper argues that medical xenophobia is deeply entrenched in the South African public health system despite being a fundamental breach of the country's Constitution and Bill of Rights, international human rights obligations and the existence of professional codes of ethics governing the treatment of patients.

Design and Methods A quantitative, nonexperimental study was conducted at a large psychiatric hospital in the United States. The Questionnaire on Attitudes and Knowledge (QuAKE) Scale was used to conduct the assessment among a convenient sample of 158 psychiatric nurses. Findings Participants' responses to questions that elicited knowledge of ECT ranged from 45% to 99% and positive attitudes ranged from 21% to 96%, revealing increased levels when compared with the low to average knowledge and positive attitudes noted in previous studies. Practice Implications Targeted ECT education is needed among psychiatric nurses with limited knowledge and negative attitudes toward ECT.

AB  - Contemporary recognition theory overemphasizes the role of rationality in human relations and fails to adequately consider the pathological valences that influence psychological motivation and social dynamics, particularly those that are unconsciously mediated. In offering an alternative Hegelian revisionist perspective, I will examine how capacities for recognition are informed by early developmental contingencies in attachment, self-formation, social relations, and the negation of difference, thereby addressing the psychodynamics of how dysrecognition and refutation of alterity lead to insidious pathologies within society and the clinic. The systemic failure to develop recognition within social collectives is rooted, I suggest, in a lack of empathy for the other.

AB  - Introduction: Epilepsy is one of the most stigmatizing disorders. Stigma and negative attitudes associated with epilepsy are due to poor public awareness and knowledge. This study evaluated knowledge, awareness, and attitude toward epilepsy among Tunisian general population. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted between 2017 and 2019. On national epilepsy day on February and during awareness campaigns at Sfax Tunisia, we asked people who visited the epilepsy stand to anonymously answer a 31-item questionnaire on epilepsy. Results: Five hundred and four participants have been included. About 43.6% of participants had personal or familial history of epilepsy. More than seventy percent of subjects thought that epilepsy is a neurological disease and 34.1% believed it is psychiatric. Majority (92.1%) of our population believed that epilepsy is non-contagious but 37.7% thought it is hereditary and 55.8% thought it causes intellectual deficiency. EEG was the most reported diagnostic method (61.7%). The two most popular therapeutic modalities reported in our population were drug treatment alone (85.3%) and associated with Quran (35.3%). Most (91.1%) of people thought that a person with epilepsy can get married. A person with epilepsy is able to study according to 92.7% of respondents, but 66.3% assumed that he/she suffers from difficulty concentrating. Subjects younger than 45 years were more aware of the ability of people with epilepsy to study and get married. We did not find any significant differences in knowledge and attitudes between subjects familiar with epilepsy and the rest of the population. Conclusion: The public knowledge and attitudes toward epilepsy were acceptable with regard to this study. However, negative attitudes and misunderstanding still exist. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The current study examines whether a distance running event has the capacity to promote participants' life satisfaction. The construct of psychological involvement was used to investigate the impact of attitude change through event preparation and subsequent activity. Data were collected four times through online surveys from running event participants (N = 211) over a five-month period. Latent growth modeling analyses revealed that participants' life satisfaction peaked immediately after the event before receding, indicating that event participation exerted a positive impact on participants' evaluations toward their lives. A positive significant association was also found between change in pleasure in running and change in life satisfaction. Findings from this study provide empirical support that a distance running event can serve as an environmental determinant that enhances participants' life satisfaction by providing positive experiences through event participation and forming psychological involvement in physical activity.

AB  - To understand how homophobia manifests itself through a Latino cultural lens of identity, a program was designed to address the issues connecting homosexual identity, culture, and Christianity. The program included screening of one of two documentary films about lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) identity and family relations. This was followed by group sharing and biblical reflections. Participants (N = 122) were asked to complete measures of homophobic attitudes and qualitative appraisal of the program. Pearson product moment correlations analyses revealed that age and political ideology were related negatively to homophobia. Eighty-five percent found the program to be very useful or useful and 95% indicated that they would recommend it to others. The complexities of the intersections of Christianity, culture, and attitudes toward homosexuality in an individual's identity were examined. The data illustrates a positive trend in changing attitudes towards homosexuality in the Latino Christian community.

AB  - This paper reviews the relationship between employees' perceived CSR and its dimensions and work outcomes, and explores the moderating effects of the samples' demographic characteristics (i.e., gender, age), and national culture, based on a meta-analysis of 65 studies from 67 samples. Results show that perceived CSR and its dimensions are positively related to employees' positive attitudes and behaviours, and negatively related to their negative attitudes and behaviours. The results also partially support the moderating effects of the samples' demographic characteristics in terms of age and gender, and national culture. This study supplements existing theoretical review articles, and further confirms the psychological effects of perceived CSR. In addition, the results further confirm the rationality of CSR practices and provide suggestions for enterprises to better use CSR strategies to motivate their employees.

AB  - Background: Media coverage and scholarly research have reported that Asian people who reside in the United States have been the targets of racially motivated incidents during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Objective: This study aimed to examine the types of discrimination and worries experienced by Asians and Asian Americans living in the United States during the pandemic, as well as factors that were associated with everyday discrimination experience and concerns about future discrimination that the Asian community may face.
   Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted. A total of 235 people who identified themselves as Asian or Asian American and resided in the United States completed the questionnaire.
   Results: Our study suggested that up to a third of Asians surveyed had experienced some type of discrimination. Pooling the responses "very often," "often," and "sometimes," the percentages for each experienced discrimination type ranged between 14%-34%. In total, 49%-58% of respondents expressed concerns about discrimination in the future. The most frequently experienced discrimination types, as indicated by responses "very often" and "often," were "people act as if they think you are dangerous" (25/235, 11%) and "being treated with less courtesy or respect" (24/235, 10%). About 14% (32/235) of individuals reported very often, often, or sometimes being threatened or harassed. In addition, social media use was significantly associated with a higher likelihood of experiencing discrimination (beta=.18, P=.01) and having concerns about future episodes of discrimination the community may face (beta=.20, P=.005). Use of print media was also positively associated with experiencing discrimination (beta=.31, P<.001).
   Conclusions: Our study provided important empirical evidence regarding the various types of discrimination Asians residing in the United States experienced or worried about during the COVID-19 pandemic. The relationship between media sources and the perception of racial biases in this group was also identified. We noted the role of social media in reinforcing the perception of discrimination experience and concerns about future discrimination among Asians during this outbreak. Our results indicate several practical implications for public health agencies. To reduce discrimination against Asians during the pandemic, official sources and public health professionals should be cognizant of the possible impacts of stigmatizing cues in media reports on activating racial biases. Furthermore, Asians or Asian Americans could also be informed that using social media to obtain COVID-19 information is associated with an increase in concerns about future discrimination, and thus they may consider approaching this media source with caution.

AB  - We examined whether specialist police training on the dynamics of sexual offending can modify officers' victim-blaming attitudes and negative perceptions regarding likely case authorization. The sample included 77 Australian police officers specialising in sexual assault investigation. The training, delivered face to face over 4 weeks, included focus on identifying elements of grooming in offending relationships and how these elements can be elicited from victims and suspects within a narrative interviewing framework. Officers' perceptions of cases were assessed immediately pre- and posttraining using a series of case scenarios. For each scenario, officers rated (on a 10-point Likert-type scale) their confidence that the case should be authorised to proceed to prosecution and the responsibility attributable to the victim. For each case, officers also listed up to 5 factors to justify their case authorization decision. Overall, confidence in case authorization increased from pre- to posttraining, whilst perception of victim responsibility decreased. The pattern of results, including the qualitative evidence to justify officers' decisions, support that the attitude change was due to greater understanding of the dynamics of sexual offending. The implications for police trainers, and directions for future research, are discussed.

AB  - In 2012-13, we signed up for Facebook in seven Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries and used Facebook advertisements to encourage young people to participate in our survey. Nearly 18,000 individuals responded. Some of the questions in our survey dealing with attitudes about women's work and cosmetics were adopted from a survey conducted by the Frankfurt School in 1929 in Germany. The German survey had shown that a great number of men, irrespective of their political affiliation harbored highly authoritarian attitudes toward women and that one sign of authoritarianism was men's attitude toward cosmetics and women's employment. We wanted to know if the same was true of the contemporary MENA. Our results suggest that lipstick and makeups as well as women's employment are not just vehicles for sexual objectification of women. In much of MENA world a married woman's desire to work outside the house, and her pursuit of the accoutrement of beauty and sexual attractiveness, are forms of gender politics, of women's empowerment, but also of antiauthoritarianism and liberal politics. Our results also suggest that piety among Muslims per se is not an indicator of authoritarianism and that there is a marked gender difference in authoritarianism. Women, it seems, are living a different Islam than men.

AB  - PurposePatients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) seem to have a negative attitude towards physical activity, which is mainly favored by the lack of counseling provided by the medical and nursing staff. The aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes of both ESRD patients and medical staff on the participation and promotion of physical activity and identify the obstacles that discourage patients' involvement in intervention programs.Study designSubjective assessment questionnaires and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire were administrated to hemodialysis patients and medical staff, to investigate the association between patient's barriers to physical activity, the total intensity level of physical activity, and attitudes of both ESRD patients and medical staff on the participation and promotion of physical activity.ResultsA total of 103 ESRD patients (61 men, 59.2%), 20 nephrologists (12 men, 60.0%), and 72 nurses (61 women, 84.7%) participated in the study. Most commonly reported patient's barriers were fatigue on dialysis (97.4%) and non-dialysis days (55.1%). Healthcare staff showed positive attitude towards renal rehabilitation exercise programs. However, most of physicians (85.0%) and nurses (83.3%) did not have previous experience with interventional exercise rehabilitation programs. Binary logistic regression revealed significant association between patients' inactivity, demographic data, and barriers towards physical activity, such as fatigue and pain in dialysis and non-dialysis days (p<0.05), family's and physician's concern (p<0.05), too many medical problems (p<0.05), the fear of getting hurt (p=0.01), and unwillingness for exercise (p<0.05). Interestingly, healthcare staff's negative attitudes toward patient's physical activity seem to be strongly associated with patient's inactivity status.ConclusionHealthcare staff negative attitudes and multiple related barriers especially fatigue on dialysis and non-dialysis days, towards ESRD patient's physical activity, suppress desire for exercise and active patients' status, leading them to abstain from it.

AB  - While mammography rates are increasing, timely repetition of mammography remains underutilized, particularly for low-income African American women. This study examined the decision-making process used by women during a culturally sensitive attitude change intervention designed to increase adherence to mammography guidelines. The sample included 318 low-income, urban African American women. A Solomon Four design was used to test the intervention in three public health clinics. Participants were followed for 12 months. Women used four different decisional styles (information seeking, 22%; information processing, 22%; advice following, 47%; and ruminating, 8%). Those engaging in information-seeking and information-processing decisional styles demonstrated more pro-attitudes toward mammography, greater intention to obtain a mammogram, and actual increase in mammography utilization. Furthermore, the link between intention and action as significant for those in the information-seeking decisional style but not in the other decisional styles.

AB  - Mounting research evidence suggests that motor resonance (MR, i.e., the mapping of others' actions onto one's own motor repertoire) can be influenced by diverse factors related to individual differences. However, no evidence has been reported so far on the effects of physical appearance and negative attitudes toward obesity to the mechanism of MR. Thirty-six participants (18 normal-weight and 18 overweight) performed a weight discrimination task, in which they were observing amateur actors reaching and grasping a light or heavy cube with or without deception (true vs. fake actions). At the end of each video clip, participants were instructed to indicate the correct cube size (light or heavy). Importantly, body similarity between observers and actors was manipulated by presenting videos of normal-weight or overweight actors. Fat phobic attitudes and automatic preference for normal-weight than obese people were also examined. Signal detection analysis (d ') on the acquired accuracy data has shown that both normal- and overweight participants were able to better discriminate truthful actions when performed by the normal-weight as compared to overweight actors. Furthermore, this finding was negatively correlated with increased scores of fat phobic attitudes in both groups. Hence, for the first time, we provide experimental evidence of action simulation being modulated by an implicit visual sensitivity towards slim bodies.

AB  - Background: Advances in healthcare have contributed to population longevity with many older adults living with complex comorbidities, including those in residential aged care facilities (RACFs). Nursing staff require knowledge of gerontology, normal ageing processes and expected physiological, psychosocial, function and cognitive changes in addition to health promotion in order to provide individualised care. The complexity inherent in the medical, palliative and basic care needs of the residents makes RACFs excellent places for learning for undergraduate student nurses who undertake clinical placement as part of a Bachelor of Nursing course. Previous research has identified that knowledge of care staff is relatively poor.
   Objectives: To explore the knowledge and misconceptions of ageing among first year undergraduate nursing students and aged care staff facilitating a placement during a clinical learning experience.
   Design: Descriptive cross-sectional design.
   Setting: Three clinical RACFs in Australia.
   Participants: First year nursing students and staff of three different RACFs.
   Method: Pre and post-test clinical placement surveys. Students and staff completed Palmore's Facts on Ageing Quiz, a 25-item tool to assess knowledge and attitudes of ageing, before commencing the clinical placement and on the last day of a two week placement.
   Results: Physiological questions were answered correctly. A knowledge deficit was evident from a sociological perspective. Negative attitudes have been found to devalue care and can directly affect the quality of practice in an undesirable way, forming a barrier to effective and therapeutic relationships with older adults, potentially impacting on patient care.
   Conclusions: From an education provider perspective, the inclusion of activities to enrich the learning activities of nurses within RACF-inclusive of reflective activities and guidance from an expert clinical facilitator - may assist in dispelling negative attitudes and stereotypes of the older adult and increase recognition of the value of working with older adults.

AB  - Posthumous diagnoses are not uncommonly given to notorious public and historical figures by applying retrospectively, and typically in the absence of the individual being diagnosed, contemporary diagnostic criteria. Although this may be relatively easy and free of consequences when it concerns clear-cut medical conditions, it may have unintended repercussions in the case of psychiatric disorders by creating myths and perpetuating stigma. The case of serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer is a typical example where a somewhat facile and almost syllogistic application of perhaps over-inclusive criteria may have contributed to the legend of solitary murderers as possibly suffering from an autism spectrum condition. Although there may be an understandable human need to explain abominable and heinous behaviors, the lack of the possibility to verify a diagnostic theory and the ill-advised attempt to make a diagnosis fit may de facto be the basis of prejudice and profiling that do not correspond to clinical reality. Although there is no doubt that the brain is the organ of behavior, the authors caution against a budding neo-Lombrosian approach to crime and criminality and against the all too common use of widely differing terms in the study of deviance, such as crime, delinquency, and aggression, the operational use of which, often used interchangeably even in association studies, often erroneously leads to further confusion.

AB  - In this interpretive phenomenological study, understandings of resilience from the perspective of teenage girls recovering from mental illness were explored. The primary research question was as follows: How is resilience portrayed through teen girls' experiences of health and mental illness? Benner's interpretive phenomenology informed by Gadamerian concepts of conversation, prejudices, and fusion of horizons guided the research design. The interpretive description process involved close reading of how the world experienced by participants was understood while listening for relational, gendered and cultural nuances. Resilience for teenage girls recovering from mental illness was portrayed as very challenging yet a rewarding life path with complex lines of movement towards strength and wellness. The life path involved critical junctures and personal growth while withstanding multiple traumas and acting to overcome adversities. Findings from this study underscore for nurses the relevance of actively advocating for trauma-informed and gender-sensitive approaches to promote teenage girls' (mental) health and well-being and to enhance resilience and recovery from mental illness in the face of what may seem insurmountable adversities.

AB  - Internalized homonegativity encompasses negative attitudes toward one's own sexual orientation and is associated with negative mental and physical health outcomes. The Reactions to Homosexuality Scale (Ross Rosser, 1996), an instrument used to measure internalized homonegativity, has been criticized for including content irrelevant to the construct of internalized homonegativity. We revised the scale using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses and identified a 7-item, 3-factor reduced version that demonstrated measurement invariance across racial/ethnic categorizations and between English and Spanish versions. We also investigated criterion validity by estimating correlations with hypothesized outcomes associated with outness, relationship status, sexual orientation, and gay community affiliation. The evidence of measurement invariance suggests that this scale is appropriate for pluralistic treatment or study groups.

AB  - Religious beliefs have been variously promulgated as both protective and risk factors for sexual reoffending. Moreover, therapists working with religious prisoners struggle with unravelling cognitive distortions embedded within religious views, with concerns about accusations of prejudice salient in their mindset. This paper presents a novel contribution to research by combining the qualitative analysis of the accounts offered by individuals (n = 12) convicted of sexual offences who describe themselves as Christians. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. This paper focuses on two superordinate themes: (i) The God Effect and (ii) The Shadow Side of Religion. Implications of this research are discussed with reference to the assessment of dynamic risk and protective factors with religious individuals who have been convicted of a sexual offence.

AB  - The advent of critical race theory (CRT) in legal scholarship changed the way in which legal scholars think about race and racism in at least three ways. First, CRT scholars argue that the problem of racial justice is fundamental to American law, whereas the previous generation of civil rights scholars saw racial justice as a problem of institutional dynamics resolvable through ordinary legal process. Second, CRT scholars have infused greater social, disciplinary, and scholastic "reflexivity" into legal scholarship on race. Third, CRT scholars have developed a rich and nuanced language for understanding race and racism, replacing an earlier and less sophisticated legal conception of people of color as "discrete and insular" minorities facing unreasoning prejudice.

AB  - This research explores a sequence of effects pertaining to the influence of relational goals on online information seeking, the use of information and arguments as relational management strategies in computer-mediated chat, and the intrapersonal attitude change resulting from these processes. Affinity versus disaffinity goals affected participants' information seeking for communicatory utility (Atkin, 1972), their conversational behaviors, and their own attitudes toward the topic and partner. People with negative relational goals used the Web to seek information for discussions more than affinity-goal participants. Individuals expressed affinity-disaffinity through arguments, agreements, and disagreements with partners' preferences, which led to changes in their own attitudes. Findings suggest renewed consideration of the interplay between mass media and interpersonal sources accessible on the Internet.

AB  - In a social and sports world dominated by weight-centred beliefs and highly exigent and gendered athletic and beauty body standards, the vulnerability for eating pathology, i.e., disordered eating and eating disorders (EDs), is elevated among women athletes. The aim of this study was to explore body image facets and ED risk among female athletes in masculinised sports such as soccer. Forty-five federated amateur female soccer players from Spain participated in this study, voluntarily complying with an extensive evaluation protocol on attitudes towards body and appearance and eating practises. The participants overall reported self-representations of their bodies that corresponded to their reality as athletes, but their body ideals were also more demanding in terms of low fat and muscularity, in association with the functionality of their body and the physical demands of their athletic activity. Despite having a fairly high positive body image and body satisfaction, they also expressed negative attitudes towards their bodies. Around 2 out of 10 players were at risk of suffering from an ED. Players with negative attitudes towards their bodies had an odd 12 times likely to develop an ED compared to those with lower self-devaluation, after adjusting for BMI and body perceptions (OR = 12.3, p < 0.01). On the contrary, players who appreciate their bodies and hold a positive body image had an odd 83% lower to suffer from eating pathology, after adjusting for BMI and body satisfaction (OR = 0.17, p < 0.05). Our findings support the healthy and protective role of positive body image in sports contexts. Body attitudes should be addressed in preventive and therapeutic efforts for reducing the prevalence of EDs in women's sports, within both a "negative" and a "positive" paradigm of body image.</p>

AB  - We aim to provide one explanation for why the link between contact and prejudice is consistently less strong for minority group members than it is for majority group members. Specifically, we propose a "wallpaper effect" such that contact works to increase minority group members' positivity towards majority groups when they live in areas densely populated with other minority group members. Conversely, we suggest that when minority group members live in neighborhoods patterned with majority group faces (as is so often the case), contact will be less transformative. We test this assumption using a large sample of both New Zealander minority (Maori; N = 925) and majority (European; N = 3805) group members. In line with predictions, Maori who lived in minority dense neighborhoods showed the traditional association between contact and increased warmth towards New Zealander Europeans. This relationship, however, was weak or non-existent when they lived in primarily European neighborhoods. Contact effects in majority group members were unaffected by neighborhood composition. The interaction held when controlling for, and was not explained by: gender, income, experiences of harm, cognitions of race-based rejection, or realistic threat. We provide the first evidence to suggest that when it comes to minority group members' intergroup attitudes, contact with majority group members may be a relatively ineffective predictor unless the "wallpaper" of their lives is minority-dense.

AB  - We examine the effect of labor mobility constraints on racial wage discrimination. We show that when monopsony power is low because of relaxed labor mobility constraints, firms cannot act on their prejudice and discrimination disappears. This prediction is taken to the data by using an exogenous mobility shock on the European football labor market. The Bosman ruling lifted restrictions on European player mobility in 1995. Exploiting racial differences in a panel of top English clubs, we compare the pre-and post-Bosman ruling market. We find evidence that wage discrimination disappears only for workers whose mobility constraints have been lifted.

AB  - This article is concerned with the evolving social construction of older workers and retirement. Evolving and competing 'world-views' from public policy, and social advocacy of productive and vulnerable older workers, are described and critiqued. Contradictions and disjunctions, in terms of public policies aimed at changing employer behaviour towards older workers, are identified. It is argued that present representations of older workers have serious flaws that provide a weak basis for policy development and may not only undermine the prospects for overcoming prejudicial societal attitudes but may in fact strengthen them. It is further argued that sheltering older workers in employment placements will inevitably limit the extent and nature of their participation. Instead, the mainstreaming of their employment is justified, bearing in mind negative attitudes towards ageing.

AB  - The current study examined whether politically non-conservative (i.e., liberal and moderate) Whites demonstrate an explicit bias in favor of Black versus White politicians on measures of political support and whether these assessments are influenced by implicit racial bias against Blacks. To address this, 671 non-conservative Whites were presented with political speeches paired with a photograph of either a Black or a White politician implied to have given the speech and were then asked to read the speech and evaluate the politician on a number of dimensions. Results showed that participants rated Black politicians more favorably than White politicians on measures of political support, including a willingness to vote for, donate money to, and report confidence in the politician. Importantly, the favorability bias observed on these measures was not influenced by implicit racial biases. When evaluating Black politicians' intelligence, however, an explicit favorability bias (higher overall ratings of Black compared to White politicians) was moderated by implicit racial bias. Implicit pro-White/anti-Black racial bias was associated with lower ratings of perceived intelligence of Black politicians, but not White politicians, such that the favorability bias was effectively eliminated for intelligence ratings. Our findings are consistent with previous research suggesting that although White non-conservatives may go out of their way to demonstrate outward support for Blacks, deep-rooted negative attitudes about Blacks may remain, which can potentially undermine true support for Blacks in politics.

AB  - Purpose: Diversification of the profession is an important element of combating racism, bias, and prejudice in the speech-language pathology workforce at national and systemic levels. However, national and systemic change needs to be combined with equipping individual speech-language pathologists to adapt to the challenges that they face to engaging in culturally responsive practice. This paper presents four interacting levels of practice within the Culturally Responsive Teamwork Framework (CRTF): (a) intrapersonal practices, (b) interpersonal practices, (c) intraprofessional practices, and (d) the interprofessional practices.
   Conclusion: CRTF is a practical, strengths-based framework that draws on international research and expertise to expand personal and professional practice and describe critical behaviors within the workplace that can be used to promote principles of evidence-based practice and social justice, especially when working with people from nondominant cultural or linguistic groups.

AB  - Genetic analysis for individuals who are at risk for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) has becoming widely accepted. The poor introduction of the genetic testing of BRCA in Japan compared with western countries could be due to insufficient recognition of its importance, prejudice against a heredity disease, especially in non-urban districts, and its high cost. There is few available data regarding the acceptance or willingness to have genetic testing among Japanese who are at risk and living outside Tokyo.
   Of 670 patients seen and detailed family history taken at our hospital, located non-urban, 30 (4 %) gave the family history of breast cancer in more than 2 members within the second degree relatives ("stronger" family history group), 92 (14 %) in 1 member ("weaker" group), and 548 (82 %) in none of members ("sporadic" group). Then, we selected 107 (24 from "stronger", 50 from "weaker", 33 from "sporadic" family history group) to see if they are willing to receive cost-free genetic testing of BRCA 1 and BRCA2.
   Ninety-two of 107 (86 %) patients agreed and 15 (14 %) refused. The rate of refusal for BRCA testing was higher in "stronger family history group" (6/24, 25 %) compared to "weaker" (7/50, 14 %) or "sporadic" (2/33, 6 %) (p = 0.04), respectively.
   These data indicate that the currently available preventive measures and/or counseling system may not be sufficient enough to convince the high risk population to receive the genetic testing or to overcome the prejudice in non-urban area in Japan, even if served free.

AB  - Background: Malnutrition is a debilitating and highly prevalent condition in acute hospital settings especially in older person; however international literature revealed negative attitudes in providing nutritional care among nurses and health professionals. Few studies have investigated attitudes towards nutritional care among nursing students, there are no data regarding the Italian context.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore nursing students' attitudes towards nutritional care in older people.
   Design: A multicentre cross-sectional survey incorporating a pre post design.
   Setting and participants: A convenience sample of nursing students of the bachelor's degree in Nursing in the three hospitals were recruited.
   Methods: Nursing students completed "The Staff Attitudes to Nutritional Nursing Care Geriatric Scale (Italian version) (SANN_G(ITA) scale)"; first year students completed the scale before (TO) and after (T1) lectures about nutrition and nutritional care.
   Results: 245 students were enrolled (response rate 88.4%). The overall score of sample attitudes was Median (Me) = 66 (IQR = [60; 72]); at the variation of the year the neutral attitudes are prevalent with a significant tendency to increase the positive attitudes (p < .003) and there is a statistically significant difference (p < .05) in all dimensions except the "habits" dimension "(P = .1126). After two months from the end of the lessons regarding nutritional care there is an increase in subjects with neutral attitudes and a decrease in those with negative attitudes (P = .05).
   Conclusions: This study revealed a progressive improvement of the attitudes during the three-year course, underling the importance of nutritional contents provided; understanding the most critical aspects about nutritional care can be helpful in understanding in which areas university education should be improved, in order to train nurses able to assess and face with each patients' assistance need.

AB  - The ability to effectively relieve pain has been available to health professionals for generations. It should be a primary concern in treating patients but is still often given a low priority or ignored completely. Apathy toward the suffering experienced may be mixed with a fear of the use of the common analgesics. Our own prejudices and ignorance can also contribute. Failures in the primary education of health professionals may be the single most important cause and the identity of the remedy. Raising the profile of pain as an essential educational topic and, more broadly, realising that this is a major public health matter are the way forward.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION

AB  - Faculties at historically Black colleges and universities (HBCU) have demonstrated stellar contributions to social work, which include early thought and epistemology related to strengths, empowerment, and social justice perspectives; religious orientation; inclusive learning environment, and community-based research. W. E. B. DuBois was the most influential among these HBCU scholars; however, the DuBoisian tradition of scholar as activist must include works of Frazier, Haynes, Young, and others, who fueled discourse on contemporary social problems despite prejudice, discrimination, and Jim Crow. HBCUs provided direction for services to the new Black urban class when the profession was not prepared to do so. They led the profession to use new theoretical ideas, perspectives, and service modes for a new clientele.

AB  - It is clear from the plain words of the Article 76, paragraph 10, of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea that the questions involving the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles are without prejudice to the question of delimitation of the continental shelf between states with opposite or adjacent coasts. However, the two processes impact each other, which gives rise to more complex dynamics than may be perceived from a cursory reading of Article 76. This article explores the relationship between the two separate but inherently related processes in light of the relevant jurisprudence and doctrinal commentaries thereto.

AB  - On Facebook, connections between users are published within friends lists. Therefore, ties between in- and outgroup members may be easily observed. We simulated this novel form of indirect intergroup contact through an evaluative conditioning (EC) procedure and tested if intergroup attitudes may be influenced positively. To be specific, we presented outgroup members as conditioned stimuli (CSs) and mutual friendship as positively valenced unconditioned stimulus (US). To test our hypotheses, we carried out eight studies measuring explicit and implicit attitudes as well as prosocial intentions toward a target outgroup. However, results demonstrate consistently that the EC procedure did not improve attitudes.

AB  - Most scholarly and public perceptions and analyses of political Islam are beset by prejudice and misunderstandings. Political Islam movements are presented as irrational and obstinate, stubbornly refusing to change despite the circumstances with rigid beliefs and political tactics with an anti-democratic orientation. This article argues that the relationship between political Islam and democracy as a whole, and its participation in the political process in the modern state, are expressions of the unique situation of each Islamic political movement and its leaders. Islamic political movements actually take a wide range of positions on democracy and have diverse approaches to participation in elections. This stems from their unique relationship with the regime and the state.

AB  - In Ghana, the deplorable living conditions and poverty among persons with disabilities cannot be over-emphasised. Despite the presence of persons with disabilities in mining communities, limited attention has been paid to exploring their experiences and living conditions. The challenges faced by people living in mining communities have been well explored in literature. As part of the effort to achieve an inclusive society, this study adopted Bronfenbrenner's socio-ecological model as a theoretical framework to explore the impact of mining activities on living conditions of persons with disabilities residing in mining communities. This article reports results from a qualitative study consisting of one-to-one and focus group interviews with 21 persons with disabilities, recruited from three mining communities in the Brong-Ahafo Region of Ghana. Findings suggest a substantial loss of sources of livelihood for persons with disabilities. Besides the negative attitudes, participants experience because of living with disabilities, the presence of the mining company in the communities has a negative impact on the livelihood of participants, in terms of loss of land and a high cost of living. The limitations and recommendations for future research, as well as the need to create economic opportunities for persons with disabilities, are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: Oculocutaneous albinism is an autosomal recessive disease caused by complete absence of or decrease in melanin biosynthesis in melanocytes. Due to the reduction or absence of melanin, albinos are highly susceptible to the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation and are at greater risk of actinic damage and skin cancer. There are no epidemiological data on the incidence of albinism in Brazil. Objective: To analyze the clinical and epidemiological profile of patients with albinism treated by the Pro-Albino Program of the Dermatology Clinic of Santa Casa de Misericordia from its beginning in 2010 until 2017. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the records of all consecutive albino patients admitted to the service in the study period were reviewed. Sociodemographic data, family history, and dermatological clinical data were collected. Results: Between March 2010 and April 2017, 191 patients were admitted, of whom 109 were female (57.07%) and the age range was 0-92 years, with >30% under the age of 18 years. Consanguinity among the parents was confirmed by 26% of the patients. Unprotected sun exposure was reported by 109 (57.07%), and 138 (72.25%) had a history of sunburn. Of the 146 records with information, 38 had skin cancer (26%), with a mean age of 47.4 (p < 0.0001); the youngest patient diagnosed with a cutaneous tumor was 23 years old. The prevalence of actinic damage was high. There was information on solar elastosis and actinic keratosis in 148 medical records, of which 96 (64.8%) patients had elastosis and 75 (50.67%) keratoses. Elastosis, keratosis, and skin cancer were significantly associated with age, unprotected sun exposure, and sunburn (p < 0.05). Of the 37 (26% of the sample of 146) patients with a previous or current history of skin cancer, it was possible to identify the histological type in 29 (13 men and 16 women); of these, 18 (62%) were basal cell carcinomas (BCC), 15 (51%) were squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), and 2 (7%) were melanomas. Of these, 4 cases (14%) presented the 2 types of carcinoma (BCC and SCC), and the 2 that had a diagnosis of melanoma also had BCC. Some patients had multiple ulcerated tumors. The tumor site was preferentially in the head and neck (43%), trunk (37%) and limbs (20%). Conclusions: Albinos represent a risk group for skin cancer and other actinic lesions. These lesions were found to be prevalent in the albinos seen by the program and probably reflect the characteristics found in the Brazilian albino population. Access to health care, especially through multidisciplinary programs that enable the diagnosis and early treatment of these lesions, health education, and the use of photoprotective measures can reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life of patients with this rare genetic condition.

AB  - Background: Findings suggest approximately one in six people with intellectual disability engage in 'challenging behaviours', which include aggression towards others/property and self-injurious actions. In residential settings, actions of staff members can make challenging behaviours more likely to occur, or make these behaviours worse. In particular, negative attitudes from members of staff and lack of understanding about the reasons for challenging behaviour are contributory factors. 'Who's Challenging Who?' (WCW) training is designed to emphasise the role of staff in residential settings as a challenge also to people with intellectual disability. The course is delivered jointly by a trainer with intellectual disability who has been labelled as having challenging behaviour, along with a trainer without intellectual disability.
   Methods: This is a cluster randomised two-arm trial of WCW training versus a waiting list control. Overall, 118 residential settings will be recruited and randomised on a 1:1 ratio. Within each setting, two members of staff will be invited to take part in the trial. Participants will complete assessments at baseline and at 6 and 20 weeks. WCW is a half day initial training course with some follow-on coaching to ensure implementation. The primary outcome is changes in staff empathy towards people with challenging behaviour. Secondary outcomes at the staff level include confidence, attitudes and work-related well-being. Secondary outcomes at the residential setting level include recorded incidents of aggressive challenging behaviour, and use of any restrictive practices.
   Discussion: If the results of the cluster randomised trial are positive, we will disseminate the findings widely and make all training manuals and materials freely available for anyone in intellectual disability services (and beyond) to use. Our training approach may have wider implications in other areas of social care. It may also provide a generally applicable model for how to train people with intellectual disability to act as co-trainers in intellectual disability social care settings. People with intellectual disability and challenging behaviour have already been involved centrally with the design, development and pilot evaluation of WCW and will also be fully involved throughout this trial.

AB  - Background: Mental health problems among young peoples are a growing public health issue around the world. In low-income countries health systems are characterized by lack of facilities, human resources and primary health care is rarely an integrated part of overall health care services. This study aims at exploring how primary health care professionals in Nicaragua perceive young people's mental health problems, suicidal problems and help-seeking behaviour.
   Methods: Twelve in-depth interviews were conducted with nurses and doctors working in primary health care services in Leon, Nicaragua. A qualitative research design was applied. Data was analysed using thematic analysis approach.
   Results: This study revealed that doctors and nurses were reluctant to deal with young people presenting with suicidal problems at the primary health care. This was more likely to stem from feelings of incompetence rather than from negative attitudes. Other barriers in providing appropriate care to young people with mental health problems were identified such as lack of time, lack of privacy, lack of human resources, lack of trained professionals and difficulties in communicating with young people. The primary health care (PHC) professionals suggested different solutions to improve care for young people with suicidal problems.
   Conclusion: PHC doctors and nurses in Nicaragua felt that providing skilled mental health services to young people was a priority for them but they also identified a number of barriers to be able to do so. They discussed ways to improve young people's willingness to share sensitive issues with them and suggested ways to make PHC more appreciated by young people.

AB  - The article is relevant in the light of strengthening "antidomestic" values, growth of anxiety in society, an attempt to identify conventional, robust features of the "scary house" representations in horror movies, the popularity of which is of interest not only as an indicator of the state of mass psychology, but also as a direct mapping of the types of deprivation of housing situations and deprived persons, and also as a factor of actual housing units - of the prejudices and preferences of Russians. To identify the types of housing deprivation and attributes of terrible spaces, we used as material the annotations of horror films in the catalogue on the websitehttps://my-hit.org/. We used two samples. The first one (n1=900) was strictly horror sample with a house as an important element of the character system in the plot. The second one (n2=572) was of all genres films, the title of which present any nomination of the house. Horror movie mostly stable models such housing frames as homelessness, institutional housing, a cultural heritage site as a residential, and a mansion, a manor, a castle. Among the forms of housing and the forms of territorial behavior the most dangerous are: job with residence (at the place of work), patrilocal marriage regardless of the quality of housing conditions, studies in boarding school, squatter settlement, accommodation in non-residential premises outside the city, rent or purchase too cheap compared to the market housing. The main attributes of a terrible home are old age, large size, spatial and social isolation, group or individual, and the abundance of "closed-like" architectural forms and details, especially additional barriers, special means of tracking and security. Horror has both psychotherapeutic, and oikophobia effect, the ratio of which is yet to be traced.

AB  - Aims and objectives. To discover and describe challenges and barriers perceived by nurses in providing culturally competent care in their day-to-day encounters with diverse patient populations.
   Background. Nurses are challenged in today's healthcare environment to provide culturally competent care to a diverse patient population. To provide patient-and family-centred care, nurses must first acknowledge patient's and family's cultural differences, be willing to incorporate patient's and family's beliefs within the healthcare treatment plan, and respect the values and lifeways of differing cultures.
   Design. Qualitative description with thematic analysis was used to describe nurses' perceptions of barriers and challenges in providing culturally competent care. The qualitative component of the study was part of a larger research study that used a prospective, cross-sectional, descriptive survey. Participants responded to two open-ended questions about potential challenges and barriers to providing culturally competent health care.
   Methods. Nurses were recruited in a south-eastern state in the USA. Research surveys were mailed to 2000 nurses throughout the state using a stratified sampling method.
   Results. Three hundred and seventy-four nurses participated in the study. Three themes emerged from the qualitative description: great diversity, lack of resources, and prejudices and biases.
   Conclusions. The provision of culturally competent patient-and family-centred care is an ethical imperative and professional mandate. Describing nurses' perspectives on challenges and barriers to providing culturally competent care is the first step in helping to redesign care delivery practices.
   Relevance to clinical practice. Challenges to providing culturally competent care included diversity in patient populations, lack of resources to provide culturally competent care and biases/prejudices. Strategies to address these challenges in the areas of nursing education, nursing research and nursing policy were proposed.

AB  - Stereotypes exist in the interactions between different social groups, and gender stereotypes are particularly prevalent. Previous studies have suggested that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is involved in the social cognition that plays an important role in gender stereotypes, but the specific causal effect of the mPFC remains controversial. In this study, we aimed to use transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to identify a direct link between the mPFC and gender bias. Implicit stereotypes were measured by the gender implicit association test (IAT), and explicit prejudice was measured by the Ambivalent Sexism Inventory (ASI). We found that male and female participants had different behavioral and neural correlates of gender stereotypes. Anodal tDCS significantly reduced male participants' gender D-IAT scores compared with cathodal and sham stimulation, while the stimulation had an insignificant effect in female participants. The reduction in male participants' gender bias mainly resulted from a decrease in the difference in reaction time (RT) between congruent and incongruent blocks. Regarding the explicit bias measurement, male and female participants had distinct attitudes, but tDCS had no effect on ASI. Our results revealed that the mPFC played a causal role in controlling implicit gender stereotypes, which is consistent with previous observations and complements past lesion, neuroimaging, and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies and suggests that males and females have different neural bases for gender stereotypes.

AB  - Undoubtedly, the study on finding the causes of stagnation of Islamic sciences from the sixth century onward is among the important and valuable issues in the history of Islamic education. This was a period in the history of science when the glittering light of Islamic sciences went out and the evolution and growth that we see in the third, fourth and even fifth centuries left the Islamic society. The issue of stoppage of the Ijtihad chapter among the Sunni Muslims led to imitation and stagnation and the fanaticism of the four Sunni religions; the leadership of this approach was assumed by Hanbalis (Hanaabilah). In such an atmosphere, freedom of thought was accompanied by heresy and cooperation with the E'tezal school, which is indicated by the investigation of the books of that era. The present paper, which is based on the report by Ibn Rajab Hanbali (736-795), has been prepared with regard to the report of the book " Fa.l ` Ilm al-Salaf ` ala ` Ilm al-Khalaf". After briefly reviewing the biography, compilations, teachers, and religious and political conditions of the time of this Hanbali scholar, the amount of his attention to the sciences of his time and his excessive caution and fear concerning new sciences and also reliance solely on the righteous predecessors' legacy are examined. After classifying sciences into useful and useless (useful vs harmful knowledge) ones, he seeks to reject new sciences. His constant concern about and frequent attacks on new sciences (sciences outside the framework of the Book [ scripture] and the Tradition), especially philosophy and theology, and his defense and strong prejudice in this respect should be considered. Accordingly, the abovementioned book is the full-length mirror of the eighth century AH on the increasing stagnation of Islamic sciences.

AB  - AimThe aim of this study was to explore factors affecting adaptation to the role of motherhood in mothers of preterm infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit.
   BackgroundTransition to motherhood often causes significant issues in terms of adaptation to the role of motherhood. The main factors leading to parental stress, especially in the neonatal intensive care unit, have shown that the greatest source of stress is the loss of women's role as mothers.
   DesignIt was a qualitative study with content analysis approach.
   MethodsSemi-structured in-depth interviews were used for data collection. Interviews were conducted with 17 mothers of preterm infants (under 36weeks) who had been hospitalized for at least one week in the neonatal intensive care unit. Purposive sampling with maximum diversity was used to recruit mothers in Kermanshah province (west of Iran). Data was collected during 2013-2014. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using conventional content analysis.
   FindingsExplanation of the mothers' perspective towards factors affecting adaptation to the role of motherhood led to two main categories of individual factors (emotional distress, self-efficacy, interaction and alienation) and social factors (support, prejudice).
   ConclusionAdaptation to the role of motherhood can be promoted through supporting mothers of preterm infants, empowering them and increasing their self-efficacy, to eliminate negative factors and emotions.

AB  - Importance Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine hesitancy or refusal is common among parents of adolescents. An understanding of public perceptions from the perspective of behavior change theories can facilitate effective and targeted vaccine promotion strategies. Objective To develop and validate deep learning models for understanding public perceptions of HPV vaccines from the perspective of behavior change theories using data from social media. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study, conducted from April to August 2019, included longitudinal and geographic analyses of public perceptions regarding HPV vaccines, using sampled HPV vaccine-related Twitter discussions collected from January 2014 to October 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures The prevalence of social media discussions related to the construct of health belief model (HBM) and theory of planned behavior (TPB), categorized by deep learning algorithms. Locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) revealed trends of constructs. Social media users' US state-level home location information was extracted from their profiles, and geographic analyses were performed to identify the clustering of public perceptions of the HPV vaccine. Results A total of 1431463 English-language posts from 486116 unique usernames were collected. Deep learning algorithms achieved F-1 scores ranging from 0.6805 (95% CI, 0.6516-0.7094) to 0.9421 (95% CI, 0.9380-0.9462) in mapping discussions to the constructs of behavior change theories. LOESS revealed trends in constructs; for example, prevalence of perceived barriers, a construct of HBM, deceased from its apex in July 2015 (56.2%) to its lowest prevalence in October 2018 (28.4%; difference, 27.8%; P < .001); Positive attitudes toward the HPV vaccine, a construct of TPB, increased from early 2017 (30.7%) to 41.9% at the end of the study (difference, 11.2%; P < .001), while negative attitudes decreased from 42.3% to 31.3% (difference, 11.0%; P < .001) during the same period. Interstate variations in public perceptions of the HPV vaccine were also identified; for example, the states of Ohio and Maine showed a relatively high prevalence of perceived barriers (11531 of 17106 [67.4%] and 1157 of 1684 [68.7%]) and negative attitudes (9655 of 17197 [56.1%] and 1080 of 1793 [60.2%]). Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study provided a good understanding of public perceptions on social media and evolving trends in terms of multiple dimensions. The interstate variations of public perceptions could be associated with the rise of local antivaccine sentiment. The methods described in this study represent an early contribution to using existing empirically and theoretically based frameworks that describe human decision-making in conjunction with more intelligent deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, these data demonstrate the ability to collect large-scale HPV vaccine perception and intention data that can inform public health communication and education programs designed to improve immunization rates at the community, state, or even national level.
   Question Can public perceptions of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be accessed from the perspective of behavior change theories by mining social media data with machine learning algorithms? Findings This cohort study included 1431463 English-language posts about the HPV vaccine from 486116 unique usernames from a social media platform. An increase in HPV vaccine-related discussions was found, and the results suggest temporal and geographic variations in public perceptions of the HPV vaccine. Meaning The findings of this study suggest that social media and machine learning algorithms can serve as a complementary approach to inform public health surveillance and understanding and help to design targeted educational and communication programs that increase HPV vaccine acceptance.
   This cohort study develops and validates deep learning models to understand public perceptions of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines from the perspective of behavior change theories using data from social media.

AB  - Objective: This study used mixed methods to explore youth attitudes about recovery-related needs and important drug-avoidance behaviors after treatment. Method: Focus groups were conducted with 118 substance using youth in treatment (four residential and 10 outpatient settings) throughout Los Angeles County. Results: The average age was 17.4 (SD = 2.9); 78.3% were male, 66.1% Latino; and most were in treatment for primary marijuana (40.9%) or methamphetamine (30.4%) abuse. Quantitatve results from the drug-avoidance activity survey identified the following factors youth rated as important to their recovery after treatment: lifestyle improvement activities (95.7%); changing personal drug behaviors (89.6%); drug environment/culture change activities (82.5%); with the least important being therapeutic activities (78.5%). Qualitative findings from focus groups that asked what youth think are important for recovery programs to address after treatment revealed the following four areas: (1) recovery promotion to developmentally appropriate activities (95%); (2) facilitating the use of coping skills to deal with stress (85%); (3) offering alternative recovery support options (not just abstinence only) (75%); and (4) continuing to provide substance use education (65%). Conclusion: Findings highlight essential aspects of recovery in terms of need and drug-avoidance behaviors considered important to youth in treatment. Such information will help to better address clinical and recovery support models aimed at relapse prevention to ensure that the perceived problems of substance-abusing youth are adequately met.

AB  - Aim: Good communication is associated with improved health of patients and empathy is a cornerstone of physician-patient communication. Medical education seems to be ineffective in helping students to maintain or increase their empathy. Some of benefits of Problem Based Learning (PBL) are about communication and interpersonal skills. This study aims to determine the effect of a PBL scenario on attitudes towards communication skills, the empathic tendency and the empathic skills of 1st year medical students.
   Materials and Methods: Attitude changes after the PBL scenario were evaluated via Communication Skills Attitude Scale (CSAS), Empathic Tendency Scale (ETS) and Empathic Skill Scale (ESS).
   Results: The positive attitude change was significant for male students (p=0.03). The means of ETS scores were 68.42 +/- 8.28 and 69.18 +/- 8.53 (p=0.36) and the means of ESS scores were 131.16 +/- 17.28 and 133.30 +/- 18.35 in the pre and post-tests, respectively (p=0.22). The ESS scores of male students both in pre and post tests were significantly higher than female students (p=0.00). A significant negative correlation between NAS and ETS and a positive correlation between PAS and ETS in both tests were determined.
   Conclusion: This scenario significantly increased positive attitudes (PAS) of students towards communication skills. There was also an increase in empathic tendency and skills.

AB  - The objective of the article is to understand Afro-Colombian women's emotional experiences of the migratory process, and their labor insertion in Chilean territory. The Antofagasta region is one of the doors that connects Chile with its neighbors; at the same time, it is a national territory that is linked to important economic and human movements due to its mining activity. In the analysis of the data collected through of group and individual interviews conducted in the city of Antofagasta, we found experiences of xenophobia, labor abuse, discrimination, prejudices, and stereotypes articulated, along with the tendency of Chilean culture to value European traits over native Latin American traits.

AB  - Research about victimization among sexual minority youth has focused on documenting the prevalence and consequences of such experiences. Lacking in the literature is an in-depth exploration of the social context of both risk and resilience in the face of violence. This is especially true for transgender youth who are largely absent from the dominant discourse. This case story provides an example of how one transgender youth interpreted and adaptively responded to the discrimination and prejudice she encountered. Katie's story illustrates the process of resilience. Despite the adversity she has faced, she shares stories of pride and strength in a culture that considers her as other.

AB  - Inclusion as an educational approach for students with disabilities is a widely debated topic. The concept of inclusion is often referred to as a philosophy that all pupils - regardless of ability and other differences - should be included within age-appropriate community schools [Stainback, S. B. and Stainback, W. eds., 1996. Inclusion: a guide for educators. Baltimore, MD: Paul H. Brookes Publishing, Artiles, A. J. and Kozleski, E. B., 2007. Beyond convictions: interrogating culture, history, and power in inclusive education. Language Arts, 84 (4), 357-365]. This educational approach has been scrutinized for its capacity to meet the needs of students with and without disabilities Lindsay, G., 2003. Inclusive education: a critical perspective. British journal of special education, 30 (1), 3-12; Kauffman, J. M. and Hallahan, D. P., 2005. Special education: what it is and why we need it. Toronto, Canada: Pearson; McPhail, J. C. and Freeman, J. C., 2005. Beyond prejudice: thinking towards genuine inclusion. Learning disability research and practice, 20 (4), 254-267]. However, as Bodgan and Taylor [1990. Looking at the bright side: a positive approach to qualitative policy and evaluation research. Qualitative sociology, 13 (2), 183-192.] point out, the 'does it work' framework for analyzing inclusion programs for persons with disabilities is not beneficial to practitioners and researchers who believe that 'integration into society is a moral question rather than an empirical one' (p. 187). Instead of questioning whether inclusion 'works' or is 'effective' for students with learning disabilities (SLD), this study uses a critical geography perspective to examine from the SLDs' perspective how educational spaces are as socially and discursively constructed as places of inclusion and exclusion. This paper also examines interest in how these constructions of places are situated in relation to provincial and regional inclusive education policies.

AB  - The present study examined teacher attitudes toward dyslexia and the effects of these attitudes on teacher expectations and the academic achievement of students with dyslexia compared to students without learning disabilities. The attitudes of 30 regular education teachers toward dyslexia were determined using both an implicit measure and an explicit, self-report measure. Achievement scores for 307 students were also obtained. Implicit teacher attitudes toward dyslexia related to teacher ratings of student achievement on a writing task and also to student achievement on standardized tests of spelling but not math for those students with dyslexia. Self-reported attitudes of the teachers toward dyslexia did not relate to any of the outcome measures. Neither the implicit nor the explicit measures of teacher attitudes related to teacher expectations. The results show implicit attitude measures to be a more valuable predictor of the achievement of students with dyslexia than explicit, self-report attitude measures.

AB  - Background: Even given equivalent drinking patterns, Black and Latino men experience substantially more dependence symptoms and other consequences than White men, particularly at low/no heavy drinking. No known studies have identified factors driving these disparities. The current study examines this question.
   Methods: The 2005 and 2010 National Alcohol Surveys were pooled. Surveys are nationally representative, telephone interviews of the U.S. including Black and Latino oversamples; male drinkers were analyzed (N = 4182). Preliminary analyses included negative binomial regressions of dependence symptom and consequence counts testing whether effects for race/ethnicity were diminished when entering potential explanatory factors individually. Additional analyses re-examined effects for race/ethnicity when using propensity score weighting to weight Blacks to Whites, and Latinos to Whites, first on heavy drinking alone, and then on heavy drinking and all explanatory factors supported by preliminary analyses.
   Results: Preliminary regressions suggested roles for lower individual SES, greater prejudice and unfair treatment, and younger age in the elevated risk of alcohol problems among Black and Latino (vs. White) men at low heavy drinking levels; additional support emerged for single (vs. married) status among Blacks and neighborhood disadvantage among Latinos. When Blacks and Latinos were weighted to Whites on the above variables, effects for race/ethnicity on dependence counts were reduced to nonsignificance, while racial/ethnic disparities in consequence counts were attenuated (by >43% overall).
   Conclusions: Heavy drinking may be especially risky for those who are poor, exposed to prejudice and unfair treatment, young, and unmarried, and these factors may contribute to explaining racial/ethnic disparities in alcohol problems. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is unclear to what extent failure to recognize symptoms as potential sign of a mental illness is impeding service use, and how stigmatizing attitudes interfere with this process. In a prospective study, we followed a community sample of 188 currently untreated persons with mental illness (predominantly depression) over 6 months. We examined how lack of knowledge, prejudice and discrimination impacted on self-identification as having a mental illness, perceived need, intention to seek help, and help-seeking, both with respect to primary care (visiting a general practitioner, GP) and specialist care (seeing a mental health professional, MHP). 67% sought professional help within 6months. Fully saturated path models accounting for baseline depressive symptoms, previous treatment experience, age and gender showed that self-identification predicted need (beta 0.32, p<0.001), and need predicted intention (GP: beta 0.45, p<0.001; MHP: beta 0.38, p<0.001). Intention predicted service use with a MHP after 6months (beta 0.31, p<0.01; GP: beta 0.17, p=0.093). More knowledge was associated with more self-identification (beta 0.21, p<0.01), while support for discrimination was associated with lower self-identification (beta -0.14, p<0.05). Blaming persons with mental illness for their problem was associated with lower perceived need (beta -0.16, p<0.05). Our models explained 37% of the variance of seeking help with a MHP, and 33% of help-seeking with a GP. Recognizing one's own mental illness and perceiving a need for help are impaired by lack of knowledge, prejudice, and discrimination. Self-identification is a relevant first step when seeking help for mental disorders.

AB  - Introduction. - Teachers tend to develop negative expectations and behaviours towards students coming from low socioeconomic backgrounds.
   Objective. - The objective of this study was to test the influence of teacher political orientation, as well as their attachment to power and universalism values, on their predictions of academic success towards students from different socioeconomic backgrounds.
   Method. - Eighty-eight high school teachers (M-age = 38.04 years; 44.3% men) responded to a questionnaire of political ideology and values, as well as to a questionnaire evaluating their prediction of success towards male high school students from different socioeconomic backgrounds.
   Results. - Teachers predicted a better academic success for students coming from a high socioeconomic background. Despite relatively small effect size, political ideology, as well as attachment to power and universalism values, predicted the bias of judgment.
   Conclusion. - Taking into consideration teachers' ideology and values would deepen understanding of processes underlying expectations development. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Describe variation in sentiment of tweets using race-related terms and identify themes characterizing the social climate related to race. Methods: We applied a Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier to conduct sentiment analysis of 1,249,653 US tweets using race-related terms from 2015-2016. To evaluate accuracy, manual labels were compared against computer labels for a random subset of 6600 tweets. We conducted qualitative content analysis on a random sample of 2100 tweets. Results: Agreement between computer labels and manual labels was 74%. Tweets referencing Middle Eastern groups (12.5%) or Blacks (13.8%) had the lowest positive sentiment compared to tweets referencing Asians (17.7%) and Hispanics (17.5%). Qualitative content analysis revealed most tweets were represented by the categories: negative sentiment (45%), positive sentiment such as pride in culture (25%), and navigating relationships (15%). While all tweets use one or more race-related terms, negative sentiment tweets which were not derogatory or whose central topic was not about race were common. Conclusion: This study harnesses relatively untapped social media data to develop a novel area-level measure of social context (sentiment scores) and highlights some of the challenges in doing this work. New approaches to measuring the social environment may enhance research on social context and health.

AB  - Medical students' attitudes towards patients with addiction and towards other chronic conditions might be comparable. Positive attitudes towards such conditions can be developed during medical education. This study evaluated medical students' attitudes towards patients with addiction, dementia, and diabetes, and how such attitudes change during training. This is an observational prospective cohort study. Participants (N = 100) were students who recruited from Primary and Community Care training, which consisted of theoretical courses and a clinical rotation. The Medical Condition Regard Scale was used to measure the attitudes and a repeated-measures analysis was performed to compare them. Before training, students' attitudes towards patients with addiction were more negative than towards dementia and diabetes. The attitudes towards addiction remained stable during the entire training, whereas the attitudes towards dementia and diabetes remained stable during the theoretical courses but decreased after the clinical rotation. These findings emphasize a need to pay attention to students' attitude development towards patients with chronic diseases, addiction in particular, during medical training.

AB  - BackgroundStudies have demonstrated that health care students and practitioners are not immune to stigma towards people living with HIV (PLHIV). This attitude could lead to poor quality of care if it remains uncorrected. However, little is known about dietetic students' acceptance of PLHIV despite their substantial role in treatment. This study aimed to measure the extent of knowledge and stigma towards PLHIV among dietetic students and to determine the associated factors using the attribution theory.MethodsStudents from three dietetics schools in Indonesia (n=516) were recruited to participate in this cross-sectional study. Survey questions covered demographic information, interaction with PLHIV, access to information sources, cultural values, and beliefs as predictor variables. The outcome variables were comprehensive knowledge of HIV, HIV and nutrition-specific knowledge, and attitudes. Analyses with linear regression and the stepwise selection were performed to determine factors related to the outcome.ResultsThe levels of HIV comprehensive knowledge and HIV-nutrition specific knowledge among dietetic students were low, as indicated by the average score of 19.90.19 (maximum score=35) and 8.0 +/- 0.11 (maximum score=15), respectively. The level of negative attitudes towards PLHIV was high, with 99.6% of participants reported having a high stigma score. Types of university affiliation (public or private), beliefs and values, exposure to HIV discourse, access to printed media, and years of study were significantly related to HIV comprehensive knowledge (p<0.05). Nutrition-specific knowledge was also correlated with university affiliation, beliefs and values, participation in HIV discussion, and years of study (p<0.05). HIV comprehensive knowledge, university affiliation, discussion participation, and ethnicities were associated with attitudes (p<0.05).Conclusions Awareness and acceptance of PLHIV must be further improved throughout dietetic training to ensure patients' quality of care since students represent future dietary care providers. Considering the consistent findings that affiliation to education institution correlates with HIV knowledge and attitude, some examinations concerning the curriculum and teaching conduct might be necessary.

AB  - Some individuals may be internationally displaced by climate change. We surveyed two independent samples of New Zealanders to understand attitudes towards climate aid. Participants were relatively less supportive of financial aid policies, though the majority supported climate refugee policy. We assessed whether those ideological barriers commonly used to predict prejudice and policy support related to this acceptance in meaningful ways. Interestingly, we show that approval or rejection of climate refugee policy was largely predicated on views regarding how hierarchically society ought to be ordered. Our research suggests that those opposing climate refugee policy are motivated by anti-egalitarianism and concerns about their own economic welfare to a greater extent than concerns about differences in culture, values, and norms.

AB  - The 9/11 terror attacks are likely to have induced an increase in anti-immigrant and anti-foreigner sentiments, not only among US residents but also beyond US borders. Using unique longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel and exploiting exogenous variation in interview timing throughout 2001, I find that the 9/11 events caused an immediate shift of around 40 percent of one within-standard deviation to more negative attitudes toward immigration and resulted in a considerable decrease in concerns over xenophobic hostility among the German population. The quasi-experiment 9/11 provides evidence on the relevance of non-economic factors in attitude formation and the role of education in moderating the negative terrorism shock. Additional descriptive analysis suggests that the effects have also been persistent in the years after the attacks.

AB  - This essay explores the intersection of race, religion, and nationality in marriage by concentrating on unions between Britons and 'Arabs' (those from North Africa and the Middle East) in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. Focusing on this area, most of which was not in the British Empire, allows an analysis of the intersection between the empire and the larger world. Marriage was a nexus in the intertwined prejudices of race, empire, class, and religion. Though the British primarily blamed polygamy for any marital problems, their own gendered law of nationality was equally at fault. Indeed, the centrality of gender was clearest in three circumstances. First, many women refused to be 'white women in peril,' instead exercising agency in their relationships. Second, British men who moved to the Middle East, converted to Islam, and married Muslim women, became legal hybrids who struggled to pass on British nationality to their wives and children. Third, British-born women married to Middle Eastern Christians faced similar problems, despite marrying other monogamists. In the 1930s, the British government formed a committee to address these issues, but the committee failed to find solutions, in part because the members, like the British state, supported racial/national coverture for women and thus refused to consider granting women equal rights in nationality. As a result, women married to men of different races and nations remained vulnerable to desertion and divorce in the interwar period. Such issues both confirmed the importance of an imperial frame of mind, but also the fact that the dilemmas went well beyond the formal empire.

AB  - Objective: We investigated teachers' attitudes toward youth suicide and its relationship with quality of life (QOL). Methods: Participants were 77 teachers. A self-administered questionnaire created by the research team was used to assess attitudes toward suicide. The Medical Outcome Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey version 2 (SF-36v2) was used to assess QOL. Results: A little more than one-fourth (26.0%) of the teachers agreed that youth suicide was an issue requiring intervention to address as a problem. Teachers that showed negative attitudes toward suicide for social reasons had a lower "role-social component summary" score on the SF-36v2 (r = .265, p < .05). Conclusions: Increasing correct knowledge about suicide and social support may be necessary for teachers to implement suicide prevention programs for students.

AB  - We outline primary features of a theoretical perspective on processes of social change in human systems that deals with broadly defined kinds of process, the nature of variants that are expressed and consolidate as change occurs, and, with specific reference to agency, the ways in which intentional actors are implicated in the changes that befall them. Our aim is to contribute to a general theory of process that is not prejudiced by the possible misrepresentation of outcomes arising in particular contexts (e.g. modernity), or the contexts themselves, as being causal processes. We direct attention to four problems of a methodological and ethical nature that may arise when analysts strive for generality.

AB  - We present an ancient Greek description written by the philosopher Theophrastus in his classic book Characters' comparable with modern attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. The arguments are based in one chapter of this bookThe Obtuse Manpresenting features of a character closely resembling the modern description of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. In a free comparative exercise, we compared Theophrastus descriptions with modern Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5) attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms. The sentences describing The Obtuse Man written by Theophrastus are similar to several symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and he would probably be currently diagnosed with this disorder as an adult. To our knowledge, this is the oldest description compatible with the current conception of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults in the Western literature. Differently than the moralistic view of ancient Greece regarding those symptoms, the medical attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder conception may be advantageous to patients since it might reduce prejudice and allow individuals to seek treatment.

AB  - In 1885, Kropotkin called for geography to be 'a means of dissipating [hostile] prejudices' between nations that make conflicts more likely, and 'creating other feelings more worthy of humanity'. As a body of scholars, we have risen far more ably to the negative task of 'dissipating' than to the positive charge of 'creating': Geography is better at researching war than peace. To redress that imbalance, we need both to conceptualise more clearly what we mean by peace, and make a commitment to researching and practising it. These arguments are made with reference to the broader literature and research along the Danish/German, Israeli/Palestinian and Kyrgyz/Uzbek interfaces. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of the paper is to summarize the author's negative experiences with police. The author seeks to enlighten readers to the differential experiences of blacks and whites in police interactions. Design/methodology/approach The paper is an essay that details the author's negative experiences with police, while living in a mid-sized Midwestern city. Research limitations/implications The key research implication of the paper is that whites and blacks often have qualitatively different experiences with the police in local communities. While black professionals may be experiencing professional success at work, they may also grapple with racial slights and harassment that undermine their overall physical and psychological wellbeing. Practical implications Practically, this paper highlights the needs for police departments to train police on unconscious biases that lead to potential violence against black people. Prospective police officers should be screened on their racial attitudes and ideology to ensure they are equipped to police a broad array of citizens. Social implications Socially, the paper underscores the unique experiences of black people with police compared to their white counterparts. To reduce cultural mistrust among blacks against whites, the latter must show empathy and understanding when blacks report instances of racial harassment and mistreatment. Also, whites who witness racial harassment perpetrated by their families, friends, and people in general, should speak out against such practices. Originality/value The author thinks the paper is original in that it chronicles his unique, negative experiences with police as a black man in America. The author provides a theoretical background to understand the recent uptick in police violence against blacks and provide helpful tips for moving forward to improve intergroup relations.

AB  - Perceptions of menstruation by media discourses portray this bodily function to be messy, inconvenient, and as an unnecessary phenomenon to be controlled or possibly eliminated. Commercials shown on YouTube targeted toward young women suggest that having a monthly period is not healthy and a lifestyle that is menses free is both pharmacologically available and recommended in order to live a fuller life. We explored the meanings attached to online menstrual suppression commercials with 10 women aged between 18 and 25. In-depth open-ended interviews were conducted over a 10-month period in 2014 after each participant viewed three menstrual suppression online advertisements. Feminist critical discourse was used for analysis with both authors coding for inter-rater reliability recognizing how our age difference and relationship as mother and daughter informed our interpretation. An overarching theme of tension emerged from the interviews with participants feeling detached due to the gendered stereotypes the commercials used to frame menstruation as compared to their own lived experience. Meanings associated with the menstrual suppression commercials were contrary to the participants' lived experience of menstruation as a healthy process not a detrimental one to their well-being as suggested by the commercials. Subliminal messages within the advertisements were identified as reinforcing gender bias and prejudices, including those associated with femininity. Despite attempting to emulate popular culture, the menstrual suppression advertisements were largely dismissed by this group of participants as undermining their intelligence and of intentionally creating divisive binaries between groups of women. This study suggests that historical bias and stereotypical prejudices were identified by this group of young women within the marketing of menstrual suppression products and, as such, were dismissed as inauthentic to the menstruation experience reflecting a form of menstrual activism.

AB  - This study uses a web-based randomized experiment (N=396) to test the effects of message type (narrative vs. expository), stigma (stigmatized vs. nonstigmatized illness), and attribution of responsibility for disease (internal vs. external) on attitudes toward medical cannabis. Narrative-formatted videos produced more favorable attitudes toward medical cannabis, compared with nonnarrative videos. Effects of narratives on attitudes were mediated through transportation and identification with the protagonist. Participants who viewed narratives in which the protagonist had a stigmatized illness and was responsible for contracting the disease expressed more negative attitudes toward medical cannabis. Effects of attribution were mediated through social distance toward medical cannabis users, and moderated by stigma. Implications for narrative persuasion and public opinion regarding medical cannabis are discussed.

AB  - Complexion privilege and color bias have long acted in concert with racism to foster intraracial forms of stratification among African Americans such as the tendency for educational levels and other measureable outcomes (e.g., income) to correspond with skin tone. In this article, we examine the salience of color prejudice at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), including its historical origins, manifestations, and damaging results. We begin with a brief history of Black colleges and then present a historical perspective on colorism in the United States. Based on our synthesis, we offer recommendations for how institutional stakeholders may counter and dismantle colorist issues that commonly arise in HBCU contexts. Last, recommendations for future research and practice are presented.

AB  - HIV-related stigma in the wider community compounds the suffering of people living with HIV (PLWH) and hampers effective HIV prevention and care. This study examines the level of public stigma toward PLWH in Hong Kong and associated social-cultural factors. A telephone survey was conducted in June-July 2016 with 1080 Chinese adults aged 18-94 randomly selected from the general population. The results indicate substantial degree of public stigma toward PLWH. Overall, 58.1% of the participants endorsed at least one statement indicating negative social judgment of PLWH. Over 40% attributed HIV infections to irresponsible behaviors and nearly 30% perceived most PLWH as promiscuous. About 20% considered HIV to be a punishment for bad behavior and believed that PLWH should feel ashamed of themselves. These statistics indicate that HIV-related stigma among the general Hong Kong population had no noticeable reduction in a decade but is lower than that among rural and urban populations in China. Our findings suggest that the lower stigma in Hong Kong may be linked to higher education levels rather than Hongkongers' more Westernized outlook. The results of a multiple regression analysis showed that education level (=-.19), homophobia (=.30), and conformity to norms (=.14) were independent predictors of HIV-related stigma but not age, income, or cultural orientations. By differentiating between associated social-cultural factors, this study provides a more nuanced understanding of the layered nature of HIV-related stigma: not broadly grounded in religion or Chinese culture but stemming from more specific social-cultural beliefs - perceptions of norm violation and negative attitudes toward homosexuality, which were not mutually exclusive. These findings have implications for HIV-related stigma reduction by providing evidence for the importance of addressing homophobia. Existing HIV publicity activities should be re-examined for inadvertent contribution to the stigmatization process - particularly press conferences and prevention campaigns that reinforce negative stereotypes of gay/bisexual men and PLWH.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Some women avoid routine Pap testing because of negative attitudes and beliefs. The ability to measure these factors is limited by lack of valid and reliable tools. Therefore, this article describes steps taken to test a measure. Methods: Validity and reliability testing of psychometric scales was conducted. Results: Sample consisted of 344 women. Using principal component analysis resulted in 4 components: Exam-Related Factors, Benefits, Vulnerability, and Risks and Barriers. Revised scale included 28 items explaining 46% variance, with good internal consistency (alpha = .84). Women who did not routinely screen exhibited significantly more negativity. Conclusions: The measure demonstrates validity and reliability across different groups of women and can be used to inform the design of individualized interventions to promote repeat screening.

AB  - Using a model of the stigmatization of flexible work based on status legitimation theory, we analyze the experiences of a sample of 54 mothers who opted out of professional jobs. Qualitative text analysis reveals that features of women's workplaces are conducive to the creation and maintenance of flexibility stigma and bias and that women working flexibly are subjected to various forms of stigmatizing treatment, which plays a role in their decision to suspend their careers. We find limited evidence, however, that women perceive high levels of stigma and differential treatment as reflecting bias or prejudice. Instead, the majority appears to accept the legitimacy of professional time norms and view their treatment as justifiable. We identify factors that moderate or inhibit their perception of flexibility bias, as distinct from stigma per se, and discuss the limitations of our research as well as its implications for future research and policy.

AB  - The racial categorization literature, reliant on forced-choice tasks, suggests that mixed-race targets are often categorized using the parent faces that created the racially mixed stimuli (e.g., Black or White) or their combination (e.g., Black-White multiracial). In the current studies, we introduce a free-response task that allows for spontaneous categorizations of higher ecological validity. Our results suggest that, when allowed, observers often classify Black-White faces into alternative categories (i.e., responses that are neither the parent races nor their combination), such as Hispanic and Middle Eastern. Furthermore, we find that the stereotypes of the various categories that are mapped to racially mixed faces are distinct, underscoring the importance of understanding how mixed-race targets are spontaneously categorized. Our findings speak to the challenges associated with racial categorization in an increasingly racially diverse population, including discrepancies between target racial identities and their racial categorizations by observers as well as variable stereotype application to mixed-race targets.

LA  - English
AB  - Bioethics and public policy literature suggests that socially marginalized populations may be at increased risk for overuse of physician-assisted suicide (PAS) were it to become more accepted. Yet the attitudes of socially marginalized populations toward PAS have not been widely studied. The present study surveyed a sample of men in a substance abuse recovery program. Participants completed a PAS attitude questionnaire and a religiosity measure. Support for PAS was fairly evenly split, with 52.2% indicating general opposition to PAS and 46.9% indicating general support. Greater religiosity was associated with more negative attitudes toward PAS. Higher educational level was associated with more acceptance. Overall attitudes toward PAS were considerably more negative than those of Dr. George Domino's (2003) general population sample.

AB  - We examined minority-status (non-Cypriot immigrant) and majority-status (Cypriot national) preadolescents' bystander reactions to, and reasoning about, intergroup social exclusion (N = 367; M-age = 11.7 years; 50% Cypriot). Participants read one of three contexts where victim group identity was either non-Cypriot or Cypriot or a context where identity was not mentioned (i.e., control). Cypriot participants reported higher prosocial bystander responses when Cypriot victims were excluded compared with when non-Cypriot victims were excluded. Non-Cypriot participants reported equally high prosocial bystander responses for Cypriot and non-Cypriot victims, and both were higher than those for the control condition. When choosing to challenge social exclusion, non-Cypriot and Cypriot participants employed moral reasoning, focusing on concerns of welfare and equality. When choosing not to challenge the exclusion, Cypriot bystanders referenced personal choice (e.g., "I would not say anything; it is not my problem") more when victim identity was salient. Non-Cypriot bystanders referenced personal choice only when not challenging exclusion in the control context. Cypriot participants with high levels of intergroup contact reported higher helping intentions toward non-Cypriot victims. These findings support and extend social reasoning developmental theory and highlight practical implications for tackling intergroup social exclusion in schools and maintaining positive intergroup relations.

AB  - Background: In Sub-Saharan Africa access to and utilization of sexual and reproductive healthcare is unsatisfactory. Consequently, rates of teenage pregnancy and unsafe abortions among adolescents in Sub-Saharan Africa, including in South Africa remain a public health challenge. The aim of this study was to explore nurses' views on and perceptions of adolescent girls' barriers and needs to accessing and utilizing sexual and reproductive healthcare services.
   Methods: Twenty-four purposively selected healthcare workers from nine public healthcare facilities in Cape Town, South Africa participated in this qualitative descriptive study. Data were collected through nine group discussions, and audio-recorded with hand-written notes taken during the discussions. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis, following the Tesch's eight steps for coding and analysing qualitative data.
   Results: Sexual and reproductive healthcare nurses are generally supportive of adolescents who ask for and use contraceptives. Non-compliance to family planning regimens and repeated requests for termination of pregnancies were perceived by nurses as irresponsible behaviours which are particularly frustrating to them and not in concordance with their personal values. The subsequent nurse-adolescent interactions sometimes appeared to hinder access to and utilization of sexual and reproductive healthcare services by adolescents.
   Conclusions: Nurses perceive certain behaviours of adolescent girls as irresponsible and warrant their negative attitudes and reactions toward them. The negative attitudes and reactions of nurses potentially further compromises access to and utilization of sexual and reproductive healthcare services by adolescent girls in South Africa and requires urgent attention. Adolescent-friendly clinic hours together with youth-friendly nurses is likely to encourage adolescent girls to access sexual and reproductive healthcare services and improve the use thereof.

AB  - It is well supported that intergroup contact reduces prejudice and that positive contact can increase trust and improve attitudes between groups in conflict. In segregated societies, however, contact is often difficult or undesirable when political parties or institutions obstruct interactions contact. Therefore, when contact does occur it is vital that it is of positive quality that could potentially lead to increased intentions for further contact, as a way of facilitating sustained contact, desegregation and promoting peace. With this in mind, the present article examines intergroup contact, intergroup trust, and future contact intentions in 2 conflict settings; Cyprus and Northern Ireland. Participants took part in an online survey that asked them to report on their contact experiences, intergroup trust, outgroup evaluation, and future contact intentions. Separate models are tested for Protestants and Catholics in Northern Ireland (n = 268) and for Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in Cyprus (n = 408). As expected, participants from Northern Ireland experienced more and better quality contact compared with participants from Cyprus. For Protestants, Catholics, and Greek Cypriots, results show that quality of contact, above quantity of contact, predicts future contact intentions, and improved attitudes through the mediation of intergroup trust. For Turkish Cypriots, contact quality additionally directly predicted outgroup evaluation without necessarily increasing trust. We argue that positive contact is an important route for promoting desegregation in societies with high residential segregation but that it is vital to understand contextual and group status when understanding these relationships.

AB  - Background: Transgender women from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are understudied, their coping strategies and struggles underrecognised.Aims: This study aimed to explore the lived experiences of transgender women from two major cities located in Brazil and India, LMICs with high rates of transphobia and gender-based violence.Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods, exploratory study, including focus group discussions (FGDs) and brief survey interviews with 23 transgender women from Hyderabad, India and 12 transgender women from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Herein we present the combined (qualitative and quantitative) results related to discrimination, stigma, violence, and suicidality in transgender women's lives.Results: Three major themes emerged from FGDs: stigma and discrimination; violence, and suicidality. Lack of education and working opportunities influence high levels of poverty and engagement in survival sex work by transgender women in both cities. Study participants live in large cities with more than 6 million inhabitants, but transgender women reported chronic social isolation. Participants disclosed frequent suicide ideation and suicide attempts. Brief surveys corroborate FGD findings, identifying high prevalence of discrimination, intimate partner violence, suicidality and low social support.Discussion: Multiple layers of stigma, discrimination, violence and social isolation affect transgender women's quality of life in Hyderabad and Rio de Janeiro. Strategies sensitive to gender and culture should be implemented to tackle entrenched prejudice and social exclusion reported by transgender women. Additional social support strategies, better access to education and employment opportunities are also urgently needed. Improving the availability of evidence-based mental health interventions addressing the high prevalence of suicidality among transgender women from Hyderabad, India and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil should be prioritized.

AB  - Empirical evidence has demonstrated that an individual's cultural values can influence his or her mental health. This study extends previous research by proposing and testing a model that examines mediating processes underlying the relationship between individuals' cultural values and their mental health. This 2-stage study used data collected from 208 (at time 1) and 159 (at time 2) full-time staff employed by private enterprises in Taiwan. The author tested hypotheses through the use of hierarchical multiple regression. The results showed that under horizontal individualism and vertical collectivism, the predictors of negative mental health (ie, somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction and/or severe depression) were partially and almost completely achieved through the mediating effect of the negative attitudes toward emotional expression.

However, it is not well known how gender equality is associated with HST. Methods: We used intervention-arm data from a cluster-randomised controlled HST intervention trial (N = 1 618) conducted in Uganda to determine the association between attitudes towards intimate partner violence (IPV), decision-making power and male partner's uptake of HST among heterosexual couples expecting a child in south-central Uganda. The original study question was to assess the impact of providing pregnant women with HST kits to improve male partner's HIV testing rates. For this analysis, the primary exposures were gender equality (measured by male partner's and female partner's attitudes towards IPV and the female partner's household decision-making power), and the primary outcome was the male partner's uptake of HST. Multivariate logistic regression was used for analysis. Results: We found that male partner HST uptake did not vary depending on male partner's attitudes towards IPV or decision-making power; however, male partner HST uptake did depend on the female partner's attitude towards IPV, with 1.76 times more testing (95% CI 1.06-2.92) in couples where the woman had "medium" versus "high" acceptance of IPV, and 1.82 times more testing (95% CI 1.08-3.08) in couples where the woman had "low" versus "high" acceptance of IPV. Conclusions: This study shows the importance of appropriate negative attitudes by women to IPV in increasing male partner's HST uptake to integrate HST into national health care policies.

AB  - Objectives. Although experiencing weight bias is associated with poor physical and psychological health, health professionals often stigmatize overweight and obese clients. The objective of this study was to evaluate a brief educational intervention that aimed to reduce weight bias among Australian pre-service health students by challenging beliefs about the controllability of weight.
   Design. Non-equivalent group comparison trial.
   Methods. Undergraduate psychology students were assigned to an intervention (n = 30), control (n = 35), or comparison (n = 20) condition. The intervention condition received a lecture on obesity, weight bias, and the multiple determinants of weight; the comparison condition received a lecture on obesity and the behavioural determinants of weight; and the control condition received no lecture. Beliefs about the controllability of weight and attitudes towards overweight and obese people were assessed 1 week pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention, and 3 weeks post-intervention.
   Results. After receiving the lecture, participants in the intervention group were less likely to believe that weight is solely within individual control and were also less likely to hold negative attitudes towards overweight and obese people and rate them as unattractive. These changes were maintained 3 weeks post-intervention. There were no such changes in the control or comparison groups. Disparagement of overweight and obese peoples' social character increased over time for participants in the control condition but did not change in the comparison or intervention groups.
   Conclusions. This study provides evidence that brief, education-based anti-weight bias interventions show success in challenging weight controllability beliefs and reducing weight bias among pre-service health students.

AB  - To hold their Members of Parliament individually accountable for their legislative behaviour, British voters would need to base their decision to vote for an MP at least partially on the extent to which the MP's legislative voting behaviour deviated from that of the MP's party leadership. Voters should evaluate this deviation contingent on their views of the party leadership. MP rebellion can signal that voterMP congruence is greater than that of the voter and the MP's party leadership. In this article it is found that only constituents with negative attitudes toward the Labour government reward rebellious Labour MPs, albeit to a limited extent. A similar conditional association is not observed on a single issue: Iraq. The policy accountability of MPs is relatively weak and general rather than issue-specific.

AB  - Stigma has been modeled in the literature as a cost of welfare participation, providing a disincentive to welfare entry; hence, traditional models predict that stigma leads to higher search effort and higher employment. We develop a more comprehensive model that accounts for the fact that welfare stigma may elicit psychological effects and foster negative attitudes towards welfare recipients, affecting their employment prospects. We find two contrasting effects. The first reinforces the standard prediction: rational individuals foreseeing the reduction in employability defer welfare entry (deterrence effect); the second goes in the opposite direction: once assisted, individuals experience less welfare-to-employment transitions, both because of reduced search effectiveness and of reduced search effort (entrapment effect). When stigma is not too high, the latter effect prevails: more stigma yields to less employment and more welfare participation. The result is stronger if individuals are not able to foresee their loss of employability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigates the psychological mechanism by which source interactivity influences health message evaluations. Combining health communication and interactivity literature, two theoretical routes to persuasion were proposed: enhanced sense of community and reduced psychological reactance. A 2 x 2 (source interactivity: absence vs. presence X smoking status: nonsmoker vs. current smoker) factorial-design experiment (N = 343) was conducted on an anti-smoking website. Result revealed that the endorsing and sharing features that resembled the Like button on Facebook enhanced self-as-source perceptions and sense of community, which exerted significant effects on message credibility for smokers and message enjoyment for nonsmokers. Among smokers, self-as-source perceptions reduced psychological reactance, which promoted greater message credibility and more negative attitudes toward smoking behavior.

AB  - Studies of the relationship between retirement and subsequent health, including longevity, have produced mixed findings. One reason may be that these studies have not taken attitudes toward retirement into account. In the current study we examined whether attitudes toward retirement can impact longevity. The cohort consisted of 394 participants who were followed for 23 years. As predicted, participants with positive attitudes toward retirement at the start of the study lived significantly longer than those with negative attitudes toward retirement. The positive attitudes-toward-retirement group had a median survival advantage of 4.9 years. This survival advantage remained after controlling for relevant covariates, including age, functional health, socio-economic status, and whether employed or retired. Our findings suggest that psychological planning for retirement is as important as the more traditional forms of planning.

TI  - Youth Opinions of Tobacco Control in New Zealand: Support for Specific Measures and the Relationship With Smoking Behaviors Among 14-15-Year-Olds
T2  - NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH
LA  - English
KW  - CAMPAIGN
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the attitudes of young people toward tobacco control and explore the association between these attitudes and both smoking intentions and behavior.
   The study used data from a national survey of 14- and 15-year-old students in New Zealand (NZ) investigating tobacco use and attitudes. Attitudes to tobacco control were assessed using student responses to 7 statements relating to specific tobacco control measures; outdoor smoking bans, increased and hypothecated tax, display bans, plain packaging, and reduced access. Analysis was conducted on a final sample of 24,495 students aged 14-15 years. Chi-square testing was used to determine group differences in smoking status and attitudes toward tobacco control measures, while logistic regression was used to test associations between youth attitudes and both smoking susceptibility and current smoking.
   Our results demonstrate youth support for tobacco control interventions in NZ. Commercial access measures received the most support, while plain packaging and display bans were the least supported measures among young people. Young people's attitudes toward tobacco control measures were found to be associated with smoking behavior; those who were opposed to measures were more likely to be susceptible to smoking or be current smokers.
   Young people in NZ have opinions when it comes to tobacco control, and it is important to investigate these when developing tobacco control policies that are aimed to have an effect on this demographic. The results provide evidence to support the proposed "end game" strategies currently being considered in NZ.

AB  - Consumer robots are predicted to be employed in a variety of customer-facing situations. As these robots are designed to look and behave like humans, consumers attribute human traits to thema phenomenon known as the Eliza Effect. In four experiments, we show that the anthropomorphism of a consumer robot increases psychological warmth but decreases attitudes, due to uncanniness. Competence judgments are much less affected and not subject to a decrease in attitudes. The current research contributes to research on artificial intelligence, anthropomorphism, and the uncanny valley phenomenon. We suggest to managers that they need to make sure that the appearances and behaviors of robots are not too human-like to avoid negative attitudes toward robots. Moreover, managers and researchers should collaborate to determine the optimal level of anthropomorphism.

AB  - Research finds that social media platforms' peer-to-peer structures shape the public discourse and increase citizens' likelihood of exposure to unregulated, false, and prejudicial content. Here, we test whether self-reported reliance on social media as a primary news source is linked to racialised policy support, taking the case of United States Muslims, a publicly visible but understudied group about whom significant false and prejudicial content is abundant on these platforms. Drawing on three original surveys and the Nationscape dataset, we find a strong and consistent association between reliance on social media and support for a range of anti-Muslim policies. Importantly, reliance on social media is linked to policy attitudes across the partisan divide and for individuals who reported holding positive or negative feelings towards Muslims. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the political ramification of information presented on contemporary social media outlets, particularly information related to stigmatised groups.

AB  - Are politicians with elite backgrounds more electable? In this article, we test whether being an elite is a net positive or negative in running for public office via an original survey experiment that manipulates one of the most salient indicators of eliteness in American life: university education. We find that liberals, but not conservatives, perceive politicians who attended elite schools to be more competent. Meanwhile, conservatives, but not liberals, perceive politicians who attended elite schools to be less relatable. On average, citizens are mildly, but not significantly, less inclined to vote for elite-educated politicians. By embedding treatments in our survey for whether politicians came from advantaged or disadvantaged upbringings, we also confirm that our results do not entirely reflect generic attitudes toward economically privileged candidates.

AB  - Having close relationships with outgroup members is an especially powerful form of intergroup contact that can reduce prejudice. Rather than examine the consequences of forming close outgroup relationships, which has previously been studied as part of intergroup contact theory, we examine how outgroup relationships-relative to ingroup relationships-form in the first place. We collected 7 years of data from Jewish Israeli and Palestinian teenagers attending a 3-week summer camp at Seeds of Peace, one of the largest conflict transformation programs in the world. We tested how being assigned to share an activity group (e.g., bunk, table, dialogue group) influenced relationship formation among outgroup pairs (Jewish Israeli-Palestinian) compared with ingroup pairs (Israeli-Israeli, Palestinian-Palestinian). Existing research offers competing theories for whether propinquity is more impactful for the formation of ingroup or outgroup relationships; here, we found propinquity was significantly more impactful for outgroup relationships. Whereas 2 ingroup participants were 4.46 times more likely to become close if they were in the same versus different bunk, for example, 2 outgroup participants were 11.72 times more likely to become close. We propose that sharing an activity group is especially powerful for more dissimilar dyads because people are less likely to spontaneously engage with outgroup members in ways that promote relationships. Thus, structured, meaningful engagement can counteract homophily. Furthermore, in this setting, propinquity proved to be an even better predictor of outgroup (vs. ingroup) relationship formation than that pair's initial outgroup attitudes. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for intergroup processes and relationship formation.

AB  - Albinism includes a group of inherited conditions that result in reduced melanin production. It has been documented across the world, with a high frequency in sub-Saharan Africa. There is very little published research about the lives of people with albinism, but available evidence shows that myths abound regarding their condition. They are feared, viewed with suspicion and believed to have supernatural powers. In this study we explored the links between beliefs, myths, traditions and positive/negative attitudes that surround people with albinism in Uganda. The study was located philosophically within Ubuntu-an-Afrocentric worldview-and theoretically within the Common-Sense Model of self-regulation of health and illness that originates from the work of Leventhal in 2003. This qualitative study took place in eight districts of Busoga sub-region, Uganda between 2015 and 2017. Data collection comprised eight group discussions and 17 individual interviews with a range of informants, capturing the viewpoints of 73 participants. Findings lend support to previous research, highlighting the lifetime discrimination and disadvantage experienced by many people with albinism. It shows that there is still much to be done to address the pervasive and potentially harmful beliefs and misconceptions about people with albinism.

AB  - Background: China's achievements in immunization are being threatened by a vaccine crisis. This paper aims to investigate vaccine confidence in China after the Changsheng vaccine incident and attempts to identify the factors contributing to it.
   Methods: An online cross-sectional investigation was conducted from 1 to 25 September 2018. Descriptive analysis and logistic regression were performed to examine the associations between socio-demographic factors, cognition and attitudes towards the Changsheng vaccine incident and vaccine confidence.
   Results: We included 1115 respondents in the final analysis, and found that approximately 70% (783) of the respondents did not have vaccine confidence. More than half of the respondents (54.53%) were dissatisfied with the government's response measures to the Changsheng vaccine incident. The logistic regression model indicated that vaccine confidence was positively associated with the degree of satisfaction with the government's response measures (OR = 1.621, 95% CI = 1.215-2.163), attitudes towards the risks and benefits of vaccination (OR = 1.501, 95% CI = 1.119-2.013), concerns about vaccine safety (OR = 0.480, 95% CI = 0.317-0.726), and vaccine efficacy (OR = 0.594, 95% CI = 0.394-0.895).
   Conclusions: A majority of the respondents held negative attitudes towards vaccines after the Changsheng vaccine incident. A coordinated effort is required to restore public confidence in vaccines, especially in China, where a nationwide mandatory immunization policy is implemented. To end dissent towards inoculation, a series of actions is crucial and multiple parties should work together to advance efforts and explore the possibility of establishing an open and transparent regulatory system.

AB  - With numerous HIV service gaps in prisons and jails, there has been little research on HIV stigma attitudes among correctional staff. Such attitudes may undermine HIV services for inmates at risk of or infected with HIV. This HIV stigma attitudes survey among 218 correctional staff in 32 US facilities (1) provides an overview of staff's stigma attitudes, (2) reports psychometric analyses of domains in Earnshaw and Chaudoir's HIV Stigma Framework (HSF), and (3) explores differences in stigma attitudes among different staff types. Overall, correctional and medical staff expressed non stigmatizing attitudes toward people living with HIV/AIDS, but perceived that stigma and discrimination exist in others. Factor analyses revealed a three factor structure capturing two mechanisms of the HSF (prejudice, discrimination). Few factor score differences were found by staff type or setting. Implications for correctional HIV services and future research on HIV stigma attitudes are discussed.

AB  - Many white psychotherapists may lack the skills required to work effectively with service users from minoritised ethnicities. This article proposes that the nature of this skills deficit can be understood through applying the Declarative-Procedural-Reflective (DPR) model of therapist skill development. The DPR model has been used in a range of psychotherapeutic contexts, and it provides a systematic account of how therapists from all modalities develop and can improve their skills. Adapting this model to white therapists' skills in working with service users from minoritised ethnicities allows the identification of specific areas of skills deficit, and therefore clear recommendations as to how to address those deficits. The application of the DPR model to this context suggests that there are clear areas of skills deficit in terms of knowledge base, the practical skills of carrying out therapy, and the ability of therapists to reflect on their work with service users from minoritised ethnicities. I conclude by making a number of suggestions as to how those deficits could be addressed, both by individual therapists and at a systemic level.
   Key learning aims
   (1) To explore why some white psychotherapists find it more difficult to work effectively with service users from minoritised ethnicities.
   (2) To conceptualise difficulties in working with service users from minoritised ethnicities as an issue of clinical skill, knowledge and attitude development, where therapists' skills can be improved if specific deficits are appropriately addressed.
   (3) To use the structure of the DPR model to better understand how deficits in therapists' skills, knowledge and reflective ability may have an impact on their work with service users from minoritised ethnicities. This allows the identification of specific areas of deficit, and therefore clear recommendations as to how to address those deficits.
   (4) This is primarily addressed at CBT therapists, but the points raised in this article apply to all schools of therapy.

AB  - The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore experiences of naturalistic interpersonal contact with persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) and attitudes toward persons with IDD among Korean American adolescents and young adults. In interviews with 12 Korean American high school and college students, Korean American participants reported six common themes regarding their experiences of interpersonal contact with persons with IDD: 1) affective attitude, 2) behavioral attitude, 3) cognitive attitude, 4) communication with persons with IDD, 5) moments of having a positive attitude, and 6) comparisons of attitudes in the United States and Korea. Recommendations for research and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Because legal determinations often turn on motive, and motives are often complex, courts must decide what to do about mixed motives. For example, a boss might fire someone both for lawful reasons relating to job performance and also because of illegal prejudice. Increasingly, courts evaluate such cases under a "But For standard," which finds for the plaintiff only if the defendant would have acted differently but for the bad motive. Put another way, the defendant loses unless the bad motive made some kind of causal difference in outcomes. While this approach is intuitive, I argue that the But-For standard is problematic. The widespread acceptance of the But-For standard is the most important failure in our jurisprudence of mixed motives.

AB  - Although intergroup contact can reduce prejudice, opportunities to experience such contact are often constrained by systems of segregation. Work on this problem has focused on divisions entrenched within institutions of residence, education, and employment. Our research employed a complementary approach, which treated segregation as the outcome of individuals' movements over time within everyday life spaces. Taking as a case study Catholics' and Protestants' use of public environments in north Belfast, we used GPS tracking technology, combined with GIS analytics, to explore the time geography of residents' activity space use over a 2-week period (Study 1). We also conducted a field survey to explore how psychological factors shaped their willingness to use activity spaces beyond their own communities (Study 2). Analysis based on around 1,000 hr of raw movement data revealed that north Belfast is marked by high levels of segregation, expressed via residents' limited use of public spaces, facilities, and pathways located in outgroup areas. However, use of shared spaces is also common, with Catholics spending more time in such spaces than Protestants. Structural equation modeling suggested that residents' self-reported willingness to use activity spaces outside their own communities was associated with both negative and positive intergroup contact-relationships partially mediated by realistic threat, symbolic threat, and anxiety over interaction across sectarian lines. Both kinds of contact and realistic threat were also associated with the time residents actually spent in spaces beyond their own communities. Opportunities for integrating psychological and geographic research on contact and segregation are highlighted.

AB  - The present research investigated linguistic description as a moderator of biased evaluations of counterstereotypical individuals. Members of an online participant pool (N = 237) indicated their liking for stereotypical and counterstereotypical individuals who were described using adjectives or behaviors. There was a significant interaction between target typicality and linguistic description: People liked counterstereotypical individuals more than stereotypical individuals when target individuals were described using adjectives. In contrast, they showed no bias or a negative bias against counterstereotypical individuals who were described using behaviors. This interaction effect generalized across gender targets (men/women) and sexuality targets (gay/straight), and it was partially mediated by subjective processing fluency. Implications for the backlash effect and prejudice reduction are discussed.

AB  - This study explored youths' experiences and perceptions about community engagement as a result of participating in a community-based data collection project using paper and mobile technology park environmental audit tools. In July 2014, youth (ages 11-18, n= 50) were recruited to participate in nine focus groups after auditing two parks each using paper, electronic, or both versions of the Community Park Audit Tool in Greenville County, SC. The focus groups explored the youths' experiences participating in the project, changes as a result of participation, suggested uses of park audit data collected, and who should use the tools.
   Four themes emerged related to youths' project participation experiences: two positive (fun and new experiences) and two negative (uncomfortable/unsafe and travel issues). Changes described as a result of participating in the project fell into four themes: increased awareness, motivation for further action, physical activity benefits, and no change. Additionally, youth had numerous suggestions for utilizing the data collected that were coded into six themes: maintenance & aesthetics, feature/amenity addition, online park information, park rating/review system, fundraising, and organizing community projects. Finally, six themes emerged regarding who the youth felt could use the tools: frequent park visitors, community groups/organizations, parks and recreation professionals, adults, youth, and everyone.
   This study revealed a wealth of information about youth experiences conducting park audits for community health promotion. Understanding youth attitudes and preferences can help advance youth empowerment and civic engagement efforts to promote individual and community health. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

KW  - TRANSLATION
AB  - Education of nurses in the Republic of Croatia is being developed as a result of compliance with education in the European Union and the implementation of nursing research that leads to the growth of the whole profession. However, prejudice against the nursing profession is still present and therefore it is necessary to explore the attitudes of the general population and the population of nurses in the nursing profession in order to discover the causes of such prejudices and act on them. Therefore, the aim of this paper was to present transcultural adaptation and validation of the Nursing Image Questionnaire, which was created by Toth and associates (1998). The questionnaire, which includes 30 items and measures how an individual looks at the roles, values, and professional activities of nurses, was conducted as part of a preliminary study and was culturally adapted. The final study included 905 students who in 2011 and 2012 enrolled in the first year of full-time and parttime nursing study; the questionnaire was completed by 725 students. Toth and associates assumed that the attitude toward nursing is expressed as the sum of the responses of all the items, which would mean a factor structure with high item intercorrelation, but they also split the questionnaire into five thematic units. Results showed that, contrary to expectations, intercorrelations of items were extremely low and that following the completion of factor analysis, no satisfactory construct validity was established. From the obtained results, it can be concluded that it is not justified to create a latent dimension as established by research of Toth and associates, and the items, although there is a correlation between some of them, should be interpreted and analysed as independent constructs.

AB  - Introduction: Arts-based knowledge translation (ABKT) strategies represent an innovative approach to disseminate results of qualitative studies, especially to tackle social issues, such as stigma and prejudice, due to knowledge gaps. Epilepsy affects 1% of the world population and brings a strong psychosocial impact to the patient, family members, and caregivers. People with epilepsy have difficulties to establish social relationships due to stigma.
   Methods: In this study, we narrate the construction of an aerial and contemporary dance based on the results of a qualitative study with patients with epilepsy, their families, and health professionals, called "'Dialogue with Emotions' to overcome barriers and to improve quality of life in epilepsy". Under the ABKT classification, this study is defined as a strategy of subjective key messages, which are presented as active performances (contemporary dance and aerial acrobacies).
   Results: In this sense, the choreography called "Perspective" presented elements that relate to suffering, pain, fear, social isolation, followed by mutual support, resilience, adaptation, and happiness. Through its scenic poetry and acrobatics combined with special lighting effect and soundtrack, this choreography represents the potential to overcome suffering and experience happiness if people embrace a different perspective over epilepsy.
   Conclusion: This presentation conveyed perceptions on epilepsy in a way to create an experience for its audience. It represented an opportunity to stimulate reflection, discussion, and knowledge construction between members of the academy, as well as patients and caregivers. Thus, this artistic presentation was able to promote discussions about epilepsy, disseminating research results, promoting empathy and compassion. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Yuval-Davis discusses three interconnected questions relating to identity. She first examines whether and in what ways the notion of identity should be theorized, on the one hand, and empirically researched, on the other, focusing on the opposing views of Stuart Hall and Robin Williams. She then examines the contested question of what is identity, positioning it in relation to notions of belonging and the politics of belonging, and in relation to several influential schools of thought, especially those that construct identity as a mode of narrative, as a mode of performativity or as a dialogical practice. Her third interrelated question concerns the boundaries of identity and the relationship between self and non-self. She explores both social psychological and psychoanalytical approaches to that question, and deals with questions such as reflexivity, identifications and forced identities. The last part of the article explores several types of relationships between self and non-self, such as: 'me' and 'us'; 'me/us' and 'them'; 'me' and other 'others'; 'me' and the transversal 'us/them'. Yuval-Davis's basic argument here is that dichotomous notions of identity and difference, when theorizing boundaries of individual and collective identities, are more misleading than explanatory.

AB  - While levels of weight bias vary among individuals, it is not clear why one person possesses stronger anti-fat attitudes than another person. This investigation examined whether individual differences commonly associated with greater anti-fat bias are also associated with a greater preference for thinness among people of varying levels of weight. Young adults (62% women; 84% Caucasian) recruited from psychology classes (N = 308) rated four male and female figures with approximate BMIs of 18.5, 25, 30, and 40, on measures of dislike and personality characteristics and completed measures assessing weight controllability, attitudes toward the obese, and perceptual reliance. Greater negative attitudes, weight controllability beliefs, and perceptual reliance were positively associated with greater dislike and negative personality attributes among obese/severely obese figures, but inversely related among low normal weight figures. Individuals who judge others based on physical features or who view obesity as controllable evidence greater weight bias and a stronger preference for thin body types. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The discipline of statistics seems well suited to the integration of technology in a lecture as a means to enhance student learning and engagement. Technology can be used to simulate statistical concepts, create interactive learning exercises, and illustrate real world applications of statistics. The present study aimed to better understand the use of such applications during lectures from the student's perspective. The technology used included multimedia, computer-based simulations, animations, and statistical software. Interviews were conducted on a stratified random sample of 38 students in a first year statistics course. The results showed three global effects on student learning and engagement: showed the practical application of statistics, helped with understanding statistics, and addressed negative attitudes towards statistics. The results are examined from within a blended learning framework and the benefits and drawbacks to the integration of technology during lectures are discussed.

AB  - Objective The current study examined the relationship between minority stress, social support, and the mental health of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) Australians during the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey. Method A sample of 1,305 Australian LGB adults completed an online survey that measured their frequency of exposure to negative and positive media messages about same-sex marriage, perceived personal support, and psychological distress during the postal survey. Results More frequent exposure to negative media messages about same-sex marriage was associated with greater psychological distress. This association, however, was significantly weaker amongst participants who perceived greater personal support for same-sex marriage from their immediate social network. Alternatively, exposure to positive messages of public support via public and social media was not associated with psychological distress, and did not moderate the association between negative media message exposure and psychological distress. Nonetheless, more frequent exposure to public support was more strongly associated with reduced psychological distress amongst participants who perceived their immediate social network to be less supportive of same-sex marriage. Conclusions The findings highlight how legislative processes related to the rights of stigmatised, minority populations have the potential to adversely affect their mental health. The findings also highlight the role of personal and public support as protective factors against minority stress. Within the limits of a cross-sectional study design, these findings have implications for public policy and legislative decision-making, treating clinicians of LGB clients, and LGB rights and mental health organisations.

AB  - Background Many people with epilepsy in low-income countries do not receive appropriate biomedical treatment. This epilepsy treatment gap might be caused by patients not seeking biomedical treatment or not adhering to prescribed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). We measured the prevalence of and investigated risk factors for the epilepsy treatment gap in rural Kenya.
   Methods All people with active convulsive epilepsy identified during a cross-sectional survey of 232176 people in Kilifi were approached. The epilepsy treatment gap was defined as the percentage of people with active epilepsy who had not accessed biomedical services or who were not on treatment or were on inadequate treatment. Information about risk factors was obtained through a questionnaire-based interview of sociodemographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, access to health facilities, seizures, stigma, and beliefs and attitudes about epilepsy. The factors associated with people not seeking biomedical treatment and not adhering to AEDs were investigated separately, adjusted for age.
   Findings 673 people with epilepsy were interviewed, of whom 499 (74%) reported seeking treatment from a health facility. Blood samples were taken from 502 (75%) people, of whom 132 (26%) reported taking AEDs, but 189 (38%) had AEDs detectable in the blood. The sensitivity and specificity of self-reported adherence compared with AEDs detected in blood were 38.1% (95% CI 31.1-45.4) and 80.8% (76.0-85.0). The epilepsy treatment gap was 62.4% (58.1-66.6). In multivariable analysis, failure to seek biomedical treatment was associated with a patient holding traditional animistic religious beliefs (adjusted odds ratio 1.85, 95% CI 1-11-2.71), reporting negative attitudes about biomedical treatment (0.86, 0.78-0.95), living more than 30 km from health facilities (3.89, 1.77-8.51), paying for AEDs (2- 99, 1.82-4.92), having learning difficulties (2.30, 1.29-4.11), having had epilepsy for longer than 10 years (4.60, 2.07-10.23), and having focal seizures (2.28, 1.50-3.47). Reduced adherence was associated with negative attitudes about epilepsy (1.10, 1.03-1.18) and taking of AEDs for longer than 5 years (3.78, 1.79-7.98).
   Interpretation The sensitivity and specificity of self-reported adherence is poor, but on the basis of AED detection in blood almost two-thirds of patients with epilepsy were not on treatment. Education about epilepsy and making AEDs freely available in health facilities near people with epilepsy should be investigated as potential ways to reduce the epilepsy treatment gap.

AB  - This article examines the symbolic function of hate crime law. By challenging the norms that sustain and promote prejudice, hate crime law seeks to contribute to claims for social justice on behalf of victim groups. This symbolic function cannot be achieved by legal rules alone. Drawing upon theories of emotional thinking, the article argues that the moral work of hate crime laws is dependent upon the capacity of victim groups to engender compassionate thinking that helps reconfigure perceptions of them as dangerous, illegitimate or inferior Others. This analysis seeks to contribute to our understanding of the processes through which some minority communities fall short of the image of ideal victims capable of contributing to the moral claim embedded in hate crime law.

KW  - AWARENESS
AB  - Rationale: Many people overestimate the amount of alcohol that increases their risk of harm and so may not perceive any need to change their drinking behaviour. Several countries have developed low-risk drinking guidelines, yet awareness of these guidelines remains low. Furthermore, mass media campaigns about alcohol-related harms may have limited impact if people do not perceive their current consumption as potentially harmful. Integrating drinking guidelines into media campaigns about alcohol's harms can concurrently provide drinkers with information about low-risk drinking levels and compelling reasons to comply.
   Objective: Our aim was to build understanding of the effectiveness of messages about the long-term harms of drinking and low-risk drinking guidelines, by testing the mediating effects of estimates of harmful drinking levels and attitudes towards drinking alcohol on subsequent intentions and behaviours.
   Method: In an online experiment conducted in 2016, n = 1156 Australian adult monthly drinkers were randomly assigned to view advertisements for non-alcohol products (NON-ALC; control), advertisements featuring long-term harms of alcohol (LTH), or LTH advertisements plus a guideline message (LTH + G). Immediately following exposure, we measured estimates of harmful drinking levels and attitudes towards drinking alcohol. One week later, we measured intentions to drink less and behavioural compliance with the guideline.
   Results: Compared to NON-ALC advertisements, exposure to LTH + G advertisements increased (i) the proportion of respondents who correctly estimated harmful drinking levels, which in turn, strengthened intentions to drink less (42% of the total effect was mediated), and (ii) negative attitudes, which in turn, also increased intentions to drink less (35% mediated) and behavioural compliance (24% mediated). Compared to NON-ALC, LTH advertisements increased negative attitudes, which in turn strengthened intentions to drink less (53% mediated).
   Conclusions: When paired with effective alcohol harm reduction television advertisements, messages promoting low-risk drinking guidelines can increase drinkers' intentions to reduce their alcohol consumption and compliance with low-risk drinking guidelines.

AB  - This study examines the influence of an observer's value orientation and personality type on attitudes toward whistleblowing. Based on a review of the literature we generated three hypotheses to explain the relationship between these two factors and attitudes toward whistleblowing, and these were tested using data collected from 490 university students in South Korea. The survey comprises two parts, a measure of MBTI personality types, and a section assessing value orientations and attitudes toward whistleblowing. Regression analysis was conducted to clarify the influence of the independent variables. The study offers two main contributions. First, it examines what role an observer's value orientation and personality type play in determining the attitudes. Second, it provides insights into designing customized ethical training programs and developing policy aimed at changing negative attitudes toward whistleblowing.

TI  - What Was Margaret Thatcher's Legacy for Women?
T2  - WOMENS HISTORY REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - This article considers the legacy for women of Margaret Thatcher (1925-2013), Britain's first and to date only woman prime minister. It is suggested that although Thatcher had to struggle against many of the sexist prejudices of her day to achieve her political ambitions, she was no feminist. The hard ladder up which she had climbed was drawn up and not extended to other women. Yet for some women, such as the Spice Girls, she was the pioneer of their ideology of girl power. Overall, it is concluded that Thatcher was a polarising figure whose legacy is one of much divisiveness, in which the divisions between women is only one of many strands.

AB  - This research evaluates enclosed mall shoppers' neural activation in response to the social presence of other people. The study draws on social impact theory to show how the mere presence of other people in an enclosed shopping mall influences six different emotions, including excitement, interest, stress, engagement, focus, and relaxation, within a focal shopper. We evaluate shoppers' emotions by employing the Emotiv EPOC+ headset to obtain electroencephalogram recordings. The data obtained from mall shoppers reveal that the mere presence of other shoppers in an enclosed mall evokes high levels of stress, decreases excitement, and impedes a shopper's ability to focus on a task. These findings imply that shoppers may avoid malls because of their cognitive responses to the social presence of other people, which promotes negative attitudes toward enclosed malls.

AB  - If public attitudes towards the welfare state, inequality and immigration are becoming increasingly polarized, as recent political events might suggest, the space for progressive social policies is more constrained. Using data from the British Social Attitudes Survey (BSA) spanning 23years, we analyse trends in these attitudes, examining whether there has been divergence between those who have been more and less exposed to disadvantage through changes in the economy and the welfare state across more than two decades. Taken in this longer term context, and examining characteristics not previously considered in relation to public attitudes such as lone parenthood and disability, we find little evidence of polarization in attitudes to welfare, inequality and immigration and even some evidence of attitudinal gaps narrowing. We conclude that given this lack of division, there may be greater room for more pro-welfare and progressive policies than the prevalent narrative of polarization suggests.

AB  - The dominant theoretical approach to exploring ethnic and racial inequality in marketing and consumer research focuses on discrete acts of discrimination that stem from social psychological causes (e.g., prejudice, stereotypes, and negative racial attitudes). It holds limited explanatory power for meso- and macro-structural phenomena that also generate racialized outcomes. An implication is that ethnic and racial inequality can be portrayed as something imposed on market systems rather than a routine feature of their functioning. In response, I introduce and synthesize two variants of Racial Formation Theory (RFT) and propose it as a useful theoretical approach for addressing whether and how organizational and institutional actors in market systems engage in goal-directed action that allocates resources in ways that challenge (or reinforce) ethnic and racial oppression.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of the study was to quantify the association between perceived everyday discrimination and binge eating among Latinas in the United States.
   Methods: Participants included 1014 Latinas from the 2002-2003 National Latino and Asian American Study. Modified Poisson models with robust standard errors were used to estimate sociodemographic-adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of binge eating associated with overall and attribution-specific discrimination.
   Results: Approximately 7% of Latinas reported binge eating. Increased frequency of discrimination was associated with a higher prevalence of binge eating (aPR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.23-2.06), and Latinas reporting frequencies of discrimination in the top tertile had the greatest prevalence elevation (aPR, 3.63; 95% CI, 1.32-10.00). There were important differences by discrimination attribution: Latinas experiencing primarily height/weight-based or skin color-based discrimination had the greatest prevalence elevation relative to those reporting no discrimination (aPR, 10.24; 95% CI, 2.95-35.51; and aPR, 8.83; 95% CI, 2.08-37.54, respectively), whereas Latinas reporting primarily race-based discrimination had the lowest prevalence elevation (aPR, 1.64; 95% CI, 0.47-5.69).
   Conclusions: Discrimination may be an important social determinant of Latinas' binge eating. Future research should incorporate expanded conceptual models that account for Latinas' complex social environment, focusing on intersecting dimensions of identity. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Community opposition to locally unwanted development is not inherently problematic, but it can be destructive where conflict between proponents and objectors escalates. This paper relates mixed-methods findings from a Sydney case-study where opposition to planned affordable housing projects was widespread but uneven. Five factors are identified that escalated individual opposition campaigns in this case: public notification procedures; sense of injustice; prejudice; strong campaign leadership; and the involvement of politicians. We argue that these factors will likely also escalate opposition to the planned development of other forms of critical social infrastructure, and that an understanding of them can help minimise destructive conflicts between proponents and host communities.

AB  - Corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts targeting both internal stakeholders (i.e., employees) and external stakeholders (i.e., environment, community, consumers) can mitigate employees' negative attitudes and behavior. However, the effects of (in)congruence between internal CSR (ICSR) and external CSR (ECSR) perceptions have not yet been examined. We used social comparison theory to investigate the joint effects of ICSR and ECSR perceptions on organizational cynicism, by conducting a polynomial regression analysis of 342 employees with data from a two-wave survey. The results show that employees experienced higher cynicism when ICSR and ECSR perceptions were incongruent, with high ECSR-low ICSR causing greater cynicism. Thus, there was an inverted U-shaped relationship between congruent CSR perceptions and organizational cynicism. Our findings have implications for research and practice.

AB  - BackgroundMethodMany CAMHS teams across the United Kingdom are now required to use Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM). However, some clinicians hold negative attitudes towards ROM and various practical implementation issues have been identified.
   The aim of this study was to explore clinician experiences of using ROM in the context of an enforced' initial implementation initiative. Twenty clinicians were surveyed at the beginning (T1) and end (T2) of the six-month period in a large UK CAMHS network adopting CYP-IAPT practice. Changes in the use of and attitudes towards ROM were investigated, as well as barriers to implementation.
   ResultsConclusionsOverall, a small but significant increase in clinician use of ROM was observed from T1 to T2, but attitudes towards ROM did not change significantly. On the whole, clinicians were more positive than negative about ROM during the implementation period, but key implementation challenges included clinician concerns about the value and (mis)use of ROM data, poor technological support and additional workload demands.
   CAMHS clinicians will not necessarily become more receptive to ROM simply as a by-product of being asked to use it more. Seeking clinician feedback at the early stages of implementation can help provide a focus for improvement efforts. Ideas for future research and important limitations of the study are discussed.

AB  - Smartphone use has changed patterns of online and offline interaction. Phubbing (i.e., looking at one's phone instead of paying attention to others) is an increasingly recognized phenomenon in offline interaction. We examined whether people who phub are more likely to have lower social intelligence, whether phubbing is considered more annoying than being ignored due to reading a magazine, and if people describe smartphones and magazines differently as sources of social distraction. We collected two survey samples (N = 112, N = 108) for a cartoon-based role-playing experiment (the Bystander Inaccessibility Experiment) in which a smartphone user and a person reading a magazine ignored the respondents' conversational initiatives. Annoyance in each scenario was measured, and written accounts were collected on why the respondents rated the scenarios the way they did. Other measures used included the Generic Scale of Phubbing, Generic Scale of Being Phubbed, and Tromso Social Intelligence Scale. The results showed that participants in both samples were more annoyed by phubbing than by being ignored due to reading a magazine. Linear regression analyses showed that phubbing was associated with lower social intelligence, even after adjusting for confounding factors. The annoyingness of phubbing was explained with negative attitudes toward smartphones, which were assumed to be used for useless endeavors, while magazines were more appreciated and seen as more cultivating. The role of bystanders' epistemic access to the smartphone user's activities is discussed.

AB  - Although zoos envision themselves as environmental education institutions and governmental policies require that students become environmentally responsible citizens, it is surprising, that little research is done with regard to school field trips to the zoo. Many students are not aware that their everyday life affects marine environments that may enhance through spatially disconnection from marine ecosystems. A zoo field trip may overcome this disconnection. Considering knowledge as prerequisite for environmental attitudes and behavior, our study focused on cognitive learning of high school students at an instructional zoo field trip about marine ecology and conservation, by applying two cooperative learning settings. The study followed a quasi-experimental design, applying multiple-choice pre-post-retention tests. The results show satisfying short- and long-term knowledge achievement. Our cooperative learning settings seems to be a suitable approach for zoo field trips to facilitate a satisfying cognitive outcome concerning marine ecology and conservational issues.

AB  - Purpose Digital libraries and social media have emerged as two prominent online information sources with different characteristics. The purpose of this paper is to compare digital libraries and social media from the perspective of the dual route model which outlined a general framework of central and peripheral route-induced attitude change. Design/methodology/approach Research hypotheses were developed and data collected from users of digital libraries and social media were used for data analysis. The paired samples t-test was employed to compare the means. Findings Both central route (information quality) and peripheral route (source credibility and reputation) of digital libraries are higher than those of social media. Originality/value Building on the dual route model, this study compares digital libraries and social media in terms of the central route and peripheral route, which the authors believe presents a new lens for digital library research and practice alike.

AB  - BackgroundSince 2009 Time to Change has included among its strategies a social marketing campaign to tackle the stigma surrounding mental health problems. At the start of its third phase (2016-2021) the target group of the campaign was kept as people aged between mid-twenties and mid-forties but changed to middle-low income groups and the content was focused on men.MethodsParticipants (n=3700) were recruited through an online market research panel, before and after each burst of the campaign. They completed an online questionnaire evaluating knowledge (Mental Health Knowledge Schedule, MAKS); attitudes (Community Attitudes toward Mental Illness, CAMI); and desire for social distance (Intended Behaviour subscale of the Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale, RIBS). Socio-demographic data and awareness of the campaign were also collected.ResultsFor each of the 3 bursts, significant pre-post awareness differences were found (OR=2.83, CI=1.90-4.20, p<0.001; OR=1.72, CI=1.22-2.42, p=0.002; OR=1.41, CI=1.01-1.97, p=0.043),and awareness at the end of the third burst was 33%. Demographic factors associated with awareness for one or more bursts included having children, familiarity with mental illness, male sex, being Black, Asian or other ethnic minorities and living in London or the East Midlands regions. An improvement across bursts in the "living with" subscale item of the RIBS, and in the "recover" and "advice to a friend" MAKS items were found. Familiarity with mental illness had the strongest association with all outcome measures, while the awareness of the campaign was also related with higher scores in MAKS and RIBS.ConclusionsThese interim results suggest that the campaign is reaching and having an impact on its new target audience to a similar extent as did the TTC phase 1 campaign. While over the course of TTC we have found no evidence that demographic differences in stigma have widened, and indeed those by age group and region of England have narrowed, those for socioeconomic status, ethnicity and sex have so far remained unchanged. By targeting a lower socioeconomic group and creating relatively greater awareness among men and in Black and ethnic minority groups, the campaign is showing the potential to address these persistent differences in stigma.

AB  - The illegal use of prescription stimulants has become an established health risk among the college student population. To address this phenomenon, a student-driven campaign informed was developed, implemented, and evaluated on a college campus. The Rethink campaign involved traditional, print, and social media, as well as in-person events. To test the effectiveness of campaign messages, college students (N = 251) at an experimental site (n = 187) completed surveys before and after the campaign. Comparisons were made between pretest and posttest assessments, as well as to a control group (n = 64) of college students not exposed to the campaign. The Rethink campaign resulted in more negative attitudes toward prescription stimulant misuse, as well as decreased perceptions of descriptive norms. Practical implications for intervention designers and researchers are discussed in light of both the campaign's successes and failures.

AB  - The number of patients with organ failure who could potentially benefit from transplantation continues to exceed the available supply of organs. Despite numerous efforts to increase the number of donors, there remains an enormous mismatch between demand and supply. Large numbers of people still die with potentially transplantable organs remaining in situ, most frequently as a result of family objections. I argue that there are no persuasive moral arguments against mandated organ retrieval from all dead individuals who meet clinical criteria. However, because of continuing endemic prejudice in United States society and its healthcare system and the distrust this engenders, I conclude that proceeding with a policy of compulsory organ retrieval, even if morally unobjectionable, would not be warranted.

AB  - EXTENSIVE EVIDENCE OF ESSENTIALIST thinking in children emphasises cognitive processes with little attention paid to social contexts. The experimental study reported in this paper follows a recent trend in social psychology of integrating theories of essentialism and social categorisation by investigating four-year-olds' (n = 64) responses to novel social stimuli. Biological and environmental/social aspects of essentialism were both manipulated and measured to investigate how contextual changes interact with children's understanding. Consistent with our predictions, children demonstrated variability in essentialist thinking that was, somewhat surprisingly, stronger on the biological measures. Our results add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating the active role played by young children in interpreting their social world.

AB  - Background: Gender norms have been challenged by unmarried rural women's migration for employment to urban Sri Lankan Free Trade Zones (FTZ). Men are described as looking for sexual experiences among the women workers, who are then accused of engaging in premarital sex, something seen as taboo in this context. Increased sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) risks for women workers are reported. To improve SRHR it is important to understand the existing gender ideals that shape these behaviours. This qualitative study explores men's perspectives on gender relations in an urban Sri Lankan FTZ, with a focus on heterosexual relationships and premarital sex. Further, possible implications for SRHR of women workers in FTZs are discussed.
   Methods: Eighteen qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with men living or working in an urban Sri Lankan FTZ and were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Two conflicting constructions of masculinity; the 'disrespectful womaniser' and the 'respectful partner', were discerned. The 'disrespectful womaniser' was perceived to be predominant and was considered immoral while the 'respectful partner' was considered to be less prevalent, but was seen as morally upright. The migrant women workers' moral values upon arrival to the FTZ were perceived to deteriorate with time spent in the FTZ.
   Heterosexual relationships and premarital sex were seen as common, however, ideals of female respectability and secrecy around premarital sex were perceived to jeopardize contraceptive use and thus counteract SRHR.
   Conclusion: The 'disrespectful' masculinity revealed in the FTZ is reflective of the patriarchal Sri Lankan society that enables men's entitlement and sexual domination over women. Deterioration of men's economic power and increase of women's economic and social independence may also be important aspects contributing to men's antagonistic attitudes towards women. The promotion of negative attitudes towards women is normalized through masculine peer pressure. This and ambivalence towards women's premarital sex are undermining the SRHR and well-being of women, but also men, in the FTZ. Awareness and counteraction of destructive gender power relations are essential for the improvement of the SRHR of women and men in the FTZ and the surrounding society.

AB  - Objective: to examine the relationship between attitudes towards home birth and birth outcomes, and whether women's attitudes towards birth and intervention affected this relationship.
   Design: a prospective cohort study.
   Setting: the study was set in Iceland, a sparsely populated island with harsh terrain, 325,000 inhabitants, high fertility and home birth rates, and less than 5000 births a year.
   Participants: a convenience sample of women who attended antenatal care in Icelandic health care centres, participated in the Childbirth and Health Study in 2009-2011, and expressed consistent attitudes towards home birth (n=809).
   Findings: of the participants, 164 (20.3%) expressed positive attitudes towards choosing home birth and 645 (79.7%) expressed negative attitudes. Women who had a positive attitude towards home birth had significantly more positive attitudes towards birth and more negative attitudes towards intervention than did women who had a negative attitude towards home birth. Of the 340 self-reported low-risk women that answered questionnaires on birth outcomes, 78 (22.9%) had a positive attitude towards home birth and 262 (77.1%) had a negative attitude. Oxytocin augmentation (19.2% (n=15) versus 39.1% (n=100)), epidural analgesia (19.2% (n=15) versus 33.6% (n=88)), and neonatal intensive care unit admission rates (0.0% (n=0) versus 5.0% (n=13)) were significantly lower among women who had a positive attitude towards home birth. Women's attitudes towards birth and intervention affected the relationship between attitudes towards home birth and oxytocin augmentation or epidural analgesia.
   Key conclusions and implications for practice: the beneficial effect of planned home birth on maternal outcome in Iceland may depend to some extent on women's attitudes towards birth and intervention. Efforts to de-stigmatise out-of-hospital birth and de-medicalize women's attitudes towards birth might increase women's use of health-appropriate birth services. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Heterosexual marking occurs when people behave in ways that are interpreted by others as evidence of heterosexuality. In an exploratory comprehensive study of this phenomenon, we conducted 12 focus groups with 57 individuals: four groups composed of heterosexual women, four composed of heterosexual men, and four composed of mixed-gender sexual minorities. In this article, we present our findings on participant conceptions of heterosexual marking that are related to gender stereotypes, gender differences, and gender inequality. Much of the heterosexual marking described by our participants reflects and reinforces stereotypes that equate gender conformity and heterosexuality. Our data suggest that heterosexual marking by men/boys and women/girls differs in several ways, including gender conformity, sexual prejudice, extent of marking, and types of marking. Furthermore, some aspects and types of heterosexual marking described by our participants reflect and reinforce gender inequality. As a result, our discussion notes some problematic implications of the heterosexual marking we describe, including rendering gender non-conformity among heterosexuals invisible and unacceptable, supporting discrimination against gender non-conformity, and more directly reinforcing gender inequality.

AB  - Background Volunteer community health workers are increasingly being engaged in Nigeria, through the World Health Organization's task sharing strategy. This strategy aims to address gaps in human resources for health, including inequitable distribution of health workers. Recent conflicts in rural and fragile border communities in northcentral Nigeria create challenges for volunteer community health workers to meet their community's increasing health needs. This study aimed to explore the perception of volunteers involved in task sharing to understand factors affecting performance and delivery in such contexts. Methods This was a qualitative study conducted in fragile border communities in north central Nigeria. Eighteen audio recorded, semi-structured interviews with volunteers and supervisors were performed. Their perceptions on how task sharing and allocation of tasks affect performance and delivery were elucidated. The transactional social framework was applied during the thematic analysis process to generate an explanatory account of the research data, which was analysed using NVivo software. Results Promotive and preventive tasks were shared among the predominantly agrarian respondents. There was a structured task allocation process that linked the community with the health system and mainly cordial relationships were in place. However, there were barriers related to ethnoreligious crises and current conflict, timing of task allocations, gender inequities in volunteerism, shortage of commodities, inadequate incentives, dwindling community support and negative attitudes of some volunteers. Conclusion The perception of task sharing was mainly positive, despite the challenges, especially the current conflict. In this fragile context, reconsideration of non-seasonal task allocations within improved community-driven selection and security systems should be encouraged. Supportive supervision and providing adequate and timely renumeration will also be beneficial in this fragile setting.

AB  - People living with HIV/AIDS (PHAs) are increasingly recognized as experts in HIV and their own health. We developed a simulated clinical encounter (SCE) in which medical students provided HIV pre-and post-test counselling and point-of-care HIV testing for PHAs as patient instructors (PHA-PIs) under clinical preceptor supervision. The study assessed the acceptability of this teaching tool with a focus on assessing impact on HIV-related stigma among medical students. University of Toronto pre-clerkship medical students participated in a series of SCEs facilitated by 16 PHA-PIs and 22 clinical preceptors. Pre-and post-SCE students completed the validated Health Care Provider HIV/AIDS Stigma Scale (HPASS). HPASS measures overall stigma, as well as three domains within HIV stigma: stereotyping, discrimination, and prejudice. Higher scores represented higher levels of stigma. An additional questionnaire measured comfort in providing HIV-related care. Mean scores and results of paired t-tests are presented. Post-SCE, students (n = 62) demonstrated decreased overall stigma (68.74 vs. 61.81, p < .001) as well as decreased stigma within each domain. Post-SCE, students (n = 67) reported increased comfort in providing HIVrelated care (10.24 vs. 18.06, p < .001). Involving PHA-PIs reduced HIV-related stigma among medical students and increased comfort in providing HIV-related care.

AB  - The ancient mystery cults practiced by the Greeks and their neighbors were derived from the prehistoric use of caves as places to induce altered states of consciousness. The visions obtained in these rituals were expressed in both cave paintings and in the stories of the ancient playwrights. Ancient thought was shaped profoundly by the ecstatic experiences of Euripides and others, whose own experiences in visionary states were externalized in the form of their poetry and plays. Plato's allegory of the cave represents a rejection of the "irrational" Dionysian way of knowing, and thus a denial of a long-enduring source of human knowledge, and a preference for a "rational" Apollonian way of knowing. Our modern attitudes continue to reflect this Platonic prejudice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Women represent roughly 50% of US medical students and one third of US surgery residents. Within academic surgery departments, however, women are disproportionately underrepresented, particularly at senior levels. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that female surgeons perceive different barriers to academic careers relative to their male colleagues.
   METHODS: A modified version of the Career Barriers Inventory-Revised was administered to senior surgical residents and early-career surgical faculty members at 8 academic medical centers using an online survey tool. Likert-type scales were used to measure respondents' agreement with each survey item. Fisher's exact test was used to identify significant differences on the basis of gender.
   RESULTS: Respondents included 70 women (44 residents, 26 faculty members) and 84 men (41 residents, 43 faculty members). Women anticipated or perceived active discrimination in the form of being treated differently and experiencing negative comments about their sex, findings that differed notably from those for male counterparts. Sex-based negative attitudes inhibited the career aspirations of female surgeons. The presence of overt and implicit bias resulted in a sense that sex is a barrier to female surgeons' career development in academic surgery. No differences were observed between male and female respondents with regard to career preparation or structural barriers.
   CONCLUSIONS: Female academic surgeons experience challenges that are perceived to differ from their male counterparts. Women who participated in this study reported feeling excluded from the dominant culture in departments of surgery. This study may help guide transformative initiatives within academic surgery departments. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Common stereotypes of virtual game or community users are often portrayed as young and socially inept male addicts. Recent studies, however, defy many of the common prejudices about game or community users. As an extension of recent research, this study looks at gender differences in Virtual Worlds and finds that female users are actually a driving force behind the recent success of online communities. The study results indicate that female users more actively participate in social life, information seeking, and building activities in Virtual Worlds than their male counterparts. Similarly, female users have greater appreciation for the value of Virtual Worlds, although both male and female users recognize Virtual Worlds as a highly useful entertainment tool.

AB  - Although continuing to capture the attention of scholars, the study of "work-family backlash" remains plagued by a lack of conceptual clarity. As a result, there is growing evidence to suggest that there is a dark side to work-life balance (WLB) policies, but these findings remain scattered and unorganized. We provide a synthesis of this literature, defining work-family backlash as a phenomenon characterized by negative attitudes, negative emotions, and negative behaviors-either individual or collective-associated with WLB policies [i.e., on-site provisions, leave policies, and flexible work arrangements (FWAs)] within organizations. We conceptualize and define four primary mechanisms involving multiple levels of analysis through which the phenomenon operates. More micro levels of analysis within organizations are characterized by (1) an inequity mechanism, (2) a stigma mechanism, and (3) a spillover mechanism. Although less developed in the literature to date, more macro levels of analysis-including the organization and societal levels-are characterized by (4) a strategic mechanism. We explain these four primary mechanisms-including the theories and literatures on which they are grounded-and develop an original conceptual model to catalyze future research.

AB  - This article explores the experiences of young British people with African and Caribbean heritage during a volunteer tourism trip to Zimbabwe. It gives an ethnographic account of how racialized identifications and geographies surfaced - and were negotiated - through emotional encounters and embodied performances. Young volunteers contended with the racialized imaginaries of charity that painfully positioned their blackness as mis-fitting' in the performances of virtue central to volunteer tourism. However, they performed their blackness in ways that asserted value, variously invoking a proud authentic' bond with Africa' and forging connections around diasporic African cool. Volunteers' claims of authentic Africanness' often problematically homogenized Africa, but celebratory affects around transnational popular culture contained possibilities for disrupting denigrating hierarchies. This account illustrates the potential for youth studies to engage further with the more-than-representational' ways in which racialized difference comes into force, but that this approach can and should sharpen our analysis of enduring racialized prejudices.

AB  - Stigmatization restricts people's opportunities in life and has severe consequences on mental health and psychological well-being. This article focuses on stigmatization research on pedophilia. Based on an extensive literature search, it reviews studies that have empirically determined lay theories, stereotypes, prejudices, and discrimination against people with pedophilia, as well as the effect of stigma on this group. The review reveals a scarcity of empirical studies on the subject (11). Although the majority of studies give at least an indication that stigma against people with pedophilia is highly prevalent, we also identified severe methodological limitations and a lack of a unifying and systematic research agenda. We discuss the need for more theory-driven, rigorous, and representative empirical studies and propose perspectives and requirements for the scientific study of stigma against people with pedophilia.

AB  - Belief in conspiracy theories is associated with negative outcomes such as political disengagement, prejudice, and environmental inaction. The current studies - one cross-sectional (N = 253) and one experimental (N = 120) - tested the hypothesis that belief in conspiracy theories would increase intentions to engage in everyday crime. Study 1 demonstrated that belief in conspiracy theories predicted everyday crime behaviours when controlling for other known predictors of everyday crime (e.g., Honesty-Humility). Study 2 demonstrated that exposure to conspiracy theories (vs. control) increased intentions to engage in everyday crime in the future, through an increased feeling of anomie. The perception that others have conspired may therefore in some contexts lead to negative action rather than inaction.

KW  - NANOWIRE LASERS
AB  - We propose a theory for the waveguide design and analysis for plasmonic nanolasers by reformulating the fundamental waveguide requirements. This theory does not rely on further optimizing previously used structures, but examines each possible design without prejudice. Our exploration of one-dimensional (i.e., layered) plasmonic nanowaveguide geometries and the subsequent extension to 2D structures not only provides a deep understanding of the characteristics of currently used designs, but also leads to superior structures with the potential to address long-standing challenges in plasmonic nanolasers. In addition, we discover analogies between the reformulated fundamental requirements for the waveguide for nanolasers and nanoscale four-wave mixing (FWM) devices. Therefore, after a slight modification, our theory can also be applied to the waveguide design for plasmonic FWM devices.

AB  - There has been an increase in lesbian and gay-themed advertisements in mainstream media in South Africa. This suggests that brands are starting to acknowledge LGBTQ consumers as an important consumer market needing representation in advertisements. However, to date little empirical research has examined the response of heterosexual consumers to lesbian and gay-themed advertisements. Therefore, this study examined the impact of tolerance of homosexuality on attitudes towards lesbian and gay-themed advertisements and brands. The findings revealed that participants with a high tolerance towards homosexuality have more positive attitudes towards advertisements and brands. The attitudes towards the advertisements have a significant positive influence on the attitude towards the brand. In addition, the study revealed that heterosexual men exposed to lesbian and gay-themed advertisements tend to have negative attitudes towards advertisements compared to heterosexual women. Managerial implications are discussed.

AB  - In the present study, the authors examined cynicism, a trait associated with mistrust and a misanthropic world view, as an impediment to seeking needed mental health services among a group of National Guard Soldiers with diagnoses of anxiety, depression, or substance abuse or dependence after a combat deployment. On their return from deployment, 40 National Guard soldiers were assessed for self-stigma, current distress, attitudes toward mental health care, and psychiatric diagnoses. Eight and a half months later, mental health service utilization was evaluated. Cynicism assessed prior to deployment was associated with lower odds of utilizing mental health services independent of self-stigma and negative attitudes toward mental health care. Further, neither self-stigma nor attitudes toward mental health care predicted engaging in needed mental health care when cynicism was included in the model.

AB  - The importance of therapeutic alliance in predicting treatment outcomes is well established, but less is known about client characteristics that predict alliance. Clients with co-occurring psychosis and substance misuse (n = 116) who received integrated motivational interviewing and cognitive behavior therapy in the context of a large randomized controlled trial completed the Working Alliance Inventory. Their trial therapists also completed Working Alliance Inventories. Rating perspectives were compared, and in a cross-sectional study, client predictors of therapeutic alliance were examined. As hypothesized, clients' negative attitudes to treatment, including lack of insight, were predictive of poorer alliance. Therapist-rated alliance was also predicted by the client's attitude to medication, self-reported depression, and living situation. Symptom severity and substance use measures were unrelated to alliance. Consistent with previous studies, rating perspectives differed, with clients rating alliance more positive than therapists.

AB  - This study investigates consumers' attitudinal and behavioral outcomes after service failure encounters with companies with which they have previously established good relationships. It indicates that conformity with or violation of relationship norms guides consumers' decision making, and that their subsequent attitudinal and behavioral outcomes further depend on the severity of the service failure. Through a 2 (relationship norm types: exchange vs. communal) x 2 (service failure severity: minor vs. major) between-subjects experiment, the study shows that when the prior relationship norms are exchange-based, consumers demonstrate similar attitudes toward the minor and major failures. However, when these relationship norms are communally-based, consumers respond relatively positively in the minor failure situation, but they display more negative attitudes in the major failure situation. This study contributes to public relations literature regarding the role of company-consumer relationships in service failure situations.

AB  - An individual's decision to support conservation efforts can be affected by personal attitudes. We interviewed 100 indigenous livestock farmers on Ehirovipuka and Khoadi //Hoas communal conservancies in Namibia. As conservancy support groups work with farmers, there is a need to understand what influences farmer decisions to engage in ecotourism activities for livelihood. We evaluated cognitive characteristics of farmers and their attitudes toward 10 species of wildlife. Farmers had negative attitudes toward predators, more positive attitudes toward meat-producing species and a hornbill (Tockus sp.), and moderate attitudes toward African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and black rhino (Diceros bicornis), which can cause damage but also attract tourists. We show support for a partial mediation model in which cognitive characteristics of farmers predicted attitudes toward predators and damage animals. The attitudes toward these species, in turn, predicted participation in the ecotourism industry.

AB  - The sexuality of people with disabilities has historically been a site of oppression and discrimination. The sexuality of people with disabilities remains relatively under-researched and poorly understood. As a result, many myths and misconceptions about the sexuality of people with disabilities may prevail. This paper reports on findings from a qualitative study exploring the experiences of 13 people with physical disabilities in South Africa. A thematic analysis was conducted to explore how the sexuality of participants are constructed by others, as revealed by reported interactions with non-disabled people. Results show that often the sexuality of people with disabilities is erased by others, or they are questioned, often in prejudiced ways, and less frequently they are explored in intimate relationships.

AB  - ObjectiveThe Recovery Record smartphone app is a self-monitoring tool for individuals recovering from eating disorders. Oppositely to traditional pen-and-paper meal diaries, the app allows for in-app patient-clinician linkage enabling clinicians to access patient app data anytime. The aim of our study was to explore the interdisciplinary clinical perspective on Recovery Record and its impact on treatment.
   MethodThirty-one clinicians from a Danish eating disorder treatment facility participated in field studies and 23 of these in interviews. Data were generated and analyzed concurrently applying the inductive methodology of Interpretive Description.
   ResultsWe found two overarching themes: Access to app data between treatment sessions, and The patient-clinician relationship. Sub-themes associated with the former were Online obligations in relation to the added workload of continuously monitoring patient app data, and Prepared or prejudiced relating to advantages and disadvantages of using patient app data as preparation for treatment sessions. Sub-themes pertaining to the latter were Expectation discrepancy in relation to patients' and clinicians' divergent expectations for app usage, and Pacified patients regarding the clinicians' experience that the app potentially compromised the patient initiative in treatment sessions.
   DiscussionRecovery Record induced new and affected pre-existing treatment and work conditions for clinicians. Clinicians were preoccupied with challenges associated with the app, for example, an added work load and potential harm to the patient-clinician collaboration. Thus, prior to adopting the app, we encourage clinicians and managements to discuss the objectives, advantages and disadvantages of adopting the app, and outline specific guidelines for patient and clinician app usage.

AB  - Background Care assistant workers (CAWs) are a part of a new pattern of mental health care providers in China and play a significant role in bridging the human resource shortage. CAWs in China mainly include community cadres, community mental health staff, and community policemen. The mental health related knowledge and attitudes of CAWs could influence their mental health care delivery. This study aimed to assess mental health related knowledge and attitudes of CAWs in Guangzhou, China. Methods In November 2017, a study was conducted among 381 CAWs from four districts of Guangzhou, China. Participants were assessed using the Perceived Devaluation and Discrimination Scale (PDD), the Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS), and the Mental illness: Clinicians' Attitudes (MICA) Scale. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, ANOVA, Bonferroni corrections and multivariable linear regression. Results The mean scores (standard deviation) of PDD, MAKS and MICA were 36.45 (6.54), 22.72 (2.56), and 51.67 (7.88), respectively. Univariate analyses showed that the older CAWs, community policemen and those who were less willing to deliver care to people with mental illness had significant higher MICA scores when compared with other staff (P < 0.001). Multivariable linear regression showed that after controlling for key variables, care willingness and PDD total score were positively associated with the MICA total score (all P < 0.05), while attitudes on additional items were significant negatively with the MICA total score (all P < 0.01). Conclusion These findings suggest negative attitudes towards people with mental disorders among CAWs are common, especially among older staff. Community policemen suggest that they applied stereotypes of "violent mentally ill" people to all people they deal with who have mental disorders. The results also indicate human rights are being paid some attention to now, but need to be further continually improved in the future. Strategies for improving such negative attitudes and reducing the perceived stigma and discrimination should be carried out towards particular staff groups in an anti-stigma programme in Guangzhou, China.

AB  - Most bias crime literature focuses on adults despite the fact that youth account for a large proportion of prejudice-motivated violence. The LA County Commission on Human Relations data for all bias crimes from 2002-2008 was used to examine similarities and differences between adult and youth suspects of bias-motivated crimes. Findings showed youth victims of racial bias crimes were 12 times more likely to be targeted by youth suspects and over five times more likely to commit property offenses. Public places were nearly three times more likely than resident places to be the location of the bias crime by youth suspects. Female perpetrators of racial bias crimes were two times more likely to be youths. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Background: Breast cancer and cervical cancer are the two leading cancers among women in Ethiopia. This study investigated knowledge and attitudes related to these two types of cancer among women in 4 zones of Ethiopia. This is the first study employing a validated questionnaire to investigate knowledge and attitudes relating to breast and cervical cancer in Ethiopia.
   Methods: A community based cross-sectional study was conducted from September to November 2015 in the North Shewa zone (Amhara region), Gamo Gofa zone (Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' region) and zones 1 and 3 (Afar region) of Ethiopia. A total of 799 women aged 18 years and older participated in the survey. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the association of possible predictors with breast and cervical cancer knowledge.
   Results: A total of 799 women aged 18 years and older participated in the survey. Of the women interviewed, 63.0% had heard of breast cancer and 42.2% had heard of cervical cancer. Among those who had heard of breast cancer, 21.3% (107/503) had heard of breast cancer screening and 1.4% of women aged 40 years and older had undergone at least one breast screening examination. Fewer than half of the participants provided the correct response to questions related to risk factors for breast and cervical cancer. Among those who had heard of cervical cancer, 41.5% (140/337) had heard of cervical cancer screening and 3.3% had undergone at least one cervical cancer screening examination. Women with primary and higher levels of education were more likely to have heard of breast cancers (OR = 3.0; 95% CI: 2.1-4.2; p < 0.001) and cervical cancer (OR = 1.9; 95% CI: 1.4-2.6; p < 0.001). From the overall attitude score, the majority of the women were found to have negative attitudes towards breast cancer (67.4%) and cervical cancer (70.6%).
   Conclusions: This study found that the overall knowledge of risk factors for breast cancer and cervical cancer among women was low. Lack of cancer awareness, and lack of education in general, are the most potent barriers to access and care, and should be addressed through multi-faceted strategies including peer-education, mass media and other community-based interventions.

AB  - Intractable conflicts pose a great challenge to both humanity and science. The crucial role played by intergroup emotions in conflict dynamics has long been asserted in the field of conflict resolution. Therefore, regulating emotions in order to change attitudes and behaviour towards promoting peace is vital. One way to transform emotions is to use established emotion regulation strategies to change intergroup emotional experiences, and subsequently political positions. However, the use of direct emotion regulation may pose challenges in its application outside the laboratory, and especially among those who lack the motivation to regulate their emotions. Thus we describe recent research in which Indirect Emotion Regulation is used to overcome those very limitations. Here concrete cognitive appraisals are indirectly altered, leading to attitude change by transforming discrete emotions. Discoveries have both theoretical and practical implications regarding emotion regulation in intractable conflicts, thus promoting attitudes so critical for peace making.

AB  - During these times of escalating tensions between the police and the communities they serve, the news and social media have been full of images of police officers wearing military gear, armed with military weapons, and driving military vehicles. This study surveyed a sample of undergraduate college students taking criminal justice classes at a Midwestern university and examined whether the blurred lines between police officers and soldiers have caused the public to perceive police officers who work in urban areas as being equivalent to soldiers in war zones. The findings indicate that holding a conservative crime ideology and having negative attitudes towards people who live in poor, high crime neighborhoods ('the policed') are strong predictors of a belief in police-military equivalency. Discussions for future research and tests of this theory are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: The lack of adequate knowledge poses a barrier in the provision of appropriate treatment and care of patients with epilepsy within the community. The purpose of this study was to determine the knowledge of and attitude towards epilepsy and its treatment by community dwellers in Uganda.
   Methods: A cross sectional population survey was conducted in urban and rural Mukono district, central Uganda. Adult respondents through multistage stratified sampling were interviewed about selected aspects of epilepsy knowledge, attitudes, and perception using a pretested structured questionnaire.
   Results: Ninety-one percent of the study respondents had heard or read about epilepsy or knew someone who had epilepsy and had seen someone having a seizure. Thirty-seven percent of the respondents did not know the cause of epilepsy, while 29% cited genetic causes. About seventeen percent of the subjects believed that epilepsy is contagious. Only 5.6% (21/377) of the respondents would take a patient with epilepsy to hospital for treatment.
   Conclusion: Adults in Mukono are very acquainted with epilepsy but have many erroneous beliefs about the condition. Negative attitudes are pervasive within communities in Uganda. The national epilepsy awareness programs need to clarify the purported modes of transmission of epilepsy, available treatment options, and care offered during epileptic seizures during community sensitizations in our settings.

AB  - In Europe, legislation exists to ensure that infrastructure facilities and services are accessible to all. This may not work perfectly, but there is no longer a need to debate the principle of access for all. In low-income countries it is a different story. Improving accessibility to water and sanitation is technically straightforward and low cost. Greater challenges are posed by institutional and social barriers. However, evidence shows that increased advocacy and information, together with training of engineers about inclusive design, can reduce prejudice and increase understanding of different needs and solutions. Drawing on examples from Africa and Asia, this paper describes water and sanitation in low-income countries, explaining the barriers that prevent access for vulnerable users and gives an overview of inclusive design for latrines and water points.

AB  - Europe is facing a new challenge - namely that of migration, and the negative attitudes stemming from the constant inflow of immigrants. Although France has historic experience with social inclusion and immigration issues, even there, the 2014 regional elections indicated mistrust towards immigrants. Present paper endeavors to analyze the phenomenon from economic, social, political and cultural perspectives based on the data provided by the European Social Survey focusing on the case of France. Research results indicated that trust is an important factor when it comes to attitudes towards immigrants. On the one hand, those, who have lower level of trust in national institutions, such as the police are more afraid of immigrants and of the threats they might pose. On the other hand, mistrust rooted in dissimilarity - like difference in religions - is also significant based on the data displayed in the article.

AB  - Rodriguez Maeso and Araujo analyse the reproduction of a dominant understanding of racism in policy discourses of integration and discrimination used by monitoring agencies in Portuguese and European Union (EU) institutional contexts. More specifically, they question the political concern over racism and discrimination vis-a-vis the idea of Europe becoming increasingly diverse' and the need to gather evidence' of discrimination. To that end, they examine periodic reports issued by EU monitoring agencies since the 1990spaying specific attention to reporting on school segregation of Roma pupils in Portugaland national integration policies and initiatives that, since the 2000s, have targeted mainly Roma and black families and youth. They argue that the dominant discourse of integration and cultural diversity conceives of racism as external to European political culture, and as a factor' of the conflictive nature' of social interactions in ethnoracially heterogeneous settings. This paves the way for calls for the strengthening of social cohesion'on the assumption that policy initiatives need to act on the characteristics' of so-called vulnerable' populationswhereas institutional arrangements and everyday practices remain unchallenged.

TI  - Represented by a Racist: Why Courts Rarely Grant Relief to Clients of Racist Lawyers
T2  - CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - Courts usually don't grant habeas claims for criminal defendants who allege that their lawyer's racism prejudiced their defense unless the racial animus is obvious on the cold trial record. In Ellis v. Harrison, the Ninth Circuit had the opportunity to relax this standard and grant habeas relief to a client of a known racist lawyer, Donald Ames, even though evidence of Ames's racism was not apparent on the trial record. While the court did grant habeas relief, it did so without much precedential effect, leaving the remaining clients of Donald Ames and other racist lawyers, whose animus remains unknown to the court, without a remedy. While ten of the eleven en banc judges in Ellis voted to grant habeas relief, only four joined a concurrence that would have created a per se rule of prejudice when a lawyer is found to harbor extreme racial animus towards their client's racial group despite both the State and the defendant's arguments in favor of the per se rule. Why?
   I argue that, contrary to popular theories of judicial decision-making, courts facing hard cases where equitable and doctrinal factors weigh in opposite directions turn to procedural mechanisms to arrive at equitable outcomes that do not create binding doctrinal precedent. Rather than reaching the merits of the claim, the Ellis en banc court granted habeas because the State and the defendant agreed that habeas should be granted. Despite granting habeas, the court has created conflicting criteria for granting future relief that at once depend on the State's agreement with, and opposition to, granting habeas, effectively blocking many future claims. In light of the procedural precedent that Ellis created for granting habeas where the State and the defendant agree, I argue that attorneys general in the Ninth Circuit should proactively review other cases involving racist lawyers and support habeas relief where the judiciary has thus far refused to do so.

AB  - The profession of social work advocates for civil rights for gay men, lesbians, and bisexual persons. However, a number of social work students and practitioners harbor antigay bias that in prior variable-centered research has been determined to be related to race, relationship status, and age. The purpose of this research was to use latent class analysis (LCA), a person-centered statistical technique, to cluster 394 university student survey responses to the Attitudes Toward Lesbian and Gays short-form instrument. The analyses indicated three groups that can be profiled as unbiased, moderately biased, and highly biased. Analysis of variance and multinomial regression verified LCA findings that are consistent with prior research. The importance of selecting appropriate educational approaches to address antigay bias among social work students and practicing social workers is discussed, and recommendations for continued research, including a national random survey of social work students and licensed social workers, are made.

AB  - Background: Buprenorphine is under-utilized in treating opioid addiction. Payers and providers both have substantial influence over the adoption and use of this medication to enhance recovery. Their views could provide insights into the barriers and facilitators in buprenorphine adoption.
   Methods: We conducted individual interviews with 18 Ohio county Alcohol, Drug Addiction, and Mental Health Services (ADAMHS) Boards (payers) and 36 addiction treatment centers (providers) to examine barriers and facilitators to buprenorphine use. Transcripts were reviewed, coded, and qualitatively analyzed. First, we examined reasons that county boards supported buprenorphine use. A second analysis compared county boards and addiction treatment providers on perceived barriers and facilitators to buprenorphine use. The final analysis compared county boards with low and high use of buprenorphine to determine how facilitators and barriers differed between those settings.
   Results: County boards (payers) promoted buprenorphine use to improve clinical care, reduce opioid overdose deaths, and prepare providers for participation in integrated models of health care delivery with primary care clinics and hospitals. Providers and payers shared many of the same perceptions of facilitators and barriers to buprenorphine use. Common facilitators identified were knowledge of buprenorphine benefits, funds allocated to purchase buprenorphine, and support from the criminal justice system. Common barriers were negative attitudes toward use of agonist pharmacotherapy, payment environment, and physician prescribing capacity. County boards with low buprenorphine use rates cited negative attitudes toward use of agonist medication as a primary barrier. County boards with high rates of buprenorphine use dedicated funds to purchase buprenorphine in spite of concerns about limited physician prescribing capacity.
   Conclusions: This qualitative analysis found that attitudes toward use of medication and medication funding environment play important roles in an organization's decision to begin buprenorphine use and that physician availability influences an organization's ability to expand buprenorphine use over time. Additional education, reimbursement support, and policy changes are needed to support buprenorphine adoption and use, along with a greater understanding of the roles payers, providers, and regulators play in the adoption of targeted practices.

AB  - This article analyzes understandings of indigeneity and legal consciousness in Brazil in the 16th, early 20th and 21st centuries. The article focuses on the often ignored work of Joao Mendes Junior, written in 1912, about the indigenous peoples of Sao Paulo and on Gabriel Soares de Sousa's Tratado descritivo do Brasil em 1587 [A Descriptive Treatise of Brazil in 1587]. Mendes' ideas about race, biology and indigeneity diverge considerably from hegemonic Western theories of racial purity and Social Darwinism, but his contribution has never really been acknowledged. This article argues that theories that better fit the organizing model of the free market have become more hegemonic and widespread. For this reason, social scientists should strive to bring into discussion epistemological alternatives to the hegemonic principles of capitalism, which foster exploitation, destitution and the privatization of public space.

AB  - Once again, the U.S. Supreme Court will determine the constitutionality of affirmative action. Once again, the focus will be on the diversity rationale for the policy. And, once again, the discussion will likely center on whether the admissions regime of a particular school (this time, the University of Texas) can take steps to ensure that it admits a certain number-or to put the point more doctrinally, a critical mass-of students from a particular racial group, such as African Americans. Framing diversity in terms of group representation assumes that when admissions officials administer affirmative action programs, their racial decisionmaking stops at the level of the racial group. Under this view, admissions officials are simply interested in whether they have a critical mass of African Americans as a group. The racial interests of these officials, however, might be narrower than that. Especially at elite colleges and universities, admissions officials are also likely employing an intraracial diversity frame. Here, the concern is not simply whether there is a critical mass of African Americans as a group. The concern is also whether the school has admitted particular "types" of African Americans. For example, a school might screen its application pool for African Americans who are likely to promote racial cooperation and understanding. Alternatively, the school might be interested in African Americans who can facilitate the robust exchange of ideas. The point is that admissions officials can realize their commitment to diversity by choosing African Americans at least in part based on their perceived racial "types" and not simply based on their racial group membership. This Article demonstrates precisely how they can do so, describes the incentive system this creates for applicants to work their identity in the application process to signal that they are the right racial "types," and explains how the phenomenon of intraracial diversity is implicated in the Fisher v. University of Texas litigation.

AB  - The aim of this cross-sectional survey was to assess awareness, knowledge, and attitudes in regard to human papillomavirus (HPV) and vaccination against HPV among college students. From 2015 to 2017, 386 diverse undergraduates were recruited from a south Florida university. A survey, part of which was researcher developed, of HPV awareness, knowledge, and attitudes was conducted. The majority (84%) of participants had heard of HPV, and 70% had favorable attitudes toward vaccination. Only 28% of men and 55% of women had received >= 1 dose vaccine (p = .01), and 4% of all participants reported that they had received 3 doses. Those with >= 1 dose (n = 123, 40.1%) were more knowledgeable about HPV (p = .01). High knowledge scores were recorded for 30% of respondents and were strongly associated with HPV vaccine initiation among both men and women (p < .001) and perceived knowledge among women only (p < .001). Negative attitudes toward HPV vaccine acceptance were associated with low knowledge scores (p = .01) and undervaccination (p < .001). Vaccinated women (n = 95) were over seven times more likely than were unvaccinated women (n = 115) to report positive vaccine attitudes (relative risk = 7.1). HPV vaccination status was not associated with vaccine attitudes among men. HPV knowledge and vaccine uptake remain problematic among college students, and deficits in both are associated with negative HPV vaccine attitudes. Although the knowledge gap is narrowing, HPV vaccination efforts should target young men, as HPV-related cancer morbidity continues to rise in men.

AB  - Roderigo Lopez, former Physician-in-Chief to Queen Elizabeth I of England, was a controversial figure in his time and continues to be the subject of controversy. Much has been written about his religious practice, politics, and guilt, or lack thereof, with regard to charges of treason to the Crown. However, the fact remains that Lopez was the only physician to the Crown to be sentenced to death. All evidence points to an anti-Semitic mindset that played in the background. Yet Lopez so endeared himself to the Queen that although he was indeed sentenced to death, almost all of his property was restored to his family. This brief paper pays tribute to the Jewish physician, Roderigo Lopez, whose story was indeed a triumph over prejudice, despite his fate.

AB  - The entanglement of border control technologies and immigration policies and practices with discourses of race, national identity and belonging has long been a focus of scholarly interest. In this paper we discuss the Human Provenance Pilot Project (HPPP), the aim of which was to evaluate the utility of genetic and isotope testing to corroborate asylum seekers' accounts of their nationality. We subject the HPPP to a detailed socio-technical analysis, highlighting how technologies, practices and modes of thought travelled from the policing context to the asylum context, illuminating the unspoken prejudices that made that transfer possible, and reflecting on implications of the HPPP for academic research, policy advice and the asylum system.

AB  - Depression in pregnancy or antenatal depression (AD) occurs in approximately one in five women, with potentially deleterious effects to the mother and fetus. People are encouraged to get treatment for depression; however, pregnant women can experience stigma when they reach out for help with depression. Research indicates that healthcare professionals hold stigma against patients who experience mental health conditions, including depression. The public, as well as healthcare professionals may have negative attitudes towards antidepressant use during pregnancy, despite evidence that many antidepressants are relatively safe for use in pregnancy. The objective of this project was to determine what knowledge and opinions healthcare students may hold towards antenatal depression and its treatment, and whether further knowledge and experience lessened the stigma. Medical, pharmacy, and nursing students (n = 309) were given a scenario regarding a woman with AD based on Corrigan's Attribution Questionnaire and asked seven questions based on the scenario that assessed their level of stigma and questions related to treatment. Each student group demonstrated some stigma towards the woman and all groups lacked knowledge regarding treatment of AD. Overall, the nursing students were the most stigmatizing of the three groups. The study demonstrates that healthcare students hold stigma towards people with mental health problems, including pregnant depressed women. It points to a need to increase education about antenatal depression and its treatment.

AB  - Attitudes can be predictors of certain health-related behaviours. The attitudes of young females towards health and taste have not been yet fully examined and their associations with dietary behaviours remain unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate if attitudes are associated with dietary patterns in a representative sample of Polish girls. The study population consisted of 1107 girls, aged 13-21 and living in Poland. Attitudes were assessed using the Health and Taste Attitudes Scale (HTAS) and categorised as negative, neutral or positive. Dietary data was obtained using a Food Frequency Questionnaire. Dietary patterns (DPs), derived previously with a Principal Component Analysis (PCA), were 'Traditional Polish', Fruit and vegetables', 'Fast food and sweets' and 'Dairy and fats'. The associations between attitudes and DPs were assessed using Spearman's correlation coefficients and logistic regression. The reference group were girls with neutral attitudes. Odds ratios (ORs) were adjusted for age, socioeconomic status (SES), and body mass index (BMI). The correlations between attitudes and DPs ranged from -0.28 for attitudes towards health and 'Fast food and sweets' and 'Traditional Polish' DPs to 0.33 for attitudes towards health and the Fruit and vegetables' DP (p < 0.05). In the logistic regression analysis, the strongest associations within health-related HTAS subscales were observed between negative attitudes towards natural products and the 'Fast food and sweets' DP (OR: 10.93; 95% CI: 3.32-36.01) and between positive attitudes towards health and the 'Fruit and vegetables' DP (OR: 5.10; 3.11-8.37). The strongest associations within taste-related HTAS subscales were observed between positive attitudes towards craving for sweet foods and the 'Traditional Polish' DP (OR: 1.93; 1.43-2.61) and between positive attitudes towards using food as a reward and the 'Dairy and fats' DP (OR: 2.08; 1.22-3.55) as well as the 'Fast food and sweets' DP (OR: 2.07; 1.14-3.74). Positive attitudes towards health were associated with a pro-healthy dietary pattern characterised by the consumption of fruit and vegetables, while negative attitudes towards natural products as well as a strong craving for sweets and using food as a reward were associated with less healthy dietary patterns. To improve the dietary habits of girls and young women, positive attitudes towards health should be strengthened and supported by emphasizing the sensory values of pro-healthy foods.

AB  - In spite of recent calls for patient-centered care and greater attention to the needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) patients, nurses still lack basic education about LGBT patient care and, as a result, may have negative attitudes, endorse stereotypes, and/or feel uncomfortable providing care. This study reports on education/training of practicing nurses and explores some of the reasons for nurses reporting feelings of discomfort with LGBT patient care. Transcripts from structured interviews with 268 nurses in the San Francisco Bay Area revealed that 80% had no education or training on LGBT issues. Although most said they were comfortable with LGBT patient care, some of their comments indicated that they might not be providing culturally sensitive care. Implications for nursing education and for policies and procedures of health care institutions are addressed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Implicit bias against the Romas in Hungarian healthcare: taboos or unrevealed areas for health promotion?
T2  - HEALTH PROMOTION INTERNATIONAL

KW  - implicit bias
KW  - Roma ethnic minority
KW  - healthcare professionals
AB  - The Roma or Gipsy population is the largest ethnic minority both in Europe and Hungary with a 10-15years lower life expectancy and significantly worse health indicators than majority populations. The purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate a sensitive and controversial topic: the perspectives of healthcare staff about the presence and impacts of implicit bias in the Hungarian healthcare system towards Roma patients. Therefore, between June 2017 and May 2018 semi-structured interviews were conducted involving 13 healthcare professionals. Interview transcripts were coded and thematically analysed. The presence and occasional manifestation of prejudices against the Romas were noted by the interviewees, most commonly in the form of longer waiting time, comments or other meta-communicative tools. Study participants appeared to exclude a direct relationship between health providers' implicit bias and the lower quality of health services or the worse health status of Roma patients. However, as reported, indirect negative effects may occur in cases where a patient refrains from seeking care due to previous perceived or experienced discrimination. As barriers to effective patient-provider communication and cooperation, differences in culture, health-seeking behaviour and gaps between health literacy levels were emphasized. In terms of prevention, enhancing anti-discriminatory attitudes from early childhood within the families, the role of media in conveying unbiased information, increasing health awareness of the Roma people as well as educating healthcare providers on culture-related issues may be beneficial. Stress and burnout of healthcare professionals also need to be addressed as these may impact on the enactment of unconscious biases.

AB  - Contemporary conceptions of written organizational rules evoke images of inefficiency, constraint, and rigidity. While formal rules can generate negative outcomes, this article argues that their written nature is not the culprit. Rather, theory suggests that the formalization process increases a rule's likelihood of becoming effective "green tape." From a rule design perspective, rule formalization is expected to trigger more organizational learning and greater scrutiny than unwritten rules, which undergo no such process. From a compliance perspective, written rules are expected to focus organizational attention and convey legitimacy better than unwritten rules, thereby increasing the likelihood of compliance. Combining these expectations, the article hypothesizes that written rules will exhibit more logical designs, higher compliance, and ultimately greater effectiveness than unwritten rules. Statistical modeling of two data sources supports these expectations and suggests the need to rethink reflexively negative attitudes toward written organizational rules.

AB  - ObjectiveTo determine whether physician's attitudes toward patients with comorbid mental illness affect management of a chronic disease.
   Data SourceA total of 256 primary care physicians interviewed in 2010.
   Study DesignThis randomized factorial experiment entailed physicians observing video vignettes of patient-actors with poorly controlled diabetes. Patients were balanced across age, gender, race, and comorbidity (schizophrenia with bizarre or normal affect, depression, eczema).
   Data CollectionPhysicians completed structured and semistructured interviews plus chart notes about clinical management and attitudes.
   Principal FindingsPhysicians reported more negative attitudes for patients with schizophrenia with bizarre affect (SBA). There were few differences in clinical decisions measured quantitatively or in charting, but qualitative data revealed less trust of patients with SBA as reporters, with more reliance on sources other than engaging the patient in care. Physicians often alerted colleagues about SBA, thereby shaping expectations before interactions occurred.
   ConclusionsResults are consistent with common stereotypes about people with serious mental illness. Vignettes did not include intentional indication of unreliable reporting or danger. Reducing health care disparities requires attention to subtle aspects of managing patientsparticularly those with atypical affectas seemingly slight differences could engender disparate patient experiences over time.

TI  - Contextualizing Migrants' Strategies of Seeking Medical Care in Russia*
T2  - INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION
LA  - English
AB  - Russia is an important destination for labour migrants from the former Soviet Union republics especially Central Asian low-income countries: Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The life of migrants from Central Asia is characterized in Russia by scarce resources and social exclusion. Limited access to healthcare is aggravated by the negative attitudes and discrimination that migrants face when visiting state hospitals and clinics. In our study, we aim to describe the medical infrastructure available to migrants in Moscow. We investigate how migrants use formal and informal strategies to overcome the barriers to their receiving medical care in the urban environment. The study is based on the analysis of qualitative interviews with 60 labour migrants from Central Asian countries and 23 caregivers working in Moscow-based medical facilities such as state hospitals, outpatient clinics, ambulance stations, and private medical centres including the so-called Kyrgyz clinics.

KW  - IMPACT
AB  - Media bias has a substantial impact on individual and collective perception of news. Effective communication that may counteract its potential negative effects still needs to be developed. In this article, we analyze how to facilitate the detection of media bias with visual and textual aids in the form of (a) a forewarning message, (b) text annotations, and (c) political classifiers. In an online experiment, we randomized 985 participants to receive a biased liberal or conservative news article in any combination of the three aids. Meanwhile, their subjective perception of media bias in this article, attitude change, and political ideology were assessed. Both the forewarning message and the annotations increased media bias awareness, whereas the political classification showed no effect. Incongruence between an articles' political position and individual political orientation also increased media bias awareness. Visual aids did not mitigate this effect. Likewise, attitudes remained unaltered.

AB  - Social biases among healthcare providers could limit PrEP access. In this survey study of 115 US medical students, we examined associations between biases (racism and heterosexism) and PrEP clinical decision-making and explored prior PrEP education as a potential buffer. After viewing a vignette about a PrEP-seeking MSM patient, participants reported anticipated patient behavior (condomless sex, extra-relational sex, and adherence), intention to prescribe PrEP to the patient, biases, and background characteristics. Minimal evidence for racism affecting clinical decision-making emerged. In unadjusted analyses, heterosexism indirectly affected prescribing intention via all anticipated behaviors, tested as parallel mediators. Participants expressing greater heterosexism more strongly anticipated increased risk behavior and adherence problems, which were associated with lower prescribing intention. The indirect effect via condomless sex remained significant adjusting for background characteristics. Prior PrEP education did not buffer any indirect effects. Heterosexism may compromise PrEP provision to MSM and should be addressed in PrEP-related medical education.

AB  - This study examines the relation of dimensions of ethnocentrism with socio-structural factors such as socioeconomic status (SES), feelings of anomie, and authoritarianism. Using clustered sampling, 500 students were selected from ten high schools in Ahvaz, Iran. Results of structural equation modeling showed that SES has a direct positive effect on ethnocentrism and an indirect effect through anomie and authoritarianism. Similarly, anomie mediates the effect of SES on authoritarianism. Anomie was found to have an indirect effect on dimensions of ethnocentrism via authoritarianism. Findings confirmed the proposed conceptual path model, which is consistent with findings from other countries. The influence of feelings of anomie in the model is highlighted since it has a very important effect on dimensions of ethnocentrism.

TI  - 'Through my eyes': feminist self-portraits of Osteogenesis Imperfecta as arts-based knowledge translation
T2  - VISUAL STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - In this paper, we present an exploration of arts-based knowledge translation through photography highlighting the lived experience of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI), a genetic disorder. It forms part of our larger photovoice research project that involved six female photographers with physical impairment. This group of women shared their personal experiences through photographic stories to challenge pervasive, limiting negative attitudes and assumptions that surround disability. In this paper, we focus on the data, analysis and discussion to one type of impairment, OI, and two photographers' work to present their:
   embodied expertise and knowledge of living with OI;
   self-portraits as contemporary disability identity, contributing to intersectionality in feminist and disability arenas;
   authentic voice as co-authors of this paper using Drew and Guillemin's interpretive engagement framework;
   original arts-based research insights currently absent in the meagre qualitative research on OI.
   By presenting, analysing and interpreting self-portraits of OI as valuable arts-based knowledge, we hope to provide readers with a better understanding of disability and femininity as a pathway to greater inclusion.

AB  - This article investigates the presence and effects of racial microaggressions in English first-class cricket. Drawing on interview data with British Asian players, it not only highlights players' experiences of racism, but also identifies their tendency to downplay the repercussions of some of the forms that this prejudice takes. The analysis demonstrates that color-blind ideology is so entrenched in contemporary Western sport that its reproduction is not exclusively the preserve of white groups; it can also at times compel minority ethnic participants to endorse dominant claims that the effects of racism are overstated as well. As a consequence they are often pressured into denying or downplaying those forms of verbal discrimination which are articulated between team-mates and in a seemingly playful manner, dismissing incidents as merely "banter" or "jokes".

AB  - Purpose: This study's purpose was to determine the attitudes of students studying in various fields related to health services towards gender roles and intimate partner violence.
   Design and Methods: The descriptive study sample was composed of 441 volunteer students. The data were collected by the Intimate Partner Violence Attitude Scale-Revised (IPVAS-R) and Gender Roles Attitude Scale (GRAS).
   Findings: The GRAS and IPVAS-R mean scores were 114.10 (18.00) and 57.77 (4.45), respectively. A statistically significant negative relationship was found between the IPVAS-R and GRAS total mean score.
   Practice Implications: The participants with negative attitudes allowing the violence also had more traditional attitudes towards gender roles. It is important to train health professionals with attitudes that believe in gender equality and reject violence to improve the quality of health services.

AB  - In three phases, this study identifies and evaluates the major messages being used in communication campaigns focused on the ongoing drought in California. A literature review in Phase 1 resulted in a typology of 12 message strategies. Following this typology, trained coders in Phase 2 evaluated water conservation messages (N=100) to determine whether each message utilized one or multiple strategies. The results revealed various frequencies of strategy application; and a correlational analysis rendered a pattern of strategy use in combinations. Phase 3 focused on a controlled message experiment applying the three most relevant strategies: conservation tips, loss aversion, and evidence of drought. Analysing data sampled from California residents (N=180), conservation messages, regardless of the strategy, led to attitude change in a negative direction. Additional analyses revealed interesting patterns of combinatorial strategy effects. The results call for a re-examination of message strategies as they may lead to several unfavourable outcomes.

AB  - The Cultural Cognition Project (CCP) at Yale Law School and the Project on Law and Mind Sciences (PLMS) at Harvard Law School draw on similar research and share a similar goal of uncovering the dynamics that shape risk perceptions, policy beliefs, and attributions underlying our laws and legal theories. Nonetheless, the projects have failed to engage one another in a substantial way. This Article attempts to bridge that gap by demonstrating how the approach taken by PLMS scholars can crucially enrich CCP scholarship. As a demonstration, this Article engages the case of Scott v. Harris, 550 US. 372 (2007), the subject of a recent CCP study.
   In Scott, the Supreme Court relied on a videotape of a high-speed police chase to conclude that an officer did not commit a Fourth Amendment violation when he purposefully caused the suspect's car to crash by ramming the vehicle's back bumper. Challenging the Court's conclusion that "no reasonable juror" could see the motorist's evasion of the police as anything but extremely dangerous, CCP Professors Dan M Kahan, David A. Hoffman, and Donald Braman showed the video to 1350 people and discovered clear rifts in perception based on ideological, cultural, and other lines.
   Despite the valuable contribution of their research in uncovering the influence of identity-defining characteristics and commitments on perceptions, Kahan, Hoffman, and Braman failed to engage what may well be a more critical dynamic shaping the cognitions of their subjects and the members of the Supreme Court in Scott: the role of situational frames in guiding attributions of causation, responsibility, and blame. As social psychologists have documented and as PLMS scholars have emphasized-while identities, experiences, and values matter, their operation and impact is not stable across cognitive tasks, but rather is contingent on the way in which information is presented and the broader context in which it is processed.
   In large part, the Scott video is treated-both by the Supreme Court and by Kahan, Hoffman, and Braman-as if it presents a neutral, unfiltered account of events. However, it does not. Studies of viewpoint bias suggest that the fact that the video offers the visual and aural perspective of a police officer participating in the chase-rather than that of the suspect or a neutral third party-likely had a significant effect on both the experimental population and members of the Court.
   Had the Supreme Court watched a different video of the exact same events taken from inside the suspect's car, this case may never have been taken away from the jury. Any discussion of judicial "legitimacy"-in both the descriptive and normative sense-must start here. The real danger for our justice system may not ultimately be the "visible fiction" of a suspect's version of events, as Justice Scalia would have it, or cognitive illiberalism as Kahan, Hoffman, and Braman would, but the invisible influence of situational frames systematically prejudicing those who come before our courts.

AB  - 5.8 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, and this number is rising. Social work can play a key role. Yet, the field is ill prepared for the growing number of individuals and families affected physically, emotionally, and financially. This mixed-methods concurrent study assessed the preliminary efficacy of an education event for students from eight social work programs. Pre- to post training survey included: (a) dementia knowledge, and (b) negative attitudes toward dementia. Bivariate analyses showed that knowledge (mean difference=9.9) and attitudes (10% lower) improved from pre- to post training (p<.05). Collaboration between social work programs can increase student access to strength-based dementia education. Such programs hold the potential of improving dementia capability within the field of social work.

AB  - The prevailing feeling of Italians toward animals is positive and based on respect. Dogs are often perceived as family members and, providing social support, can improve human health. However, the mutually beneficial relationship between human and dog can break, as demonstrated by animals being abandoned to shelters. Rupture of the bond between owner and dog may be because of a lack of correspondence between the owner's conception of an ideal dog and reality. The aim of this study was to investigate demographic, morphological, and behavioral characteristics important to the Italian public in their ideal dog, using a questionnaire previously administered to the Australian public. Data were collected from 770 volunteers (74.3% females) aged 18-64 years. Physical characteristics were not important in defining the ideal dog, but the percentage of Italians reporting to prefer a neutered dog (35%) was much lower compared with the Australian public (64%). In particular, most Italian men preferred a male entire/intact dog (68%, P < 0.001). Italian women were more willing to spend time with their dog than Italian males. Most people indicated that the cost of maintaining a dog was unimportant, but most dog owners reportedly spent less than 21(sic) per week (70%, P < 0.001). Consistent with the Australian data, the ideal dog for Italians should be safe with children, housetrained, healthy, friendly with humans and other animals, long lived, and obedient. Principal component analysis condensed ideal behavioral traits into 5 components, explaining 47.9% of the total variance: calm, sociable and healthy, well trained and adaptable, energetic, and easy to manage. Analysis of variance revealed that men preferred an energetic dog (P < 0.001) and participants living with children a sociable and healthy dog. Older adults (P < 0.001), dog owners (P < 0.001), and participants living alone (P < 0.05) perceived training to be important in the ideal dog. Dog owners also preferred a dog that is easy to manage (P < 0.05). In conclusion, gender, previous experiences, prejudices on neutering, and attitude toward the animals may affect expectations of respondents regarding the ideal dog. The gaps between ideal and real dogs highlighted in this study should be further investigated. These might be reduced by promoting an adequate education of potential dog owners about dogs' physiology and ethology and of the positive effects of training activities on dogs' behavior.

AB  - Purpose: The objective of the study was to define factors associated with adolescent and young adult (AYA) experiences with private time and having discussed confidentiality and the impact of these experiences on improving delivery of clinical preventive services.
   Methods: In 2016, a nationally representative sample of 1,918 US AYAs (13- to 26-year-olds) was surveyed. Survey questionnaire domains were based on prior research and Fishers' information-motivation-behavior skills conceptual model. Data were weighted to represent US households with AYA and analyzed to identify factors independently associated with ever experiencing private time and discussions of confidentiality with a regular health-care provider (HCP). We examined the association of these experiences on AYA attitudes about health care.
   Results: Fifty-five percent of female and 49% of male AYA reported ever having had private time with an HCP and 55% of female and 44% of male AYA had spoken to an HCP about confidentiality. Independent predictors of having experienced private time and confidentiality included older age, race, higher household income, gender of the provider, amount of years with the provider, and involvement in risk behaviors. AYA who had experienced private time and confidentiality discussions had more positive attitudes about their providers, were more willing and comfortable discussing sensitive topics, and thought that these discussions should happen at younger ages.
   Conclusions: Although confidentiality and private time are important to AYA, many are not experiencing these components of care.

TI  - THE TRANSGENDER MILITARY BAN: PRESERVATION OF DISCRIMINATION THROUGH TRANSFORMATION
T2  - NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - MENTAL-HEALTH
KW  - STRESS
KW  - PREJUDICE
KW  - GAY
AB  - This Essay contends that the Trump Administration's ban on transgender individuals serving in the military is based on prejudice and bias, lacking any legitimate justification. As such, the transgender military ban cannot be justified on legal grounds. Nor can it be justified based on health and safety. Engaging a robust empirical record, the authors show that the ban cannot be justified based on matters of efficiency, preparedness, or combat readiness-arguments used by the Trump Administration to justify the ban. Despite transgender individuals serving openly in the military in recent years, the Trump Administration has not been able to offer in reports or court documents proof of its claims that transgender service members undermine combat readiness and thus pose a risk to the military.
   Given this, the authors argue, the Supreme Court's intervention to lift the preliminary injunctions bodes poorly for how the Court will address this issue and other LGBTQ rights issues to come. The Essay identifies several problems with the Trump Administration's policy to ban transgender individuals from serving in the U.S. military. First, the policy is unjustifiably discriminatory on the basis of gender identity. Second, it perpetuates harmful stereotypes and stigmas that have serious consequences in society generally, and specifically, for transgender service members and their families. Third, the policy singles out transgender members of the military through what ultimately can be understood as coercion and shaming, forcing trans military service members to obtain a psychological diagnosis of gender dysphoria and to do so rather abruptly in order to continue in their military employment. The Essay shows how the transgender military ban perpetuates historical patterns of discrimination in the military, which reach back to race- and sex-based discrimination. The authors conclude that promoting equality in the military will only occur when those who wish to, and are qualified to, serve are permitted to do so with dignity and respect.

AB  - Background: The few existing studies on herpes labialis among health care workers have been predominantly among non-dental health care workers. The purpose of this study was to determine Nigerian dental health care providers' knowledge of, attitudes toward, preventive behaviors for, and refusal to treat patients with herpes labialis.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted among final-year dental students at the University of Benin, dental house officers, and residents at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Benin City, Nigeria. Data collection was via a self-administered questionnaire. Bivariate statistics and logistic regression were used to relate the dependent and independent variables.
   Results: Of the 120 questionnaires distributed, 110 were completed and returned, giving a 91.7 % retrieval rate. However, 15 of the returned questionnaires were discarded because they were improperly completed, leaving a total of 95 questionnaires for final analysis in this study. The majority of participants were over 28 years old (54.7 %), male (67.4 %), unmarried (66.3 %), and postgraduate dental health care providers (51.6 %). Less than half (43.2 %) of participants demonstrated adequate overall knowledge of herpes labialis. About one-tenth (10.5 %) and more than three-quarters (87.4 %) of participants reported a positive attitude and performance of adequate preventive behaviors, respectively. A total of 16.8 % of participants reported a high tendency to refuse treatment to patients with herpes labialis. Although not statistically significant, young, unmarried, male undergraduate participants reported a greater likelihood to refuse treatment to herpes labialis patients. We found a statistically significant positive correlation between attitude and refusal to treat patients with herpes labialis. However, marital status and the attitude of participants toward these patients emerged as the determinants for refusal to treat patients with herpes labialis.
   Conclusions: Data from this study revealed a high level of inadequate knowledge, negative attitudes, and reasonably adequate preventive behaviors with respect to herpes labialis. One out of every six dental health care workers studied reported having refused to treat patients with herpes labialis. Unmarried dental health care providers and those with negative attitudes toward herpes labialis patients were more prone to refuse treatment to these patients.

AB  - Therapists working with couples are likely to see gay male couples in their practice yet there is a lack of training to prepare therapists to work with gay couples. Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) is an empirically supported approach to couples therapy and offers a clear structure and map for working with gay male couples. This article reviews some of the issues that are specific to EFT work with gay men. Given the range of minority stressors that gay men contend with EFT is particularly appropriate for work with gay male couples because of the focus on the attachment bond. Building a secure relationship is an important source of resilience that can buffer against prejudice and discrimination and provide a secure base for individual and couple exploration.

AB  - Many ecosystems are facing environmental threats. Some of the main concerns are now focused in developing countries. Strong environmental messages by numerous stakeholders have led to varied responses on environmental issues. Companies, governmental agencies and NGOs are responding to such issues by developing campaigns to promote sustainable practices amongst key stakeholders. Green advertising is one important form of communications employed to elicit environmentally friendly attitudes and consequently promote behavioural change. This study analyses the effect of a sponsored cinematographic green advertising strategy by a NGO and a major supermarket chain in a Latin American country. Based on in-depth interviews with Colombian movie audiences, this investigation demonstrates how (1) a movie focused on nationalistic identification can effectively provoke positive attitude change toward environmental sustainable practices, (2) the movie's media format can heighten audience interest about adopting environmental sustainable practices and (3) these results benefit positively the two movie sponsors through association and affect transfer.

AB  - Sexual objectification of women is linked to a variety of negative attitudes and behaviour towards them, including myths about sexual aggression. The aim of the study was to examine the link between myths about sexual aggression and sexual objectification through hostile attitudes towards women. A sample of students and non-students (N = 165) completed a questionnaire that included the Acceptance of Modern Rape Myths about Sexual Aggression Scale, the Interpersonal Sexual Objectification Scale-Perpetrator Version, and a measure of hostility towards women. The results indicated that acceptance of myths about sexual aggression was positively correlated with sexual objectification and hostility towards women. In addition, acceptance of myths about sexual aggression was indirectly related to sexual objectification via hostile attitudes towards women. We discuss the implications of our findings for the relationship between the negative perceptions and treatment of women, particularly those relating to sexualised attitudes and rape myth acceptance.

AB  - Most current studies involving prisoner's dilemma games are formulated under the assumption that participators are rational during collective interaction. Although irrationality in some patterns has been considered in the evolution, the effects brought about by the hatred of the rich mentality have never been investigated. Here, we introduce a cumulative reward-based rule where a player will adopt an irrational strategy which is expressed in defection in the game if the cumulative reward of the opponent exceeds the threshold controlled by a given parameter. Interestingly, despite irrational defection, such rules will result in the best environment for cooperator's viability. In addition, we have demonstrated that irrationality in this form could be favorable for the average allocation of wealth in terms of Gini coefficient.

AB  - The purposes of this study were: (a) to analyze the factors determining the quality of relationships between a novice physical education (PE) teacher and his students' families and (b) understand the implications of these relationships for his professional identity. The data stemmed from detailed teacher's diaries written by the participant throughout his first five years of teaching. The data analysis followed several rounds of cyclical inductive-deductive processes in order to identify and classify the patterns related to the aforementioned purposes. The results, presented in two sections, show two distinct sets of factors, which, respectively, had very different implications for the development of the teacher's professional identity. On the one hand, in the first three years of teaching, there appeared 11 specific struggle factors' (6 socio-cultural and structural factors and 5 family prejudices toward PE) that threatened the teacher's initial pedagogical passion and lead to a great deal of hesitation and discouragement on his part; on the other hand, in the fourth and fifth years, due to the teacher's ongoing commitment and (self-)reflective practice, there emerged eight success factors' (one from the families and seven from the teacher) that transformed his previous discouragement into hope and self-confidence. Besides the detailed analysis of all these factors and their implications, some additional recommendations for PE teacher education programs and further research are provided.

AB  - In this study, using mixed methods, we investigated the longer term effects of eCoaching through advanced online bug-in-ear (BIE) technology. Quantitative data on five dependent variables were extracted from 14 participants' electronically archived video files at three points in time-Spring 1 (i.e., baseline, which was the first semester of enrollment without eCoaching feedback), Spring 2 (i.e., 1 year later with eCoaching feedback), and Spring 3 (i.e., 2 years later after exiting the program without eCoaching feedback). Qualitative data were collected by means of interviews with participants regarding their ongoing participation in eCoaching. Quantitative analysis, using repeated-measures ANOVA, confirmed initial improvements in participants' teaching practices and P-12 student engagement generally withstood the test of time. Also, qualitative findings indicated, as time went on, participants had more positive than negative attitudes toward eCoaching through advanced online BIE.

AB  - Pedestrian Navigation System (PNS) is one of the research focuses of indoor positioning in GNSS-denied environments based on the MEMS Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU). However, in the foot-mounted pedestrian navigation system with MIMU or mobile phone as the main carrier, it is difficult to make the sampling time of gyros and accelerometers completely synchronous. The gyro-accelerometer asynchronous time affects the positioning of PNS. To solve this problem, a new error model of gyro-accelerometer asynchronous time is built. The effect of gyro-accelerometer asynchronous time on pedestrian navigation is analyzed. A filtering model is designed to calibrate the gyro-accelerometer asynchronous time, and a zero-velocity detection method based on the rate of attitude change is proposed. The indoor experiment shows that the gyro-accelerometer asynchronous time is estimated effectively, and the positioning accuracy of PNS is improved by the proposed method after compensating for the errors caused by gyro-accelerometer asynchronous time.

AB  - Britain's response to the recent refugee crisis is marked by its absence. Kushner's article explores how constructions of the past have been instrumentalized by defenders of government restrictionism and those demanding that more should be let in. His particular focus is on child refugees and the comparisons drawn (and rejected) to the Kindertransport. Through discussion in parliament, the media, cultural productions and among ordinary people, he shows the importance of history' and how references to the Second World War and the Holocaust have tended to help justify rather than query the exclusion of today's refugees, thereby providing a very different example to Germany. He also explores the role of sentimentalism in positive responses to refugees and how this encourages empathy but can also limit effective entry policies and treatment of the forcibly displaced.

AB  - Negative attitudes toward dogs are common in Muslim societies. Thus, in studying both past and present Muslim writings on dogs, a contradictory picture emerges, indicating that Muslim attitudes toward dogs have had their ambiguities. At times the dog has been presented as the lowest, filthiest, and vilest of creatures, and at times the dog appears as a perfect role model, exemplifying qualities like loyalty, devotion, and self-sacrifice. There are signs that attitudes toward dogs are changing in some Muslim societies. One such sign is that an increasing number of people in Muslim countries are now keeping dogs as companion animals. The following research will be used to highlight ambiguities as well as changes in order to not only better understand the position of the dog within Islam, but also to provide a very concrete example of how interpretations of religions are not isolated or single but are dependent on context.

AB  - This study uses a three-wave prospective longitudinal survey (at 6-month intervals) to test effects of information seeking and scanning on attitudes toward marijuana among college students in Israel (N = 700). We integrate constructs from the elaboration likelihood model to contrast processes of attitude change among individuals who vary in moderators of information processing depth (motivation and ability). In addition, we test whether trust in the information source moderates these processes, and use propensity score matching to reduce bias. Results of autoregressive cross-lagged structural equation models show that scanning from interpersonal sources predicted attitudes toward marijuana among individuals who were low in elaboration motivation or ability. Seeking and scanning information about marijuana from interpersonal sources were positively associated with attitudes toward marijuana among individuals higher in elaboration motivation and ability, who had greater trust in the source. Implications for information processing models, seeking and scanning, and campaigns are discussed.

TI  - Risk-Sensitive Multiagent Decision-Theoretic Planning Based on MDP and One-Switch Utility Functions
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
LA  - English
AB  - In high stakes situations decision-makers are often risk-averse and decision-making processes often take place in group settings. This paper studies multiagent decision-theoretic planning under Markov decision processes (MDPs) framework with considering the change of agent's risk attitude as his wealth level varies. Based on one-switch utility function that describes agent's risk attitude change with his wealth level, we give the additive and multiplicative aggregation models of group utility and adopt maximizing expected group utility as planning objective. When the wealth level approaches infinity, the characteristics of optimal policy are analyzed for the additive and multiplicative aggregation model, respectively. Then a backward-induction method is proposed to divide the wealth level interval from negative infinity to initial wealth level into subintervals and determine the optimal policy in states and subintervals. The proposed method is illustrated by numerical examples and the influences of agent's risk aversion parameters and weights on group decision-making are also analyzed.

AB  - Much of the literary criticism devoted to interpreting the work of W. Wordsworth tries, on the one hand, to overcome and moderate, or, on the other hand, to directly accept the manifest opposition against science and scientific practices that the poet maintains, mainly throughout his work The Prelude. I will examine the conceptual basis of such hostile attitude by analyzing the lexicon used in this work. The results obtained permit confirming Wordsworth's hostility towards science, and more precisely, the prejudice that modern science would not allow a humanized perception of nature. But I argue that this attitude is due to a latent enchanted worldview, in a Weberian sense, more suitable for the sentimental description than for the perception and description of the natural landscape based on the explanatory knowledge of nature.

AB  - Through a field experiment set in academia (with a sample of 6,548 professors), we found that decisions about distant-future events were more likely to generate discrimination against women and minorities (relative to Caucasian males) than were decisions about near-future events. In our study, faculty members received e-mails from fictional prospective doctoral students seeking to schedule a meeting either that day or in 1 week; students' names signaled their race (Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, Indian, or Chinese) and gender. When the requests were to meet in 1 week, Caucasian males were granted access to faculty members 26% more often than were women and minorities; also, compared with women and minorities, Caucasian males received more and faster responses. However, these patterns were essentially eliminated when prospective students requested a meeting that same day. Our identification of a temporal discrimination effect is consistent with the predictions of construal-level theory and implies that subtle contextual shifts can alter patterns of race- and gender-based discrimination.

AB  - Misinformed beliefs are difficult to change. Refutations that target false claims typically reduce false beliefs, but tend to be only partially effective. In this study, a social norming approach was explored to test whether provision of peer norms could provide an alternative or complementary approach to refutation. Three experiments investigated whether a descriptive norm-by itself or in combination with a refutation-could reduce the endorsement of worldview-congruent claims. Experiment 1 found that using a single-point estimate to communicate a norm affected belief but had less impact than a refutation. Experiment 2 used a verbally presented distribution of four values to communicate a norm, which was largely ineffective. Experiment 3 used a graphically presented social norm with 25 values, which was found to be as effective at reducing claim belief as a refutation, with the combination of both interventions being most impactful. These results provide a proof of concept that normative information can aid in the debunking of false or equivocal claims, and suggests that theories of misinformation processing should take social factors into account.

AB  - Weight bias is a widespread form of prejudice that leads to the stigmatization of individuals who are perceived to have excess weight. Several psychological theories have been used to explain weight bias and to understand its negative impact on the mental and physical health of individuals with overweight and obesity. Top-down approaches are needed to reduce weight stigma and its adverse health consequences at the population-level. Potential targets for stigma-reduction policies include weight-based discrimination in the workplace, bullying and discrimination in educational settings, stigma in health care, and stereotypical media portrayals. These proposed policies have strong support from the public and stakeholders and, with further implementation and evaluation, may serve as promising structural interventions for addressing societal weight stigma.

AB  - Culturally relevant pedagogy (CRP; e.g., Ladson-Billings, 1995) is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to serve culturally and linguistically diverse student learners. Although a large body of work describes its tenets and permutations, and its implications for students, less work has been done to outline the myriad barriers that teachers face when trying to implement CRP. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a race-conscious, multilevel, ecological framework to illuminate the societal, institutional, and individual obstacles that teachers must navigate in the pursuit of CRP. Implications for teacher training and development are discussed.

In total, 830 adults residing in Seoul were sampled by a multi-stage cluster and random sampling design. Data were collected from a structured self-administered questionnaire, which covered variables concerning demographics, health status and TPB constructs including attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control. A path analysis combining personal characteristics and TPB constructs was used to investigate determinants of the customers' intention. Positive and negative attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control directly affected the intention to participate. Demographics and health status both directly and indirectly affected the intention to participate. This study identifies personal characteristics and TPB constructs that are important to planning and implementing a restaurant health promotion program.

AB  - Background: There has been an increase in recent publications, in high and medium resource settings, documenting women's dissatisfaction with the quality of maternity care they receive. Their discontent is mostly related to their midwives' disrespectful or negative attitudes.
   Objective: To explore women's experiences and perceptions of disrespect and abuse from their maternity care providers in a low resource rural setting in Zimbabwe.
   Design: A critical, qualitative research methodology, using in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions, was employed to capture rural women's experiences during antenatal care, postpartum care, and the use of maternity waiting homes' services.
   Setting: Three rural health centres in Mutare district, Manicaland Province in eastern Zimbabwe.
   Participants: A total of 20 purposively sampled women, 16-30 years of age, who were accessing various stages of maternal health services, were recruited from three conveniently selected rural health centres. Eight women participated in the in-depth interviews. A further eight women were discussants in the first focus group, and a further four women participated in the second focus group.
   Findings: Multifaceted and interconnected factors contribute to midwives' attitudes and behaviours towards their clients. Midwives' subjective perceptions, women's social status, and health system constraints (i.e., availability of trained midwives and quality of midwifery training) in rural and poorly resourced community, often result in inappropriate services, negative attitudes, abusive treatment, and disrespectful behaviour towards women. Poor treatment in maternity care directly contribute to adverse health outcomes and women's satisfaction with services.
   Conclusion and implications for practice: Women's social status, level of education and age, were perceived to influence the quality of care or treatment they received. Improving women's experience of maternal care requires targeted interventions at the interpersonal level between a woman and her health care providers, as well as at the level of the health care facility and the health system. The results of this study challenge all tiers of health personnel including policy makers, in low resource settings to reappraise the present situation thereby challenging these established behaviours, to ensure that the continuum of maternity care is respectfully and socio-culturally delivered.

AB  - This study examined preschoolers' social inclusion-the active involvement of new partners into social interactions-in different intergroup contexts. Using an interactive paradigm, 3- to 5-year-old German children played a ball-tossing game with 2 puppets in which 1 puppet initiated the game with the child and another approached the game. In Study 1 (N = 144), the initiator was from an ingroup while an outgroup puppet approached the game (ingroup/outgroup condition) or the child and the 2 puppets did not have any group membership (control condition). Social inclusion was assessed by analyzing whether and how children included the approaching puppet into the game. Results revealed that children were more inclusive with increasing age. Across age, children were less willing to include the approaching puppet in the intergroup context as compared to the control context. To further investigate whether the difference between conditions was driven by a preference for the ingroup or a derogation of the outgroup, a second study (N = 72) was conducted. Here, the initiating puppet was neutral (i.e., no group membership) and the approaching puppet was from an outgroup (neutral/outgroup condition). In this condition, social inclusion was in between the 2 conditions of Study 1. Further, the developmental trajectory found in Study 1 could be replicated in Study 2 such that children were more likely to include the approaching puppet with increasing age. These results suggest that children's willingness to include others increases over preschool age and is influenced by both ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation.

KW  - medical ethics
AB  - Background: Fee splitting is a process whereby a physician refers a patient to another physician or a healthcare facility and receives a portion of the charge in return. This survey was conducted to study general practitioners' (GPs) attitudes toward fee splitting as well as the prevalence, causes, and consequences of this process.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study on 223 general practitioners in 2013. Concerning the causes and consequences of fee splitting, an unpublished qualitative study was conducted by interviewing a number of GPs and specialists and the questionnaire options were the results of the information obtained from this study.
   Results: Of the total 320 GPs, 247 returned the questionnaires. The response rate was 77.18%. Of the 247 returned questionnaires, 223 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Among the participants, 69.1% considered fee splitting completely wrong and 23.2% (frequently or rarely) practiced fee splitting. The present study showed that the prevalence of fee splitting among physicians who, had positive attitudes toward fee splitting was 4.63 times higher than those who had negative attitudes. In addition, this study showed that, compared to private hospitals, fee splitting is less practiced in public hospitals. The major cause of fee splitting was found to be unrealistic/unfair tariffs and the main consequence of fee stplitting was thought to be an increase in the number of unnecessary patient referrals.
   Conclusion: Fee splitting is an unethical act, contradicts the goals of the medical profession, and undermines patient's best interest. In Iran, there is no cdde of ethics on fee splitting, but in this study, it was found that the majority of GPs considered it unethical. However, among those who had negative attitudes toward fee splitting, there were physicians who did practice fee splitting. The results of the study showed that physicians who had a positive attitude toward fee splitting practiced it more than others. Therefore, if physicians consider fee splitting unethical, its rate will certainly decrease. The study claims that to decrease such practice, the healthcare system has to revise the tariffs.

AB  - Individuals that perceive stigma surrounding their identity and fear rejection of support requests may experience a paradox whereby they seek support indirectly from support networks (friends and family) to avoid rejection and are met with unsupportive responses. This study extended this paradox to sexual minorities using survey data from a sample of 133 individuals self-identified as gay and lesbian. Results of structural equation modeling showed self-stigma and fear of support rejection linked to increased indirect support seeking, which in turn explained unsupportive network responses, providing support for a paradox among gays and lesbians. Findings may have implications for interventions to improve support exchanges in the lives of sexual minorities.

AB  - Objective: This study measured Americans' willingness to pay an additional $50 in taxes to improve health care and social services for individuals with serious mental illness.
   Methods: A nationally representative online survey was conducted with 1,010 respondents. Analysis examined how respondents' demographic characteristics and attitudes toward individuals with serious mental illness correlated with their willingness to pay additional taxes to improve health care and social services for this vulnerable population.
   Results: A majority of respondents expressed willingness to pay $50 in additional taxes to improve health care services (60%) and social services (58%) for individuals with serious mental illness. Those with more negative attitudes toward individuals with serious mental illness were less willing to pay additional taxes to improve either service type.
   Conclusions: Many Americans are willing to pay additional taxes to improve health care and social services for individuals with serious mental illness.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between internalized and public stigma on treatment-related attitudes and behaviors in a community sample of 449 African American and white adults aged 18 years and older Telephone surveys were administered to assess level of depressive symptoms, demographic characteristics, stigma, and treatment-related attitudes and behaviors. Multiple regression analysis indicated that internalized stigma mediated the relationship between public stigma and attitudes toward mental health treatment. Within group analyses indicated that the mediating effect of internalized stigma was significant for whites only. Among African Americans, internalized stigma did not mediate public stigma; it was directly related to attitudes toward mental health treatment. The internalization of stigma is key in the development of negative attitudes toward mental health treatment, and future research should focus on this aspect of stigma in both individual and community-based efforts to reduce stigma.

AB  - Objectives: Generational changes in lifestyle expectations, working environments and the feminisation of the medical workforce have seen an increased demand in postgraduate less than full-time training (LTFT). Despite this, concerns remain regarding access to, and information about, flexible training for surgeons. This study aimed to assess the opinions and experiences of LTFT for surgical trainees.
   Design: Prospective, questionnaire-based cross-sectional study.
   Setting/participants: An electronic, self-administered questionnaire was distributed in the UK and Republic of Ireland through mailing lists via the Association of Surgeons in Training and British Orthopedic Trainee Association.
   Results: Overall, 876 completed responses were received, representing all grades of trainee across all 10 surgical specialties. Median age was 33 years and 63.4% were female. Of those who had undertaken LTFT, 92.5% (148/160) were female. Most worked 60% of a full-time post (86/160, 53.8%). The reasons for either choosing or considering LTFT were childrearing (82.7%), caring for a dependent (12.6%) and sporting commitments (6.8%). Males were less likely to list childrearing than females (64.9% vs 87.6%; p<0.0001). Only 38% (60/160) found the application process easy and 53.8% (86/160) experienced undermining behaviour from workplace staff as a result of undertaking LTFT. Of all respondents, an additional 53.7% (385/716) would consider LTFT in future; 27.5% of which were male (106/385). Overall, only 9.9% of all respondents rated current LTFT information as adequate. Common sources of information were other trainees (47.3%), educational supervisors (20.6%) and local postgraduate school website (19.5%).
   Conclusions: Over half of surgical trainees working LTFT have experienced undermining behaviour as a result of their LTFT. Despite a reported need for LTFT in both genders, this remains difficult to organise, access to useful information is poor and negative attitudes among staff remain. Recommendations are made to provide improved support and information for those wishing to pursue LTFT.

AB  - During conversations, people generally comply with norms such as keeping the story interesting for the listener. If word-of-mouth about a previous consumption experience is communicated in a conversational format, then adherence to conversational norms could result in changes to the retrospective evaluation of the event. The research presented here investigates whether an alteration occurs, the possible consequences of an alteration to the retrospective evaluation, and the mechanisms behind a change. A peak-trough moment approach to constructing retrospective evaluations is compared with an average moment (or overall attitude) change. The peak is the most intensely positive moment in a positive experience and the trough is the most intensely negative moment in a positive experience. The results show that post-conversational retrospective evaluations are amplified and that the change in the intensity of the trough that has an important role to play in explaining the changes in the retrospective evaluation of the consumption event.

AB  - The relationship between male rape myth acceptance, female rape myth acceptance, attitudes toward gay men, a series of gender role and sexism measures, victim blame and assault severity were investigated. It was predicted that men would display more negative, stereotypical attitudes than women and that male rape myth endorsement would be related to, and predicted by, the other attitude and attribution scales. Respondents comprised 323 undergraduates (146 males and 177 females) from a large University in the Northwest of England. Results broadly conformed to predictions, with men generally more negative than women, and male rape myth acceptance significantly related to female rape myth acceptance, negative attitudes about gay men, gender role attitudes, and victim blame. Furthermore, male rape myth acceptance was predicted by female rape myth acceptance, gender attitudes, and victim blame. Methodological issues and implications for future work and those working with victims are discussed.

AB  - Objective To examine the overlap between priorities expressed by representatives from national and local campaigning organisations and the views of key voices in relation to dementia. Methods Semi-structured, in-depth telephone interviews were conducted with 19 representatives from campaigning organisations, including nine countries and six local community initiatives in Australia. Responses were categorised into nine priorities. Views were compared to the voices of people with dementia (n = 19), carers (n = 28), and health-care (n = 21), social work (n = 23) and service professionals (n = 20). Results Local groups prioritised user-led decision-making and community normalising agendas. National groups were influenced by service frameworks and increasing public awareness. Professional and carer groups focused on increasing understanding and communication skills while people with dementia valued being a normal part of society. Conclusion Future campaigning should use both national and local approaches to changing social relations, through interpersonal connections, advocacy and social mobilisation, to promote a normalising approach to attitude change.

AB  - Selfish behaviors widely occur in adolescence and can be detrimental to adolescents' moral development and social well-being. However, little is known about the antecedents of selfish behaviors among adolescents in collectivist samples (e.g., East Asia). As social dominance orientation (SDO) is negatively related to morality and concerns about others, we aim to understand whether and how individual differences in SDO predict people's intention to engage in selfish behaviors among Chinese adolescents. We hypothesize that people high in SDO would display higher level of psychological entitlement and, in turn, be more likely to engage in selfish behaviors. To examine this hypothesis, we measured SDO, psychological entitlement, and selfish behavioral intentions using hypothetical scenarios among 254 middle school students aged 12-18 years in China. The results demonstrated that, compared to middle school students low in SDO, those high in SDO reported stronger selfish behavioral intentions, and this effect was partially mediated by psychological entitlement. Directions for future research and implications for interventions to curb selfish behaviors among adolescents are discussed.

AB  - Dehumanization is a central concept in the study of intergroup relations. Yet although theoretical and methodological advances in subtle, "everyday" dehumanization have progressed rapidly, blatant dehumanization remains understudied. The present research attempts to refocus theoretical and empirical attention on blatant dehumanization, examining when and why it provides explanatory power beyond subtle dehumanization. To accomplish this, we introduce and validate a blatant measure of dehumanization based on the popular depiction of evolutionary progress in the "Ascent of Man." We compare blatant dehumanization to established conceptualizations of subtle and implicit dehumanization, including infrahumanization, perceptions of human nature and human uniqueness, and implicit associations between ingroup-outgroup and human-animal concepts. Across 7 studies conducted in 3 countries, we demonstrate that blatant dehumanization is (a) more strongly associated with individual differences in support for hierarchy than subtle or implicit dehumanization, (b) uniquely predictive of numerous consequential attitudes and behaviors toward multiple outgroup targets, (c) predictive above prejudice, and (d) reliable over time. Finally, we show that blatant-but not subtle-dehumanization spikes immediately after incidents of real intergroup violence and strongly predicts support for aggressive actions like torture and retaliatory violence (after the Boston Marathon bombings and Woolwich attacks in England). This research extends theory on the role of dehumanization in intergroup relations and intergroup conflict and provides an intuitive, validated empirical tool to reliably measure blatant dehumanization.

AB  - The wide variety of retailer return policies can cause consumers confusion. While keeping costs contained, very restrictive Return Policies (RPs) may mar consumer behavior. As a first attempt to examine the impact expectation of return control and involvement have on consumers, this study builds a conceptual model with support of the theory of psychological reactance and lends insights into how and why RPs, specifically the denial of product returns, affect consumers during and after the product return process. Our findings indicate that when consumers have high expectations of successfully returning a product and are denied, RPs create significantly higher negative attitudes toward the retailer and attempts to regain control both directly by asking the retailer for an exception and indirectly by retaliating against the retailer in the form of future fraudulent returning. Return-encounter tensions may be lessened by making consumers aware, before purchase, of the RPs.

AB  - Psychiatric advance directives (PADs) allow service users to participate in their own mental health care in the event that they have a future mental health crisis and are deemed incompetent to make decisions, but few patients complete these documents. This Open Forum reports on factors that have helped or hindered completion of PADs in New Zealand. Perceived barriers to completion include resource limitations, procedural issues, access and storage problems, and mistrust between clinicians and service users regarding implementation. Having management and nursing "champions" of the process and organizing outreach meetings for all interested parties appear to aid completion. Targeted education and training promote creation and use of PADs, address negative attitudes, and assist service users in creating these documents. Information technology support is vital to having PADs uploaded and accessed in medical records.

AB  - Background Staff members, and their attitudes, are crucial for providing person-centered care in residential care facilities for people with dementia. However, the literature on the attitudes of nursing staff regarding person-centered care is limited. The objective of this study is to explore the association between staff characteristics (age, education level, years of work experience and function, i.e., care or welfare) and staff attitudes toward perceived person-centered care provision and including informal caregivers in the caregiving process in residential care facilities. Methods A convenience sample of 68 care staff - nurses and nurse assistants - welfare staff members - activity counselors, hostesses, and living room caretakers - of two residential care facilities filled out a questionnaire. Staff attitudes regarding perceived person-centered care were measured with the Person-centered Care Assessment Tool (P-CAT). Staff attitudes regarding informal care provision were measured with the Attitudes Toward Families Checklist (AFC). Multiple linear regression analysis explored the association between variables age, work experience, education, and function (care or welfare). Results A higher age of staff was associated with a more negative attitude toward perceived person-centered care and informal care provision. Welfare staff had a more negative attitude toward the inclusion of informal caregivers than care staff. The perceived person-centered care provision of the care and welfare staff was both positive. Work experience and education were not associated with perceived person-centered care provision or informal care provision. Conclusion This study is one of the first to provide insight into the association between staff characteristics and their attitude toward their perceived person-centered care provision and informal care provision. A higher age of both the care and welfare staff was associated with a more negative attitude toward their perceived person-centered care and informal care provision. Welfare staff had a less positive attitude toward informal care provision. Additionally, future studies, also observational studies and interview studies, are necessary to collect evidence on the reasons for negative attitudes of older staff members towards PCC and informal care giving, to be able to adequately target these reasons by implementing interventions that eliminate or reduce these negative attitudes.

AB  - Purpose: Many studies performed in Morocco showed an important lack of knowledge about epilepsy among persons with epilepsy and their families. The misconceptions about the disease are a source of suffering for both patients and their families and increase the costs of epilepsy care. We conducted this investigation for assessing the origins of misinterpretation of the disease in the Moroccan society.
   Objectives: The teachers' knowledge about epilepsy in the Fez-Meknes region in Morocco and their attitudes toward a person with epilepsy constitute the two major objectives of this study. We also assessed the impact of sociocultural parameters on Moroccan teachers' knowledge and attitudes toward a person with epilepsy.
   Material and methods: The data collection was based on the "Attitudes Toward Persons with Epilepsy" (ATPE) test.
   Results: The study showed a positive correlation between the level of teachers' knowledge of epilepsy and their attitudes toward a person with epilepsy. The results revealed the persistence of negative attitudes toward a person with epilepsy among teachers. The level of ATPE of teachers in Morocco was lower compared to high-middle income countries.
   Conclusion: There is still poor knowledge about epilepsy among teachers in Morocco. This unawareness is negatively affecting teachers' attitudes toward a person with epilepsy. Hence, we recommend integrating epilepsy in teaching and training programs of teachers in the Moroccan educational system. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - When determining probative value for the purposes of balancing the probative value of evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused, the High Court has favoured an approach that appears incompatible with a rational response to the treatment of opinions based on specialised knowledge. A majority in IMM v The Queen concluded that when determining the probative value of evidence for the purpose of s 137 the trial judge should take the contested evidence at its highest. In doing so the trial judge is prevented from considering the reliability of the evidence or the credibility of the witness. This article explains why, whatever the merits of such an approach might be in relation to other types of evidence and witness, trial judges are incapable of assessing the probative value of most forms of scientific, medical and technical opinion evidence - particularly forensic science and forensic medicine evidence - without insight into reliability or trustworthiness demonstrated through formal evaluation. Using examples, the article explains why blinding trial judges to reliability and validity obliges them to speculate about the value of procedures and opinions. Not only are trial judges obliged to speculate, but inattention to the results of formal evaluation has detrimental system effects, elides a range of serious dangers to the accused and denudes s 137 of value as a trial safeguard.

AB  - Background: "The purpose of the present study was to explore further the cross-cultural validity, consistency, and replicability of FAIDSS among students when assessing HIV/AIDS-related stigma and fear of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Lagos metropolis.
   Methods: Using a purposive method, participants in Lagos Metropolis were surveyed using a questionnaire and conceptualization derived from the work of Ross and Hunter (1992) to measure a variety of HIV-related attitudinal and behavioural items. Quantitative data analyzed employing factor analysis using maximum-likelihood extraction followed by oblique rotation (direct oblimin, delta=0).
   Results: On the factor scale measuring having fear of sex with a particular person, younger respondents especially females significantly more likely to report greater fear than for any other groups. Our findings further suggest that levels of fear of outsiders are high among males and need urgent action and intervention at both individual and societal levels.
   Conclusion: It is argued that messages and interventions must be targeted to promote a positive social environment for those living with or affected by HIV/AIDS, and to be useful in understanding stigma, fear and prejudice more fully and in reducing them. A crosscurrent behavioral change that can transform AIDS from an inevitably fatal pandemic to a chronic and manageable disease is the answer.

AB  - Sexual assault on college campuses has become a major concern. A common response has been to provide bystander intervention training, which research shows may provide short-term attitude change without reducing the number of assaults. Current curricula and research may neglect the very factors that could play a part in students' desire and ability to intervene, one of which may be moral motivations. For this qualitative study, we interviewed students (n = 38) who identified as having been bystanders to a 'sketchy sexual situation' to understand, from a moral perspective, their decisions to intervene or not. In exploring narratives, we used Moral Foundation Theory to categorize the moral reasoning of participants and explore the voices and motivations that adhere to these categories. Through a thematic/discourse analysis we identified additional discourses. Implications for changes to bystander intervention training are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of current and former sailors, staff and volunteers who were involved in an adaptive recreational sailing program and identify the factors that impact their engagement. Using an ethnographic approach, participant observations (n = 20) and qualitative interviews (n = 18) were conducted with sailors, staff and volunteers. We analyzed the data thematically and identified two main themes. 1) "Anchors away: reasons for setting sail," described the benefits of adaptive sailing including learning opportunities, leaving disability onshore, challenging stigma, building a community and engaging with nature. 2) "Running ashore: challenges with program delivery and logistics," acknowledged the various issues encountered, including issues around accessibility, equipment, scheduling, safety management, and volunteers/volunteering. The findings emphasize how adaptive sailing offers a multidimensional experience and could reduce prejudices against people with disabilities. Challenges regarding accessibility of facilities and transports as well as volunteers were identified.

The quantitative results indicated that the participants in two service groups (i.e. for at-risk adolescents and adolescents with cerebral palsy) demonstrated a more significant promotion of social justice beliefs than their peers in non-service group. A qualitative analysis provided evidence of the mechanism underlying service-learning, as well as different service experiences affecting on students' social justice beliefs. Finally, the implications for implementing service-learning and realizing social justice goals in China were discussed.

AB  - Background In undergraduate medical education, patient safety concepts and understanding of medical errors are under-represented. This problem is more evident in low-income settings. The aim of this study was to explore undergraduate medical students' attitudes towards patient safety in the low-income setting of the Gaza Strip. Methods A cross-sectional, descriptive study included medical students of the two medical schools in the Gaza Strip with 338 medical students completing the Attitudes to Patient Safety Questionnaire-IV (APSQ-IV), which examines patient attitudes in 29 items over 10 domains. Results are represented as means +/- standard deviations for each item and domain as well as percentage of positive responses to specific items. Results Medical students reported slightly positive patient safety attitudes (4.7 +/- 0.5 of 7) with the most positive attitudes in the domains of situational awareness, importance of patient safety in the curriculum, error inevitability and team functioning. While no negative attitudes were reported, neutral attitudes were found in the domains of professional incompetence as a cause of error and error reporting confidence. Study year and gender had no significant association with patient safety attitudes, except for disclosure responsibility, where male students displayed significantly more positive attitudes. The study university was significantly associated with three of the 10 examined domains, all of which involved understanding of medical errors, for which students of University 2 (who had undergone limited patient safety training) held significantly more positive attitudes, compared with students of University 1 (who did not have structured patient safety training). Conclusion Medical students' patient safety attitudes were very similar among students from both universities, except for understanding of medical error, for which students, who had received structured training in this topic, displayed significantly more positive attitudes. This underlines the power of the 'hidden curriculum', where students adjust to prevalent cultures in local hospitals, while they do their clinical training. Furthermore, it highlights the need for a systematic inclusion of patient safety content in local undergraduate curricula.

AB  - The striking under-representation of women in Japan has been partly attributed to gender stereotypes and prejudice toward female leadership among voters. We examine whether and to what extent candidates get rewarded or punished when they deviate from the behavioral expectations associated with their gender roles and images. Our conjoint experiment results in Japan demonstrate that not only are female candidates disadvantaged compared to their male counterparts, but also that they could lose support when they diverge from gender-based behavioral expectations. Our findings suggest that female candidates face a difficult dilemma in that they must weigh the cost of losing support for failing to conform to gender-based expectations, against the general loss of support they would incur for conforming to these expectations.

AB  - Since 2002, social workers and others in New York City have attended Undoing Racism TM Workshops (URW) designed to encourage participants to advance racial equity in the organizations in which they work. However, little is known about the extent to which participants pursued these goals following the workshop. Drawing on a participatory action model, this study explored the impact of URW by examining the participants' (1) change in knowledge and attitudes about structural racism, (2) engagement in job-related racial equity activities, and their (3) view of their organization's progress toward racial equity. The study also explored (4) factors that might be associated with personal engagement and progress toward organizational change and (5) the role of race in the outcomes. Findings include increased knowledge and attitude change, considerable individual engagement, mixed organizational progress, and identification of facilitators and barriers with some differentiations by race.

AB  - The election of President Barack Obama offers a unique opportunity to test the impressionable-years hypothesisthe theory of political socialization that predicts that widely experienced political events can have a lasting impact on the political attitudes of individuals who experience that event in their youth, thereby creating a generational distinction. Using data from an original survey embedded in the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study, we examine the racial attitudes of White youth who came of age during Barack Obama's presidential campaign and election to see if those individuals are significantly more liberal on racial attitudes than older generations of Whites. In other words, we look for early evidence that an Obama generation has emerged. We find there are indeed early signs of a generational distinction. Members of the Obama generation are more strongly opposed to racial resentment, but they exhibit similar levels of opposition to old-fashioned racism as older cohorts. Additionally, we uncover that the factors that traditionally structure racial attitudes among Whites, most notably contact, education, and residential proximity, work quite differently for members of this generation. We take these findings as initial evidence that Barack Obama's presidency will have a lasting impact on the racial views of a generation of Americans.

AB  - The main goal of this paper is to propose a probability model for computing probabilities of dismissal of 10b-5 securities class-action cases filed in United States Federal district courts. By dismissal, we mean dismissal with prejudice in response to the motion to dismiss filed by the defendants, and not eventual dismissal after the discovery process. The proposed probability model is a hybrid of two widely-used methods: logistic regression, and naive Bayes. Using a dataset of 925 10b-5 securities class-action cases filed between 2002 and 2010, we show that the proposed hybrid model has the potential of computing better probabilities than either LR or NB models. By better, we mean lower root mean square errors of probabilities of dismissal. The proposed hybrid model uses the following features: allegations of generally accepted accounting principles violations, allegations of lack of internal control, bankruptcy filing during the class period, allegations of Section 11 violations of Securities Act of 1933, and short-term drop in stock price. Our model is useful for those insurance companies which underwrite Directors and Officers liability policy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Processes for the identification of criminal suspects tell us a great deal about wider cultural assumptions and social prejudices regarding somatic difference; its causes, relative degree, and consequence. If early modern Europeans had something approaching a forensic science, it was astrology, which has recently garnered renewed attention from historians of ideas. Rather than assume astrology's seventeenth-century decline in the face of revolutionary natural philosophy, what follows suggests that English astrology remained significant for mundane bodily discrimination, in the context of both a more deliberate, gradual reform and the tenacity of centuries-old humoral physiology. More importantly, scrutiny of astrological practice, and the logic underpinning its lasting currency, can reveal much about the significance of bodily contrasts and the meanings ascribed to them by Tudor-Stuart folk.

AB  - In this paper we examine intercultural relations from a three-way perspective (among immigrants/refugees, Anglo-Australians, and Indigenous Australians) through the lens of social cohesion and its dimensions (belonging, inclusion, participation, recognition, and legitimacy). Our data are drawn from three community case studies involving 15 focus group discussions (138 community residents) and 54 key informant interviews (government and nongovernment service providers and community representatives). Our findings highlight the complexity of intergroup relations, with tensions driven largely by realistic threat concerns and perceived relative deprivation among Anglo-Australians and Indigenous Australians. These concerns intersected with intercultural recognition and national identity. Finally, there was a general lack of the kind of intergroup contact that would decrease prejudice. The findings are discussed in relation to acculturation research and the complexity of intergroup relations in plural societies.

AB  - This study investigated psychological distress in Iranian international students at UNSW Australia, and explored the psychosocial factors associated with high levels of distress. A total of 180 Iranian international students pursuing undergraduate and postgraduate degrees during 2012/2013 completed an email questionnaire containing socio-demographic items and five standardized and validated scales. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyse the predictors of psychological distress. Compared to domestic and international students at two other Australian universities, a significantly smaller proportion of Iranian international students scored as distressed on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Greater levels of psychological distress were associated with being female, poorer physical health, less social support, less religious involvement and spirituality, and negative attitudes towards seeking professional psychological help. Findings from this growing group of international students can help inform culturally competent mental health promotion and service provision in their host countries.

AB  - Can a single conversation change minds on divisive social issues, such as same-sex marriage? A randomized placebo-controlled trial assessed whether gay (n = 22) or straight (n = 19) messengers were effective at encouraging voters (n = 972) to support same-sex marriage and whether attitude change persisted and spread to others in voters' social networks. The results, measured by an unrelated panel survey, show that both gay and straight canvassers produced large effects initially, but only gay canvassers' effects persisted in 3-week, 6-week, and 9-month follow-ups. We also find strong evidence of within-household transmission of opinion change, but only in the wake of conversations with gay canvassers. Contact with gay canvassers further caused substantial change in the ratings of gay men and lesbians more generally. These large, persistent, and contagious effects were confirmed by a follow-up experiment. Contact with minorities coupled with discussion of issues pertinent to them is capable of producing a cascade of opinion change.

AB  - Those persons with church membership or professing a faith or relationship with God represent a microcosm of society. Therefore, the demons of racism, bigotry, and prejudice found in society at large are found in the church. Despite the very nature of Christianity that calls on Christians to be a countervoice in the world against evil, many have capitulated to various strains of racism in the world and in the Church. Some Christian denominations have begun to explore racism in the church and have developed responses to addressing the issues in the church and in the world. This article examines the historical context of race and religion in the Christian church in the United States, and addresses the current efforts of some Christian denominations to become proactive in the struggle against racism.

AB  - Previous studies investigating attitudes to genetically modified (GM) foods suggest a correlation between negative attitudes and low levels of science education, both of which are associated with women. In a qualitative focus group study of Australian women with diverse levels of education, we found attitudes to GM foods were part of a complex process of making "good" food decisions, which included other factors such as locally produced, fresh/natural, healthy and nutritious, and convenient. Women involved in GM crop development and those with health science training differed in how they used evidence to categorize GM foods. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of how GM food, and the role of science and technology in food production and consumption more broadly, is understood and discussed amongst diverse "publics" and across different "sciences," and to research related to deepening public engagement at the intersection of science and values.

Scant research has assessed the influence on employers and on the work setting. This study focused on a unique program to foster the employment of individuals with intellectual disabilities in the Israeli military and examined the effect of the program on the employers (military commanders) and on the military units. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 28 military commanders. Results Four themes illustrate the influence of people with intellectual disabilities on the military units in which they work: (a) functioning of the military unit, (b) effect on other soldiers, (c) effect on commanders, and (d) effect on attitudes toward people with intellectual disabilities. Conclusions Results suggest that employing soldiers with intellectual disabilities has beneficial effects on both commanders and the military units, although some negative attitudes remain and merit interventions.

AB  - The present study investigated the effects of immersive exposure to other-race individuals on racial bias. In Study 1, we tracked African students (N = 85) who went to study at a Chinese university and thus experienced daily contact with Chinese individuals en masse for the first time. Using a cohort-sequential longitudinal design, we found that an implicit pro-Chinese racial bias emerged within 3 months after these students arrived in China, and that this bias remained stable for at least a year. In contrast, their explicit racial bias did not change. In Study 2, we assessed another group of African students (N = 47) at 1 month and at 3 months after their arrival in China, looking at not only their implicit and explicit racial bias, but also their intergroup contact quantity, intergroup contact quality, and intergroup friendship. We found that intergroup contact quantity and intergroup friendship predicted implicit but not explicit racial bias 2 months later. The findings suggest that immersive experiences with racial out-groups can have early and lasting effects on implicit racial bias.

AB  - Bias crime is crime that is motivated by prejudice or bias towards an attribute of the victim, such as race, religion or sexuality. Police have been criticised for failing to take bias crime seriously, and there is a pressing need to understand the reasons for this failure. This article aims to address this gap by presenting the results of the first empirical study of bias crime policing in the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW). Drawing on interviews with the NSW Police Force (NSWPF), the study found that sustainable reform in this domain has proven elusive. This can be attributed to a number of key challenges including reporting, recording, identification, framing, community engagement and leadership. The lessons that emerge from the findings have important ramifications for all police organisations.

AB  - This study tests the effects of the portrayal of negative consequences of alcohol use on beliefs and attitudes toward alcohol consumption. In a between-subjects experiment (N=108), participants were randomly assigned to watch one of three conditions. One group of participants watched a version of an edited episode of the reality program Jersey Shore in which alcohol use had negative consequences, another group watched a version of the episode in which alcohol use had more positive consequences, and a control group was not exposed to any program. Results showed that participants who saw the version with negative consequences had more negative beliefs about alcohol and more negative attitudes toward beer than participants who saw the more positive consequences and participants in the control condition. This indicates that the portrayal of negative consequences can have positive outcomes for viewers' health beliefs and attitudes, reducing their positivity toward alcohol use.

AB  - This study centers on an intervention that uses visual methods to structure conversations among teachers about their undocumented Latino/Latina immigrant students living in the US. Given negative perceptions of undocumented immigrants and cultural misunderstandings, recent demographic shifts have challenged many communities, and presented issues especially relevant to majority-culture teachers who teach immigrant students. We describe an innovative intervention methodology that incorporates photographs with facilitated discussion using Visual Thinking Strategies to promote awareness, empathy, and understanding. This study uses qualitative data to identify the ways in which images function to facilitate difficult discussions; to determine the relationship between images, facilitated discussion, and attitude shifts; and to determine whether such attitude shifts are schema changes. Findings show images effectively engage participants in discussion, elicit openness and reflection, and increase empathy. Indications of schema change derive from participants' descriptions of shifts in awareness, perspective-taking, attitude change, and more complex thinking about Latino/Latina immigrants.

AB  - Background The health and aged care workforce must understand and support the diverse needs of older people to enhance their care experience. We previously identified five principles of diversity training for this workforce: awareness of unconscious bias and prejudice; promotion of inclusion; access and equity; appropriate engagement; and intersectionality. This study aims to explore how these principles are considered from the perspectives of older Australians. Methods Older people (>= 65 years) receiving home care and nursing services based in Victoria, Australia were invited to participate in a home-based semi-structured interview about their experience of, or with, diversity. Interviews were thematically analysed using a priori categories based on our previous work on principles of diversity training, and themes were interpreted and expanded upon based on the participants' experiences and understanding of diversity concepts and their care needs. Results Fifteen older people (seven female, eight male), mean age 76 years (range 71-85 years), were interviewed. Five themes were drawn from the data. It was found that human connection through building (1) trust and rapport was highly valued as an approach by older people, crucial as a first step to understanding what is important to the older person. Identifying with (2) intersectionality, that is, the different intersecting aspects of who they are and their experiences was understood by the participants as an important framework to meet their needs. The participants were aware of (3) unconscious bias and prejudice by health professionals and its impact on their care. Participants also noted that (4) promotion of inclusion through language was important to for a positive relationship with the healthcare worker. The participants understood that to facilitate human connection, these four principles of human interaction were critical, underpinned by (5) access and equity of the system. A model articulating these relationships was developed. Conclusion Health and aged care training should incorporate the five diversity principles to support older people to participate in their own care.

AB  - 'Intersectional stigma' is a concept that has emerged to characterize the convergence of multiple stigmatized identities within a person or group, and to address their joint effects on health and wellbeing. While enquiry into the intersections of race, class, and gender serves as the historical and theoretical basis for intersectional stigma, there is little consensus on how best to characterize and analyze intersectional stigma, or on how to design interventions to address this complex phenomenon. The purpose of this paper is to highlight existing intersectional stigma literature, identify gaps in our methods for studying and addressing intersectional stigma, provide examples illustrating promising analytical approaches, and elucidate priorities for future health research.
   Evidence from the existing scientific literature, as well as the examples presented here, suggest that people in diverse settings experience intersecting forms of stigma that influence their mental and physical health and corresponding health behaviors. As different stigmas are often correlated and interrelated, the health impact of intersectional stigma is complex, generating a broad range of vulnerabilities and risks. Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods approaches are required to reduce the significant knowledge gaps that remain in our understanding of intersectional stigma, shared identity, and their effects on health.
   Stigmatized identities, while often analyzed in isolation, do not exist in a vacuum. Intersecting forms of stigma are a common reality, yet they remain poorly understood. The development of instruments and methods to better characterize the mechanisms and effects of intersectional stigma in relation to various health conditions around the globe is vital. Only then will healthcare providers, public health officials, and advocates be able to design health interventions that capitalize on the positive aspects of shared identity, while reducing the burden of stigma.

AB  - Background: People who identity as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) have specific health needs. Sexual orientation and gender identity are social determinants of health, as homophobia and heteronormativity persist as prejudices in society. LGBT patients often experience discrimination and prejudice in health care settings. While recent South African policies recognise the need for providing LGBT specific health care, no curricula for teaching about LGBT health related issues exist in South African health sciences faculties. This study aimed to determine the extent to which LGBT health related content is taught in the University of Cape Town's medical curriculum.
   Methods: A curriculum mapping exercise was conducted through an online survey of all academic staff at the UCT health sciences faculty, determining LGBT health related content, pedagogical methodology and assessment.
   Results: 127 academics, across 31 divisions and research units in the Faculty of Health Sciences, responded to the survey, of which 93 completed the questionnaire. Ten taught some content related to LGBT health in the MBChB curriculum. No LGBT health related content was taught in the allied health sciences curricula. The MBChB curriculum provided no opportunity for students to challenge their own attitudes towards LGBT patients, and key LGBT health topics such as safer sex, mental health, substance abuse and adolescent health were not addressed.
   Conclusion: At present, UCTs health sciences curricula do not adequately address LGBT specific health issues. Where LGBT health related content is taught in the MBChB curriculum, it is largely discretionary, unsystematic and not incorporated into the overarching structure. Coordinated initiatives to integrate LGBT health related content into all health sciences curricula should be supported, and follow an approach that challenges students to develop professional attitudes and behaviour concerning care for patients from LGBT backgrounds, as well as providing them with specific LGBT health knowledge. Educating health professions students on the health needs of LGBT people is essential to improving this population's health by providing competent and non-judgmental care.

AB  - In three experiments (N= 56, 99, and 225), we showed that racial phenotypicality bias characterizes educational expectations for Chilean mestizo students: participants displayed more positive educational expectations for light complexioned than for dark complexioned high school students. In Study 1, with male high school target students, the relation between racial phenotypic appearance and educational expectations was mediated by differences in perceived competence. Study 2 suggests that the gender of the target student did not influence the occurrence of racial phenotypicality bias. Study 3 showed that racial phenotypicality bias occurs in both university students and high school teachers' judgements. Although socioeconomic background of the target student partially explained the effects of racial phenotypic appearance (especially in teachers), the latter exerted an additional and independent influence on educational expectations. These results underline the fact that effects of racial phenotypicality bias should not be overlooked in the educational domain. As mediational analyses suggested, these effects only partly occur because of stereotypical associations between racial phenotypic appearance and socioeconomic background, but also because of stereotypical associations between racial phenotypic appearance and attributed competence.

AB  - Background: Childbirth with a skilled attendant is crucial for preventing maternal mortality and is an important opportunity for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. The Maternity in Migori and AIDS Stigma Study (MAMAS Study) is a prospective mixed-methods investigation conducted in a high HIV prevalence area in rural Kenya, in which we examined the role of women's perceptions of HIV-related stigma during pregnancy in their subsequent utilization of maternity services.
   Methods and Findings: From 2007-2009, 1,777 pregnant women with unknown HIV status completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire assessing their perceptions of HIV-related stigma before being offered HIV testing during their first antenatal care visit. After the visit, a sub-sample of women was selected for follow-up (all women who tested HIV-positive or were not tested for HIV, and a random sample of HIV-negative women, n = 598); 411 (69%) were located and completed another questionnaire postpartum. Additional qualitative in-depth interviews with community health workers, childbearing women, and family members (n = 48) aided our interpretation of the quantitative findings and highlighted ways in which HIV-related stigma may influence birth decisions. Qualitative data revealed that health facility birth is commonly viewed as most appropriate for women with pregnancy complications, such as HIV. Thus, women delivering at health facilities face the risk of being labeled as HIV-positive in the community. Our quantitative data revealed that women with higher perceptions of HIV-related stigma (specifically those who held negative attitudes about persons living with HIV) at baseline were subsequently less likely to deliver in a health facility with a skilled attendant, even after adjusting for other known predictors of health facility delivery (adjusted odds ratio = 0.44, 95% CI 0.22-0.88).
   Conclusions: Our findings point to the urgent need for interventions to reduce HIV-related stigma, not only for improving quality of life among persons living with HIV, but also for better health outcomes among all childbearing women and their families.

AB  - BackgroundMany Western countries have cervical cancer screening programmes and have implemented nation-wide human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination programmes for preventing cervical cancer.
   ObjectiveTo explore immigrant women's experiences and views on the prevention of cervical cancer, screening, HPV vaccination and condom use.
   DesignAn exploratory qualitative study. The Health Belief Model (HBM) was used as a theoretical framework.
   Setting and participantsEight focus group interviews, 5-8 women in each group (average number 6,5), were conducted with 50 women aged 18-54, who studied Swedish for immigrants. Data were analysed by latent content analysis.
   ResultsFour themes emerged: (i) deprioritization of women's health in home countries, (ii) positive attitude towards the availability of women's health care in Sweden, (iii) positive and negative attitudes towards HPV vaccination, and (iv) communication barriers limit health care access. Even though the women were positive to the prevention of cervical cancer, several barriers were identified: difficulties in contacting health care due to language problems, limited knowledge regarding the relation between sexual transmission of HPV and cervical cancer, culturally determined gender roles and the fact that many of the women were not used to regular health check-ups.
   ConclusionThe women wanted to participate in cervical cancer prevention programmes and would accept HPV vaccination for their daughters, but expressed difficulties in understanding information from health-care providers. Therefore, information needs to be in different languages and provided through different sources. Health-care professionals should also consider immigrant women's difficulties concerning cultural norms and pay attention to their experiences.

AB  - Although bisexual individuals are estimated to make up the largest percentage of sexual minority individuals, they tend to be the least visible and accepted members of LGBTQ+ communities. Negative attitudes and stereotypes about bisexual people can contribute to identity uncertainty and experiences of stigma and discrimination, which impact the disclosure of bisexual identity. This qualitative study sought to explore the factors that influence the decision to come out for bisexual individuals. Six participants (three cisgender women and three cisgender men) were interviewed. A grounded theory analysis was conducted. Themes culminated with a core category, revealing that the decision to come out as bisexual is based on the experiences of navigating contextual and psychological factors and weighing a desire to be authentic against perceived consequences of disclosure. Implications for those who identify as bisexual, for mental health clinicians working with bisexual clients, and for the general public are discussed.

TI  - CHARACTER ASSASSINATION: AMENDING FEDERAL RULE OF EVIDENCE 404(B) TO PROTECT CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS
T2  - COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - LAW
AB  - There is a war raging over the admissibility of the prior bad acts of criminal defendants in federal trials. While many circuits treat Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) as a rule of "inclusion" and liberally admit such prior bad-acts evidence with predictably explosive effects on criminal juries, a few circuits are developing rigorous standards designed to foreclose prosecutorial use of such bad-acts evidence. This Article chronicles the well-documented permissive admission of the prior bad acts of criminal defendants notwithstanding the prohibition on such evidence by Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b)(1), as well as recent efforts by some federal circuits to restrict such evidence. In light of these contemporary developments, the Judicial Conference Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules is currently considering amendments to Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) to restore the intended exclusionary purpose of the Rule. This Article details several drafting alternatives being considered by the Committee, as well as the likely costs and benefits of each, and proposes a simple and elegant fix for what ails Rule 404(b)-a more protective balancing test that admits the prior bad acts of criminal defendants only when their probative value outweighs any unfair prejudice to the defendant. Tipping the scale in favor of exclusion of prior bad-acts evidence would restore the protective purpose of Rule 404(b), while continuing to permit the government to admit such evidence in appropriate and necessary circumstances. This balance would bring Rule 404(b) into alignment with existing Federal Rule of Evidence 609, which allows the felony convictions of testifying criminal defendants to be admitted for impeachment purposes only when their probative value outweighs unfair prejudice. This Article takes on the thorny contemporary issues surrounding the admissibility of prior badacts evidence and identifies the optimal amendment to Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). This amendment would resolve the current conflict among the federal circuits and restore the prohibition on trial by character, which is a cornerstone of the American criminal process.

AB  - Reduced counterarguing - the generation of questions and arguments in response to a message - has been proposed to be a mechanism of persuasion in a variety of contexts, yet many questions remain unanswered regarding the factors that influence this process. Building upon past theorizing in narrative persuasion, this present work investigates whether signaling of persuasive intent (signaling vs. no signaling) and the fictional presentation of texts (fact vs. fiction) decrease counterarguing and, in turn, increase persuasion. Using a 2 x 2 factorial design across four topics at three time points, hypotheses were tested with narratives regarding four controversial political issues, presented either with or without signaling of persuasive intent and in either a news or short fiction format. The online experiment demonstrated that the narratives impacted political attitudes, even when captured in a later follow-up session. However, neither persuasive signaling nor fictional presentation influenced counterarguing or the extent of attitude change, captured both immediately after narrative exposure and again in a follow-up survey two days later.

AB  - Even in the turn toward justice-oriented pedagogy, computing education tends to overlook the quality of intergroup relationships, which risks entrenching division. In this article, we establish an intercultural approach to computing education, informed by intercultural and peace education, prejudice reduction, and the sociology of racism and ethnicity. We outline three major concerns of intercultural computing: shifting from content toward relationships, from cultural responsiveness to cultural reflexivity, and from identity to identification. For the last, we complicate discourses of race and identity widespread in U.S. education. Drawing from studies of youth programming classes in East Africa and U.S. contexts, we then reflect on our attempts to address the first shift of fostering relationships across difference. We highlight three promising design tactics: intergroup pairing, interdependent programming, and making relational goals explicit. Overall, we find that computing can indeed be a site of intergroup bonding across difference, but that bonding can carry complications and tensions with other equity goals and tactics. Rather than framing justice-oriented CS primarily as changes to the aims of computational learning, we argue that future work should explore making relational goals explicit and teach students how to attend to friction.

AB  - Existing research on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) youth homelessness identifies family rejection as a main pathway into homelessness for the youth. This finding, however, can depict people of color or poor people as more prejudiced than White, middle-class families. In this 18-month ethnographic study, the author complicates this rejection paradigm through documenting the narratives of 40 LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness. The author examines how poverty and family instability shaped the conditions that the youth perceived as their being rejected because of their gender and sexuality. This rejection generated strained familial ties within families wherein the ties were already fragile. Likewise, the author shows how being gender expansive marked many youth's experiences of familial abuse and strain. This study proposes the concept of conditional families to capture the social processes of how poverty and family instability shape experiences of gender, sexuality, and rejection for some LGBTQ youth.

AB  - For international and domestic actors, post-conflict peacebuilding is one of the most difficult policy are-nas to understand and in which to operate. Environmental and natural resource governance have the potential to facilitate peacebuilding in such contexts, but existing research has not yet produced a cohe-sive theoretical understanding of the pathways by which natural resource management strategies can facilitate positive peace. This paper explores the wider benefits of natural resource management and dis-cusses their potential for reducing political fragility in affected states and helping to build positive peace. The paper outlines three mechanisms through which improved natural resource governance in post-conflict contexts is theorized to have positive effects on peace: (a) the contact hypothesis, whereby the facilitation of intergroup cooperation reduces bias and prejudice; (b) the diffusion of transnational norms, where the introduction of environmental and other good governance norms supports human empower-ment and strengthens civil society; and (c) state service provision, where the provision of access to public services addresses the instrumental needs of communities, thereby strengthening their belief in the state. Guided by an interest in the opportunities presented by natural resource management to support peace -building processes in post-conflict states, the paper seeks to revise and advance the current environmen-tal peacebuilding research agenda.

AB  - Social workers are instrumental in the lives of many people with disabilities, yet despite a strong foundation for this relationship, there is a dearth of research exploring the experiences and attitudes of social work students toward people with disabilities. To bridge this gap, the current study surveyed graduate social work students to understand the influence of different attributes on student responses to people with disabilities, identify variability in student attitudes toward people with different disabilities, and identify factors that predict student attitudes toward people with disabilities. Results from 212 student respondents indicated that their self-identified level of knowledge differed by disability type and significantly predicted attitudes across disability types. In addition, gender differences emerged, with men having more negative attitudes than women toward people with disabilities. This study provides preliminary evidence suggesting the importance of disability type and the need for further dialogue and focus on disabilities in the profession.

AB  - Taking inspiration from assemblage thinking and the vitality of matter, this study examines the negotiated, contested and nonlinear formation of highly marginalised and stigmatised alternative food market. The analysis of an ethnographic case study shows that tensions of disorder, abjection and dangerisation spark when components of an alternative food market assemblage misaligns with prevailing social norms, values and institutional arrangements. Although these tensions threaten the alternative food market assemblage, further analysis reveals the capacity of food to assuage these tensions and this occurred, in part; because food catalyses human engagement through visceral encounters, bodily interactions and contagious magic. To that end, the study sets a new agenda for alternative market research to consider the sensory, corporeal and magical capacity of matter to provoke in humans a new sensitivity to our wasteful practices, endangered planet, social inequalities and prejudices.

AB  - Prior investigations have examined both traditional media (e.g., television news) and entertainment media (e.g., crime-related shows) on policing-related outcomes; however, less is known how contemporary forms of media, such as the Internet and social media, may affect policing-related outcomes. Using a sample of young adults, the current study examines the effect of multiple types of media consumption (traditional, entertainment, the Internet, and social media) on attitudes toward police legitimacy. Findings reveal that respondents who read news online are more likely to have negative attitudes toward police legitimacy. However, when individual differences are controlled for, the effect of reading news online is weakened and using social media becomes marginally significant. Further, the impact of media consumption on attitudes toward police legitimacy varies by key audience characteristics.

AB  - Social change does not always equal social progress-there is a dark side of social movements. We discuss conspiracy theory beliefs - beliefs that a powerful group of people are secretly working towards a malicious goal - as one contributor to destructive social movements. Research has linked conspiracy theory beliefs to anti-democratic attitudes, prejudice and non-normative political behavior. We propose a framework to understand the motivational processes behind conspiracy theories and associated social identities and collective action. We argue that conspiracy theories comprise at least two components - content and qualities-that appeal to people differently based on their motivations. Social identity motives draw people foremost to contents of conspiracy theories while uniqueness motives draw people to qualities of conspiracy theories.

AB  - As the sexual minority in China, transpersons remain faced with various realistic challenges. In recent years, however, there has been a significant progress made in the protection given to the rights that transpersons deserve. Currently, the citizens who have changed their gender through sex reassignment surgery can make applications to the local police station for changing their gender registration and get issued a new ID card. This is regarded as a crucial milestone in reducing the bias against transpersons and protecting their legitimate rights in China. Highlighted by the case of an extraordinary appraisee who have received SRS to change from male to female and started a new life with a new ID, not only does this article construe the current ID policy and the detailed process of ID card change for transpersons in China, it also reveals the living and developmental conditions facing transpersons in China. Finally, the visibility of the community of transpersons is improved to eradicate the discrimination against transpersons.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to explore the barriers to effective pain management in Iranian people with cancer.
   Design: A qualitative descriptive design was used.
   Methods: This qualitative descriptive study was performed on 14 people with cancer. Data were collected using semi-structured interviews and analysed by Graneheim and Lundman's content analysis method.
   Results: Four main categories emerged in relation to barriers to pain management from the perspective of people with cancer. Categories included 1) accepting and enduring divine pain, 2) negative attitudes towards the effectiveness of analgesics, 3) patients' low knowledge of pain self-management methods and 4) neglected pain management. Barriers to pain management are multidimensional in nature consisting of patients, healthcare providers and system components. Therefore, attempts should be focused on the education of patients and healthcare providers about pain management and eliminating the shortcomings of the healthcare system.

AB  - In May and June 2005, thousands of Zimbabweans were brutally displaced from urban areas. But 'Operation Murambatsvina' was not simply an unpredictable 'tsunami,' rather it provides a moment in which long-held prejudices and assumptions which shaped the developmental state became visible, reflecting not just the internalisation of the Rhodesian, modernist world-view, but also its imbrication with local understandings of home and home-ness. To see Murambatsvina as simply a politically expedient move is to miss the deep resonance of the political rhetoric, the ways it was embedded in the state, and how it is shaped by norms of citizenship. Contextualised against Harare's urban politics, the clearances reveal a long-standing set of policies designed to regulate and control urban life, forming part of a broader crisis of the post-colonial developmental state.

AB  - This article proposes that Nini Towong, a Javanese game involving a possessed doll, is an involution of fifth-century Chinese spirit-basket divination. The investigation is less concerned with originist theories than it is a discussion of the Chinese in Indonesia. The Chinese have been in Southeast Asia from at least as early as the Ming era, yet Chinese contributions to Indonesian culture is an understudied area. The problem begins with the asymmetrical privileging of Indic over Sinic influences in early European scholarship, a situation which in turn reveals the prejudices that the Europeans brought to bear in their dealings with the Chinese of Southeast Asia in the seventeenth to nineteenth century. Europeans introduced the Chinese-Jew analogy to the region. Their disdain contributed to indigenous hostility toward the Chinese. Racialism is a sensitive topic but a reminder of past injustices provides a timely warning in this moment of tense world geopolitics.

AB  - Postpartum depression (PPD), a common mental health problem among mothers worldwide, is higher among minority women. However, little is known about barriers faced by minority women when accessing mental health care services (MHCS) for PPD treatment. Drawing on McLeroy etal (Health Education Quartely 15: 351, 1988) ecological model, the current study explores barriers to mental health services among pregnant and postpartum minority Bedouin women in southern Israel. We conducted eight focus groups (FGs) in Arabic with 75 Bedouin women recruited using snowball sampling. Participants completed a socio-demographic questionnaire at each FG. Discussions were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Next, we conducted simultaneous thematic analysis and coded transcripts into conceptual categories based on the ecological model. We found multiple barriers that manifest at different levels (individual, family, organisational, economic, and public policy) and interact to limit Bedouin women's access to PPD treatment. At the individual level, factors included: women's negative attitudes toward PPD, women's societal status, grand multipara, gender, and limited knowledge about PPD; at the family level: low awareness among husbands and other family members regarding PPD symptoms and treatment, and lack of social support; at the organisational level: lack of culturally appropriate (health care services) HCSs, lack of PPD screening, and lack of PPD detection by family physicians; at the community level: economic barriers and poverty, stigmatisation of mental health problems, polygamy, and multiple births; finally, at the public policy level: residence in unrecognised villages lacking basic infrastructure. Our study thus sheds light on multilevel barriers impacting PPD prevention and treatment among Bedouin women. Policies and intervention programmes should seek to remove these barriers and protect Bedouin women and their children from the consequences of PPD.

AB  - Background. Kidney transplantation (KT) is now the preferred renal replacement therapy in suitable patients with end-stage renal disease but organ availability is a major limiting factor.
   Aims. To evaluate the willingness of caregivers (CGs) and healthcare workers (HWs) to donate a kidney and possible motivating factors in our setting.
   Methods. This cross-sectional study was done at Mother and Child Hospital, Kidney Care Centre Ondo and Babcock University Teaching Hospital, all in Southern Nigeria. Participants' willingness to donate a kidney was assessed using Likert and Visual Analogue Scales (VAS). The data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Student t test was used to compare weighted mean scores. Multivariate analysis done; P < .05 was taken as significant.
   Results. A total of 563 CGs and HWs took part in the study. Sixty percent of them were aware of kidney donation (KD) but only 43.7% had a favorable attitude towards it, and these were predominantly HWs (63.4% vs 33.1%, P < .001). A quarter of the participants were adequately willing to donate a kidney; HWs were significantly more willing than CGs (45.4% vs 15.8%, P < .001). On VAS, the mean willingness score of HWs was higher than that of CGs (t = 7.13, P < .001). Factors strongly influencing the willingness of CGs to donate include their educational level (P = .028, OR = 4.86, 95% CI: 1.19-19.91) social class (P = .012, OR = 6.17 95% CI: 1.5-24.8) and having a relative with kidney disease (P = .019; OR = 3.07 95% CI: 1.25-12.00). Willingness correlated with awareness of KD among CGs (r = 0.534, P < .001).
   Conclusion. There is a low level of willingness alongside negative attitudes toward kidney donation among our participants.

AB  - The paper questions some of the premises in studying academic spin-offs in developed countries, claiming that when taken as characteristics of 'academic spin-offs per se,' they are of little help in understanding the phenomenon in the Eastern European countries during the transitional and post-transitional periods after 1989. It argues for the necessity of adopting a path-dependent approach, which takes into consideration the institutional and organisational specificities of local economies and research systems and their evolution, which strongly influence the patterns of spin-off activity. The paper provides new findings and original arguments in support of Balazs' seminal theses (Balazs 1995, 1996) about the emergence of academic spin-offs during the early transition. It reveals key economic and policy mechanisms bearing on academic entrepreneurship in Eastern Europe, such as the tensions between economic and political nomenclatures of former Communist Parties, where the dismantling or preservation of the power of political nomenclature resulted in different patterns of development-rapid reforms in the 'first wave' of EU accession countries or the establishment of rent-seeking and assets-stripping economies in countries like Bulgaria and Romania, making the transition period especially difficult. In the latter, a specific economic environment emerged, unknown in Western Europe and in the 'champions' of transition-such as suppression of the authentic entrepreneurship in a number of economic sectors, disintegration of corporate structures, etc. Thus, the paper reveals the common ground behind the two conflicting tendencies in post-socialist academic spin-offs, partially outlined in other research (Simeonova 1995; Pavlova 2000): as an authentic form of academic entrepreneurship grasping the opportunities opened up by the economic crisis and compensating failures in science and technology policy on the one hand, and as specific rent-seeking strategy draining valuable public assets on the other (the latter, in turn, boosting the negative attitudes in local scientific communities). The paper provides new findings about the evolution of the academic spin-offs in Bulgaria along the two polar trends and their positive and negative repercussions on parent research institutions. The results were achieved in the PROKNOW Project, EC 6th Framework Program.

AB  - Although people often are aware of the importance of adopting environmentally friendly lifestyles, they might be reluctant to do so as they believe that their actions do not make a difference (i.e. low response efficacy). Furthermore, they might experience reactance (e.g. negative attitudes) towards environmental messages that encourage them to adopt an environmentally friendly lifestyle. Therefore we experimentally tested whether it is possible to stimulate people to adopt an environmentally friendly lifestyle (i.e. recycle more clothing) by using visual impact metaphors that convey the message that old clothes deserve a new life. The findings show that a message in the form of a visual impact metaphor (vs. no visual impact metaphor) results in more positive attitudes towards recycling and stronger recycling intentions. This effect was mediated by two different underlying mechanisms: Response efficacy and more positive attitudes towards the persuasive attempt (i.e. positive evaluative persuasion knowledge).

AB  - In the last decade, the phenomenal growth of Zimbabwean congregations in Britain, responding to conditions in both the hostland and homeland, has received little scholarly attention. This article, drawing from an in-depth study of Zimbabwean Christians and the modes-of-incorporation framework, examines the ways in which the context of reception in the hostland shape, alter and influence the development of religious transnationalism among migrants. As this article will argue, Zimbabweans' mode of incorporation into Britain was mediated by a hostile reception from authorities, considerable prejudice and hostility from the host society and a weak pre-existing co-ethnic community. These conditions in the hostland reinforce migrants' transnational religious ties to the homeland. In addition, the article illustrates the contradictory ways in which respondents reproduce, contest and construct their transnational gendered identities.

AB  - It is a commonplace in Genocide Studies to say that 'Turkey denies the Armenian genocide'. The Turkish state's official policy towards the Armenian genocide was and is indeed characterized by misrepresentation, mystification and manipulation. But when one gauges what place the Armenian genocide occupies in the social memory of Turkish society, even after nearly a century, a different picture emerges. Even though most direct eyewitnesses to the crime have passed away, oral history interviews yield important insights. Elderly Turks and Kurds in Eastern Turkey often hold vivid memories from family members or fellow villagers who witnessed or participated in the genocide. This article is based on interviews conducted with (grand)children of eyewitnesses to the Armenian genocide. The research suggests there is a clash between official state memory and popular social memory: the Turkish government is denying a genocide that its own population remembers.

AB  - While it is clear that self-reported racial/ethnic discrimination is related to illness, there are challenges in measuring self-reported discrimination or unfair treatment. In the present study, we evaluate the psychometric properties of a self-reported instrument across racial/ethnic groups in a population-based sample, and we test and interpret findings from applying two different widely-used approaches to asking about discrimination and unfair treatment. Even though we found that the subset of items we tested tap into a single underlying concept, we also found that different groups are more likely to report on different aspects of discrimination. Whether race is mentioned in the survey question affects both frequency and mean scores of reports of racial/ethnic discrimination. Our findings suggest caution to researchers when comparing studies that have used different approaches to measure racial/ethnic discrimination and allow us to suggest practical empirical guidelines for measuring and analyzing racial/ethnic discrimination. No less important, we have developed a self-reported measure of recent racial/ethnic discrimination that functions well in a range of different racial/ethnic groups and makes it possible to compare how racial/ethnic discrimination is associated with health disparities among multiple racial/ethnic groups.

AB  - Objective: Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal disorder and characterized by dysmorphic features, intellectual disability and frequent developmental abnormalities. Though the syndrome is a lifetime health issue for society, the awareness of our community on the syndrome is not sufficient.
   Methods: This study is planned to define the level of awareness of our population on simple Down syndrome facts. A questionnaire consisting sociodemographic characteristics of the participants and Down syndrome facts was applied to 283 randomly selected participants.
   Results: The majority of the participants (89.8%) have heard of Down syndrome and 70% of the participants were aware that Down syndrome can be diagnosed during pregnancy. Even though less than half of them (42.4%) was clued in frequent association of congenital malformations with the syndrome, more participants (55.1%) knew that the advanced maternal age was a risk factor. There were statisticially significant differences between different sociodemographic groups on awareness of particular subjects.
   Conclusion: Even though the certain demographics were well informed about the syndrome, there are still excessive amount of prejudice against Trisomy 21 patients; and therefore, more social projects are needed to raise the awareness.

AB  - Attitudes toward homosexuality are complex. To get a comprehensive view on the attitudes of people, different dimensions need to be included in research. Based on a review of the literature, we distinguish five dimensions: acceptance of homosexuality in a general sense; attitude toward equal rights; reactions to homosexuality oat close quarterso; reactions to homosexuality in public; and so-called modern homonegativity. In a study on a representative sample of Dutch Defence personnel (N = 1,607) we tested this model. Structural equation modeling of several items measuring the attitude toward homosexuality offers a six factor solution. These six factors are more or less comparable to the five dimensions we distinguished. The dimension oreactions to homosexuality at close quarterso is, however, empirically split in a dimension on affective reactions to homosexuality and homosexual persons in general and a dimension on affective reaction to homosexual friends or acquaintances.

AB  - The current research explores how local racial diversity affects Whites' efforts to structure their local communities to avoid incidental intergroup contact. In two experimental studies (N = 509; Studies 1a-b), we consider Whites' choices to structure a fictional, diverse city and find that Whites choose greater racial segregation around more (vs. less) self-relevant landmarks (e.g., their workplace and children's school). Specifically, the more time they expect to spend at a landmark, the more they concentrate other Whites around that landmark, thereby reducing opportunities for incidental intergroup contact. Whites also structure environments to reduce incidental intergroup contact by instituting organizational policies that disproportionately exclude non-Whites: Two largescale archival studies (Studies 2a-b) using data from every U.S. tennis (N =15,023) and golf (N =10,949) facility revealed that facilities in more racially diverse communities maintain more exclusionary barriers (e.g., guest policies, monetary fees, dress codes) that shield the patrons of these historically White institutions from incidental intergroup contact. In a final experiment (N = 307; Study 3), we find that Whites' anticipated intergroup anxiety is one driver of their choices to structure environments to reduce incidental intergroup contact in more (vs. less) racially diverse communities. Our results suggest that despite increasing racial diversity, White Americans structure local environments to fuel a self-perpetuating cycle of segregation.

AB  - Aims Driven by the literature on pluralistic ignorance, our research investigates fear of appearing racist, being rejected, discriminated, and disinterest in intergroup contact as antecedents of contact and outgroup attitudes, focusing on attributional differences between the majority and minority group perspectives.
   Methods Questionnaires were distributed in schools in Northern Italy. Participants were 400 Italian and 141 immigrant high-school students.
   Results The results showed that the lack of interest in contact was the strongest predictor of contact for the majority group. For the minority group, fear of rejection emerged as the strongest predictor. The majority group attributed the minority to avoid contact most strongly due to the fear that they would be rejected, and the minority group perceived it was due to the majority not being interested in contact.
   Conclusion Our research contributes to understanding the divergent concerns the majority and minority groups have in relation to intergroup contact and discusses the importance of tackling these concerns.

AB  - Volatile economic, demographic and political trends have severe implications for human service organizations (HSOs). Restricted governmental budgets threaten HSOs? funding and negative attitudes toward science threaten HSOs? evidence-based practices. A ray of light in this bleak context is the emergence of the social good movement that coalesces grassroots organizations, NGOs, governmental agencies, businesses, and philanthropists who are motivated to improve the lives of others. Social good refers to ?individual, community and societal well-being in the domains of environmental justice, inclusion, and peace, achieved by engaging unconventional systems and utilizing innovative technologies, aiming to promote social justice?. This paper: (a) examines contextual social forces challenging HSOs; (b) defines social good and its theoretical underpinnings; (c) presents an original model of social good and its relevance to HSOs; (d) introduces a framework for guiding future research in HSOs; and, (e) examines implications for practices, policies, and future research.

AB  - Objectives The aim of our study was to investigate the knowledge, perceptions and attitudes of female Romanian university students, as possible future opinion leaders, about contraception and motherhood, by assessing their level of contraceptive use, opinions and knowledge with regard to combined oral contraceptives (COCs).
   Methods A knowledge, attitudes and practice questionnaire was conducted among 1105 female university students aged 19 to 30 years. The participants were recruited from six faculties at universities in Iasi and Arad, Romania. The study protocol was approved by the university ethics committees. Statistical analyses included percentages, (2) tests and Fisher's exact test.
   Results Two-thirds of respondents were in a relationship or married. Average age at first sexual intercourse was 18.6 years. Two out of three (69%) students identified themselves as sexually active. The same percentage showed a positive attitude towards contraception and stated that they used it. The most commonly used contraceptive methods were condoms, COCs and withdrawal. The students' perceptions of the benefits and adverse effects of COCs were analysed. Half of the students had heard about extended COC regimens, but only 24% showed interest in using them regularly. A large proportion of pharmacy and non-medical students appeared to have poor knowledge about contraception and reproductive health, which generated misperceptions and negative attitudes. Two-thirds of the participants considered 25 to 29 years to be the optimal age for starting a family, and 85.5% intended to have children in the future.
   Conclusions Medical students, but not pharmacy students, showed higher levels of knowledge. Improvement of students' knowledge, perceptions and attitudes towards general contraceptive use, COCs and childbearing is needed. Evidence-based information is required to address poor knowledge about the physiology of reproduction, misconceptions relating to COCs, and the possibility of menstrual suppression using hormonal contraceptive methods. Compulsory reproductive health education for students is desirable.

AB  - Locker rooms operate as pivotal access points to physical activity across sports, physical education, and fitness facilities. However, locker rooms are predicated on cis-heterosexual assumptions that can be isolating to LGBTQ+ individuals. Using an online cross-sectional survey, LGBTQ+ adults (N = 1,067) were asked open-response questions about their past and present locker-room experiences. The resulting texts were independently coded by two researchers using thematic analysis and compared. All discrepancies were discussed with and rectified by a third researcher who acted as a critical peer. The results present distinct experiences across three intersecting aspects of embodiment: self-conscious-"I hate(d) being seen," sexual transgression, and gender transgression. The findings provide insight into how harmful LGBTQ+ stereotypes influence lockerroom experiences and support the redesign of locker rooms to challenge the binary organization of these spaces.

AB  - Stereotype Embodiment Theory (SET) implies that people who hold negative attitudes towards the elderly are more likely to experience a decline in various cognitive/physical functions themselves. Anti-elderly discriminatory attitudes, which negatively affect the elderly's health status, could be reduced by communicating the contents of SET to non-elderly people. To weaken anti-elderly discriminatory attitudes, in Study 1, we had participants read about SET and related empirical findings (SET intervention), which intended to increase their self-interested motives for avoiding anti-elderly discrimination. In Study 2, we conducted an 'integrated intervention' containing a SET intervention and one selected aspect of educational intervention (i.e., presenting some information about some commonly misunderstood aspects of the elderly). Consequently, the integrated/SET interventions reduced participants' anti-elderly discriminatory attitudes and these effects persisted for at least 1 week. Our new interventions will be useful for those who work with the elderly.

AB  - The present study develops and empirically tests a parsimonious new multiple-item scale to measure consumers' propensities to adopt new technologies. We show that a consumer's likelihood to embrace new technologies can reliably be measured by a 14-item index that combines assessments of consumers' positive and negative attitudes towards technology. Consistent with prior work on technology readiness, we show four distinct dimensions of consumers' technology adoption propensity: two inhibiting factors, dependence and vulnerability, and two contributing factors, optimism and proficiency. We develop the index on a cross-sectional dataset of U.S. consumers then establish the validity of each of the four component scales on two dissimilar validation sets. The resulting index shows sound psychometric properties and may be used by researchers interested in the antecedents or effects of each of the independent sub-scales. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Therapists' forced transition to provide psychotherapy remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity to examine therapists' views and challenges with online therapy. This study aimed to investigate the main challenges experienced by therapists during the transition from in-person to online therapy at the beginning of the pandemic and 3 months later, and the association between these challenges and therapists' perception of the quality of the relationship with their online patients, and therapists' attitudes and views about online therapy and its efficacy at these two timepoints. As part of a large-scale international longitudinal survey, we collected data from 1,257 therapists at two timepoints: at the start of COVID-19, when many therapists switched from providing in-person therapy to online therapy, as well as 3 months later, when they had had the opportunity to adjust to the online therapy format. At both timepoints, therapists reported on perceived challenges, quality of working alliance and real relationship, attitudes toward online therapy, and their views on online therapy's efficacy compared to in-person therapy. Factor analysis of individual survey items at both timepoints identified four different types of challenges among this therapist sample: Emotional connection (feeling connected with patients, reading emotions, express or feel empathy), Distraction during sessions (therapist or patient), Patients' privacy (private space, confidentiality), and Therapists' boundaries (professional space, boundary setting). Older and more experienced therapists perceived fewer challenges in their online sessions. At baseline, all four types of challenges were associated with lower perceived quality of the therapeutic relationship (working alliance and real relationship), and more negative attitudes toward online therapy and its efficacy. After 3 months, perceived challenges with three domains - Emotional connection, Patients' privacy, and Therapists' boundaries significantly decreased - whereas challenges in the fourth domain - Distraction - increased. In our study, therapists' concerns about being able to connect with patients online appeared to be the most impactful, in that it predicted negative attitudes toward online therapy and its perceived efficacy 3 months later, above and beyond the effect of therapists' age and clinical experience. Clinical and training implications are discussed.

AB  - Persons with HIV who develop depression have worse medical adherence and outcomes. Poor patient-provider communication may play a role in these outcomes. This cross-sectional study evaluated the influence of patient depression on the quality of patient-provider communication. Patient-provider visits (n=406) at four HIV care sites were audio-recorded and coded with the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS). Negative binomial and linear regressions using generalized estimating equations tested the association of depressive symptoms, as measured by the Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression scale (CES-D), with RIAS measures and postvisit patient-rated quality of care and provider-reported regard for his or her patient. The patients, averaged 45 years of age (range =20-77), were predominately male (n=286, 68.5%), of black race (n=250, 60%), and on antiretroviral medications (n=334, 80%). Women had greater mean CES-D depression scores (12.0) than men (10.6; p=0.03). There were no age, race, or education differences in depression scores. Visits with patients reporting severe depressive symptoms compared to those reporting none/mild depressive symptoms were longer and speech speed was slower. Patients with severe depressive symptoms did more emotional rapport building but less social rapport building, and their providers did more data gathering/counseling (ps<0.05). In postvisit questionnaires, providers reported lower levels of positive regard for, and rated more negatively patients reporting more depressive symptoms (p<0.01). In turn, patients reporting more depressive symptoms felt less respected and were less likely to report that their provider knows them as a person than none/mild depressive symptoms patients (ps<0.05). Greater psychosocial needs of patients presenting with depressive symptoms and limited time/resources to address these needs may partially contribute to providers' negative attitudes regarding their patients with depressive symptoms. These negative attitudes may ultimately serve to adversely impact patient-provider communication and quality of HIV care.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the adverse effects of descriptive norms in the context of disaster preparation, although the cumulative evidence has demonstrated that descriptive norms desirably promote social behavior. Descriptive norms inevitably inform that some people do not prepare; therefore, the secondary meaning can be utilized to confirm the receiver's already possessed attitudes, and it results in a backfire. We conducted two preregistered experiments examining preparation behaviors for natural disasters while manipulating descriptive norms. In Study 1 (N = 262), the only promotive effect of descriptive norms was obtained among U.S. participants. In Study 2 (N = 329), when replicated with a sample of Japanese participants, participants' attitudes moderated the effects of descriptive norms. The patterns of moderation were consistent with our prediction and suggested that descriptive norms suppressed the desirable behavior when participants held negative attitudes. The pitfalls of descriptive normative approaches are also practically important.

AB  - This article identifies the moral premises of contemporary business ethics. After analyzing thirty business ethics texts, the article shows that many business ethicists hold the conventional view that being moral is altruistic. This altruistic perspective logically implies a negative evaluation of self-interest and the profit motive, and business. As a result, the prevailing attitude in mainstream business ethics is that without altruistic restraints businesspeople are inclined to lie, steal, and cheat, not create and earn wealth through honest production and voluntary trade. Therefore, the central concern in current business ethics is to curb businesspeople morally, not to empower them in their self-interested desire to make money. In the final analysis, the article shows how the anti-egoist assumptions manifest themselves in a moral prejudice against business, leading to a biased, unfair, and misleading account of the business world.

AB  - Surveys indicate that belief in conspiracy theories is widespread. Previous studies have indicated that such beliefs are related to agreeableness, low levels of self esteem, certain negative attitudes towards authority, and paranoia. The current study investigated the relationship between conspiracy theory beliefs, paranormal belief, paranoid ideation, and schizotypy, in a study involving 60 females and 60 males aged 18-50. Sex differences were found in paranormal belief, with females scoring significantly higher than males in spiritualism, precognition, psi, and overall paranormal belief. Partial correlations controlling for sex showed that conspiracy beliefs were significantly and positively correlated with paranormal beliefs, paranoid ideation and schizotypy. Confirmatory analysis revealed a best fit model to explain conspiracy beliefs that included schizotypy and paranoid ideation, but not paranormal beliefs. These findings suggest that paranoid ideation and schizotypy are strongly associated with belief in conspiracy theories. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Traditional studies of attitude change have focused on attempts between strangers, but what about in close relationships? The present article examines whether accuracy regarding a partner's meta-attitudinal bases can influence persuasion attempts. Because meta-bases reflect information-processing goals, we hypothesized that given partners with more affective meta-bases, greater accuracy regarding partners' meta-bases would predict use of emotional advocacies and their perceived persuasiveness. Self and partner ratings of meta-bases were assessed, and emotional advocacies as well as cognitive ones were provided to participants to present to their partners. Results revealed that the correspondence between perceptions of partner's affective meta-bases and use of emotional advocacies was greater among those whose partners rated themselves as having more affective meta-bases compared to those whose partners rated themselves as having less affective meta-bases. Results remained significant when controlling for perceived similarity. Implications of meta-bases for understanding interpersonal influence are discussed.

AB  - Since its development, deep learning has been quickly incorporated into the field of medicine and has had a profound impact. Since 2017, many studies applying deep learning-based diagnostics in the field of orthopedics have demonstrated outstanding performance. However, most published papers have focused on disease detection or classification, leaving some unsatisfactory reports in areas such as segmentation and prediction. This review introduces research published in the field of orthopedics classified according to disease from the perspective of orthopedic surgeons, and areas of future research are discussed. This paper provides orthopedic surgeons with an overall understanding of artificial intelligence-based image analysis and the information that medical data should be treated with low prejudice, providing developers and researchers with insight into the real-world context in which clinicians are embracing medical artificial intelligence.

AB  - American Indians are disproportionately affected by factors that lead to health disparities, however many Native people demonstrate resilience when faced with health risks. Study objectives were to use a resilience framework to identify wellness strategies among American Indian people and to assess health care provider perceptions of American Indian wellness. Participants included 39 American Indian adults who self-reported resilient change and 22 health care providers who served American Indian patients. Thematic categories across American Indian and health care provider data were identified: 1) relationships inform resilience; 2) prejudice stymies resilience; and 3) place shapes resilience. Results indicated the salience of relationships in demonstrating resilience. Identified challenges and supporters of resilience are discussed.

AB  - Group interventions for mental health have proved very effective, but there is little consensus on their mechanism of action. In the present study, we posit that normative change is a plausible mechanism and provide a test of this in an eating disorder prevention group program. Participants were 112 women aged 15-25 years with body, shape or weight concerns who completed five questionnaires across the four session group-based intervention. Results indicated that participants experienced a significant reduction in thin-ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction and dieting intentions across the course of the program. These decrements were preceded by changes in group norms. Changes in both descriptive norms and injunctive norms in the first half of the program predicted improvement in thin-ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction and dieting intentions in the second half. Implications for theoretical models of attitude change are discussed, as well as implications for group interventions more generally. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study aimed at evaluating residents' attitudes towards the contribution of cultural tourism to the social welfare of the local rural residents participating in cultural tourism activities by factoring gender and level of education as possible differentiating factors in residents' attitudes. Based on survey of local people in northern part of Tanzania, a questionnaire was administered that yielded data that were subjected to a series of t-tests. The results indicate residents to have both positive and negative attitudes towards the contribution of cultural tourism. Gender differences are noted to relate with cultural tourism participation and attitudes towards the contribution of cultural tourism. Females benefit more from cultural tourism than males in economic terms. Having education raises the chances of locals having a more positive attitude towards cultural tourism. From the results, implications to facilitators in cultural tourism to further aid tourism contribution to the locals are derived.

AB  - Little is known about how researchers in higher education institutions (HEIs) experience and respond to support received from their departments. The present study investigated how support for researchers' autonomy (choice and self-expression), relatedness (through connections with colleagues) and competence (feeling effective in one's work) influenced their attitudes towards an external assessment of research. To do so, we surveyed 598 academics from four HEIs in the UK about their attitudes towards one such external assessment: the Research Excellence Framework (REF), a nationwide assessment of research quality and the subject of debate about research evaluation. Our findings, drawing on self-determination theory, show that departments can shape responses to the REF: individuals whose psychological needs were supported by their academic departments held more positive, and less negative, attitudes towards the REF. This occurred both directly and indirectly through researchers' recognition that the REF had a more positive influence on their research activities and outputs.

FX  - This work was funded in part by HEFCE (Higher Education Funding Council for England, now Research England), the organisation previously responsible for managing the REF exercise. Conclusions made may therefore be susceptible to a bias through a conflict of interests. It was part of a larger project wherein members of Research England included questions of importance to them (e.g., testing academics' awareness of various aspects of the REF structure and where they receive information about the REF), and the academic research team included questions of interest to them (e.g., the ones presented here). Members of Research England were instrumental in research strategy and approach. However, they did not demand certain phrasing be used or delete items, and Research England has not contributed to the primary analyses presented in this paper or the writing of it. The research team itself represents diverse attitudes towards the REF.

AB  - Research suggests that hearing an outgroup member voice internal criticism increases individuals' openness to the outgroup's perspective. We replicate and extend these findings in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israeli participants exposed to a Palestinian official voicing internal criticism reported more openness to the Palestinian narrative of the conflict, an effect that was mediated by an increase in participants' perception that Palestinians are open-minded and a subsequent increase in their hope for more positive relations between the two groups. In our extension of these findings, we examined a complementary mechanism contributing to the effectiveness of the criticism manipulation, specifically the extent to which participants perceive that the Palestinian official took a risk voicing criticism of Palestinians. Positive messages from a hostile outgroup may be received with suspicion, but if they are articulated under great risk to the speaker, greater credibility may be granted. Across two studies, we demonstrate that the criticism conveys risk to the speaker and that this risk is predictive of the perceived credibility of the speaker, and participants' subsequent openness to the outgroup's perspective.

AB  - Although individuals have a whole arsenal of resistance strategies they can use to defend their attitude against a persuasion attack, resistance has often been simplified to counterarguing. This article advances previous studies by considering eight distinct resistance strategies and analyzing their isolated and intertwined effect on attitude change. We further ask under what circumstances they work most effectively to curb persuasion by looking at their interaction with cognitive elaboration - that is, thoughtful and systematic processing. We present new evidence from a study conducted on a sample of American citizens (N = 528) and use a quasi-experimental design in which respondents are exposed to a tailored counterargument on a political issue. The results suggest that it is not the use of the isolated resistance strategies but that it is overall effort individuals put into resisting that help them to defend their attitude, and that this effect is reinforced by cognitive elaboration.

Background There is a lack of knowledge about implementing technologies in NHs and the ethical challenges that might arise. In past studies, nursing care teams expressed the need for technologies offering clinical support. Technologies like an IVS and an app could prove useful in NHs to prevent and manage falls and responsive behaviours. Design An exploratory qualitative study was conducted with care managers, family caregivers and formal caregivers in five NHs. Methods Each participant was shown a presentation of a potential app and a short video on an IVS. It was followed by an individual semi-structured interview. A conventional content analysis was performed. Findings Potential users found it would be possible to implement these technologies in NHs even if resistance could be expected. To facilitate adoption and achieve clinical benefits, the implementation of technologies should be pilot-tested, and coaching activities should be planned. Ethical risks were considered already present in NHs even without technologies, for example, risks to privacy. Strategies were proposed, for instance, to adapt the code of ethics and procedures. Some potential prejudices about the interest and abilities of older staff, nurses' aides, and family caregivers to use technology were identified. Conclusions Through rigorous and ethical implementation, technologies supporting clinical care processes could benefit older people living in NHs, as well as their relatives and the staff. Implications for practice Various strategies are proposed to successfully implement technologies. Effort should be made to avoid prejudices during implementation, and procedures should be adapted to mitigate possible ethical challenges.

AB  - Objectives: Evaluate the relationship between race, perceptions of personally mediated racism and health outcomes in the Massachusetts Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS).
   Methods: Regression analysis of 8,266 respondents to the Reactions to Race module in 2006 and 2008. Questions assessing personally mediated racism were combined to measure perceptions of reactions to race.
   Outcome Measures: Adjusted odds ratios and 95% CI of perceived personally mediated racism, self-reported overall health, life satisfaction, health risks (smoking status, obesity, binge and heavy drinking), and preventive services (colonoscopy, flu vaccine).
   Results: Black non-Hispanic respondents are 10.4 times (95% CI: 6.3-17.3; P<.001) and Hispanics 5.8 times 195% CI: 3.6-9.4; P<.001) more likely to report being treated worse than other races compared to White non-Hispanic respondents. Respondents of all races reporting being treated worse than other races are 3.2 times (95% CI: 1.9-5.4; P<.001) more likely to have fair/poor health and 4.1 times (95% CI: 2.1-7.9; P<.001) more likely to report life dissatisfaction than those treated the same or better than other races. There is no statistically significant association between perceived personally mediated racism and health risks or preventive services tested.
   Conclusions: Perceptions of personally mediated racism are significantly associated with fair/poor overall health and life dissatisfaction, but none of the health risks or preventive services tested. (Ethn Dis. 2012;22[4]:492-496)

AB  - This article tests a longitudinal model of the antecedents and consequences of changes in identification with indigenous (Mapuche) among indigenous and nonindigenous youth in Chilean school contexts over a 6-month period (633 nonindigenous and 270 Mapuche students, M-ages = 12.47 and 12.80 years, respectively). Results revealed that in-group norms supporting contact and quality of intergroup contact at Time 1 predicted student's changes in Mapuche identification at Time 2, which in turn predicted changes in support for adoption of Chilean culture and maintenance of Mapuche culture at Time 2; some of the relationships between these variables were found to be moderated by age and ethnicity. Conceptual and policy implications are addressed in the Discussion.

AB  - Previous studies have distinguished cognitive, occupational status and network mechanisms in the relation between education and ethnocentrism. Hypotheses on these mediating mechanisms are derived from socialization theory, realistic group threat and contact theory. In the current study we use structural equation modeling to investigate the explanatory power of these three mechanisms simultaneously. The analysis is based on a representative population survey from the Netherlands (NELLS 2009, n = 1910). The results show that more than half of the initial association between education and ethnocentrism can be attributed to cognitive ability and occupational status mechanisms. The remaining part of the overall association, however, still has to be modeled as a direct relationship between education and ethnocentrism. This direct association can be attributed either to social desirability or to a direct liberalizing effect of education on social and political attitudes. Our analysis tentatively suggests that the rise of average education levels in Western societies might lead to less ethnocentric attitudes via the cognitive sophistication mechanism.

AB  - Featuring an online experiment and content analysis of a research sample of 185 participants with different races/ethnicities, this study investigates how bridging and bonding capital online and offline (a) encourage targets of racial discrimination to seek support, (b) buffer targets' emotional distress, and (c) facilitate assertive coping behaviors. Hierarchical regressions indicate individuals bridging with a wider range of interpersonal networks offline are more likely to seek support than those with fewer bridging ties. Online bonding helps buffer emotional distress when targets perceive the prejudiced acts encountered as less severe. Maintaining connections with diverse people offline also helps targets cope with racial discrimination assertively when the supportive messages received fail to fully validate their feelings. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Objective: to examine changes in midwives' attitudes to their professional role following the introduction of midwifery group practice (MGP) (a case load model of midwifery continuity of care provided to women of all risk levels) and to explore aspects of the model that were working well and those that were not working well.
   Design: the questionnaire 'Attitudes to Professional Role' was used to measure midwives' satisfaction in terms of professional satisfaction, professional support, client interaction, and professional development. Open-ended questions were also included to offer an opportunity for midwives to expand on their experiences of working in the MGP model. The questionnaire was administered at five time points over the 18-month evaluation period. Round 1 was prior to the implementation of MGP, Rounds 2-4 were at three-month intervals, with Round 5 six months later. Analysis of the structured part of the questionnaire was undertaken by comparing mean scores of satisfaction ranging from -2 (very negative attitudes) to +2(very positive attitudes), and the open-ended questions were analysed using qualitative content analysis.
   Setting: the Women's and Children's Hospital, Adelaide, South Australia.
   Participants: questionnaires were distributed to all midwives(n = 15) working in MGP in Rounds 1,2 and 3, and to the 12 midwives remaining from the original sample in Rounds 4 and 5. Fourteen questionnaires were returned in Round1, 12 in Round 2, 10 in Round 3, nine in Round 4, and 10 in Round 5.
   Findings: overall, a positive change in attitudes to professional role was reflected in all sub-scales in the period between start-up and 18 months later; a reduction in scores occurred in Round 3. The mean increases were significant for all sub-scales apart from professional development. Five main themes were identified across the rounds in the content analysis: 'continuity of care', 'working pattern', 'working environment', 'collegiality' and 'issues relating to midwifery practice'. Midwives gained particular satisfaction from providing continuity of care and building relationships with women and their families, and through practising autonomously as a midwife. While there was a struggle to manage the hours worked and being on call, high levels of professional satisfaction were maintained.
   Key conclusions: while there were aspects of MGP that midwives were not satisfied with and wanted to change, overall they were satisfied with the model.
   Implications: there is a need for ongoing evaluation in order to monitor the short- and long-term impact on midwives of working in a caseload model of continuity of midwifery care. (c) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Immigration became a hot issue during the 2016 presidential election, in part due to Donald Trump's offensive campaign against immigrants and minorities in general. Drawing upon the belief gap hypothesis, we tested if support for Donald Trump increased false beliefs about immigrants. The belief gap hypothesis explains differences in beliefs about empirically verifiable and politically contested issues, relying on ideology and partisanship-instead of education-to predict people's beliefs. By using nationally representative panel data, this study explored how political ideology and education work together to predict belief gaps about immigrants. Findings suggest that conservative ideology and education interact to predict attitudes, showing that highly educated conservatives hold more negative beliefs about immigrants as compared to highly educated liberals or less educated conservatives. We also found that Trump's supporters exhibit negative attitudes and beliefs about immigration-yet results indicate that Donald Trump is not the cause of such attitudes but the catalyst that reveals them. Implications for theory and future research are discussed.

AB  - With the development of mobile technology, mobile advertising has become popular worldwide. It seems that almost every user who owns a mobile device receives mobile advertisements from various service providers. However, most consumers hold negative attitudes towards mobile advertising. This research aims to investigate the factors which influence consumers' adoption of mobile advertising. Based on a literature review from previous research, a research model is proposed. This research model is empirically evaluated using survey data collected from 302 receivers of mobile advertising in China. Consumers' attitudes toward mobile advertising and incentives explain about 80 percent of consumers' intention to receive mobile advertisements. In addition, entertainment, credibility, personalization and irritation all have direct effects on consumers' attitudes toward mobile advertising; the effect of entertainment is quite strong. Both theoretical and practical implications of this research are discussed.

AB  - When we consider bias in an adjudicative setting, we may think about cases such as Baker v. Canada in which the interviewing officer's undue emphasis on the applicant's number of children, economic status, and mental health is glaring. It is easy to become accustome When we consider bias in an adjudicative setting, we think about cases such as Baker v. Canada where the interviewing officer's emphasis on the applicant's number of children, economic status, and mental health is glaring. It is easy to become accustomed to thinking about bias in clear examples such as prejudice against people of a disadvantaged group. However, bias can also be subtly present in the subconscious mind, even when a person appears to be acting objectively. The development of cognitive psychology research has revealed that the mind relies on heuristics, or mental shortcuts, to make quick decisions. Heuristics research divides the mind into two systems of operation: The first operates automatically, while the second operates methodically. Heuristics are a function of the former and are consequently difficult to clearly observe and readily identify. Subconscious reliance on heuristics when approaching tasks that demand objectivity can result in decisions that are unintentionally guided by bias, rather than evidence. A reasonable apprehension of bias (RAB) claim is advanced when a party suspects bias on the part of an adjudicator. The question is whether an informed reasonable person would reasonably perceive bias on the part of the adjudicator. The onus is not to prove bias, but merely an appearance of bias. The test is an appeal to the maxim that justice must not only be done but should be seen to be done. The analysis is designed to protect not only the parties but also the public perception of the legal system. In this sense, the RAB test is overinclusive. Conversely, consideration of the RAB test, in light of cognitive biases and heuristic reasoning, reveals that the test is also underinclusive. The driving force behind the RAB analysis appears to be that justice must be seen to be done. Neither the informed reasonable person's knowledge of the law nor the community can help discover veiled or subtle cognitive biases. We are left with a conundrum: The original premise that justice must be done may be violated covertly without triggering the prevailing test for a RAB, leaving an unintentional blind spot. In order to address the shortcomings of the RAB analysis, I propose the implementation of preventative measures to decrease adjudicators' vulnerability to cognitive biases. These measures can be established by increasing adjudicators' understanding of heuristics and counteracting potential intuitive predispositions. Development of remedial measures should consider scarce judicial and adjudicative resources.d to thinking about bias only in clear examples that reveal obvious prejudice against people of a disadvantaged group. However, bias can also be subtly present in the subconscious mind even when it is not objectively apparent. The development of cognitive psychology research has revealed that the mind relies on heuristics, or mental shortcuts, to make quick decisions. Subconscious reliance on heuristics when approaching tasks that demand objectivity can result in decisions that are unintentionally guided by bias, rather than evidence. The current legal framework for identifying a reasonable apprehension of bias (RAB) in adjudication captures only obvious and observable instances of bias, not subtle cases of cognitive bias.
   This article argues that the RAB test is both underinclusive and overinclusive. It offers a series of recommendations to reduce adjudicators' susceptibility to inappropriate intuitive reasoning but concludes that the best remedies available are preventative. We should prioritize decreasing adjudicators' vulnerability to cognitive biases by increasing their understanding of heuristics and counteracting against potential intuitive predispositions.

AB  - Natural selection affects emotional and behavioural patterns, such as anti-predator adaptations, that enhance human survival. Fear is a basic emotion that activates behavioural responses upon encountering a predator, being consistently higher in females than in males. In this study, we investigated associations between fear of a large carnivore predator and perceived physical condition in a sample of Slovakian participants (n = 943). When testing evolutionary hypotheses explaining gender differences in fear of predators, we found partial support for the "physical condition" hypothesis, because females either reported lower perceived body condition than males and their perceived body condition showed significant correlation with fear of brown bear, Ursus arctos. The negative association between fear and perceived body condition was stronger in males suggesting that fear evolved as a response to higher predation pressures on males in our evolutionary past, indirectly supporting the "predation pressure" hypothesis. Males and participants with higher fear of bears wanted to exterminate bears by shooting more than others, suggesting that future management strategies should be oriented on elimination of fear of predators, as primary predictor of extremely negative attitudes toward bears.

AB  - This article critically examines the argument that language testing for citizenship is necessary in order to ensure that naturalized citizens have sufficient language proficiency to participate in democratic life. First, we contend that as they are currently designed, language tests are normally unsuitable to assess the ability of would-be citizens to participate in the complex linguistic interactions that characterize democratic life. We further claim that if language tests were redesigned in order to meet this challenge, this would unjustly exclude (or exacerbate the exclusion of) many categories of migrants from citizenship, especially humanitarian entrants and adults with low-level literacy skills. Finally, we argue that language tests and language skills may be unnecessary for political participation, if institutions and social norms are in place which enable speakers of different languages to participate in political life effectively and without fear of prejudice.

AB  - This study explores biracial students' racial regard, an evaluative component of racial identity that captures positive and negative feelings about the racial groups to which one belongs. Drawing on data from interviews with 62 black-white biracial students attending predominantly white institutions (PWIs) or historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), I explore the conditions of educational contexts that promote or hinder development of positive racial regard. HBCU students highlighted the importance of college for improving their evaluations of blackness, while narratives of improved regard were rare among PWI students. Students' evaluations of blackness and descriptions of contact with black peers support contact theory's propositions about the type of contact likely to improve racial attitudes; specifically, I show how HBCUs can improve racial regard by facilitating institutionally supported contact between equal-status black and biracial students in the pursuit of common goals. My findings also extend contact theory by suggesting another condition of contact that can improve evaluations of blackness: contact with a heterogeneous group of black peers. These findings add to the literature on biracial identity by exploring racial regard, an understudied dimension of racial identity with important mental health implications. The findings also speak to the importance of HBCUs for fostering positive racial regard at a time when the purpose and longevity of these institutions is often questioned.

AB  - This article explores the social representations of youngsters from favelas in Rio de Janeiro on police practices in the context of the implementation of Pacifying Police Units'. Drawing from fieldwork, participant observation and interviews, the authors analyse the narratives and practices which influence relations between young people and the police in the Complexo do AlemAo area of the city. The interviewees expressed a demand for further public security and social services. Young people noted some progress in police practices, although these changes appear to be unstable. The permanence of violent practices and prejudice by the police was verified in youngsters' narratives. Any change in this scenario should be based on the replacement of the war logic of pacification' for another logic, that of participation.

AB  - This study investigated the stories of heterosexual women who experienced a husband coming out as gay and a consequential marital separation. Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was used. Loss, anger, spousal empathy and concerns regarding societal prejudice were reported. Additional stress was experienced when others minimised the experience due to the gay sexual orientation of their husband. Experiencing positive communication with their husband during and after the disclosure aided the resolution of the emotional injury experienced by them. They all eventually let go' of their husband. This involved a process of reconceptualising the self as separated. Findings indicate the importance of supporting women to re-focus on their needs during and following marital dissolution. The importance of non-judgemental support for marital loss, rather than a focus on the gay sexual orientation of the spouse, was highlighted.

AB  - When an anti-gay initiative is on the ballot, lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals must contend not only with the tangible consequences if the initiative passes (e. g., a lack of rights) but also with the stress of the campaign itself. The current research examined the consequences of the campaign associated with California's Proposition 8 on LGB individuals' well-being and personal relationships. LGB participants (N = 354) completed a survey in the 5 days before the 2008 election. In both quantitative results and open-ended responses, participants revealed much personal ambivalence. Participants reported experiencing both negative and positive emotions (e. g., anger, pride) and were particularly ambivalent regarding the effect of Proposition 8 on relationships with friends, family, coworkers, and their intimate partner. The campaign created opportunities for support but also opportunities for stigmatization and conflict. These results demonstrate the powerful effects that campaigns themselves, and not just outcomes, have on targeted individuals.

AB  - This study utilizes Terror Management Theory (TMT) to examine differences between eliciting social death and physical death anxiety related to smoking, smoking attitudes, and quitting intent among college students. Moreover, an important TMT variable-self-esteem-was used as a moderator. A 2 x 3 between-subjects factorial design crossed smoking-based self-esteem (low,high) with mortality salience manipulation (health-focused, social-focused, control). Results suggest while both making health-focused salient and making social-focused mortality salient were effective at getting smokers to quit, there was less effect for health-focused mortality salience on those whose self-esteem is strongly tied to smoking. Effect of social-focused mortality salience was more pronounced among participants who highly linked self-esteem with smoking. For smokers with low smoking-based self-esteem, both health-focused and social-focused mortality salience were effective at motivating attitude change toward smoking and quitting intentions. Implications for smoking cessation ad design and TMT are discussed.

AB  - In the film and play Twelve Angry Men, Juror 8 confronts the prejudices and poor reasoning of his fellow jurors, exhibiting an unwavering capacity not just to formulate and challenge arguments, but to be open-minded, stay calm, tolerate uncertainty, and negotiate in the face of considerable group pressures. In a perceptive and detailed portrayal of a group deliberation a 'wheel of virtue' is presented by the characters of Twelve Angry Men that allows for critical thinking virtues and vices to be analysed in context. This article makes the case for (1) the film being an exceptional teaching resource, and (2), drawing primarily on the ideas of Martha Nussbaum concerning contextualised detail, emotional engagement, and aesthetic distance, its educational value being intimately related to its being a work of fiction.

AB  - The present study aims to examine how subjective age of older Korean Americans would be affected by functional disability and attitudes toward aging. We hypothesized that (a) both functional disability and attitudes toward aging would have a direct effect on subjective age and (b) the effect of functional disability on subjective age would be mediated by attitudes toward aging. Our analyses of the survey data with 208 community-dwelling Korean Americans aged 60 and older (mean age = 69.6, SD = 7.51) showed that the indirect effect of functional disability on subjective age through attitudes toward aging [-.020 (.009)] was significant (bias-corrected 95% confidence interval [-.039, -.006]). The findings suggest that functional disability fosters negative attitudes toward aging, which in turn leads to the feelings of being older than actual age. Our study suggests ways to preserve and promote positive perceptions of age and aging.

AB  - Intergroup contact reduces prejudice and improves outgroup attitudes, while a salient social identity might have the opposite effects. Recent research has shown that exposure to positive information about the outgroup could influence such effects of the contact and social identity on the outgroup attitudes. Here we investigate the effects of the contact and social identity on the outgroup attitudes, and forgiveness toward the outgroup of Bosniak Muslims among Serbs (N = 400) by randomly allocating them into control and experimental groups. In the experimental condition, the students were presented with brief biographies of three eminent Bosniak Muslims, in the positive context, after which they completed a survey. In the control group, students were only presented with the survey without the biographies. Subsequent independent samples t-tests showed that the mean values for ingroup identification and intergroup trust were significantly different in the two groups. Specifically, participants who were in the experimental condition, being exposed to the positive information about Bosniak Muslims, reported a higher level of intergroup trust and a lower level of ingroup identification as Serbian. We then performed a multi-group structural equation modeling through which we tested a predictive role of the past contact and in-the group identification on trust and collective guilt in both control and experimental conditions. Across both groups, past contact positively and ingroup identification negatively predicted both intergroup attitudes and forgiveness via trust and collective guilt. Exposure to the positive information about the outgroup moderated the indirect effects of the ingroup identification on the intergroup attitudes via collective guilt.

AB  - Online reviews have become a significant information source for customers in decision-making. Such reviews are particularly important to firms like Airbnb as consumers have limited direct information regarding the quality of the property and the services. Researchers and practitioners, in general, favor positive reviews as they increase customers' booking intentions. However, this study theorizes that positive reviews could backfire and induce negative consequences under certain circumstances. More specifically, this research examines the interaction effects between the cause of an expectation disconfirmation and review dispersion on customers' attitudes and behavioral intention. Results indicated that when an expectation disconfirmation was caused by reviewers, participants showed more negative attitudes and lower intentions to spread positive WOM and repurchase when review dispersion was low (vs. high). In contrast, when the expectation disconfirmation was caused by property descriptions, participants reported similar responses regardless of review dispersion. Further, such interaction effects were mediated by perceived fairness.

AB  - Racial microaggressions often occur in U.S. higher education. However, less is known about how White American students reason about their evaluations of racial microaggressions. The present study investigated how 213 White college students (54.46% cisgender women) attending a Primarily White Institution in the Southeast U.S. in the Fall of 2019 justified their evaluations of the acceptability of racial microaggressions presented in vignettes. Following Social Domain Theory, to assess participants' social reasoning, we conducted quantitative content analysis of participants' open-ended justifications for their evaluations. Multiple regression analyses revealed that participants were less likely to evaluate racial microaggressions as negative the more they employed justifications focused on (a) assuming that the behaviors in the situation followed conventions of the classroom, (b) judging the professor's response as correct, and (c) asserting that the behavior was likely to happen to anyone. Further, the higher participants' endorsement of color-blind attitudes the more likely they were to evaluate racial microaggressions as appropriate. However, reasoning centered on (a) assuming differential treatment based on race, (b) perceiving the behavior as harmful, and (c) considering the behavior was against conventional expectations was associated with finding racial microaggressions to be more negative. The present study highlights the value of investigating underlying reasoning behind evaluating racial microaggressions in addition to color-blind attitudes. The findings suggest that higher education professionals should consider interventions which pay particular attention to unpacking students' reasoning, untangling acceptance of Ethnocentric narratives and providing information that challenges classroom behaviors that, while potentially appearing conventional, in fact perpetuate harm through microaggressions.

AB  - Marketing a destination is costly so efficiency of promotion expenditure is critical; identifying improved techniques to achieve this will be of great value. Clustering techniques have sought to identify target markets but are widely criticised for the biases they induce. Persistent Homology identifies key tourist groupings with similar behaviours without the prejudice of the functional forms inherent in most regression models. It further produces more focused, and therefore easily promoted to, markets. Consequently Persistent Homology can highlight obtainable promotion opportunities that otherwise would be missed. This paper provides an example of its application to identify the highest, and lowest, spenders amongst tourists visiting the United Kingdom. We further provide an intuitive theoretical background highlighting the inherent value of the methodology for tourism research. Potential for impact in applications to other aspects of tourism practice is also great as we signpost therein.

AB  - This article is an exploration of attitudes towards public protest through a perspective which focuses on the increasing use of gender to delineate the boundaries between acceptable and unacceptable violence by the nineteenth century. The increasing association between public manifestations of protest and physical violence is argued as showing the extent to which the nineteenth century represented a new departure in attitudes towards protest because of associated negative attitudes towards violence in Britain. The key focus here is on England and Wales, although the Scottish dimension is also considered. The move to new formats for public protest (such as marches and public meetings) is explained through a depiction of the new hostility towards visible violence, especially that involving women either as participants or victims. The criminalising of protest because of its implications for violence within a society that increasingly valued orderliness' as a symbol of civilisation is portrayed through the use of a range of texts including newspapers and fiction.

AB  - This article presents several covalent inhibitors, including examples of successful drugs, as well as highly selective, irreversible inhibitors of emerging therapeutic targets, such as fatty acid amide hydolase. Covalent inhibitors have many desirable features, including increased biochemical efficiency of target disruption, less sensitivity toward pharmacokinetic parameters and increased duration of action that outlasts the pharmacokinetics of the compound. Safety concerns that must be mitigated include lack of specificity and the potential immunogenicity of protein-inhibitor adduct(s). Particular attention will be given to recent technologies, such as activity-based protein profiling, which allow one to define the proteome-wide selectivity patterns for covalent inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. For instance, any covalent inhibitor can, in principle, be modified with a 'clickable' tag to generate an activity probe that is almost indistinguishable from the original agent. These probes can be applied to any living system across a broad dose range to fully inventory their on and off targets. The substantial number of drugs on the market today that act by a covalent mechanism belies historical prejudices against the development of irreversibly acting therapeutic small molecules. Emerging proteomic technologies offer a means to systematically discriminate safe (selective) versus deleterious (nonselective) covalent inhibitors and thus should inspire their future design and development.

AB  - Background: People with intellectual disability experience elevated rates of mental ill health. Yet they face barriers in accessing appropriate individualised mental health care. Further research is required to learn about the capability of the mental health workforce to facilitate access and participation in quality mental health care for this group. Methods: Thirty-three Australian intellectual disability mental health experts participated in four focus groups. The research team undertook thematic analysis applying a health care human rights framework known as the 3AQ Framework. Results: The participants identified multiple barriers to the delivery of quality mental health care. These included the lack of clear career pathways, education, clinical skills, clinical guidelines, and negative attitudes held by some mental health professionals. Conclusion: A comprehensive workforce development strategy is required to improve the capability of the mental health workforce to provide an available, accessible, acceptable and quality mental health services to people with intellectual disability.

AB  - A two-step agent-based mathematical model of negative rumor spread in the context of conflicting groups is presented. The GBN-Dialogue model builds on rumor theory, focuses on person-to-person interaction characteristics, and is dynamical. The model first estimates the probability of rumor transmission between two persons based on their transmission motivation (which is a function of their Group (G) memberships), the strengths of their belief (B) in the rumor, and the Novelty (N) of the rumor for each person. Psychological and sociological research informs this Transmission Probability Function. In the second step, belief levels and rumor novelty of each participant change as a result of rumor transmission and time; literature on attitude change guides these updating functions. Empirical support is presented by comparing rumor transmission literature with results of Monte Carlo simulations on different network topologies. The validity of the model's assumptions is addressed by comparison with simpler and more complex alternatives.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze HIV/AIDS positive individual's perception and attitudes regarding dental services.
   METHODS: One hundred and thirty-four subjects (30.0% of women and 70.0% of men) from Nuevo Leon, Mexico, took part in the study (2014). They filled out structured, analytical, self-administered, anonymous questionnaires. Besides the sociodemographic variables, the perception regarding public and private dental services and related professionals was evaluated, as well as the perceived stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, through a Likert-type scale. The statistical evaluation included a factorial and a non-hierarchical cluster analysis.
   RESULTS: Social inequalities were found regarding the search for public and private dental professionals and services. Most subjects reported omitting their HIV serodiagnosis and agreed that dentists must be trained and qualified to treat patients with HIV/AIDS. The factorial analysis revealed two elements: experiences of stigma and discrimination in dental appointments and feelings of concern regarding the attitudes of professionals or their teams concerning patients' HIV serodiagnosis. The cluster analysis identified three groups: users who have not experienced stigma or discrimination (85.0%); the ones who have not had those experiences, but feel somewhat concerned (12.7%); and the ones who underwent stigma and discrimination and feel concerned (2.3%).
   CONCLUSIONS: We observed a low percentage of stigma and discrimination in dental appointments; however, most HIV/AIDS patients do not reveal their serodiagnosis to dentists out of fear of being rejected. Such fact implies a workplace hazard to dental professionals, but especially to the very own health of HIV/AIDS patients, as dentists will not be able to provide them a proper clinical and pharmaceutical treatment.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to assess the hypothesis that achievement goal orientations will predict sportpersonship attitudes among young athletes, namely that task orientation will predict socially positive attitudes and ego orientation will predict socially negative attitudes. For hundred and eighty two athletes, aged 13 to 16 years completed the Portuguese versions of the Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQp) and of the Sports Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQp). Bivariate correlations were used to examine the relationships between TEOSQp and SAQp. Afterwards, relationships between ego orientation and score agreement in cheating and gamesmanship as well as task orientation and score agreement in convention and commitment were examined through EQS (version 5.7). For the estimation of the model, the maximum likelihood method was used. A matrix correlation between the variables (task orientation, ego orientation, cheating, gamesmanship, convention and commitment) showed positive correlations between task orientation and convention (r = 0.29, p < 0.01) and commitment (r = 0.40, p < 0.01). Ego orientation appeared to be positively correlated with cheating (r = 0.30, p < 0.01) and gamesmanship (r = 0.33, p < 0.01), and negatively with convention (r = -0.16, p < 0.01). The fit of the model was evaluated using the CFI (0.97) and SRMR (0.04). The hypothesized model was confirmed. Task and ego orientations produced a significant effect on prosocial attitudes and on antisocial attitudes, respectively. Task-oriented goals in youth sport programs can represent a relevant framework for promoting prosocial attitudes and consequentely increment the effectiveness of educational interventions.

AB  - Forgiveness helps repair ruptured relationships and maintain cooperation. It may most usefully serve these functions when it is preferentially directed toward better cooperators. We examined this proposal in two studies with young children. Study 1 asked whether children forgive in-group members (whom people generally expect to be more cooperative) more than out-group members. When a novel in-group member and out-group member both transgressed against the child and both showed remorse, 5-year-old children (N = 20) were more forgiving of the in-group member. In Study 2, when only the out-group transgressor was remorseful whereas the in-group transgressor was unremorseful (and did not demonstrate cooperative intent), 5-year-olds (N = 20) were more forgiving of the remorseful out-group transgressor. Children also judged the unremorseful in-group transgressor negatively and wanted her to leave their group. Together, these results reveal that from early in life, forgiveness is preferentially directed so as to maximize successful cooperation while reducing the risk of exploitation.

AB  - Purpose: Speech-language pathology programs globally need to prepare graduates to work with culturally and linguistically diverse populations. This study explored the knowledge, perceptions and experiences related to development of cultural awareness of graduate-entry Master of Speech Pathology students at an Australian university.
   Method: Sixty students across both year-levels completed a cultural awareness survey at the beginning of the semester. To explore how clinical placement influenced students' knowledge and perceptions, year-2 students completed written reflections pre-and post-placement (n = 7) and participated in focus groups post-placement (n = 6).
   Result: Survey results showed student interest in working with culturally and linguistically diverse populations was high (over 80%) and confidence was moderate (over 50%). More than 80% of students reported awareness of their own cultural identities, stereotypes and prejudices. Content analysis of focus group and written reflection data identified key concepts comprising of: (1) context-university, and clinical placement site; (2) competencies-professional and individual; and (3) cultural implications-clients' and students' cultural backgrounds.
   Conclusion: Findings suggest clinical placement may positively influence cultural awareness development and students' own cultural backgrounds may influence this more. Further exploration of how students move along a continuum of cultural development is warranted.

T2  - CURRICULUM MATTERS
LA  - English
KW  - ISSUES
AB  - Heteronormativity is pervasive and ongoing in most societies. New Zealand, despite its comparatively liberal laws in relation to sexual orientation, is no exception. The effects of such attitudes, values and prejudices extend into education and, by default, into curriculum. Findings from a study including student and staff online surveys, a series of focus group and individual interviews and an overview of programme content suggest that there was a hidden curriculum of heteronormativity in teacher education at a New Zealand faculty of education in 2009. Course content and delivery, staff and student attitudes and beliefs and the lack of visibility of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and transsexual (LGBTT) people appeared to produce a curriculum that was unsupportive and not inclusive of queer(1) students and staff members. This article discusses notions of curriculum and the research findings with reference to relevant theoretical perspectives.

AB  - In the context of requests for provisional measures, the link requirement has not attracted much scholarly attention and might be regarded as raising limited controversy. However, this article argues that the link is an unnecessary requirement for granting provisional measures by the International Court of Justice and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. First, the function which the link purports to fulfil is already fulfilled by other requirements (i.e., prima facie jurisdiction, plausibility and real and imminent risk of irreparable prejudice). Second, if the link is understood as requiring provisional measures to be tailored to the rights of which protection is sought, the ICJ and ITLOS have the power to indicate measures different from those requested. One may suggest that the link therefore emerges as an unnecessary requirement which overburdens provisional measures proceedings.

AB  - As government welfare programming contracts and NGOs increasingly assume core aid functions, they must address a long-standing challenge-that people in need often belong to stigmatized groups. To study other-regarding behavior, we fielded an experiment through a text-to-give campaign in Greece. Donations did not increase with an appeal to the in-group (Greek child) relative to a control (child), but they were halved with reference to a stigmatized out-group (Roma child). An appeal to fundamental rights, a common advocacy strategy, did not reduce the generosity gap. Donations to all groups were lower near Roma communities and declined disproportionately for the Roma appeal. Qualitative research in 12 communities complements our experiment. We conclude that NGO fundraising strategies that narrowly emphasize either in-groups or out-groups, or fundamental rights language, may not be as effective as broader appeals, and we discuss implications for public goods provision in an era of growing nationalism.

AB  - Over the last two decades in Europe and North America, many more employers have been requiring Sunday work. The current study examines attitudes towards days worked in a North American retail sample where most employees had to work on Sunday. We use Exchange Theory to develop hypotheses examining how factors related to working Sundays, such as organizational tenure, pay premiums, scheduling control, and scheduling flexibility, are associated with attitudes towards days worked. To test the hypotheses, employees were categorized into groups based on whether they worked Sundays and the premiums they received for working Sundays. Organizational tenure, higher premiums for Sunday work, and greater scheduling control were related to more positive attitudes towards days worked. In addition, employees more willing to work Sundays for scheduling control and flexibility had more negative attitudes towards their days worked. We discuss the practical implications in relation to work schedule management.

KW  - EDUCATION
AB  - This paper starts from the premise that there is more to writing than simply skill, knowledge and ability, i.e. cognition. This is an important part of writing but is only one aspect of it. The paper discusses the idea of the affective domain and goes on to focus largely on the positive and negative attitudes and feelings of graduate students towards writing. These views were collected during a number of teaching sessions with post-graduates. The teaching sessions, which are outlined in the paper, involved a wide range of post-graduate students (overseas and UK) who were at different stages in their doctorate. During those sessions, the views and attitudes of experienced academic writers were also presented briefly as a contrast and a comparison to those of students. The article ends with a discussion of the range of students' attitudes and feelings and considers how staff might best 'deal' with them in helping to develop students' writing as successfully as possible.

AB  - Ageism is a problem in aging societies. Clinical psychologists and undergraduate psychology students have shown negative attitudes toward older adults. However, no speci?c measure against ageist myths in the psychotherapeutic context is available. This study aims to develop and present the psychometric properties of the Ageist Myths about Psychotherapy Questionnaire (AMPQ). These issues were examined by surveying 222 psychology graduates at higher education institutions about their attitudes and behaviors concerning psychotherapy with older adults, negative stereotypes toward aging, and attitudes toward dementia. Using principal components analysis, 10 items were retained and one factor was obtained with an acceptable reliability index. Signi?cant associations were found between the AMPQ and negative stereotypes toward aging, and attitudes toward dementia. Results revealed that universities and colleges with psychology programs have an ageist bias. Implications for college formation in aging, and older adults with mental health problems, are discussed and presented.

AB  - This study examines the interplay of positive and negative intergroup contact with majority group members from the perspective of ethnic minority youth. Taking a social identity approach, we posit that negative contact experiences (i.e., hostile interactions) may undermine the benefits of some positive contact experiences (i.e., friendly interactions) for minority contact orientations (e.g., openness to and anxiety about cross-group interactions). Conversely, for other positive contact experiences, in particular high-quality forms of positive contact (e.g., friendship), we expect that their beneficial effects will not be undermined, and that the adverse effects of negative contact may even be buffered by such high-quality positive contact experiences. We tested our predictions in a sample of U.S. Latino/a youth (N = 126) nested in 41 classrooms, using a multilevel design. As expected, friendly interactions predicted more favorable contact orientations only in the absence of negative contact, while high-quality positive contact robustly predicted more favorable contact orientations and even buffered negative contact effects. These findings illuminate how negative contact can cast a long shadow over the inclusion of minority youth in intergroup settings; moreover, they indicate the importance of curbing hostile treatment targeting minority youth and of promoting high-quality positive contact over and above mere friendly interactions.

AB  - A well-functioning democracy requires a degree of mutual respect and a willingness to talk across political divides. Yet numerous studies have shown that many electorates are polarized along partisan lines, with animosity towards the partisan out-group. This article further develops the idea of affective polarization, not by partisanship, but instead by identification with opinion-based groups. Examining social identities formed during Britain's 2016 referendum on European Union membership, the study uses surveys and experiments to measure the intensity of partisan and Brexit-related affective polarization. The results show that Brexit identities are prevalent, felt to be personally important and cut across traditional party lines. These identities generate affective polarization as intense as that of partisanship in terms of stereotyping, prejudice and various evaluative biases, convincingly demonstrating that affective polarization can emerge from identities beyond partisanship.

AB  - The last few years have been a testament to the fact that anti-Black racism is alive and well in America. It manifests not only in macro-level indicators of social inequity (e.g., housing, education) but also manifests within individual organizations. Importantly, individuals in organizations can endorse anti-Black attitudes and other racist sentiments that influence others' expressions of bias. In the current research, we examine the power of proximal organizational norms in two studies. In Study 1, 269 participants heard a member of their organization condone or condemn anti-Black attitudes and were then asked to give their own attitudes about Black Americans. Results revealed that participants were strongly influenced by the organization member's stance on anti-Black racism; compared to those in the control condition, those who heard an organizational peer condone anti-Black attitudes were also more likely to condone, and those who heard an organizational peer condemn these attitudes were also more likely to condemn. In Study 2, we continued to examine the impact of norms on expressions of anti-Black bias by investigating the relationship between bias expression and both proximal (within an organization) and distal (within a more socially and physically distant reference group, i.e., country) norms. Consistent with Study 1, results from 183 participants showed that the proximal norms (but not the distal norms) were strongly related to the expression of anti-Black bias. We discuss the results by considering the critical role that both individual workplace allies and collective organizations can play in shaping the expression of anti-Black bias.

AB  - Background Abusive and disrespectful treatment of women during childbirth is a critical global issue that threatens women's sexual rights and reproductive rights and access to quality maternal care. This phenomenon has been documented in Colombia. However, little emphasis has been placed on identifying the drivers of and potential interventions against disrespect and abuse against particularly vulnerable populations in the country, including internally displaced indigenous women. Methods This report is a sub-analysis of a larger project. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with indigenous (Embera) women with childbirth experience (n = 10), maternal healthcare workers (n = 6), and community stakeholders (n = 5) in Medellin, Colombia. Qualitative analysis techniques, consisting of inductive and deductive approaches, were used to identify and characterize the drivers of disrespect and abuse against indigenous women during childbirth and points for intervention. Existing frameworks were adapted to thematically organize drivers and potential solutions into four interrelated subsystems: individual and community factors, clinician factors, facility factors, and national health system factors. Results Participants highlighted disrespect and abuse as stemming from (within the individual and community level) its normalization, lack of autonomy and empowerment among indigenous women, lacking antenatal care, (within the clinician level) prejudice, linguistic or cultural barriers to communication, lack of understanding of indigenous culture, medical culture and training, burnout and demoralization, (within the facility level) inadequate infrastructure, space, and human resources, and (within the national systems level) lack of clear policies and the devaluing of respectful maternity care. They called for interventions specific to these drivers, grounded in dignity and respect for indigenous culture. Conclusion This paper expands upon the growing literature on global mistreatment during childbirth by highlighting drivers of mistreatment and identifying points for intervention in a previously unstudied population. Our data show that indigenous women are especially vulnerable to mistreatment due to cultural and linguistic barriers and prejudice. Broad and meaningful action is urgently needed to realize these women's rights to respectful maternity care. Interventions must be multifaceted and locally specific, taking into account the needs and wants of the women they serve.

AB  - The security exceptions under the GATT Article XXI set forth an important carve-out for WTO Members. The provision arguably contains an element of a "self-judging" nature. It also extends to other non-military and commercial sectors. Nonetheless, the provision remains subject to a WTO panel's review. The provision also sets forth specific requirements to be fulfilled before it is properly invoked. In particular, the terms "for the purpose of supplying a military establishment" and "other emergency in international relations" establish an important outer parameter for the interpretation and application of the provision. The negotiating history and ordinary meaning interpretation of these two terms also support such conclusion. As such, irrespective of and without prejudice to the selfjudging nature of the article, proper invocation of Article XXI would demand showing of the satisfaction of these two requirements of the provision.

AB  - This article takes a dyadic approach to the conceptualization of nature-based tourism (NBT) destinations. Treating the natural area and its gateway city as distinct evaluative objects, we propose that tourists may differentially assess each element of a city-park dyad based on the degree to which the attributes of each are perceived as conducive to the fulfillment of NBT-specific goals. By empirically testing this perspective, this study reveals the unique complexities of NBT. The findings indicate that nature-based tourists have distinct perceptions of natural areas and their gateway cities. The results also reveal that proenvironmental attitudes motivate individuals to engage in NBT and are associated with a positive image of the natural area. However, these proenvironmental attitudes also yield negative attitudes toward the human-made attributes of the gateway city, which result in a negative image of the city itself. The principal implications for future research and application are discussed.

AB  - This paper is a report on a qualitative study which considered the issue of how lecturers feel about teaching and managing the topic of culture and racism within their role as nurse educators. The issue of cultural diversity and the related issue of racism within nursing and society more generally means that the problem cannot be ignored since one of the central tenets of nursing is that care should be delivered in nondiscriminatory ways. We interviewed a group of lecturers within a UK university to explore their views on the topic. We produced six themes: Culture; the existence of racism within nursing; challenging racism; political correctness; strategies adopted to address issues in the classroom and the presence of cultural diversity within the curriculum. We identified that the lecturers in our study were keen to address the issue but were also very concerned about their own abilities and confidence in this area. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study presents a bibliometric analysis of the publication patterns of indigenous knowledge in Africa. IK has always been subjected to prejudice, and the contributions made by Africa to the body of knowledge are conspicuously missing from text books for formal education and continue to remain unknown. Data for this study were collected from WoS and Scopus databases and saved into excel sheets for further analysis. The results suggest that the bulk pf IK research was done in medicinal and pharmaceutical sciences. When it comes to Library and Information Science, the researchers focus was more on the management of IK, which was motivated by the preservation role that Information science professionals must play as the custodians of knowledge generated in societies.

AB  - Broken windows theory (BWT) has heavily influenced social science and policy over the past 30 years. It posits that disorder in neighborhoods leads to elevated crime by inviting additional criminal activity and by discouraging the positive social behavior that prevents crime. Scholars have debated the veracity of BWT, and here we conduct a meta-analysis of 96 studies to examine the effects of disorder on residents' (a) general proclivities for aggressive behavior and (b) perceptions of and attitudes toward their neighborhood (e.g., fear of crime), with particular attention to aspects of research design that might confound causal inference. We found no consistent evidence that disorder induces greater aggression or more negative attitudes toward the neighborhood. Studies that found such effects disproportionately utilized weaker research designs that omit key correlates or confound perceptions of disorder with other neighborhood attitudes. We explore implications for theory, research, and policy.

AB  - Nowadays, there is a trend of HIV prevalence transmitting from high-risk group to average-risk group in China. Rural China is the weak link of HIV prevention, and rural areas of Henan province which is one of the most high-risk regions in China have more than 60% of the AIDS patients in the province. Thus, improving the HIV awareness and implementing health education become the top-priority of HIV/AIDS control and prevention. A multistage sampling was designed to draw 1129 people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHAs) and 1168 non-PLWHAs in 4 prevalence counties of Henan province. A health promoting and social-psychological support model was constructed to improve the health knowledge of participants. Chi-square tests and unconditional logistic regression were performed to determine the intervention effect and influencing factors. All groups had misunderstandings towards the basic medical knowledge and the AIDS transmission mode. Before the intervention, 59.3% of the HIV/AIDS patients and 74.6% of the healthy people had negative attitudes towards the disease. There was statistically significant difference in the improvement of knowledge, attitude and action with regards to HIV prevention before and after intervention (P<0.05). PLWHAs who were males (OR=1.731) and had higher education level (OR=1.910) were found to have better HIV/AIDS health knowledge, whereas older PLWHAs (OR=0.961) were less likely to have better HIV/AIDS health knowledge. However, the intervention effect was associated with the expertise of doctors and supervisors, the content and methods of education, and participants' education level. It was concluded that health education of HIV/AIDS which positively influences the awareness and attitude of HIV prevention is popular in rural areas, therefore, a systematic and long-term program of HIV control and prevention is urgently needed in rural areas.

AB  - This study examined factors of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) identity in relation to general attitudes toward medical care and specific attitudes of medical care avoidance. Through an online questionnaire, 114 participants who self-identified as LGB completed measures of LGB identity and attitudes toward medical care. Out of eight domains of LGB identity, identity affirmation, acceptance concerns, and identity superiority significantly related to overall attitudes toward medical care. In other words, an affirming experience with one's LGB identity significantly related to positive attitudes. Conversely, concerns about judgement for being LGB and beliefs that LGB identity is superior to heterosexual identity related to negative attitudes. Furthermore, stronger overall negative LGB identity significantly related to stronger attitudes of medical care avoidance. These findings suggest that both positive and negative aspects of LGB identity relate to attitudes toward seeking medical care. We discuss the implications of our findings for clinical work with LGB individuals and their loved ones.

AB  - One hundred years ago, the first Department of International Politics was established at the University College of Wales, Aberystwyth, with the express purpose of seeking in Arnold Toynbee's prophetic words (uttered many years later) - of breaking decisively with the 'habit of nationalism'. As David Davies in the founding statement put it, by moving beyond 'insular and vested prejudices horizontal ellipsis the shattered family of nations' could be brought back together again and a new world order established. Yet as the history of the twentieth century showed - and the new century looks to be no nearer to realizing that original dream - nationalism has throughout continued to retain its power of mobilizing peoples and setting nation against nation. How and why this happened and with what consequences is the subject of this article.

AB  - Born in 1968, the French Nouvelle Droite (ND) is a 'cultural school of thought'. It created a sophisticated European-wide political culture of the revolutionary right in an anti-fascist age; it helped to nurture the discourse of 'political correctness' among extreme right-wing political parties, and turned former French ultra-nationalists into pan-Europeanists seeking to smash the egalitarian heritage of 1789. Bar-On argues that the ND world-view has been shaped by transnational influences and that the ND has, in turn, shaped a decidedly more right-wing political culture in Europe in a transnational spirit. The transnational impact of ND ideas is a product of three key factors: first, the intellectual output and prestige of ND leader Alain de Benoist; second, the 'right-wing Gramscianism' of the ND's pan-European project that mimicked earlier attempts to unite interwar fascists and post-war neo-fascists into the revolutionary right; and, finally, the political space opened up by the decline of the European left after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. Bar-On concludes by considering the influence of the ND on contemporary European politics, as well as the implications for the struggles against racism and the extreme right.

AB  - U.S. President Barack Obama's much-anticipated address in Egypt in 2009 promised a new beginning between the U.S. government and the Arab world but only a few years later there were many criticisms that the U.S. President did not live up to his promises, driving Arab attitudes toward the United States to their lowest point in years. Five years later, we analyzed Arabic-language twitter messages involving President Obama to examine cognitive and affective attributes. Results show that tweets by members of the media differed greatly from tweets by members of the public. The public tweets held more negative attitudes towards the U.S. President than tweets by news organizations. Members of the public also were more likely to link the President to a wider range of countries, suggesting a greater diversity of attributes, while primarily fixating on the Palestinian issue.

AB  - The main purpose of this exploratory research study was to determine urban hotel guest, manager, and staff perspectives on the impacts in terms of costs and benefits of the introduction of service robots in rooms. It was conducted to fill a literature gap on multi-stakeholder perspectives on the use of in-room service robots. Using a variety of data collection methods including a survey and interviews, the perspectives of stakeholder groups were found to be dissimilar. Hotel guests perceived more benefits than expenses while management views were more focused on the costs and technical aspects. Managers and financial officers primarily had a return on investment perspective on hotel robot use. The negative attitudes held by hotel managers toward service robots were related to costs of implementation and a concern that these costs could not be recouped. The technology readiness index, service robot acceptance model, and technology organization environment (TOE) framework were applied to examine guest perceptions and adoption attitudes.

AB  - Faced with the general period of political demobilisation since 2011, there is a need to look beyond the manifest forms of political participation and to better understand the dynamics of engagement among today's Arab Mediterranean youth. In this article, we inquire into the life experiences of young people and, especially, explore the agentic dimensions of their apparent disengagement. What societal processes shape their negative attitudes toward engaging in public political life? What prospects are there for further politicisation of youth in the post-2011 era? In order to address these questions, we adopt a processual view of engagement, indicating that young people's agencies are geared towards the goals of livelihood, employment, and attaining personal advancement and markers of social adulthood. These in turn represent spheres of life that may aggregate instances of felt injustices and thresholds of politicisation processes.

AB  - Background Ageism is a common form of prejudice that negatively affects the health of older adults. Anti-aging procedures are increasingly popular among patients seeking aesthetic surgery and minimally invasive treatments.
   Objectives This study aimed to identify the prevalence of age-based discrimination, and its relationship to health, among patients seeking cosmetic procedures.
   Methods Patients from a university-based, single-surgeon, aesthetic plastic surgery clinic completed the Everyday Discrimination Scale, which assesses the frequency with which individuals have experienced microaggressions and the main reason(s) for discrimination (including age). Participants also completed: measures of perceived age discrimination across interpersonal, romantic, work, and healthcare contexts and anticipation of age-based discrimination in the future; a single-item measure of self-rated health (rated 1-5); and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale.
   Results Fifty patients consented to participate in the study (94% women, 78% white, mean age 49.4 13.5 years). More than 30% of participants reported age as the main reason for everyday discrimination. Participants who reported experiencing age-based discrimination, compared with those who did not, had worse self-rated health, lower self-esteem, and greater anticipated age-based discrimination. Participants most frequently endorsed experiencing age-based discrimination in an interpersonal context (36.0%) followed by work settings (20.0%).
   Conclusions A significant portion of patients seeking cosmetic procedures may experience age-based discrimination, which could negatively affect their health and well-being. Patients might benefit from expectation management about how their procedure may or may not address their concerns about age-based discrimination. More research is needed to determine whether cosmetic procedures help to mitigate discrimination in aging patients.

AB  - This study assessed beliefs about mental disorders and changes in those beliefs following an educational intervention for a convenience sample of Nigerian medical and nursing students.
   A 43-item questionnaire was used to assess perceptions regarding mental disorders and attitudes toward people with mental illness before and after a 4-day educational intervention.
   Factor analysis identified four domains: (1) socializing with people with mental illness, (2) belief in witchcraft or curses as causes of mental illness, (3) favorable attitudes toward normalization of the lives of people with mental illness, and (4) biopsychosocial approaches to mental illness. The greatest changes were in attitudes favoring normalization of the lives of people with mental illness (p = 0.0002), socializing with the mentally ill (p = 0.01), and biopsychosocial perspectives on mental illness (p = 0.01).
   Brief educational interventions may alter some stigmatizing negative attitudes toward mental illness in healthcare trainees in low- and middle-income countries.

AB  - This paper presents research on the attitudes to multiculturalism, immigration, and cultural diversity of dominant and non-dominant groups in three Australian states. The study utilized an adaptation of the original International Study of Attitudes toward Immigration and Settlement (ISATIS) instrument developed by John Berry and colleagues. Results from our quantitative-and qualitative data demonstrated favorable attitudes toward cultural diversity and support for multiculturalism amongst the Australians in our sample, in general. Women, immigrants and non-dominant cultural groups held more positive attitudes than men, non-immigrants and dominant groups for some dimensions. Consistent with previous Australian research, there was evidence of attitudinal ambivalence, with participants expressing concerns about the perceived negative consequences of cultural diversity. Participants also expressed negative attitudes toward particular outgroups, such as Muslims and Arabs. The results are discussed in terms of the complex nature of multiculturalism attitudes and the need to examine these in a variety of contexts. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Obese individuals experience pervasive stigmatization. Interventions attempting to reduce obesity stigma by targeting its origins have yielded mixed results. This randomized, controlled study examined the effectiveness of two interventions to reduce obesity stigma: cognitive dissonance and social consensus. Participants were college undergraduate students (N = 64, 78% women, mean age = 21.2 years, mean BMI = 23.1 kg/m(2)) of diverse ethnicities. Obesity stigma (assessed with the Antifat Attitudes Test (AFAT)) was assessed at baseline (Visit 1) and 1 week later, immediately following the intervention (Visit 2). Participants were randomly assigned to one of three intervention groups where they received standardized written feedback on their obesity stigma levels. Cognitive dissonance participants (N = 21) were told that their AFAT scores were discrepant from their values (high core values of kindness and equality and high stigma), social consensus participants (N = 22) were told their scores were discrepant from their peers' scores (stigma much higher than their peers), and control participants (N = 21) were told their scores were consistent with both their peers' scores and their own values. Following the intervention, omnibus analyses revealed significant group differences on the AFAT Physical/Romantic Unattractiveness subscale (PRU; F (2, 59) = 4.43, P < 0.05). Planned contrasts revealed that cognitive dissonance group means were significantly lower than control means for AFAT total, AFAT PRU subscale, and AFAT social/character disparagement subscale (all P < 0.05). No significant differences were found between social consensus and controls. Results from this study suggest that cognitive dissonance interventions may be a successful way to reduce obesity stigma, particularly by changing attitudes about the appearance and attractiveness of obese individuals.

AB  - Conversations around race have come to the forefront of public discourses in the United States with incidents of police brutality leading to movements such as Black Lives Matter and its opposition, All Lives Matter. Although there is substantial psychological literature focusing on racial attitudes and intergroup relations, much of this research is experimental, failing to capture diverse and evolving viewpoints of people in the United States. In the present study, our aim was to understand folk definitions and diverse perspectives about the role of race in the United States in participants' own words. We thematically analyzed submissions to The Race Card Project (n = 913), a publicly available platform, and responses from a sample of college students describing perspectives on race (n = 1092). A total of 27 identified themes were organized in four domains: opinions about race, race-based interactions, race and identity, and emotions. Opinions about race ranged from color-blind ideology to racial equality, race as divisive or providing community, and excessive focus on race. References were made to historic and current race relations, assumptions based on skin color, prejudice and discrimination, White privilege, and "reverse racism." These findings contribute to evolving scholarly understanding of race in the United States, with implications for informing initiatives to promote race relations and reduce experiences of discrimination for individuals of color.

AB  - This study examines how changes in gender role attitudes of couples after childbirth relate to women's paid work and the type of childcare used. Identifying attitude-practice dissonances matters because how they get resolved influences mothers' future employment. Previous research examined changes in women's attitudes and employment, or spouses' adaptations to each others' attitudes. This is extended by considering how women and men in couples simultaneously adapt to parenthood in terms of attitude and behavioural changes and by exploring indirect effects of economic constraints. Structural equation models and regression analysis based on the British Household Panel Survey (1991-2007) are applied. The results suggest that less traditional attitudes among women and men are more likely in couples where women's postnatal labour market participation and the use of formal childcare contradict their traditional prenatal attitudes. Women's prenatal earnings have an indirect effect on attitude change of both partners through incentives for maternal employment.

AB  - Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is underutilized in the treatment of drug-dependent, criminal justice populations. This study surveyed criminal justice agencies affiliated with the Criminal Justice Drug Abuse Treatment Studies (CJ-DATS) to assess use of MAT and factors influencing use of MAT. A convenience sample (N = 50) of criminal justice agency respondents (e. g., jails, prisons, parole/probation, and drug courts) completed a survey on MAT practices and attitudes. Pregnant women and individuals experiencing withdrawal were most likely to receive MAT for opiate dependence in jail or prison, whereas those reentering the community from jail or prison were the least likely to receive MAT. Factors influencing use of MAT included criminal justice preferences for drug-free treatment, limited knowledge of the benefits of MAT, security concerns, regulations prohibiting use of MAT for certain agencies, and lack of qualified medical staff. Differences across agency type in the factors influencing use and perceptions of MAT were also examined. MAT use is largely limited to detoxification and maintenance of pregnant women in criminal justice settings. Use of MAT during the community reentry period is minimal. Addressing inadequate knowledge and negative attitudes about MAT may increase its adoption, but better linkages to community pharmacotherapy during the reentry period might overcome other issues, including security, liability, staffing, and regulatory concerns. The CJ-DATS collaborative MAT implementation study to address inadequate knowledge, attitudes, and linkage will be described.

AB  - The assessment of frailty in heart failure patients can help clinicians to build a tailored care plan, aimed at improving the selection of patients likely to benefit from one treatment vs. another, thereby improving outcomes. Although progress has been made in the 'operationalization' of frailty assessment, there is still the need to provide an improved instrument to assess frailty that is easy, quick and at the same time predictive within the setting of a busy clinical practice. Using such an ideal instrument, clinicians would be able to optimize the use of limited health care resources and avoid what has been termed 'frailtyism'. This term, similar to ageism, can be defined as prejudice or discrimination based on the presence of frailty.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to investigate Australian healthcare practitioners' knowledge and attitudes toward binge eating disorder (BED).
   Method: Participants were 175 healthcare professionals, who were randomized to one of two conditions that assessed diagnostic and treatment knowledge of either comorbid BED and obesity or only obesity via case vignette, as well as weight bias toward obese patients.
   Results: Results suggested that participants demonstrated a reluctance to diagnose comorbid BED and obesity, that their knowledge of physical complications associated with BED was limited, and that they indicated a narrow range of evidence-based treatment options. When compared with levels of weight bias expressed by healthcare professionals in previous international studies, Australian clinicians were significantly less biased, however, still largely endorsed 'negative' attitudes toward obesity.
   Conclusion: Findings suggest that future clinical training in eating disorders should therefore focus not only on diagnostic criteria, physical complications and treatment options, but also on practitioner attitudes toward eating and weight.

AB  - The values divide between materialists and postmaterialists, first identified by Ronald Inglehart, continues to define the evolution of partisan loyalties in the United States. Contemporary analysis of voting behavior within the White working-class incorporates the debate between a revisionist school that identifies a contemporary electoral battleground inverted from that of the New Deal era and a traditionalist school that maintains the class alignment established during the New Deal largely remains in effect. The following case study investigating voting behavior in Pennsylvania at the precinct level allows the application of empirical data to identify trends in partisan identity. The study concludes that there is significant evidence that the class loyalties as determinants of partisan attachment established by the New Deal have been superseded by values-driven imperatives. Accordingly, traditionally Democratic, materialist blue-collar constituencies in southwestern Pennsylvania have moved towards the Republican Party, while the opposite has occurred in the traditionally Republican postmaterialist white-collar constituencies of southeastern Pennsylvania. Given the underlying demographics, the Democratic Party has been the net winner from this transfer of allegiances.

AB  - PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION: Despite lung cancer screening guidelines and insurance coverage changes, rates of lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography remain suboptimal among the eligible population in the United States.
   LITERATURE SEARCH: Electronic literature databases, including PubMed, CINAHL (R), PsycINFO, and Google Scholar, were searched.
   DATA EVALUATION: After applying filter information and inclusion and exclusion criteria, 10 articles were reviewed. Methodological rigor was evaluated.
   SYNTHESIS: Based on the social-ecological approach, barriers to lung cancer screening at the individual level, including sociodemographic characteristics, financial cost, lack of knowledge, inaccurate beliefs about lung cancer screening, distrust of the medical system, stigma around smoking and lung cancer, negative attitudes about outcomes of lung cancer screening, and inconvenience of receiving lung cancer screening, were identified. Barriers at the health-system level included lack of information from primary care providers.
   IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Overcoming barriers to lung cancer screening at individual and health-system levels is essential to increase lung cancer screening uptake rates.

AB  - The study on reliability of multi-layer structure of thermo-optic switch under thermal mechanical coupling effect is the basic research subject in modern micro-optoelectronics. Power consumption and response time are the most important performance indexes. Based on the generalized thermoelasticity theory, thermo-optic switch models of various structures are built to simulate the temperature and stress field for structure optimization. The numerical results show that an appropriate cross-section shape can reduce the switch power consumption without prejudice to the response speed, the refractive index of the core layer varies with the temperature, and the inter-layer thermal mismatching stress of the double-ridge structure is the maximum. The above findings will introduce new ideas for research and development and design of new optic switches.

TI  - Elite stigmatization of the unemployed: The association between framing and public attitudes
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - This paper uses a multi-methods approach to explore the social psychological construction of stigma towards the unemployed. Study 1a uses thematic analysis to explore frames used by political elites in speeches at U.K. national party conferences between 1996 and 2016 (n = 43); in study 1b, we track the usage of these frames in six national newspapers (n = 167,723 articles) over the same period showing an increase in the use of negative frames. Study 1c shows that these are associated with national attitudes towards welfare recipients using the British Social Attitude Survey. We find the `Othering' frame is correlated with negative attitudes towards the unemployed, even when controlling for the unemployment rate. This finding supports the claim that social attitudes are related to frames produced in the political and media spheres. We provide theoretical integration between social representations theory and framing which affords development in both domains.

AB  - This article outlines the key characteristics of sustainable housing, including environmental, economic and social dimensions. It uses these characteristics to assess housing and regeneration in Dublin since the early 1980s. While regeneration has improved some areas, there are a number of causes for concern. Barriers to achieving sustainable housing include the lack of a shared vision of sustainable housing, inadequate building regulations and noncompliance with existing regulations, limited knowledge and expertise in green building methods, negative perceptions of higher density housing, poor quality designs, negative attitudes to social mix, an emphasis on demolition, a failure to recognize the need for social regeneration and limited resources. The article concludes that it is essential to target resources at enforcing building regulations, providing sufficient social and affordable housing as well as the social infrastructure required for sustainable communities, adequate management and maintenance, and retrofitting the unsustainable housing constructed in the past.

AB  - A growing body of research suggests that affective computing has many valuable applications in enterprise systems research and e-businesses. This paper explores affective computing techniques for a vital sub-area in enterprise systems-consumer satisfaction measurement. We propose a linguistic-based emotion analysis and recognition method for measuring consumer satisfaction. Using an annotated emotion corpus (Ren-CECps), we first present a general evaluation of customer satisfaction by comparing the linguistic characteristics of emotional expressions of positive and negative attitudes. The associations in four negative emotions are further investigated. After that, we build a fine-grained emotion recognition system based on machine learning algorithms for measuring customer satisfaction; it can detect and recognize multiple emotions using customers' words or comments. The results indicate that blended emotion recognition is able to gain rich feedback data from customers, which can provide more appropriate follow-up for customer relationship management.

AB  - Students of Turkish descent suffer various forms of discrimination in education in Flanders (the northern part of Belgium). Nevertheless, few studies have documented how these discrimination experiences are situated within structures of ethnic inequality in education. Adopting a critical race theory approach, experiences of Turkish Belgian university students were analysed to expose deficit assumptions towards ethnic minorities and push against inequity in education. The accounts of students show the exclusionary treatment they were exposed to despite the dominating discourses of colorblindness in education. Students' experiences with peers highlight the pervasiveness of racism that targeted ethnic minority students based on their ethnic and social class background. Lack of minority representation, ubiquitous microaggressions, and exclusionary curriculum shape students' experiences at university context and affirm White normativity. These findings highlight the urgency of challenging against systems and structures of racism in education. The implications for research and practice are detailed in the concluding section.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to gain a deeper understanding of older women's experiences in the labour market, how they value their job opportunities and perceived attitudes towards them. Qualitative interviews were conducted with seven women aged 57-74 years who all have at least 10 years working experience after they turned 40. Experiencing discrimination in the work force was often mentioned by the women. Their experience is that men are less discriminated against on grounds of age than women. Older women pride themselves for participating in the workforce for being reliable, unselfish and undemanding rather than being experienced, skillful and good at their jobs. The results indicate that it is important to research further the well-being of older women in the labour market and try to change the negative attitudes and discrimination that appear prevalent. Ageism against older women can affect their well-being and health and must be prevented.

AB  - Electronic games transcend demographic boundaries and are a prevalent cultural phenomenon. Marketers see potential of this immersive venue as a way to reach a highly receptive audience with brand messages. Designing games around a brand - advergames - has become a common marketing practice. However, few empirical studies have tested the effectiveness of this communication strategy in delivering the brand message. This paper serves to fill some research gaps and explores the influence of game-product congruity on brand memory and attitudes toward the game. A product-congruent advergame is compared to a product-incongruent advergame using a stimulus brand for a low-involvement product category. The findings indicate that highly congruent games lead to superior memory for the sponsoring brand. However, benefits of these positive memory effects may be negated by the negative attitudes players have toward the highly thematic game for a low-involvement product. Implications are discussed.

AB  - This paper asks: do most Uyghurs perceive themselves to be middle class or lower class? What are the major determinants of their perceptions? Data are drawn from a 2007 survey (N = 900) conducted in Urumchi in China. This paper focuses on individualized and subjective hierarchical differentiation and reports three main findings about class identity among Uyghurs. Firstly, class identity is not closely linked to occupational attainment and income among Uyghurs. However, education is a key determinant of Uyghur class identification. Secondly, psychological well-being measures are not predictors of the choice of class label by Uyghurs. Thirdly, ethnic consciousness is closely related to class identification among Uyghurs, holding main background characteristics constant. Uyghurs give more attention to their group concerns (discrimination, prejudices, intergroup inequality, etc.) than to their individual worries (such as unemployment or stress) when choosing a class label.

AB  - The concept of women engaging in physical recreation was anathema to late nineteenth-century Mexican society. While underlying scepticism continued throughout the decades that followed, post-Revolutionary reforms provided a surprisingly open arena within which both men and women could practice sport. We analyze how the issue of gender influenced these reforms and the degree to which this affected popular participation in sports. Identifying media coverage as a barometer of broader society's perceptions of female sporting activity, we consider the salient trends in the Mexican press, how these changed over time, and the ways in which female journalists approached women's sport. Our findings suggest the need for caution in leaping to gender-based assumptions and provide evidence that, in some respects, male journalists became more enlightened than their female counterparts in confronting underlying prejudices.

AB  - Language is a powerful marker for social discrimination, often associated with stereotypes and prejudices against various social groups. However, less is known about the psychological role of language during ethnolinguistic conflicts. In such conflicts, the political rivalry is closely intertwined with language ideology. We consider two independent paths through which language might trigger social discrimination. The first one is related to linguistic identity, where a person could favor those who speak like her. The second one is related to political identity, where a person could favor those who use the language associated with the person's political views. In the context of the conflict in Ukraine, we find empirical support only for the political identity explanation and no support for the linguistic identity one.

AB  - Managers' attitudes toward depressed employees play an important role in effectively managing depression in the workplace. The present study pilot tested a survey measure of managers' attitudes toward depressed employees (n = 225). Exploratory factor analysis showed evidence of cognitive, affective, and behavioral dimensions in the measure of attitudes. Regression analyses examined relationships between the measure and a range of proposed individual and contextual correlates. Results showed that more negative attitudes toward depressed employees were endorsed by managers who reported a more internal locus of control, higher levels of stress, less familiarity with depression, and greater reticence to seek help. Managers who perceived their organizations to have unsupportive depression disclosure norms reported higher levels of stigma, and those whose organizations had a clear mental health strategy reported lower levels of stigma. The findings have important implications for developing human resource management strategies that deal with the increasing incidence and impact of depression in the workplace.

AB  - Drawing on the theory of social distance, this study examined the extent to which residents' attitudes concerning tourism can predict a sympathetic understanding of tourists. Results from residents within the rapidly emerging inbound tourism market, Japan (n=1569), were analyzed. EFA was undertaken on both residents' attitudes and social distance data. CFA was then undertaken to establish a measurement model, followed by SEM to examine model relationships. The SEM revealed that more negative attitudes concerning tourism were found to have the strongest impact on less sympathetic understanding of tourists and vice versa, revealing that residents' attitudes toward tourists depend in part upon whether attitudes about tourism are positive or negative. This study expands residents' attitude theory by exploring the outcomes of such attitudes, rather than focusing on antecedents. Practical implications are advanced concerning internal marketing strategies, such as disseminating the positive impacts of tourism development to residents.

AB  - Social media have caused information overload for users who normally have limited information processing capability, thus making the issue of task-information fit become critical. The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) provides a theoretical underpinning for understanding the informational influence processes underlying the effectiveness of dual-route persuasion and attitude change. Drawing on the ELM, the current study explores the effectiveness of dual-route persuasion on informational fit-to-task so as to highlight the importance of task-information fit. Specifically, the current study explores the effects of the central route (information quality of social media) and the peripheral route (source credibility of social media and reputation of social media) on informational fit-to-task with focused immersion as an ability variable.

AB  - We addressed how individuals' power influences their judgments regarding corporate transgressions. Based on the Situated Focus Theory of Power, which theorizes that powerful people respond more in accordance to circumstantial factors, we tested the interaction of power and the type of corporate discourse offered by the accused company. Across two studies (overall N = 216), we experimentally primed power (Study 1) and manipulated participants' sense of direct control over the company (Study 2). We consistently found an interaction effect of power and corporate discourse on people's negative attitudes toward the company-particularly on the unwillingness to use the company's products. Particularly, high-power individuals were prone to strongly vary their attitudes based on the mitigative/non-mitigative nature of the discourse, while those low in power were unsusceptible to the type of discourse. The results suggest how the potential rise of consumer power in society may critically influence the consumer-corporate relationships following corporate transgressions.

AB  - We designed and tested the efficacy of a 1-hr training session to mitigate endorsement of questionable research practices (QRPs), research practices that raise ethical concerns and are detrimental to reproducible science, in psychology graduate students. We assessed attitudes toward QRPs 1 week prior to the training, 1 week following the training, and at 2-month follow-up. Participants reported QRPs as less ethically defensible 1 week following the intervention compared with 1 week prior, with attitudes at 2-month follow-up falling in between these time points. Results were maintained even when controlling for socially desirable responding. Participants who rated the training more favorably demonstrated greater attitude change toward detrimental research practices. These results provide evidence that an intervention to educate graduate students about QRPs and their negative impact on science can mitigate consideration of such practices as ethically defensible, although such benefits may not hold over time without additional training sessions.

AB  - Background In western Kenya, women often present with late-stage cervical cancer despite prior contact with the health care system. The aim of this study was to predict primary health care providers' behaviour in examining women who present with abnormal discharge or bleeding. Methods This was a cross-sectional survey using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). A sample of primary health care practitioners in western Kenya completed a 59-item questionnaire. Structural equation modelling was used to identify the determinants of providers' intention to perform a gynaecological examination. Bivariate analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between the external variables and intention. Results Direct measures of subjective norms (DMSN), direct measures of perceived behavioural control (DMPBC), and indirect measures of attitude predicted the intention to examine patients. Negative attitudes toward examining women had a suppressor effect on the prediction of health workers' intentions. However, the predictors of intention with the highest coefficients were the external variables being a nurse (beta = 0.32) as opposed to a clinical officer and workload of attending less than 50 patients per day (beta = 0.56). In bivariate analysis with intention to perform a gynaecological examination, there was no evidence that working experience, being female, having a lower workload, or being a private practitioner were associated with a higher intention to conduct vaginal examinations. Clinical officers and nurses were equally likely to examine women. Conclusions The TPB is a suitable theoretical basis to predict the intention to perform a gynaecological examination. Overall, the model predicted 47% of the variation in health care providers' intention to examine women who present with recurrent vaginal bleeding or discharge. Direct subjective norms (health provider's conformity with what their colleagues do or expect them to do), PBC (providers need to feel competent and confident in performing examinations in women), and negative attitudes toward conducting vaginal examination accounted for the most variance. External variables in this study also contributed to the overall variance. As the model in this study could not explain 53% of the variance, investigating other external variables that influence the intention to examine women should be undertaken.

AB  - As the relationship between Cuba and the United States evolves, many Americans are entertaining the idea of travel to Cuba. This study used the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to examine predictors of US residents' intentions to travel to Cuba across three time horizons: 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years. TPB constructs were administered to a cross-sectional panel of US residents. Results varied by time horizon, with US residents' negative attitudes toward Cuba having a positive and significant influence on their intention to visit Cuba within one year. This finding suggests that some US residents match Plog's Allocentric profile of tourists and that the current rough edges of Cuba are what attract them to travel in the short rather than long term. Findings from this study provide baseline data that is valuable for Cuban and American tourism organizations, should the US market become more accessible.

AB  - This experiment revealed that emotional news frames (anger-inducing vs. sadness-inducing) affect people's emotional response to a corporate crisis such as a cell phone battery explosion accident. The distinct emotions induced by different news frames influenced individuals' information processing (i.e., heuristic vs. systematic processing) and the evaluation of the company differently. Participants exposed to anger-inducing crisis news read the news less closely and had more negative attitudes toward the company than those exposed to sadness-inducing news. Also, emotional frames affected how individuals perceived the different types of corporate responses (relief-focused message vs. punishment-focused message; emotional appeal vs. no emotional appeal). The advantage of emotional appeals was found contingent on how the crisis was previously framed by the media. Findings demonstrate a potential for developing effective corporate response strategies in a given crisis situation, considering the type of crisis, how it has been framed by the media, the publics' emotional responses, and the use of emotional appeals.

AB  - Teaching sociological perspectives on race and ethnicity is challenging due to the predominance of color-blind ideology in our supposed postracial society. Students enter the classroom hesitant to discuss race or acknowledge ongoing racism. To better educate students and bridge the racial distance between them, we developed small-group, team-facilitated dialogues as a core course component. We explore results of pre- and postsurveys from students in two sections of Sociology of Race and Ethnicity taught by the first author, which featured dialogues, and one similarly structured offering from a different instructor without dialogues. In comparison to the class offering without dialogues, students who completed the dialogues showed greater mastery of core sociological concepts related to race and an increased commitment to supporting and promoting racial and ethnic equality.

AB  - The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has increasingly deferred to States' margin of appreciation when considering interferences with the right to manifest religion under Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). In contrast, the Advisory Committee (AC) on the Framework Convention on National Minorities (FCNM), despite originally being feared to be a highly politicised body, has allowed States very little room for manoeuvre when considering the implementation of Convention rights. In order to explore these seemingly contradictory positions, this article examines the approaches of the ECtHR and the AC towards two controversial manifestations of religion: the right to construct places of worship and the right to wear religious clothing. It argues that the ECtHR, by developing minimum standards that defer to the prejudices of the majority, is in danger of undermining the progress made by the AC towards establishing consistent minority rights standards throughout Europe.

AB  - Mental illness stigma refers to negative stereotypes and prejudices about people with mental illness, and is a widespread phenomenon with damaging social, psychological, and economic consequences. Despite considerable policy attention, mental illness stigma does not appear to have declined significantly in recent years. Interpersonal contact with persons with mental illness has been identified as a promising approach to reducing mental illness stigma. This study investigates the effect of contact with mental health treatment users on stigma using an observational research design that is free of self-selection bias. The research design is based on the quasi-experiment in which university students are assigned to live together as roommates. Survey data were collected from first-year undergraduates at two large universities in the United States (N = 1605). Multivariable regressions were used to estimate the effect of assignment to a roommate with a history of mental health treatment on a brief measure of stigmatizing attitudes. Contact with a treatment user caused a modest increase in stigma (standardized effect size = 0.15, p = 0.03). This effect was present among students without a prior treatment history of their own, but not among those with a prior history. The findings indicate that naturalistic contact alone does not necessarily yield a reduction in mental illness stigma. This may help explain why stigma has not declined in societies such as the United States even as treatment use has risen substantially. The findings also highlight the importance of isolating the specific components, beyond contact per se, that are necessary to reduce stigma in contact-based interventions. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Cervical cancer is the leading cause of women's cancer deaths in Senegal, but few medical personnel are trained to perform cervical cancer screening. In rural areas, the situation is worse. To remedy this, a collaborative of researchers and stakeholders trained local health-care workers in cervical cancer screening through the "training-of-trainers" method. However, lack of cancer screening knowledge, barriers, and a hard-to-reach population may jeopardize the collaborative's efforts. The purpose of this study is to map the health communication infrastructure by applying communication infrastructure theory to assess general health and cancer screening knowledge, as well as attitudes and barriers toward screening. Results from focus groups and interviews show that women have minimal knowledge of cervical cancer. Moreover, health workers report detrimental attitudes in menopausal women. Our findings identified routes for information dissemination and attitude change including community radio and local health talks.

AB  - Acceptance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) may be predicted by individual psychological correlates, examined here. Study 1 reports confirmatory validation of the General Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS) following initial validation elsewhere. Confirmatory Factor Analysis confirmed the two-factor structure (Positive, Negative) and showed good convergent and divergent validity with a related scale. Study 2 tested whether psychological factors (Big Five personality traits, corporate distrust, and general trust) predicted attitudes towards AI. Introverts had more positive attitudes towards AI overall, likely because of algorithm appreciation. Conscientiousness and agreeableness were associated with forgiving attitudes towards negative aspects of AI. Higher corporate distrust led to negative attitudes towards AI overall, while higher general trust led to positive views of the benefits of AI. The dissociation between general trust and corporate distrust may reflect the public's attributions of the benefits and drawbacks of AI. Results are discussed in relation to theory and prior findings.

AB  - Interviewing is considered a key form of qualitative inquiry in psychology that yields rich data on lived experience and meaning making of life events. Interviews that contain multiple components informed by specific epistemologies have the potential to provide particularly nuanced perspectives on psychological experience. We offer a methodological model for a multicomponent interview that draws upon both pragmatic and constructivist epistemologies to examine generational differences in the experience of identity development, stress, and health among contemporary sexual minorities in the United States. Grounded in theories of life course, narrative, and intersectionality, we designed and implemented a multicomponent protocol that was administered among a diverse sample of three generations of sexual minority individuals. For each component, we describe the purpose and utility, underlying epistemology, foundational psychological approach, and procedure, and we provide illustrative data from interviewees. We discuss procedures undertaken to ensure methodological integrity in the process of data collection, illustrating the implementation of recent guidelines for qualitative inquiry in psychology. We highlight the utility of this qualitative multicomponent interview to examine the ways in which sexual minorities of distinct generations have made meaning of significant social change over the past half-century.

AB  - This study investigates the primary effect of positive, neutral, and negative exposure to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) TV portrayals in entertainment programs on attitudes toward the LGBT community and the Secondary Transfer Effect (STE) of such exposure on attitudes toward people with Asperger's Disorder (the secondary out-group), controlling for face-to-face and online contacts with both out-groups. Research was conducted using a mixed methods approach. Quantitative Study 1 used an online survey of 716 Israeli Jews, to investigate primary and secondary effects of TV exposure to LGBT portrayals. The positive primary effect of TV exposure was shown-regardless of LGBT portrayals perceived as positive, neutral, or negative. STE of TV exposure to neutral and negative LGBT portrayals is likely to diminish social distance to people with Asperger's Disorder, while no STE was found with positive LGBT portrayals. Full mediation effect of attitudes toward the LGBT community was found. Qualitative Study 2, based on 52 in-depth interviews, was conducted in order to reveal the hidden mechanisms of these effects, examining the parasocial experience and its interpretations by the viewers. According to qualitative findings, the positive primary and secondary effects of negative exposure may be explained by varied interpretations of gay portrayals on TV by different people depending on social background and life experience, opposite reaction on stereotypical gay portrayals on TV, and asymmetrical negative-positive heuristic. Given the important role of TV in fostering more positive intergroup relations, this research revealed sources of prejudice reduction and increase in tolerance toward "others" for society at large.

AB  - In previous work on collective motion, agents always tend to imitate the behavior strategies of higher ranks; this model is called rank-based strategy diffusion. Unfortunately, this model is, by itself, insufficient in causal multiagent societies where agents may have causal links with each other. In causal environments, agents will develop positive (or negative) attitudes (favor) about those who can increase (or decrease) their own utilities. Naturally, for collective motion, agents will be inclined to imitate those who are well-favored and avoid those who are disfavored. This paper presents the concept of favor in causal environments, and presents a model for favor-based strategy diffusion. In the proposed model, agents in causal environments are inclined to associate with and imitate the strategies of those who are well-favored. Obviously, such diffusion effects well reflect the impact of causal relations in the real world. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article examines whether crimes motivated by, or which demonstrate, gender 'hostility' should be included within the current framework of hate crime legislation in England and Wales. The article uses the example of rape to explore the parallels (both conceptual and evidential) between gender-motivated violence and other 'archetypal' forms of hate crime. It is asserted that where there is clear evidence of gender hostility during the commission of an offence, a defendant should be pursued in law additionally as a hate crime offender. In particular it is argued that by focusing on the hate-motivation of many sexual violence offenders, the criminal justice system can begin to move away from its current focus on the 'sexual' motivations of offenders and begin to more effectively challenge the gendered prejudices that are frequently causal to such crimes.

AB  - Objective The current study examined whether variations in patient weight and eating-disorder behavior frequency influenced the recognition of bulimia nervosa (BN) and the perception that it is a serious mental health concern. Method Participants (N = 320) were randomly assigned to one of six conditions in which they read a vignette describing a young woman with BN. Each vignette was identical except for the variables of interest: weight status (underweight, healthy-weight, and overweight), and symptom frequency (daily or weekly binge-eating episodes and purging). Results Participants were more likely to have negative attitudes toward and blame the patient with overweight. Participants were less likely to believe that the patient with overweight was experiencing mental illness and that her problems were too serious to handle on her own. There were no significant differences by symptom frequency. Discussion Findings suggest the presence of weight stigma and that overweight might impede the recognition of eating disorders.

AB  - To address the highly-complex and emotionally-charged nature of issues concerning older drivers, we engaged in the development and evaluation of a research-based applied theater production. A quasiexperimental pretest-posttest group design was used to assess change in attitudes and beliefs, derived from social science theories, of older drivers and other stakeholders. After viewing the play, older adults showed decreases in their positive attitudes toward driving and intention to continuing driving. The findings for the older adults appeared to be driven by the responses of the women in the group. Stakeholders showed no change in attitudes about older drivers. Data collected two weeks after the play was viewed confirmed that audience members found the play informative and that it promoted discussion about the topic. The findings from this study provide important new information about how exposure to an applied theater production brings about attitude change.

AB  - Data obtained from a national study of male victims or survivors of intimate partner abuse (IPA) indicate that the experience (current or past) of abuse and with service use may predict a positive perception toward help seeking. However, marital status and a tendency to minimize problems may predict negative attitudes toward help seeking. Empirical evidence from this mixed-method study suggests that male victims face many interpersonal and societal obstacles. Feeling uncomfortable when requesting assistance, men in IPA situations are affected by a masking factor that causes them to hide their situation and contributes to a misconception factor that causes people to treat men as the sole perpetrator. Although men are eligible, services may not be perceived as being available or helpful. The study yields important implications for social work practice, and the findings result in several recommendations for increased awareness about IPA, advocacy for gender-inclusive services, revision of laws and policies, increased research, and emphasis on funded and anonymous services.

AB  - Among sexual minorities, bisexuals are at the greatest risk for poor health due in part to prejudice and stigma. This research examined associations of bisexual-specific minority stress and health among cisgender (non-transgender) and transgender adults with bisexual orientation. Participants were 488 adults (378 cisgender women, 49 cisgender men, 61 transgender individuals), age 18 to 66years, with bisexual orientation based on identity and/or attractions to multiple genders. Participants completed an online survey. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were conducted with sexual minority stress and bisexual-specific minority stress as the predictors and physical health, measured by the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36), as the outcome. Models controlled for demographic variables. Moderation analyses were conducted to test for gender differences. Greater bisexual-specific minority stress significantly predicted poorer overall physical health (=-0.16), greater pain (=-0.16), and poorer general health (=-0.25) above and beyond the effects of sexual minority stress. Gender moderated the association between bisexual-specific minority stress and health, such that bisexual-specific minority stress predicted overall physical health and role limitations for transgender individuals but not for cisgender women. Addressing bisexual-specific minority stress is necessary to improve the health and well-being of bisexual individuals.

AB  - The information dissemination in social networks is affected by many factors. However, node attitude which is an important influence factor of information dissemination in social network have not been fully considered in the previous works. Aiming at the problem of the influence of node attitude on information dissemination, this paper proposes an information propagation model based on evolutionary game. Firstly, from the individual point of view, the node's attitude update rules are defined according to non-Bayesian social learning rules. Secondly, an inter-node game matrix based on attitude value is established. Based on the evolution analysis paradigm, an information dissemination model based on node attitude is established. The equilibrium solution of dynamic equations is replicated for both positive and negative attitudes, and the corresponding equilibrium points are stabilized. The validity of the proposed model is verified by numerical analysis and simulation experiments. They all show that the different attitudes of nodes play an important role in information dissemination.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the association between psychosocial determinants of unprotected receptive anal intercourse (URAI) and unprotected insertive anal intercourse (UIAI). Data from 417 HIV positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study from April 1999 to March 2012 were analyzed and adjusted odds were calculated. It was found that 66% (n = 277) and 72% (n = 299) reported any UIAI or URAI over follow-up, respectively. Cumulative cART-years (median = 5.30 years) was associated with 33 and 47% increases in UIAI and URAI, respectively. Not having reduced concern about HIV transmission (UIAI: OR 0.37, p-value = 0.0004; URAI: OR 0.57, p-value = 0.04), increased safe sex fatigue (UIAI: OR 2.32, 95% p-value = 0.0002; URAI: OR 1.94, p-value = 0.003), and sexual sensation seeking (UIAI: OR 1.76, p-value = 0.002; URAI: OR 1.56, p-value = 0.02) were associated with UIAI and URAI. Serosorting was associated with UIAI (OR 6.11, p-value < 0.0001) and URAI (OR 6.80, p-value < 0.0001). Findings suggest that negative attitudes about HIV transmission are sustained among older men who have sex with men.

AB  - Objectives Negative attitudes towards ageing have been associated with poor mental well-being, and protective factors are not well-understood. This study examined the relationship between ageing attitudes and symptoms of anxiety and depression, and the potential moderating effect of age, and buffering effects of social support, physical activity and education. Methods This study used a subsample of 482 adults aged 50+ years from a mail questionnaire study in Brisbane, Australia. Data were analysed using linear regression. Results People with more positive ageing attitudes reported fewer symptoms of anxiety and depression, with no moderating effect of age. There was a significant interaction between ageing attitudes and education on depression, and a similar trend for anxiety. Conclusion This study confirmed the adverse impacts of negative ageing attitudes on mental health and indicated that those with low education may be most vulnerable. This has implications for future research and targeting interventions for mental health promotion.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this article is to examine the inter-war history of the Raffles Library in Singapore with the aim of understanding what the management of the library believed its role should be as well as the role others in that society considered that it should fulfill.
   Design/methodology/approach - The article is based on historical research using archival sources.
   Findings - To a great extent the management of the library narrowly construed the institution's mission in terms of appealing to that class of persons likely to become paying members that is, the European elite and its high-level local collaborators. Financial constraints, relations between the library and museum as well as prevalent negative attitudes regarding class and race in colonial society are likely reasons for the lack of sustained attention to non-European populations.
   Originality/value - The library history of much of Asia remains relatively unexplored, especially from a viewpoint that stresses the importance of social context to library structure and operation.

AB  - Employee attitudes with regard to the usefulness of external knowledge may influence a firm's extent of inter-organizational knowledge transactions. Prior research has focused on "not-invented-here (NIH)" tendencies, which refer to negative attitudes in organizations toward the acquisition of knowledge from external sources. In this research, we develop the concept of "not-sold-here (NSH)" tendencies, which result from protective attitudes in firms toward the external exploitation of knowledge, for example, technology licensing. We show conceptually how NSH tendencies develop and how they can influence the extent of outward knowledge transfer. We test five hypotheses regarding antecedents and consequences of NSH tendencies with data from 152 firms spanning multiple industries. The empirical findings show that NSH tendencies exist in organizations and that they constitute a major barrier to the implementation of external knowledge commercialization strategies. The concept of NSH therefore helps explain the varying degrees of activity in external knowledge exploitation, and it contributes to understanding particular microfoundations of dynamic capabilities.

AB  - The use of prefabricated building systems offers considerable advantages in cases wherein extensive solutions to housing problems are immediately required. However, this system's share in the overall building housing market in Libya is nearly negligible. This study attempts to explore the current situation of prefabricated building systems and their potential to address Libyan housing conditions. The perspectives of local experts in the construction industry are mainly considered. Qualitative analysis is conducted by using information obtained from interviews. Results show that prefabricated building can improve the Libyan housing industry; however, government and prospective practitioners who lack information, knowledge, and know-how of prefabricated building applications are often prejudiced against their use. Most of the interviewees also cannot fully provide conceptual or policy guidelines, which may serve as the starting point for the development of prefabricated building in Libya.

AB  - To date, sport research on sexuality has primarily focused on White lesbian, bisexual, and gay (LBG) persons or heterosexual racial minorities; few studies have provided meaningful insight into how sexual prejudice affects racial minorities. Thus, the purpose of the current study is to explore the intersection of race, sexual orientation, and gender in the context of collegiate sport and examine the influence of multiple marginalized identities on organizational outcomes. Grounded in intersectionality literature and feminist standpoint theory, semistructured interviews were conducted with 15 current and former intercollegiate sport employees. Results revealed four higher order themes: (a) racially influenced experiences, (b) managing lesbian-ness, (c) organizational climate, and (d) organizational outcomes. This research expands the theoretical knowledge of intersectionality, introduces a turnover intention tipping point phenomenon, and provides mangers with firsthand feedback on current policy and norms that may decrease satisfaction.

AB  - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which began in early 2020, is a global public health crisis. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is necessary to promote vaccine administration and preventive behaviors (e.g., mask, handwashing, social distancing). However, some people have negative attitudes toward vaccine administration and preventive behaviors. Based on the information-deficit model, the present study investigated how scientific literacy and perceived understanding of COVID-19 are associated with attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccinations and preventive behaviors. The findings demonstrated that both scientific literacy and perceived understanding of COVID-19 vaccines were positively associated with attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. Additionally, perceived understanding of COVID-19 preventive behaviors (but not scientific literacy) was positively associated with attitudes toward/practice of COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Collectively, our findings revealed the role of cognitive factors in preventing the global public health crisis and demonstrated the roles of objective and subjective knowledge on attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccinations and preventive behaviors.

AB  - To understand the conditions fostering positive outcomes of inclusive schooling, this two-wave study examined the role of individual change in trust and sympathy for adolescents' cross-group friendships and inclusive attitudes toward students with low academic achievement. Cross-group friendships, intergroup trust, intergroup sympathy, and inclusive attitudes were obtained from surveys completed by 1,122 Swiss adolescents (M-age T1=11.54years, M-age T2=12.58years) from 61 school classes. Results from a parallel latent change score model revealed that the number of cross-group friendships positively related to individual change in trust and sympathy; this growing trust and sympathy in turn predicted adolescents' inclusive attitudes. These findings are discussed regarding theories of intergroup contact and inclusive schooling.

AB  - Efforts to identify and address social inequities in HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) access are urgently needed. We investigated early-adopting PrEP prescribers' beliefs about how stigma contributes to PrEP access disparities in health care and explored potential intervention strategies within the context of PrEP service delivery. US-based PrEP prescribers were recruited through professional networks and participant referrals. Qualitative interviews were conducted, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. Participants (n = 18) were primarily male (72%); white (39%) or Asian (33%); and heterosexual (56%). Most practiced in the Northeastern (67%) or Southern (22%) United States; were physicians (94%); and specialized in HIV/infectious disease (89%). Participants described multiple forms of structural and interpersonal stigma impeding PrEP access. The requirement that PrEP be prescribed was a perceived deterrent for populations with medical mistrust and/or low health literacy. Practice norms such as discussing PrEP only in response to patient requests were seen as favoring more privileged groups. When probed about personally held biases, age-related stereotypes were the most readily acknowledged, including assumptions about older adults being sexually inactive and uncomfortable discussing sex. Participants criticized providers who chose not to prescribe PrEP within their clinical practice, particularly those whose decision reflected personal values related to condomless sex or discomfort communicating about sex with their patients. Suggested solutions included standardizing PrEP service delivery across patients and increasing cultural competence training. These early insights from a select sample of early-adopting providers illuminate mechanisms through which stigma could compromise PrEP access for key populations and corresponding points of intervention within the health care system.

AB  - Genetic testing can advance cancer prevention if current screening behaviors improve. Increased prevalence of high-risk genotypes within specific religious groups, use of religious venues for recruiting to genetic screening, and ethical-religious considerations argue for exploring the role of religiosity in forming genetic testing decisions. This study uses the theory of reasoned action and structural equation modeling to test the effects of religious involvement, attitudes, knowledge, and previous experience on intent-to-obtain genetic testing within a representative sample of 1,824 U.S. adults. A majority of respondents indicate willingness to test, especially for curable disorders. Attitudes, knowledge, and previous experience have significant direct effects, and religious involvement has an indirect effect, through its negative effect on attitudes, on intent-to-test. High religious involvement is associated with more negative attitudes toward genetic testing. The findings underscore the need to refine genetic testing outreach efforts to account for multiple influences on consumer intent-to-test.

AB  - For a wide range of taxa, partial prey consumption (PPC) is a frequent occurrence. PPC may arise from physiological constraints to gut capacity or digestive rate. Alternatively, PPC may represent an optimal foraging strategy. Assessments that clearly distinguish between these causes are rare and have been conducted only for invertebrate species that are ambush predators with extra-intestinal digestion (e. g., wolf spiders). We present the first strong test for the cause of PPC in a cursorial vertebrate predator with intestinal digestion: wolves (Canis lupus) feeding on moose (Alces alces). Previous theoretical assessments indicate that if PPC represents an optimal foraging strategy and is not caused by physiological limitations, then mean carcass utilization is negatively correlated with mean kill rate and the utilization of individual carcasses is uncorrelated with time between kills. Wolves exhibit exactly this pattern. We explore how the typical portrayal of PPC by wolves has been not only misleading but also detrimental to conservation by promoting negative attitudes toward wolves.

AB  - Background Opportunities for meaningful engagement with the homeless can alter negative attitudes. The purpose of this study was to assess changes in attitudes towards the homeless among undergraduate nursing students participating in a service-learning foot soak experience. Methods This was a prospective, pretest, and posttest interventional study. Student attitudes were measured through: (a) the attitudes toward homelessness inventory and (b) thematic analysis of a guided reflection on the experience. Results Mean posttest total scores (mean = 50.06; standard deviation = 7.004) were significantly (P = .001) higher from mean pretest scores (mean = 47.06; standard deviation = 5.455), indicating more positive attitudes towards the homeless (n = 47) after the clinic. Three categories of themes reflected student experiences are as follows: (a) benefits, (b) context, and, (c) potential consequences. Conclusions A foot soak clinic can increase students' understanding of experiences faced by homeless persons through genuine human interaction, and has benefits to community members and learners.

AB  - Despite some changes to the way that people with intellectual disabilities (ID) are viewed in society, negative attitudes prevail. One of the aspirations of the 2012 Paralympic games was to influence the public's attitudes toward people with disabilities. The aim of this study was to investigate whether stimuli depicting people with ID performing at Paralympic level of competition change attitudes toward ID. A mixed randomized comparison design was employed comparing 2 groups: those who viewed Paralympic-level ID sport footage and information and those who viewed Olympic footage and information. One hundred fourteen students, mean age 25 yr, were administered measures of implicit (subconscious) attitudes toward disability and explicit (belief-based) attitudes toward ID. Implicit attitudes significantly changed in a positive direction for both groups. The findings provide evidence that both Paralympic (ID) and Olympic media coverage may have at least a short-term effect on attitudes toward people with disabilities.

AB  - Studies have suggested that people voting for Brexit were motivated by anti-globalization, anti-multiculturalism and anti-elite sentiments. However, little is known about how these factors are related and whether citizens in other member states share similar reasons for wanting to exit the EU. Methodologically, this question is addressed by utilizing path models on data from the European Social Survey, with respondents in 17 countries. Empirically, this article reveals considerable cross-country variation, which implies that motivations for voting Leave should be assessed on a country-by-country basis. Yet, two main pathways are identified. First, lower education is related to more negative attitudes towards multiculturalism, which increases the probability of voting Leave. Second, lower income decreases the level of trust in the political establishment, which again increases the probability of voting Leave. Theoretically, this implies that the anti-globalization model is subsumed by the anti-multiculturalism and anti-elite models, giving rise to two new mechanisms.

AB  - Objective: This study examined female college students' knowledge, attitudes, and breast cancer screening and determined significant predictors of breast self-examination, clinical breast examination, and mammography among this population. Participants: A convenience sample of 1,074 college women from 3 universities participated in the research. Methods: Respondents completed an online version of the Toronto Breast Self-examination Instrument as well as questions developed by the authors. Results: Descriptive statistics showed gaps in college women's knowledge of breast health and negative attitudes toward screening that were relative to age. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses revealed that knowledge, attitudes, and copay were significant predictors of screening, whereas family history and ethnicity were not. Conclusions: This study supported previous smaller-sample studies that showed college women to be a priority population for breast health education and revealed new significant factors that should be addressed in health education for this group.

AB  - This study investigated how the prevalent visual depiction of obesity in the media promotes stigmatization of obese individuals. Particularly, this study proposed and tested the two sequential mechanisms which were not explicated in the previous models but indispensable in stigma research: (1) the disease avoidance response (i.e. discomfort for physical contact) and (2) dehumanizing perception. Results of two experiments overall supported the extended model: the headless photos of obese individuals triggered the disease avoidance responses, which sequentially increased the dehumanizing perception of and negative attitudes toward obese individuals. The identity trait (e.g. gender) match increased readers' level of social identification with obese people and alleviated the disease avoidance response when they saw the photo of the obese model as a whole being. By contrast, the opposite effects (i.e. disidentification and heightened discomfort) were found when the participants saw the headless photo of the obese model of the same gender.

AB  - Past studies have found that multicultural approaches to diversity can reduce prejudice and stimulate positive intergroup relations. The current research explored a possible negative side effect of multiculturalism: whether organizational diversity structures geared toward multiculturalism can conceal racial discrimination and delegitimize racial discrimination claims. Three studies found that, even when objective information was indicative of discrimination, both Whites and racial minorities perceived organizations which had diversity policies emphasizing multiculturalism as more fair toward minorities. This perception of (false) fairness led individuals to perceive less racial discrimination and to view claims of racial discrimination against that organization as less legitimate. Furthermore, we found that organizational multiculturalism and externally granted diversity awards both produced a (false) fairness effect. The results suggest an irony of multicultural diversity structures: They can create a false fairness effect that conceals and delegitimizes discrimination.

AB  - Few studies examine how relationship factors influence sexual risk. We investigated gender differences of the influence of relationship functioning on sexual risk behavior and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among 296 young pregnant couples. Compared to women, men were twice as likely to have a concurrent partner, were less likely to intend to be monogamous in the future, had less HIV/STI knowledge and more perceived risk for HIV/STI, negative attitudes and efficacy toward condom use (all P < 0.05). For men, poor relationship functioning related to less intentions to be monogamous, more partner concurrency, worse sexual communication, and more condom use. For women, poor relationship functioning related to worse sexual communication and less condom use. In addition, women who had good relationship functioning and women who had partners with poor relationship functioning were more likely to have an STI. These results demonstrate the need to include heterosexual men and relationship factors in HIV prevention.

AB  - The present study investigated how the magnitude the word blindness suggestion effect on Stroop interference depended on hypnotic suggestibility when given as an imaginative suggestion (i.e. not post-hypnotic suggestion) and under conditions in which hypnosis was not mentioned. Hypnotic suggestibility is shown to be a significant predictor of the magnitude of the imaginative word blindness suggestion effect under these conditions. This is therefore the first study to show a linear relationship between the imaginative word blindness suggestion effect and hypnotic suggestibility across the whole hypnotizability spectrum. The results replicate previous findings showing that highs respond to the word blindness suggestion to a greater extent than lows but extend previous work by showing that the advantage for those higher on the hypnotizability spectrum occurs even in a non-hypnotic context. Negative attitudes about hypnosis may not explain the failure to observe similar effects of the word blindness suggestion in less hypnotizable individuals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Clinician bias contributes to healthcare disparities, and the language used to describe a patient may reflect that bias. Although medical records are an integral method of communicating about patients, no studies have evaluated patient records as a means of transmitting bias from one clinician to another.
   To assess whether stigmatizing language written in a patient medical record is associated with a subsequent physician-in-training's attitudes towards the patient and clinical decision-making.
   Randomized vignette study of two chart notes employing stigmatizing versus neutral language to describe the same hypothetical patient, a 28-year-old man with sickle cell disease.
   A total of 413 physicians-in-training: medical students and residents in internal and emergency medicine programs at an urban academic medical center (54% response rate).
   Attitudes towards the hypothetical patient using the previously validated Positive Attitudes towards Sickle Cell Patients Scale (range 7-35) and pain management decisions (residents only) using two multiple-choice questions (composite range 2-7 representing intensity of pain treatment).
   Exposure to the stigmatizing language note was associated with more negative attitudes towards the patient (20.6 stigmatizing vs. 25.6 neutral, p < 0.001). Furthermore, reading the stigmatizing language note was associated with less aggressive management of the patient's pain (5.56 stigmatizing vs. 6.22 neutral, p = 0.003).
   Stigmatizing language used in medical records to describe patients can influence subsequent physicians-in-training in terms of their attitudes towards the patient and their medication prescribing behavior. This is an important and overlooked pathway by which bias can be propagated from one clinician to another. Attention to the language used in medical records may help to promote patient-centered care and to reduce healthcare disparities for stigmatized populations.

AB  - Background Considering (1) that reading proficiency is fundamental for educational success, (2) the reciprocal relationship between affective aspects of reading (e.g., reading attitude and motivation) and reading behaviour and ability, (3) the alarming decline in students' reading attitude throughout primary and secondary education and (4) the rather large group of pre-service teachers starting teacher education with a negative reading attitude, this study used a person-centred approach to examine the development of pre-service teachers' reading attitude throughout teacher education and how it relates to their perceived reading ability and reading behaviour. Methods In a sample of 128 pre-service teachers, cluster (movement) analysis was executed at the start of teacher education and near graduation to identify different reading attitude clusters and possible changes throughout teacher education. A distinction between purpose (recreational vs academic) and context (personally vs socially oriented) was made when assessing reading attitude components. Results Three reading attitude profiles (i.e., personally oriented, socially oriented and low attitude) were corroborated at both measurement occasions. Cluster movement analysis identified that the majority remained in the same profile over time (53-62%). When pre-service teachers did switch profile, they most likely evolved towards the personally- or socially-oriented profile (reading as a mere personal activity vs willing to interact about reading, respectively). Convergent validity evidence was found in that pre-service teachers in the low-attitude profile (24%) were least likely to read and perceived themselves as least competent in reading. They further appeared to be least willing to invest in reading promotion in their future school(s) of all profiles. Conclusions It may be worrisome that about one fourth of the pre-service teachers in this sample enters the profession with a rather negative reading attitude. Encouragingly, the majority of pre-service teachers either retained or increased their positive reading attitude throughout teacher education. Highlights What is already known about this topic Differences in reading attitude are related to differences in reading behaviour and perceived reading ability. There is a declining trend in primary and secondary school students' reading attitude, starting at the end of primary school. Nearly half of all pre-service teachers start teacher education with a negative reading attitude. What this paper adds Person-centred movement analysis provided a basis to map the stability and change of pre-service teachers' reading attitude profiles' throughout teacher education. Pre-service teachers' reading attitude remains rather stable throughout teacher education and is related to reading behaviour and perceived reading ability. Almost one fourth of the pre-service teachers graduate with a quite negative reading attitude. Implications for theory, policy or practice The urgency to address reading attitude more adequately in teacher education and to attend more closely to pre-service teachers' individual differences in reading attitude. The importance of using a longitudinal approach to gain insight into reading attitude development throughout teacher education and preferably also during the first crucial years in the profession.
   This longitudinal study could be a possible step in the process of (re)designing teacher education programs and continuing professional development trajectories in relation to reading attitude.

KW  - HISTORIES
AB  - Recent interventions suggest that the history of India's nationalist movement might be profitably reconstructed with reference to visual culture as a way of counteracting both dominant Congress teleologies and the colonial prejudices embedded in governmental records. This article furthers this hypothesis by undertaking a close examination of Desh Chintan, a rich nationalist image from the 1930s. Grounding Desh Chintan against a matrix of archival sources, banned literature, oral history interviews and other posters of the era presents a substantially different picture of the way in which the anti-colonial movement was conceived in the 1930s. This analysis suggests that there was a moment in the freedom struggle in which support for acts of retributive revolutionary violence were unproblematically maintained alongside genuine enthusiasm for the Gandhian program of non-violence.

AB  - Numerous field experiments have demonstrated the existence of discrimination in labor markets against specific minority groups. This paper uses a correspondence test to determine whether this discrimination is due to prejudice against specific groups, or a general preference for the majority group. Three groups of identical fabricated resumes are sent to help-wanted advertisements in Chicago newspapers: one with Anglo-Saxon names, one with African-American names, and one with fictitious foreign names whose ethnic origin is unidentifiable to most Americans. Resumes with Anglo-Saxon names generate nearly one third more call-backs than identical resumes with non Anglo-Saxon ones, either African-American or Foreign. We take this as evidence that discriminatory behavior is part of a larger pattern of unequal treatment of any member of non-majority groups, ethnic homophily. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - While negative attitudes within the social work community toward clients struggling with addiction may not be ubiquitous, there is evidence that such attitudes remain problematic. Interestingly, there is very little research available concerning factors that may be involved with these adverse attitudes. While extant research suggests social workers demonstrate low empathy toward clients with a Substance Use Disorder (SUD), there is little empirical exploration of the relationship between dispositional empathy and subsequent attitudes. Similarly, a practitioner's spirituality may also influence their views of SUD clients, yet there is little evidence investigating this relationship. This study explored the relationship between empathy, spirituality, and attitudes toward clients with SUDs. Results demonstrated that both empathy and spirituality have some predictive potential and that some dimensions of empathy and spirituality interact. The results also showed that different dimensions were important for social work students and social work practitioners.

AB  - In many real-world situations, unfairness of outcomes is not directly related to fairness related properties of individual decisions; it is an unintended consequence of procedures in which individuals interact. Attitudes to such unfairness may be revealed in emotions of anger and resentment rather than in preferences over alternative decision outcomes. We conjecture that inequality is viewed with relatively little disfavour when it results from procedures that allow individuals equal strategic opportunities. We define a concept of procedural fairness which formalises intuitions about equality of opportunity. We report a Vendetta Game experiment in which negative attitudes to inequality can be expressed in costly and counter-productive 'taking' of co-players' assets. A given degree of material inequality induces more taking if the procedure that has generated it is unfair rather than fair. Surprisingly, there is excess taking by players whom procedural unfairness has benefited as well as by those it has harmed. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: A lack of specialized knowledge about providing health care to older people decreases their health outcomes and quality of life. This article presents an innovative learning strategy for preregistration nursing students to raise awareness of person-centered care of the older adult. Method: This report is based on the authors' own experience and includes comments from students to the authors who taught the unit of study from 2010 to 2015, supported by current literature and theory discussing contemporary educational strategies. Results: Students came to value the older adult as a person to whom they could relate and the learning promoted person-centered care delivery. Although many students found this approach to learning to be challenging, student feedback demonstrated that the overall reception of the strategy was very positive. Conclusion: This strategy facilitated learning to improve person-centered care and addressed negative attitudes toward older adults, which improved health outcomes and their quality of life.

TI  - Making the "Other" from "Us": The Representation of British Converts to Islam in Mainstream British Newspapers
T2  - JOURNAL OF MUSLIM MINORITY AFFAIRS
LA  - English
AB  - There is now a great deal of literature that shows how Islam and Muslims are routinely represented in negative ways in the mainstream newspapers. With overt or covert reliance on Orientalist discourse, discourses of cultural clash and extremism, including terror, are prevalent. Not only are Muslims less likely to feature in "normal" stories, abuse and prejudice against them is also more unlikely to constitute "news". British converts to Islam have only recently begun to receive more focused attention, both in academia and in the mainstream press. Occupying a unique position in respect to the idea of the "other" and of integration in a multicultural society, converts offer a powerful point of critique of these concepts. The aim of this study is to understand how and in what discourses British converts to Islam are represented, and thereby contribute empirical knowledge to these theoretical concerns.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPEECH-LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - COMMUNICATION
KW  - CHILDREN
AB  - Purpose: Variation within languages, including dialects, takes on an indexical function, marking belonging and connection. Meanwhile, attitudes toward these speech varieties become marked by linguistic bias. Within the speech-language pathology profession, research evidence, assessment tools, and intervention programs have largely been designed for and by the White, English-speaking middle class. As such, linguistic bias with a preference for standardized dialects is prevalent in the training and practice of the speech-language pathology profession, resulting in discriminatory and racialized practices.
   Method: To investigate the influence of linguistic bias upon speech-language pathologists' (SLPs') clinical decision making, data were collected from 129 Australian SLPs via an online survey. Inferential statistics were used to investigate the relationship between clinical decision making and SLPs' attitudes toward nonstandard dialects as well as personal and professional factors. A content analysis of extended responses was conducted to identify themes in clinical decision making.
   Results: SLPs with more years of experience and those who had received professional development were significantly more likely to seek out more information before making a diagnosis, while those with more negative attitudes toward linguistic diversity were significantly more likely to identify a disorder than a difference. SLPs provided a range of justifications for their clinical decision making, but few acknowledged the influence of their own attitudes and bias upon their decision making.
   Conclusions: SLPs' linguistic bias towards speakers of nonstandard dialects has the potential to impact upon their clinical judgment of difference versus disorder and lead to inequality of service provision for speakers who do not express themselves in standardized forms. Before the profession can truly move toward an antiracist approach of equitable service provision for all, SLPs must engage in critical self-reflection to disrupt the adherence of the speech-language pathology profession to standardized "White" norms of communication.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify modifiable factors that facilitate discussion of potentially sensitive topics between health care providers and young people at preventive service visits after Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act implementation. METHODS: We used data from a national internet survey of adolescents and young adults (13-26 years old) in the United States. Questionnaire construction was guided by formative research and Fisher's Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model. Those who had seen a regular health care provider in the past 2 years were asked about 11 specific topics recommended by national medical guidelines. Four multivariable regression models were used to identify independent predictors of discussions of (1) tobacco use, (2) drug and/or alcohol use, (3) sexually transmitted infections or HIV, and (4) the number of topics discussed. RESULTS: Fewer than half of young people reported having discussed 10 of 11 topics at their last visit. Predictors were similar across all 4 models. Factors independently associated with health discussions included the following: ever talked with a provider about confidentiality (4/4 models; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.85-2.00), ever had private time with a provider (1 model; aOR = 1.50), use of health checklist and/or screening questionnaire at last visit (4 models; aOR = 1.78-1.96), and time spent with provider during last visit (4 models). Number of years that young men had seen their regular provider was significant in 1 model. Other independent factors were positive youth attitudes about discussing specific topics (3/3 models) and youth involvement in specific health risk behaviors (3/3 models). CONCLUSIONS: Discussions about potentially sensitive topics between health care providers and young people are associated with modifiable factors of health care delivery, particularly provider explanations of confidentiality, use of screening and/or trigger questionnaires, and amount of time spent with their provider.

AB  - BackgroundIt has been argued that interpersonal contact is the best intervention for reducing negative attitudes and discrimination toward individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID). In Israel, the Equal in Uniform project makes it possible for individuals with ID to serve alongside soldiers without ID in ordinary military units in the Israeli Defense Forces. The project provided the opportunity to examine the effect of contact on the attitudes of soldiers without ID.
   MethodsData analyses are based on data collected from 220 soldiers without ID via a self-administered questionnaire based on the Multidimensional Attitudes Scale. Of these, 138 were in contact with soldiers with ID as part of the project.
   ResultsA mediation model showed that the impact of contact with a soldier with ID on withdrawal behaviour was mediated by cognitive attributions and negative affect. Contact was directly associated with prosocial behaviour.
   DiscussionResults support the importance of contact between soldiers with and without ID to bring about improved attitudes toward the former.

AB  - Some research suggests a racial-ethnic hierarchy exists as to perceptions of police, with African-Americans exhibiting the most negative attitudes, Whites the most positive, and Hispanics holding more intermediate attitudes. Other findings regarding Hispanics are less consistent and little study has been made of Asians. This study further tests the premise for such a hierarchy by examining the views of both Hispanics and Asians alongside those of African-Americans and Whites as they relate to police misconduct. Partial support for a hierarchy of attitudes was found, with Hispanics exhibiting the hypothesised intermediate attitudes. While race remained an important factor for explaining African-Americans' attitudes, other factors ultimately better explained Hispanics' attitudes. The attitudes of Asians were indistinguishable from those of Whites. These findings suggest the experiences of racial-ethnic groups widely vary and the premise of a racial-ethnic continuum may be too simplistic for understanding the attitudes of Asians and Hispanics.

AB  - This research conducted focus group interviews and a questionnaire survey to investigate the potential demand of drivers for anger intervention systems (AISs) and explore the effects of demographic factors and personality traits on the preference and attitudes toward AISs. Results indicate that drivers prefer auditory intervention over tactile and visual interventions. Moreover, they favor emotion recording features but also have negative attitudes about accuracy and system security. In addition, age and some personality traits (i.e., types of driving anger and categories of driving anger expressions) play an important role in predicting the preference of intervention modalities or attitudes toward AISs and provide a new perspective on designing customized intervention systems. The outcome of this research provides practical implications regarding the design of in-vehicle anger intervention systems for the automotive industry to reduce drivers' anger and improve driving safety.

AB  - Aim: Evidence-based practice (EBP) is perceived as an integral component of contemporary allied health practice. While allied health clinicians (such as occupational therapists) have generally positive attitudes towards EBP, research suggests that they find its implementation consistently challenging. The professional literature increasingly suggests that more effective EBP learning takes place when social constructivist approaches to learning are adopted. The authors of this study sought to use the pre-existing knowledge and perceptions of occupational therapy students to inform a curriculum review of an EBP unit. Therefore, the aim of this content analysis study was to investigate how occupational therapy students perceive and critically analyse factors that influence the implementation of EBP, specifically strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT). Methods: The study sampled students in the third year of a 4-year, Bachelor level Australian Occupational Therapy Program. The students were undertaking the first of two EBP units, and data were collected from the first assignment they submitted for these units. The assignment required the students to complete a SWOT analysis of EBP in occupational therapy, and response to a statement around whether it should be mandatory. Data were collected over 2 consecutive years from a total of 64 occupational therapy students. All data collected were subjected to content analysis, with themes identified by at least 25% of students in each cohort retained for analysis and formation into overall themes. Results: Participating occupational therapy students identified five strengths, four weaknesses, six threats but only one opportunity for EBP. Three key themes were identified within the data: first, the role and purpose of EBP; second, the resources it requires and third, factors that influence its success. The students perceived the main purpose of EBP as supporting positive practice change, and highlighted its roles in building clinician capacity and professional credibility. They also characterized EBP as a separate and specialist practice that requires specific training and resourcing to achieve, and questioned its feasibility as an integrated part of daily practice. Along with previously identified challenges around time and resourcing, the students also highlighted negative attitudes and beliefs from senior colleagues as an important negative influence on the success of EBP. Conclusion: The current study consolidates a growing body of international literature about the value of social constructive approaches to EBP in undergraduate education. Vertical constructive alignment that embeds EBP through undergraduate education, rather than the provision of 'EBP'-specific units, should now be considered best practice. However, this embedded approach requires the explicit and repeated communication of the presence of EBP in all learning opportunities, to enable students to recognize opportunities to deploy their existing knowledge and skills.

AB  - Co-branding is regarded as a beneficial corporate branding strategy. Corporate crises can, however, result in one or both brands damaging customer-firm relationships. Research evidence in the area is sparse and shows that the non-culpable partner is negatively influenced by crises when perceived as being aware of the wrongdoing. Extending prior research, we investigate how brand equity of the non-culpable partner shapes consumers' post-crisis attitudes. We also examine boundary conditions to the brand equity effect. Drawing on expectancy violation theory, we show that high-equity of the non-culpable partner mitigates the negative effects of accidental crises, whilst low-equity can mitigate preventable crises. In preventable crises, non-culpable partner brands enjoying high equity suffer from negative attitudes accruing from the culpable brand in the alliance. The results suggest that managers should use corporate co-branding with caution, carefully evaluating the partner brand's equity and its effects when planning for and managing crisis situations.

AB  - Recently, the field of psychology has begun to display a growing interest in the influence of religion on people's psychological well-being. By and large, the empirical findings of this body of inquiry have revealed positive associations between religious beliefs and practices and different indices of health and well-being and demonstrated that religion serves as a valuable tool for individuals dealing with life stressors. Yet, there is ample data to suggest that religion can also have a negative influence on the psychological well-being of the individual. This duality of religion is the focus of this summary paper which consists of two main sections. The first considers the potential constructive and destructive sides of religion with regard to general health and wellbeing. The second section refers to religious variables that promote or mitigate prejudice and perceived conflict with others.

AB  - In a multi-phase research design over two academic semesters, White college students assigned to either a same-race or other-race roommate were tracked across two survey phases and a third phase involving an interracial interaction with a Black stranger. After four months, Whites who lived with an other-race roommate came to have more diverse friends and believe that diversity was more important than did Whites with a White roommate. After six months, self-reports, partner ratings, and nonverbal behavior indicated that Whites with an other-race roommate were less anxious, more pleasant, and more physically engaged during a novel interracial interaction. These results demonstrate that residential contact with other-race individuals not only affects race-related attitudes, but can also reduce interracial anxiety and positively influence behavior in subsequent diverse settings.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose was to examine whether a requirement for parental or guardian consent systematically limits which lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, two-spirit, queer/questioning (LGBT2Q+) youth participate in research.
   Methods: A total of 60 LGBT2+ youth (aged 14-18 years) completed measures assessing gender and sexual minority identity, depression and anxiety, help-seeking intentions, and social support.
   Results: A substantial proportion (37.6%) of youth reported that they would not have participated in the research if parental or guardian consent was required. Those who would not have participated had more negative attitudes about their sexual and gender identity, less family support, lower levels of help-seeking intentions, and higher levels of negative affect.
   Conclusions: The results suggest that requiring parental or guardian consent may exclude the most at-risk youth. Policy and practice decisions regarding the health and mental health outcomes of LGBT2Q+ youth might be based on incomplete and unrepresentative data.

AB  - A large portion of the global population generates various multimedia data such as texts, images, videos, etc. One of the most common categories which influences the public at large is visual multimedia content. Due to the different social media platforms (e.g., Whatsapp, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube), these materials are passed without censorship and national boundaries. Multimedia data containing any violent or vulgar objects could trigger public unrest, and thus, it is a serious threat to the law and order of the land. Children and teenagers use social media like never before in previous generations and create lots of multimedia data. It is important to assess the quality of multimedia content without any bias and prejudices. Although the mainstream social media platforms use different filters and moderation using human experts, it is impossible to verify the terabytes of uploaded images and videos. Thus, it is inevitable to automate the content assessment phase without incurring an increase in upload time. This study aims to prevent uploading or to tag an image/video with a reasonable percentage of a gun as content. In this paper, object detection architectures such as Faster RCNN, EfficientDet, and YOLOv5 have been used to demonstrate how these techniques can efficiently detect human faces and different types of guns in given multimedia data (images/videos). The models are tested on various test images and video clips. A comparative analysis has also been discussed based on mean average precision and frames per second metric. The YOLOv5 provides the best-performing results as high as 80.39% and 35.22% at mAP(0.5) and mAP([0.50:0.95]), respectively. A face recognition task requires thousands of samples and the usual deep learning models are data-driven. On the contrary, a few- shot learning approach has been implemented to recognize the detected faces categorizing the content as real or reel.

AB  - The effects of intergroup contact on prejudice are well established. However, its effects on minority group well-being have been rarely studied. We hypothesized that contact with members of the majority culture will be related to better well-being, and that this is facilitated by majority language proficiency. We tested this hypothesis in a three-wave longitudinal study of refugees over 2 years (N = 180). Cross-lagged path modeling confirmed that intergroup contact at earlier time points was associated with increased well-being at later time points; the reverse associations (from earlier well-being to later contact) were not reliable. Self-rated earlier English language competence was positively associated with later intergroup contact (but not the reverse), suggesting that improving majority language proficiency might be the key to better well-being of refugees, with intergroup contact being the mediator between language and well-being.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Negative attitudes toward patients can adversely impact health care quality and contribute to health disparities. Stigmatizing language written in a patient's medical record can perpetuate negative attitudes and influence decision-making of clinicians subsequently caring for that patient.
   OBJECTIVE To identify and describe physician language in patient health records that may reflect, or engender in others, negative and positive attitudes toward the patient.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This qualitative study analyzed randomly selected encounter notes from electronic medical records in the ambulatory internal medicine setting at an urban academic medical center. The 600 encounter notes were written by 138 physicians in 2017. Data were analyzed in 2019.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Common linguistic characteristics reflecting an overall positive or negative attitude toward the patient.
   RESULTS A total of 138 clinicians wrote encounter notes about 507 patients. Of these patients, 350 (69%) were identified as female, 406 (80%) were identified as Black/African American, and 76 (15%) were identified as White. Of 600 encounter notes included in this study, there were 5 major themes representing negative language and 6 themes representing positive language. The majority of negative language was not explicit and generally fell into one or more of the following categories: (1) questioning patient credibility, (2) expressing disapproval of patient reasoning or self-care, (3) stereotyping by race or social class, (4) portraying the patient as difficult, and (5) emphasizing physician authority over the patient. Positive language was more often more explicit and included (1) direct compliments, (2) expressions of approval, (3) self-disclosure of the physician's own positive feelings toward the patient, (4) minimization of blame, (5) personalization, and (6) highlighting patient authority for their own decisions.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This qualitative study found that physicians express negative and positive attitudes toward patients when documenting in the medical record. Although often not explicit, this language could potentially transmit bias and affect the quality of care that patients subsequently receive. These findings suggest that increased physician awareness when writing and reading medical records is needed to prevent the perpetuation of negative bias in medical care.

AB  - Previous research has demonstrated the importance of intercultural willingness to interact; however, these investigations have yet to be applied to a health context or to compare an ethnic minority with a majority sample. Consequently, the current study sought to better understand engagement with health services by investigating both attitudes towards seeking psychological help and intercultural willingness to interact within an ethnic minority South East Asian population, relative to an Anglo Australian sample. As predicted, negative attitudes towards seeking psychological help were higher in the South East Asian sample, with this relationship persisting across generations, despite significant differences in acculturation. In contrast, intercultural willingness to interact was not associated with ethnicity status but was associated with higher anxiety, uncertainty, ethnocentrism and help-seeking, consistent with current empirical and theoretical literature. The current study also sought to examine factors associated with help-seeking attitudes and found that ethnocentrism was a significant predictor, when accounting for previous health experience.

AB  - Although the act of dehumanizing an outgroup is a pervasive and potent intergroup process that drives discrimination and conflict, no formal research has examined the consequences of being dehumanized by an outgroup-that is, "metadehumanization." Across 10 studies (N = 3,440) involving several real-world conflicts spanning 3 continents, we provide the first empirical evidence that metadehumanization (a) plays a central role in outgroup aggression that is (b) mediated by outgroup dehumanization, and (c) distinct from metaprejudice. Studies 1a and 1b demonstrate experimentally that Americans who learn that Arabs (Study 1a) or Muslims (Study 1b) blatantly dehumanize Americans are more likely to dehumanize that outgroup in return; by contrast, experimentally increasing outgroup dehumanization did not increase metadehumanization (Study 1c). Using correlational data, Study 2 documents indirect effects of metadehumanization on Americans' support for aggressive policies toward Arabs (e.g., torture) via Arab dehumanization. In the context of Hungarians and ethnic minority Roma, Study 3 shows that the pathway for Hungarians from metadehumanization to aggression through outgroup dehumanization holds controlling for outgroup prejudice. Study 4 examines Israelis' metaperceptions with respect to Palestinians, showing that: (a) feeling dehumanized (i.e., metadehumanization) is distinct from feeling disliked (i.e., metaprejudice), and (b) metadehumanization uniquely influences aggression through outgroup dehumanization, controlling for metaprejudice. Studies 5a and 5b explore Americans' metaperceptions regarding ISIS and Iran. We document a dehumanization-specific pathway from metadehumanization to aggressive attitudes and behavior that is distinct from the path from metaprejudice through prejudice to aggression. In Study 6, American participants learning that Muslims humanize Americans (i.e., metahumanization) humanize Muslims in turn. Finally, Study 7 experimentally contrasts metadehumanization and metahumanization primes, and shows that resulting differences in outgroup dehumanization are mediated by (a) perceived identity threat, and (b) a general desire to reciprocate the outgroup's perceptions of the ingroup. In summary, our research outlines how and why metadehumanization contributes to cycles of ongoing violence and animosity, providing direction for future research and policy.

AB  - Some nurses who provide AIDS care, in addition to experiencing stigma themselves, also exhibit negative attitudes and perpetrate stigma and discrimination toward persons living with HIV (PLWHAs). We used a participatory research approach to explore the nature, context, and influence of stigma on the nursing care provided to PLWHAs in four low- and middle-income countries: Jamaica, Kenya, South Africa, and Uganda. Eighty-four registered nurses, enrolled nurses, and midwives participated in interviews and 79 participated in 11 focus groups. Nurses were very aware of the stigma and discrimination that AIDS evoked, and made adjustments to their care to decrease the manifestation of AIDS stigma. Despite the assurance that PLWHAs were treated equally, and that universal precautions were used consistently, we found that in reality, nurses sometimes made decisions about nursing care that were based on the appearance of the patient or knowledge of his or her status.

AB  - Objective:
   This study aims to evaluate the impact of a national mental health arts festival for the general public, encompassing a wide variety of art forms and themes.
   Method:
   An evaluation was undertaken with 415 attendees from 20 different events, combining qualitative and quantitative approaches.
   Results:
   The findings demonstrate positive impact on the relationship between arts and mental health. Events increased positive attitudes, including positive representations of people's contributions, capabilities and potential to recover. They did not decrease negative attitudes. Intended behaviour change was modest and one film event increased audience perceptions of dangerousness.
   Conclusion:
   The paper argues that the arts can change stigma by constructing shared meanings and engaging audiences on an emotional level. Carefully programmed, collaborative, community-based arts festivals should form an integral part of national programmes to address stigma and to promote mental health and wellbeing, alongside traditional social marketing and public education approaches.

AB  - Researchers in the medical, health, and social sciences routinely encounter ordinal variables such as self-reports of health or happiness. When modelling ordinal outcome variables, it is common to have covariates, for example, attitudes, family income, retrospective variables, measured with error. As is well known, ignoring even random error in covariates can bias coefficients and hence prejudice the estimates of effects. We propose an instrumental variable approach to the estimation of a probit model with an ordinal response and mismeasured predictor variables. We obtain likelihood-based and method of moments estimators that are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed under general conditions. These estimators are easy to compute, perform well and are robust against the normality assumption for the measurement errors in our simulation studies. The proposed method is applied to both simulated and real data.

AB  - Widespread agreement that training can play a key role in addressing workplace sexual harassment (SH) has led to a dramatic increase in employer-provided SH training around the world. However, summaries of published research have been qualitative in nature and have yielded inconsistent assessments of SH training's effectiveness in fulfilling that role. The study helps address those uncertain and sometimes conflicting assessments by providing the first meta-analytic investigation of the relationships between SH training and changes in trainees. We found that the largest SH training effect was on declarative knowledge learning (delta = 1.06), followed by attitude change (delta = 0.41), procedural knowledge-skills learning (delta = 0.39), and transfer outcomes (delta = 0.14). Significant moderating effects were found for scope of training, instructional method, and gender of trainees; however, the results varied by training outcome. The effect of SH training did not vary significantly as a function of the training delivery media, training duration, or training setting. Theoretical implications, directions for future research, and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - In 1967, the University of Maryland's School of Library and Information Services created a public library in Prince George's County, Maryland, named the High John Experiment, to give Librarianship and Information Science students experience serving disadvantaged communities and to discover new methods to better serve these communities. From the creation of High John to the present day, University of Maryland publications and unaffiliated works credit High John as a groundbreaking experiment that propelled interests in diversity and inclusion in public libraries. High John's creators published a 73 paged report for the United States' Office of Education, accompanied by published articles, that confirms a violation of ethics toward the community High John served. The community was not involved in the implementation or planning of the library and many of the services and materials the library offered were based on prejudiced assumptions instead of community input or research. Although High John garnered supporters, the validity and ethicality behind High John's intent and methods were called into question during the experiment. The controversy led to debates within the field that resulted in conversations about Librarianship and Information Science pedagogy and appropriate methods in outreach and community engagement for disadvantaged communities. Now that the passionately fueled debates on High John have ceased, the experiment is a distant memory. Although this experiment led to debates about diversity, inclusion, and equity in information access within the United States, this experiment is relevant to information readers on a global scale. Because Librarianship and Information Science has a history rooted in elitism and oppression worldwide, High John warrants further exposure and examination from a diverse pool of contemporary perspectives. Through the application of modern community outreach and engagement practices, this article builds on a critical historical analysis of the experiment and argues High John failed in its mission and violated the community's trust that it purported to serve.

AB  - The paper highlights four tendencies in the media reporting of teachers and education: (a) recurring patterns of defining education in crisis, (b) mantling responsibility as exterior spokespersons for education and teachers, (c) excluding teachers' and educational researchers' knowledge and experiences in the media and (d) simplifying the notion of a good and bad teacher through stereotypes and dualistic frameworks that overlook task and relational complexity. In this paper, I explore how the simplifications of teachers and education that are often presented in the media can be interpreted as structural violence. In the light of these tendencies, research on structural violence helps to remind us that: (a) teachers are unwillingly forced into a paradoxical (in)visibility, (b) they are squeezed in-between two pressuring external demands, namely the complexities in their professional assignment that are politically steered and stereotypes of the good and bad teacher produced by, in this case, the media, (c) they risk wasting time and energy on addressing prejudices that have nothing to do with the specific work they are expected to do and (d) the logic of binary stereotypes is a power issue that brands teachers into a position of permanent failure.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify limitations and incentives in reporting clinically suspect situations, possibly caused by classical swine fever (CSF), to veterinary authorities with the ultimate aim to facilitate early detection of CSF outbreaks. Focus group sessions were held with policy makers from the veterinary authorities, and representatives of veterinary practitioners and pig farmer unions. Personal interviews with a small group of pig farmers and practitioners were held to check limitations raised and solutions proposed during the focus group sessions. An electronic questionnaire was mailed to pig farmers and practitioners to investigate perceptions and attitudes with respect to clinically suspect situations possibly caused by CSF. After triangulating the responses of veterinary authorities, veterinary practitioners and farmers, six themes emerged across all groups: (1) lack of knowledge on the early signs of CSF; (2) guilt, shame and prejudice; (3) negative opinion on control measures; (4) dissatisfaction with post-reporting procedures; (5) lack of trust in government bodies; (6) uncertainty and lack of transparency of reporting procedures.
   The following solutions to facilitate early detection of CSF were put forward: (a) development of a clinical decision-support system for vets and farmers, in order to get faster diagnosis and detection of CSF; (b) possibility to submit blood samples directly to the reference laboratory to exclude CSF in a clinical situation with non-specific clinical signs, without isolation of the farm and free of charge for the individual farmer; (c) decrease social and economic consequences of reporting CSF, for example by improving the public opinion on first reports; (d) better schooling of veterinary officers to deal with emotions and insecurity of farmers in the process after reporting; (e) better communication of rules and regulations, where to report, what will happen next; (f) up-to-date website with information and visual material of the clinical signs of CSF.

AB  - Since negative attitudes toward wildlife reduce support for biodiversity conservation, understanding the relationship between urban residents' attitudes and their experience with wildlife problems is important. We surveyed households in Wellington City, New Zealand, and modeled the relationship between attitude toward birds, and biodiversity awareness and engagement. Planting trees to attract birds was the only predictor to provide substantial inference for attitude (omega(i) = 0.873). We then assessed how experiencing a problem with birds modified these relationships, finding that two models comprised the confidence model set (Sigma omega(i) >= 0.95); planting for birds combined with the additive (omega(i) = 0.568) and interactive (omega(i) = 0.400) effects of experiencing a problem. Experience of a bird problem on its own did not influence attitude (Delta AIC = 17.50, omega(i) < 0.001). Attitude toward birds may be robust to experiencing minor problems, and may be related to a person's experience and engagement with birds rather than negative experiences.

AB  - Using World Values Survey data from several dozen countries around the world, this article analyzes the relationship between postmaterialist values and bribery (dis)approval in a multilevel framework. We find that people, who place stronger emphasis on postmaterialist values, tend to justify bribery more. However, the ecological effect of postmaterialism operates in the exactly opposite direction: A higher prevalence of postmaterialist values induces more bribery disapproval, and especially among postmaterialists themselves. In our view, this happens because the large number of people who internalized postmaterialist values generate positive social externalities which strengthen negative attitudes toward corruption. We outline a theoretical framework that explains why and how these externalities may emerge. Our results contribute to the literature on the sociocultural factors of corruption, provide a better understanding of the complex nature of postmaterialism, and also might be interesting in the light of ongoing discussions on whether moral attitudes are culturally universal or culturally specific.

AB  - This research investigates individual's support for social provisions and rights of Syrian refugees in Turkey. Support is examined in relation to perceived threat of Syrian refugees and negative emotions in combination with the perception of family and friends considering Syrian refugees a threat (negative descriptive social norm) and whether these significant others morally support these refugees (positive injunctive norms). A questionnaire study was conducted among Turkish participants (N = 565), and the results show that perception of threat was associated with negative emotions which, in turn, were related to less support to Syrian refugees. Additionally, perception of threat was associated with less support through negative emotions when perceived descriptive norms were strong. Further, perceived injunctive norms were associated with more support to Syrian refugees, but less so when people had stronger negative emotions. These findings suggest that with negative descriptive norms, threat-based negative emotions are associated with less support to Syrian refugees, and that stronger negative emotions make the association between positive injunctive norms and support weaker.

AB  - Beginning with three preliminary considerations - on the factual role of prejudices (Section 1), on the relation of nature and culture (Section 2) and on the importance of logic (Section 3) - I compare the logical point of view with the ecological point of view for a new understanding of the philosophy of science (Section 4), the core of which is a theory of knowledge. In this view science is an evolutionarily late type of the Batesonian ecosystems of the mind that nevertheless follow many of the old systemic structures developed in the earlier ecosystems of matter. A problem is that in the past decades we have become used to the Kuhnian description of sciences as paradigmatic or longing for a paradigm-change. This entails the mistake of replacing the overall important value of truth by the concept of power (Section 5) which is unacceptable for an ecological point of view. In the ecological view we gain a new criterion for the dependency of science from the surrounding systems (as politics or economics) by judging its relative intactness in pursuing its scientific goals (Section 6). Language is a most important means for structuring human knowledge and science, but linguistics has not yet contributed much to its theory because of the deficits of the language sciences (Section 7). The ecology of language could repair that by resuming and developing ideas of the Humboldtian tradition (Section 8) which have been lost by the Saussurian and Chomskyan schools, especially that of restoring the environments of the language-systems to its important rights. Unfortunately, many ecolinguists do not recognize the importance of the ecological ideas for a progress in the theory of language and even grammar (Section 9). Therefore the power of change that is included in the ecolinguistic perspective - not only to supply a growing core of linguistic knowledge by some ecological additions but to replace it by a better linguistics (Section 10) - is often underrated.

AB  - By the 1990s, sociology faced a frustrating paradox. Classic work on mental illness stigma and labeling theory reinforced that the "mark" of mental illness created prejudice and discrimination for individuals and family members. Yet that foundation, coupled with deinstitutionalization of mental health care, produced contradictory responses. Claims that stigma was dissipating were made, while others argued that intervention efforts were needed to reduce stigma. While signaling the critical role of theory-based research in establishing the pervasive effects of stigma, both claims directed resources away from social science research. Yet the contemporary scientific foundation underlying both claims was weak. A reply came in a resurgence of research directed toward mental illness stigma nationally and internationally, bringing together researchers from different disciplines for the first time. I report on the general population's attitudes, beliefs, and behavioral dispositions that targeted public stigma and implications for the next decade of research and intervention efforts.

AB  - This paper introduces a robot visual-inertial tracking algorithm for a robot manipulator intended to track an object using inertial sensors incorporated into the object. To create this algorithm, the inertial Jacobian is first newly defined in order to show the relationship between an angle set velocity vector of the object and the angular velocity vector of the robot tip. Then, the inertial Jacobian is combined with the conventional image Jacobian. Therefore, the proposed algorithm requires only two landmarks with the help of an inertial measurement unit to track a moving object with six degrees of freedom, while at least three landmarks are required in the conventional stereo visual servoing algorithm. Further, the possession of a multi-rate controller allows the integration system to out-perform conventional systems in the tracking of an object's attitude change. A suggested application of the proposed method is tracking and selection of a container from a shipping vessel that is being affected by large waves. Simulations and experiments were conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed methodology.

AB  - As a kind of complex targets, the nonrigid vibration and attitude change of an aircraft as well as the rotation of its rotating parts will induce complex nonlinear modulation on its echo from low-resolution radars. If one performs the multifractal analysis of measures on an aircraft echo, it may offer a fine description of the dynamic characteristics which induce the echo structure. On basis of introducing multifractal theory based on structural functions, the paper models real recorded aircraft echo data from a low-resolution radar by using the random walk process and the incremental process respectively, and investigates the application of echo multifractal characteristics in aircraft target classification with low-resolution radars. The analysis shows that aircraft echoes from low-resolution radars have clear multifractal characteristics, and one should take an aircraft echo series as a random walk process to perform the multifractal analysis. The experimental results validate the classification method based on multifractal signatures.

AB  - This research focuses on the subjectification of young asylum-seeking men. By subjectification, we mean the effort an individual invests in detecting, negotiating, meeting and contesting the surrounding discursive expectations. The underlying question is: if someone wants to fulfil the position ascribed to them, that is be a 'good asylum seeker' and respond to the surrounding demands as much as possible, what would then, in fact, be a 'good asylum seeker'? The data consists of interviews and ethnographic hanging out with nine young asylum-seeking men throughout their asylum process. Based on their reflections on the discourses of the surrounding society, a 'good asylum seeker' is patient, active, positive and grateful; he normalises racism he faces and accepts prejudice towards himself. A 'good asylum seeker' also accepts the position of a less worthy human being, acknowledging that in an ideal situation he would be entirely away, out of sight or in another subject position. Our findings showcase the sheer impossibility of successfully filling the asylum seeker subject position, as the requirements are contradictory and unrealistic. Paradoxically, it could be said that a 'good asylum seeker' is no longer an asylum seeker.

Drawing on survey data collected from 1,272 individuals from three ethnic minority backgrounds in Australia, the present study reports findings including: (1) significant and large direct positive associations between superordinate identity and willingness to cooperate with police, (2) small-to-moderate significant associations between perceived police bias and cooperation with police (positive for Vietnamese subsample; negative for Indian and Arab subsamples), and (3) significant interaction patterns between subordinate identity, perceived police bias, and ethnicity. Findings are discussed with respect to community-engaged prevention and prejudice reduction.

AB  - This article follows on from a case study discussed in Avison and Malaurent (2007) which described a largely unsuccessful implementation of a French multinational corporation's enterprise resource planning (ERP) project in its Chinese subsidiaries. Many features imposed by the ERP template did not fit in the Chinese context. This present article describes what happened next. Rather than resist the system totally by not using it, the Chinese users worked around the misfits by inventing their own solutions known as workarounds. These enabled the ERP system as a whole to be workable in China but caused problems at company headquarters as some transparency was lost and the information provided was seen as potentially misleading. A project team was set up to examine each of these workarounds and decide whether they should be formalized or prevented. The result was a system accepted by users and management alike. Reflections on the case include a discussion on management attitude change, the positive and negative aspects of workarounds, the importance of good communications and the role of the researcher.

AB  - Education affects individual values and beliefs, mitigates prejudices and enhances open-mindedness. Additionally, education has been shown to affect cultural traits like trust and respect in societies. Building on this literature and employing an extensive individual-level cross country data from World Value Survey (WVS), we explore the role of educational attainment and cultural traits in shaping attitudes towards abortion. Our results show that higher educational attainment is associated with stronger justification of abortion as a choice. We also show that cultural traits like trust and respect enhance the association between educational attainment and attitudes towards abortion. Obedience, however, erodes the impact of educational attainment on the individual justification for abortion. Our results are robust to a wide array of controls as well as estimates taking into bias arising out of simultaneous sample selection.

AB  - We demonstrate that people can adopt a favorable view of ambiguous risks relative to ones with known probabilities, contrary to the usual attitude of ambiguity aversion, when doing so permits justification for unfair behavior. We use binary dictator games involving a choice between a relatively equitable allocation and an "unfair" allocation that is both less generous and makes the recipient's payment dependent oil a p = 0.5 lottery. Dictators choose the unfair option more frequently when the recipient's allocation depends on an ambiguous lottery than on a lottery with a known probability - even though the objective distributions of outcomes are identical under the two kinds of lotteries. Dictators' estimates of the expected value of the recipients' allocations are inflated under ambiguity, indicating that dictators form self-serving beliefs about ambiguity. Finally, increased unfair behavior under ambiguity is extinguished when dictators are constrained by their own initial unmotivated, and negative, attitudes towards ambiguity. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The history of Chinese immigration in Italy is about a century old, but numbers have become consistent in the last decades and the emergence of new generations is a recent phenomenon. This article examines the growing role of Chinese descendants in the country (within Chinese enterprises and new forms of interaction with the mainstream society) and their processes of identity formation, focusing the attention on the role played by Italian society and the dominant prejudices about this ethnic minority. The study highlights the relevance of social exclusion and identity prescription, as well as the importance of class, in determining different feelings of belonging and processes of identification. While a minority of middle-class Chinese have identified with Italy and developed a new hyphenated identity, many Chinese from the lower class appear uncertain about their national identity and react to social exclusion by abandoning hope and dropping out of education.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate pre-service physics teachers' knowledge and attitudes toward nuclear science and technology. This research used a survey method. The subjects of this study were 184 pre-service physics teachers at one of the universities in South Kalimantan province in Indonesia that consist of 39 men and 145 women. The instrument used was a questionnaire and the data were analysed descriptively quantitatively. The result showed that: (1) pre-service physics teachers have knowledge discrepancy between content and contextual knowledge, where the contextual knowledge of pre-service physics teachers on nuclear science and technology is still low; (2) pre-service physics teachers have negative attitudes on nuclear science and technology; (3) pre-service physics teachers' knowledge correlated to the attitude on nuclear science and technology. This research is expected to be taken into consideration in improving pre-service physics teachers' curriculum about nuclear science and technology, so they can play a role to improve public acceptance of nuclear energy.

AB  - This article examines how Lord Coleridge's Victorian experiences and Christian mindset played a prominent and persuasive role in the formulation of his judgment in R v Dudley and Stephens. Notwithstanding efforts to act impartially and objectively, we are all beholden, often unconsciously, to the biases and beliefs permeating the society in which we live. Coleridge was no exception, being a composite of influences: family and educational backgrounds, religious beliefs, personal encounters and societal norms. These prejudices sharpen into focus with the benefit of distant hindsight. An associated challenge is the present difficulty faced when interpreting old judgments in which allusions are made to concepts that no longer resonate in the modern world. Finally, we are left to ponder our own predicament: what are the biases that present-day jurists unconsciously possess, how do they influence the formulation of judgments and how will they be understood in a future age?

AB  - Twenty-five years after George Gerbner and colleagues' seminal report on television and science attitudes, there is a need to update the data on television's portrayals of science and to revisit the cultivation question. We address this need by analyzing 21st-century television depictions of science and examining the relationships between exposure to television and attitudes toward science with an analysis of 2006 General Social Survey data. Content results show that scientists appear infrequently in prime-time dramatic programs, are typically White males, and are frequently cast in good or mixed roles rather than as evil scientists. Regarding the cultivation effect, we do not find a significant direct relationship between television viewing and negative attitudes toward science after relevant controls are taken into account. Additional results, however, indicate a displacement effect of television viewing on science attitudes and show significant interaction effects consistent with mainstreaming.

AB  - Physical cleanliness has many medical benefits, such as protection from the dangers of contagion. We explore a potential unintended consequence of cleanliness. Given the metaphorical association between physical cleanliness and moral purity (Zhong & Liljenquist, 2006), we contend that a clean self may also be linked to a virtuous self. This enhanced moral self-perception can in turn license harsher moral judgment. Three experiments found that cleanliness, whether induced via physical cleansing or through a visualization task, licensed severe judgment on morally contested issues such as abortion and pornography. Further, we found that an inflated moral self mediated the relationship between cleanliness and moral judgment. These results provide unique insight to the social significance of cleanliness and may have important implications for discrimination and prejudice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study focused on the effects of game-product congruity and product placement proximity on advergame players' brand memory, brand attitude, game enjoyment, and future intention to play. A 2 (congruity) x 2 (proximity) repeated-measures experiment was used. Results revealed that players' implicit memory improved for congruent games only. Explicit memory measures also showed signs of improvement for brands in the congruent/central game condition. Surprisingly, it appears that the incongruent/peripheral game condition produced the best results overall with the smallest negative attitude change, the most game enjoyment, and the highest intention to play again in the future. These contradictory findings suggest to brand marketers who design advergames to be careful when combining multiple game features (congruity and proximity) within a single advergame because this strategic move may provide optimal brand memory while also producing the opposite desired effect for attitude toward the brand, game enjoyment, and intention to play.

AB  - To capture the common features of diverse fundamentalist movements, overcome etymological variability, and assess predictors, religious fundamentalism is conceptualized as a set of beliefs about and attitudes toward religion, expressed in a disciplinarian deity, literalism, exclusivity, and intolerance. Evidence from representative samples of over 23,000 adults in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and Turkey supports the conclusion that fundamentalism is stronger in countries where religious liberty is lower, religion less fractionalized, state structure less fragmented, regulation of religion greater, and the national context less globalized. Among individuals within countries, fundamentalism is linked to religiosity, confidence in religious institutions, belief in religious modernity, belief in conspiracies, xenophobia, fatalism, weaker liberal values, trust in family and friends, reliance on less diverse information sources, lower socioeconomic status, and membership in an ethnic majority or dominant religion/sect. We discuss implications of these findings for understanding fundamentalism and the need for further research.

AB  - Increasing numbers of university students in Sudan are at risk of contracting HIV because of their engagement in condomless sex. A comprehensive and culturally accepted condom promotion program could potentially reduce this threat substantially. However, little is known about the sociocognitive determinants of condom use in this population: information that is required to develop such HIV prevention programs. Therefore, in August 2014, we conducted 30 semi-structured individual interviews with male and female students (both currently sexually active and nonactive) to explore determinants of condom use based on the I-Change model. Data were analyzed using Nvivo 10. The results suggest that barriers to condom use among university students include misconceptions about condom use, negative attitudes toward condom use, lack of social support, low self-efficacy to use condoms, and poor action planning. Sexual health promotion should, therefore, address these aspects to successfully promote condom use among sexually active students and subsequently reduce the risk of HIV transmission.

TI  - Frank and Bhupinder: the odd couple of Indian cricket
T2  - SPORT IN SOCIETY
LA  - English
AB  - In 1935-1936, a non-sanctioned group of cricketers embarked on the inaugural tour of India with the ambitious, unorthodox, professional Frank Tarrant employed as team manager. Maharaja Bhupinder Singh lavishly financed the tour motivated by his love of cricket, his political and economic aspirations, its recognition as a symbol of allegiance to the British and by the prospect of leaving a legacy as the guardian of the game. Primary source material reveals that xenophobic prejudice and discrimination were endemic during the 1930s and the relationship between Tarrant and the Maharaja challenged the imperial paradigm. This article interrogates the mutually advantageous relationship and the tour through Orientalist theory discourse. The role of Tarrant will be examined, specifically regarding the ethnographic discrepancy between his representation in India and the British World. The article assesses the mutually beneficial, amiable relationship between Tarrant and the Maharaja as a metonym for wider Australia-India transactions.

AB  - The case of Sri Lanka and the Tamil diaspora can be cited as a classic case of participation by a diaspora in the homeland conflict and to some extent also in conflict resolution. Influenced by lived experiences of discrimination and suffering in an ethnocentric homeland and a range of racial prejudices and economic deprivation, in the host lands, the diaspora Tamils developed a strong sense of Tamil identity and ethno-nationalism which the LTTE could successfully harvest on. However, with the devastating civil war coming to an end, and a new government in power, numerous opportunities have opened up for diaspora participation in the development and reconstruction of the war-torn regions. All that is required is a pragmatic and reconciliatory approach by both sides - by the diaspora as well as by the Sri Lankan state.

AB  - Recent events, particularly in the United States, have highlighted strained police-citizen relations and the importance of citizens viewing police as legitimate and trustworthy. Perceptions of unreasonable police officer conduct, particularly related to demeanor and physical force, are often at the center of public complaints. The present study used survey data to explore the attitudes of 577 Australian police recruits regarding behaving disrespectfully toward, and using force against, citizens. Over all, recruits' attitudes were positive, likely reflecting present screening processes. However, some variation was evident and predicted by selected police culture dimensions, including cynicism and police authority, as well as officer characteristics and background factors. Further, attitudes more supportive of disrespect and force were, in turn, predictive of the code of silence for such behavior, measured through hypothetical unwillingness to report colleagues' behavior. The implications for understanding police attitudes are discussed, as well as attempts to reduce negative attitudes and behavior.

AB  - The coalescence of Jews from across the world to form a unified Jewish nation-state has been the dream of many Jewish and Zionist leaders. With the gathering of immigrants after the State of Israel was established, the founders strived for a 'fusion of exiles' (mizug hagaluyot), where individual migrant cultural identities would assimilate to form a new Israeli identity that was predominantly European. Though the idea of a 'New State' appealed to Indian Jews, the promises that were made before they migrated from India did not materialise once they arrived in Israel, and they had to undergo several challenges, including discrimination based on colour and ethnicity, thus delaying their assimilation within Israeli society. This paper tries to understand the migration patterns of the Bene Israeli and Cochin Jewish communities and the prejudices enforced by the Israeli government and its agencies on them, which challenged their integration into mainstream Israeli society.

AB  - Population ageing presents major challenges to the welfare system across the European Union. Consequently, emphasizing delayed retirement age and extended working lives abound in political discussions. Researchers have recognized numerous problems, which make the extended working life a challenging political task. One of these problems are citizens' negative attitudes toward delayed retirement and extended working life. In this paper, we approach this "attitude problem" from the perspective of discursive social psychology and analyze the variation in the way aspirations to extend working lives are evaluated by older workers. The data analyzed in the study consists of interviews where participants between 50 and 65 years of age comment on the political goal to extend working lives. The article sheds light on the "attitude problem" by turning the attention from underlying individual preferences to discursive resources used to undermine the political goal and the situational functions these evaluative practices have.

AB  - Engagement is seen as an important characteristic of action research. The term is often used to refer to the participation and involvement of the research participants. Within this article we take another angle and explore the concept of engagement in relation to the main action researcher. Using an auto-ethnographic approach, we illustrate that the involvement and 'closeness' of the researcher, although necessary within action research, can also have a darker side as people have the tendency to get trapped in their own beliefs and prejudices. If not mindful enough of their own involvement and way of being within the context, the researcher can lose him-or herself in the situation and no longer be able to encourage or facilitate the participation of others. We give suggestions for realizing productive engagement as a (participatory) researcher using concepts such as mindfulness and mindsight.

AB  - HIV is a serious public health problem for homeless populations. Homeless men who have sex with women have received less attention in the HIV risk literature than other homeless populations. This research uses multi-level modeling to investigate the context of unprotected sex among heterosexually active homeless men in the Skid Row area of Los Angeles. Based on interviews with 305 randomly selected men who discussed 665 of their recent female sexual relationships, this project investigates the correlates of unprotected sex during the past 6 months at the partnership, individual, and social network levels. Several different measures of relationship closeness and lack of communication about HIV/condoms were associated with unprotected sex. Controlling for relationship factors, men's negative attitudes towards condoms, mental health, and higher number of male sex partners also were associated with having unprotected sex with female partners. We discuss the implications of these findings for health interventions.

AB  - Stigma negatively affects the health of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Negative attitudes and discriminatory actions towards PLWHA are thought to be based, among other factors, on stigma towards sexual minorities and beliefs about personal responsibility. Yet, there is little evidence to support these linkages and explain how they take place, especially among Latinos. This study analyzes attitudes towards PLWHA among 643 Latino gay/bisexual men and transgender (GBT) people. It examines whether discriminatory actions are predicted by beliefs about personal responsibility and internalized homosexual stigma. Results indicate that Discriminatory Actions towards PLWHA is associated with HIV/AIDS Personal Responsibility Beliefs and Internalized Homosexual Stigma. Further, HIV/AIDS Personal Responsibility Beliefs partially mediates the relationship between Internalized Homosexual Stigma and Discriminatory Actions towards PLWHA. Latino GBT persons who have internalized negative views about homosexuality may project those onto PLWHA. They may think PLWHA are responsible for their serostatus and, hence, deserving of rejection.

AB  - Background Healthcare professionals' "cultural prejudices" toward individuals' cultural beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions affect the care they provide. Their awareness of their bias is closely associated with the quality of healthcare provided. Purpose This study was designed to assess nurses' perceptions regarding providing care to Syrian refugee patients using metaphors and to evaluate their views based on these metaphors. Methods The participants in this qualitative study consisted of 80 nurses who worked in Level 1 and Level 2 health institutions. Data were collected using an interview form prepared by the researchers. The form included descriptive characteristics of the nurses and two expressions used to determine the nurses' opinions on providing care for Syrian refugee patients. The nurses were given an incomplete sentence, which was "Providing care for a Syrian refugee patient horizontal ellipsis because horizontal ellipsis ," and were asked to complete the blanks. The data were analyzed using the content analysis method. Results On the basis of "providing care for Syrian refugee patients," four categories of metaphors were determined: occupational awareness, health promotion, a difficult process/resistance, and providing service in vain. The participants generated 50 metaphors, with "humanity," "a baby/little child," and "a barrier" as the three most used metaphors, belonging to the "occupational awareness" and "a difficult process/resistance" categories, respectively. Conclusions/Implications for Practice The metaphors of nurses regarding giving care to Syrian refugee patients were mostly concentrated in the categories of "occupational awareness" and "a difficult process/resistance." Metaphors generated by the nurses offer a powerful research tool to reveal, understand, and explain nurses' personal perceptions and to develop and support nursing care accordingly. In addition, the subject of transcultural nursing should be discussed more extensively in nursing education programs. Understanding the social context of refugees is very important during the nursing care process.

AB  - Introduction. Medical care in geriatrics has its own specificity, and in order to build a successful doctor-patient relationship it is important while studying medicine to learn some functioning aspects of this age group.
   Objective. The aim of this study is to explore and describe the role of emotional intelligence in the attitudes of medical students towards elderly patients, taking into account their the place of residence. The place of residence has an impact on social relations and socialization, which could effect with disparities in behaviour towards elderly patients.
   Materials and method. Medical University of Lublin students from rural (N=71; M=23.44 SD=1.80) and urban (N=87; M=23.34; SD=1.38) areas took part in the study. Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (INTE) and Attitude Towards Elderly Patients Questionnaire (ATEP) were used.
   Results.There are statistically significant differences between medical students from rural and urban areas in their attitude towards elderly patients (p=0.001), but no differences were observed between rural and urban residents in terms of emotional intelligence (general result, action factor and cognitive factor). Positive correlations were observed between action factor (r=0.322), cognitive factor (r=0.311) and general INTE result (r=0.358) and attitude towards elderly patients in the group of medical students from rural area.
   Conclusions. Medical students from rural areas are characterized by a more positive attitude towards elderly patients than medical students from urban areas, The predictors of attitudes towards elderly patients are the cognitivefactor of emotional intelligence and the place of residence of medical students. The results give the opportunity to design a well-developed programme of a geriatric course which could be matched to the personal predispositions of students.

KW  - INTERGROUP CONTACT
AB  - This article evaluates existing programs designed to bring together groups from different generations, through a literature search on intergenerational learning programs in accordance with the intergroup contact theory. The theory, as described by Allport (1954) and Rothbart and John (1985), asserts that in order to reduce prejudice and achieve the positive effects of intergroup contact, each of the following conditions should be met to some degree: (1) support of established authority or institution; (2) cross-group contact facilitated regularly over time; (3) equal status within the situation; (4) common goals; (5) intergroup cooperation; (6) behavior of minority group members not consistent with their stereotype; and (7) cross-group contact facilitated in a variety of social contexts. It is the authors' hypothesis that transgenerational engagement in the academic setting is achieved when an activity or program meets all of the aforementioned criteria.

AB  - This article examines Homeward Bound, a political education youth organizing program for Vietnamese immigrant youth in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Inspired by Paulo Freire's critical pedagogy theory, the program sought to empower learners to challenge their pre-existing knowledge and experience of interracial relations. Drawing on data from observations, interviews, and document reviews, we describe the process by which the program shaped Vietnamese immigrant youth's critical consciousness of Vietnamese/Asian-black interracial tension. While some participants expressed apprehension and prejudice toward African Americans, particularly in the early days of the program, by the end, participants demonstrated knowledge retained from lessons and activities on the shared history of Vietnamese immigrants and African Americans. Participants also identified roots of and offered solutions to interracial tension. This study illuminates the role of immigrant youth organizing programs in resolving interracial tension in multiracial contexts.

AB  - Unsurprisingly, most scholarship on the English Defence League (EDL) focuses on the Islamophobic nature of the group's politics. This has found that, whilst the group presents a more moderate, public-facing image, the EDL's backstage discourse is a far less nuanced brand of Islamophobia and cultural racism (Allen, C. (2011). Opposing Islamification or promoting Islamophobia? Understanding the English Defence League. Patterns of Prejudice, 45(4), 279?294; Kassimeris, G., & Jackson, L. (2015). The ideology and discourse of the English Defence League: ?Not racist, not violent, just no longer silent?. British Journal of Politics and International Relations, 17, 171?188). A more fundamental area of EDL ideology has been left unexamined, however: what notion of ?England? is the EDL trying to ?defend?? Using content analysis of EDL online discourse, this article examines how the EDL articulates, represents, and uses English national identity within its discourse and politics.

AB  - Background: Stigma and discrimination against people with mental illness remain barriers to help seeking and full recovery for people in need of mental health services. Yet there is scarce research investigating the experiences of psychiatric stigma on mental health service users in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The aim of this study was therefore to explore the experiences of psychiatric stigma by service users in order to inform interventions to reduce such stigma and discrimination in one LMIC, namely South Africa.
   Methods: Participants comprised a total of 77 adults aged above 18 years, made up of service providers including professional nurses (10), lay counsellors (20), auxiliary social workers (2); and service users (45).
   Results: Psychiatric stigma was found to be perpetuated by family members, friends, employers, community members and health care providers. Causes of psychiatric stigma identified included misconceptions about mental illness often leading to delays in help-seeking. Experiencing psychiatric stigma was reported to worsen the health of service users and impede their capacity to lead and recover a normal life.
   Conclusion: Media campaigns and interventions to reduce stigma should be designed to address specific stigmatizing behaviours among specific segments of the population. Counselling of families, caregivers and service users should include how to deal with experienced and internalized stigma.

AB  - The food-energy-water (FEW) nexus framework calls for a systems perspective on addressing complex sustainability challenges. As a sustainability science field, nexus research should in theory bring together transdisciplinary approaches drawing from a range of stakeholder knowledge and experiences. This approach would align with the competence-based training for future sustainability leaders advocated for in sustainability education literature. In practice, the field is dominated by techno-scientific approaches with superficial or peripheral attention paid to issues of social justice and community engagement. In this article, we explore how this imbalance in the literature reflects a breakdown between the ideals of sustainability training and the reality of training at the nexus and describe obstacles that may be contributing to this breakdown, including a prejudice towards the idea of "objective" science, institutional incentives, and disciplinary culture. To address these concerns, we introduce a research project focused on assessing the training of future researchers at the FEW nexus and exploring how these programs train students in particular views of what is important at the FEW nexus, such as technological solutions, stakeholder collaboration, and/or issues of equity and justice. It will also provide recommendations for creating open learning environments that are competence-based, and that incorporate multiple methods, acknowledgments of limitations, and alternate ways of knowing.

AB  - Objective: A qualitative exploration of the barriers and facilitators for people experiencing homelessness achieving good oral health. Participants: Adults using two homeless centres in Leeds. Methods: Focus group discussions were convened with homeless people using support services. Both an inductive and deductive approach to data analysis was taken. Themes were identified and then a framework applied to analysis using Nvivo software. Results: Three focus group discussions with 16 participants were conducted with people experiencing homelessness. The barriers identified were insufficient information on local dental services, negative attitudes of oral health professionals, low priority of dental care, anxiety and cost of dental treatments. Facilitators included single dental appointments, accessible dental locations and being treated with respect. Conclusions: Despite the barriers that prevent people experiencing homelessness from maintaining and improving their oral health, the participants were aware that they needed oral healthcare and requested that dental services were made available to them and were accessible in line with their socioeconomic status and needs.

AB  - The current research investigated German preservice and experienced teachers' implicit stereotypes, attitudes, and explicit cognitions with respect to male ethnic minority students. Using the Implicit Association Test, Study 1 revealed negative implicit stereotypes as preservice and experienced teachers more strongly associated ethnic minority students with negative learning and working behaviors than ethnic majority students. Study 2 showed negative implicit attitudes toward ethnic minority students. Explicit cognitions in both studies were positive. In addition to characterizing teachers' attitudes, Study 2 explored the role of attitudes in spontaneous judgments. Participants with more negative implicit attitudes made less favorable judgments of ethnic minority students. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for ethnic minority students and classroom interactions as well as for teacher education programs.

AB  - America's aging population needs interprofessional health care providers committed to providing high-quality, patient-centered care. Considering the often negative attitudes held by health care students about older adults and the impact that can have on their care, it is important to explore factors that influence student attitudes and desire to provide geriatric care. Five hundred seventy-two students pursuing nursing, physical therapy, athletic training, dietetics, and social work degrees were surveyed. Students reported demographic factors, amount of contact with older adults, how rewarding that contact had been, and confidence and interest in working with older adults. Higher levels of confidence were associated with gender, studying nursing or physical therapy, and being older. Overall, confidence and interest were positively correlated with (a) positive attitudes toward aging, (b) contact frequency, and (c) quality experiences with older adults. Therefore, confident students with an interest in working with the geriatric population upon graduation have more exposure and more rewarding experiences with older adults before entering their program.

AB  - This paper investigates international responses to Singapore English (SgE), in terms of both intelligibility and attitudes toward the speaker, and compares it to responses to American English (AmE). It surveys 200 respondents from over 20 countries as they listen to a set of 15 sound recordings, including read SgE, spontaneous SgE, and read AmE. The results suggest that the intelligibility of SgE and AmE does differ between informants from different regions. However, the intelligibility of the test stimuli does not correlate simply to positive and negative attitudes. While SgE elicits generally positive attitudes, what is interesting is that the judgments of respondents from South-East Asia and East Asia are often more negative than those of English speakers of Inner Circle varieties. This seems to suggest not only an impenetrable mindset of these traditionally "non-native" English speakers, who seem to be still clamoring to speak an idealized "standard", but also an inferiority complex over their own varieties of English.

AB  - Research suggests that spirituality and religion, particularly attitudes toward God, correlate with life satisfaction. These studies generally rely on self-reports. The current research utilized a reaction time task to test whether implicit and explicit attitudes toward God related with life satisfaction in a diverse Jewish sample. Results indicated that explicit and implicit attitudes did not significantly correlate with each other and that both correlated with life satisfaction. Regression modeling revealed a significant interaction. For those with more positive implicit associations, higher levels of positive explicit attitudes predicted higher life satisfaction, while for those with more negative implicit associations, explicit positive attitudes were unrelated to life satisfaction. Surprisingly, those with positive implicit associations and low levels of explicit positive attitudes reported the lowest life satisfaction. Explicit negative attitudes toward God were unrelated to life satisfaction. Results suggest that life satisfaction is best supported by consistent integration across both implicit and explicit domains.

AB  - Negative attitudes to aging are a risk factor for poor health and well-being. The current study sought to examine satisfaction with social support as a potentially modifiable factor that might facilitate the development of more positive attitudes to aging. A convenience sample of 501 older respondents (M-age=72.06) reported on frequency of social support and their satisfaction with it, as well as completing a rating of attachment (model of the self and others), a measure of attitudes to aging, and a number of background measures. Results indicated that better subjective health, younger age, and greater satisfaction with social support were all significant predictors of more positive attitudes to aging, while frequency of social support was not. Model of the self accounted for some variation in satisfaction with social support. Interventions to increase satisfaction with social support in later life, recognizing individual differences and attachment styles, may improve attitudes to aging and further support health and well-being.

TI  - Research competency and specialist registration: Quo vadis?
T2  - SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - The requirement of 'research completion' as necessary for specialist registration with the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) has recently been subject to legal action, with a court order potentially shifting requirements beyond those envisaged by the HPCSA. The research requirement is congruent with National Department of Health strategy in this regard, i.e. the strengthening of research as a stated priority. While the expectation of research competency is not in itself contentious, the capacity of institutions and the ability of registrars to facilitate and complete, respectively, have brought the issue into focus. Specifically, the apparent discrepancy between a court order and a regulation needs to be resolved to ensure that specialist registration is not unduly hampered, while ensuring that a potentially important contributor to a national priority is not prejudiced.

AB  - This article offers a reflexive conversation between three teacher-educators from a South African University, who teach in the Curriculum Studies discipline. We consider how we can use the curriculum to engage pre-service teachers in discussions that might lead to active participation around issues of prevention and changing of attitudes towards gender-based violence (GBV) against people identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex or queer (LGBTIQ+) people. We used a discussion prompt in the form of a newspaper article. Drawing on transcripts of our audio-recorded dialogue we present a brief examination of our interchanges. Through this dialogue, we attempt to develop a shared sense of how we can use the curriculum to begin engaging students in conversations and confrontation of their own prejudices, so they can, in turn, translate that into their own practice as future teachers.

AB  - Monitoring the transmission status of multi-joint industrial robots is very important for the accuracy of the robot motion. The fault diagnosis information is an indispensable basis for the collaborative maintenance of the robots in industry 4.0. In this paper, an attitude data-based intelligent fault diagnosis approach is proposed for multi-joint industrial robots. Based on the analysis of the transmission mechanism, the attitude change of the last joint is employed to reflect the transmission fault of robot components. An economical data acquisition strategy is performed by only installing one attitude sensor on the last joint of the multi-joint robot. Considering the characteristics of attitude data, a hybrid sparse auto-encoder (SAE) and support vector machine (SVM) approach, namely SAE-SVM, is subsequently presented to construct an intelligent fault diagnosis model by learning from the attitude dataset with multiple fault information. Experimental results show that the proposed fault diagnosis approach has promising performance in identifying different faults related to the reducer of a 6-axial multi-joint industrial robot accurately and reliably.

We analyzed the relationships between attitudes and age, gender, education, occupation, years at residence, income, distance from protected area, livestock owned, live-stock lost to predators and knowledge of carnivores. Three-quarters of respondents (79%) held negative attitudes toward large carnivores, while 20% were generally positive. Three variables were positively associated with attitudes towards different species: formal education (all carnivore species), years at residence (lions and cheetahs), and knowledge of carnivores (cheetahs). Attitudes toward large carnivores were not significantly related to distance from protected area, livestock owned. or livestock lost to predators. Findings suggested that interventions aimed at fostering positive attitudes toward large carnivores should focus on improving formal education and securing long-term residency for people in the region.

AB  - This study explores the navigation patterns of users reading hypertext-linked online news articles about a controversial issue. With the theoretical frameworks of selective exposure and cross-cutting exposure, the study examined the effects of individuals' attitudes on their navigation patterns and consequent attitude changes after the news exposure. We asked 130 participants to read positive or negative news articles about the Korea-U.S. free trade agreement (FTA) by selecting six consecutive webpages. The results indicate that their attitudes toward the FTA was a significant predictor of their news selection, providing support for the selective exposure hypothesis. In terms of navigation patterns across the six news selection stages, the participants tended to select news articles that corresponded to their initial attitudes. The selection gap between participants with different attitudes increased until the fifth stage and ultimately converged. In terms of attitude change, the gap in the participants' attitudes decreased sharply after their navigation.

AB  - Individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD) have reported being stigmatized when they seek care for pain. Nurse attitudes contribute to stigmatization and may affect patients' response to sickle cell cues, care-seeking, and ultimately patient outcomes. The purpose of this cross-sectional, descriptive, comparative design study was to determine whether there are significant differences in nurse attitudes toward patients with SCD by worksite-medical-surgical units compared with emergency departments/intensive care units (ED/ICU). The sample consisted of 77 nurses (36 nurses from the ED/ICU and 41 from medical-surgical units) who completed an anonymous online survey. No significant differences were noted in attitudes by worksite, with nurses from both sites demonstrating high levels of negative attitudes toward patients with SCD. Findings suggest that nurses from both worksites need additional education about SCD and care of this vulnerable, patient population. (C) 2015 by the American Society for Pain Management Nursing

AB  - Australia is a multicultural society. However, its history of British colonisation has contributed to enduring overt and covert discrimination, racism and black/white racial divisions. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are the recipients of ongoing racial discrimination, they are the most disadvantage groups in Australia and they are significantly overrepresented as social work clients. An anti-racist stance is core to social work practice, and some literature has suggested that cultivating empathy can help reduce racism and provoke activism for social justice. In 2014, a classroom-based inquiry exploring barriers to activism extended previous student-centred research exploring empathy and racism. The findings suggest that some students hesitant to commit to action for social justice for reasons including a lack of confidence, and a lack of time and information. Facilitating social work students' confidence, increased understanding of everyday acts of activism and skill development including critical empathy may bolster their confidence and their action for social justice.

AB  - The Statistics Anxiety Rating Scale (STARS) was adapted into German to examine its psychometric properties (n = 400). Two validation studies (n = 66, n = 96) were conducted to examine its criterion-related validity. The psychometric properties of the questionnaire were very similar to those previously reported for the original English version in various countries and other language versions. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated 2 second-order factors: One was more closely related to anxiety and the other was more closely related to negative attitudes toward statistics. Predictive validity of the STARS was shown both in an experimental exam-like situation in the laboratory and during a real examination situation. Taken together, the findings indicate that statistics anxiety as assessed by the STARS is a useful construct that is more than just an expression of a more general disposition to anxiety.

AB  - Latino immigrant men who have sex with men (MSM) are at risk for HIV and delayed diagnosis in the United States. This paper describes the evaluation of a pilot of the Tu Amigo Pepe, a multimedia HIV testing campaign aimed at Latino MSM in Seattle, WA particularly targeting immigrants who may not identify as gay, ages 18-30 years old. The 16-week campaign included Spanish-language radio public service announcements (PSAs), a Web site, social media outreach, a reminder system using mobile technology, print materials and a toll-free hotline. In developing the PSAs, the Integrated Behavioral Model was used as a framework to reframe negative attitudes, beliefs and norms towards HIV testing with positive ones as well as to promote self-efficacy towards HIV testing. The campaign had a significant and immediate impact on attitudes, beliefs, norms and self-efficacy towards HIV testing as well as on actual behavior, with HIV testing rates increasing over time.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In the popular news media, public health officials routinely emphasize the health risks of obesity and portray weight as under personal control. These messages may increase support for policies designed to reduce rates of obesity, but can also increase antifat stigma. Less often, the media cover 'Health at Every Size' or 'Fat Rights' perspectives that may have the opposite effects. We investigated how exposure to different 'fat frames' shifts attitudes about weight and support for obesity policies.
   METHODS: Across four experiments (n = 2187), people read constructed news articles framing fatness as negative (unhealthy, controllable, acceptable to stigmatize) or positive (healthy, uncontrollable, unacceptable to stigmatize).
   RESULTS: Compared with people who read fat-positive frames, people who read fat-negative frames expressed more: belief in the health risks of being fat (d = 0.95-1.22), belief weight is controllable (d = 0.38-0.55), support for charging obese people more for health insurance (d = 0.26-0.77), antifat prejudice (in three out of four experiments, d = 0.28-0.39), willingness to discriminate against fat people (d = 0.39-0.71) and less willingness to celebrate body size diversity (d = 0.37-0.64). They were also less willing to say that women at the lower end of the obese range could be healthy at their weights. Effects on support for public policies, however, were generally small and/or nonsignificant. Compared with a control condition, exposure to fat-positive frames generally shifted attitudes more than fat-negative frames. In experiment 4, adding a message about the unacceptability of weight-based discrimination to unhealthy/controllable news articles only reduced antifat stigma on one of three measures compared with articles adding a discrimination-acceptable message.
   CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to different news frames of fat can shift beliefs about weight-related health risks and weight-based stigma. Shifting policy attitudes, however, is more challenging.

AB  - This article draws on archival sources to trace the way advertising in nineteenth century Australia was used to peddle the prejudices and myths of the settler society, in the context of the broader historical trend of the misappropriation of traditional cultural expressions and racism in advertising throughout the British Empire. These archives reveal an unnerving duality. On the one hand, the Australian advertising archives present a proud and successful society. Juxtaposed against this positive imagery was an unsettling portraiture of the first Australians and their treatment by European settlers. This article will document this duality, and examine how the courts and the legal system validated this behaviour (positively or by omission), with many of these advertising materials registered for trade mark and copyright protection across the Australian colonies. It will also examine how these historical artefacts continue to shape public discourse on race and intellectual property in Australia to this day.

AB  - Event programmes are typically designed with a target audience in mind, and such design can inherently signal inclusion or exclusion of marginalised segments. This is particularly the case for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer (LGBTIQ+) individuals, whose sexual and gender identities position them as an invisible minority on the periphery of society. Given the role of events in building community spirit, it is essential to ensure all members of a community feel able to participate in order to create a sense of belonging, fulfilling Sustainable Development Goals of inclusivity in community. Through the lens of Social Dominance Theory and in pursuit of equality for LGBTIQ+ communities, in-depth interviews were conducted with sexually diverse (queer) participants to explore their perceptions of inclusivity at community events. This study explored how elements of an event could serve to enhance or attenuate prejudice, and therefore influence the inclusion of LGBTIQ+ communities.

AB  - Infectious disease poses a threat to reproductive fitness. However, the costs associated with infectious disease are often greater for females than males. Sexist attitudes toward females may have in part emerged from disease-avoidance concerns, in order to decrease infectious disease threat and promote reproductive success for females (and males indirectly). Across three studies, disease-avoidance tendencies were positively correlated with benevolent sexism (perceiving females as pure and in need of protection). Hostile sexism, or more traditional negative attitudes toward females, was inconsistently related to disease avoidance. Furthermore, right-wing authoritarianism partially accounted for the relation between disease avoidance and benevolent sexism, whereas right-wing authoritarianism fully accounted for the relation between disease avoidance and hostile sexism. By encouraging traditional sex roles and restricting female sexual behavior, benevolent sexism may reduce infectious disease threat in females, while maintaining positive relations between the sexes (unlike hostile sexism), which is important for reproduction.

AB  - Cultural competency in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) health care has been found to be lacking within various medical specialties, but no studies have compared competency among primary care providers. The authors compared 127 primary care providers? cultural competency regarding LGBTQ health using a survey that assessed providers? attitudes, practices, and knowledge. Overall, 78.0% of respondents agreed that they were comfortable treating LGBTQ patients. Yet many providers did not feel well informed on specific LGBTQ health needs (70.1%), on clinical management of LGBTQ care (74.8%), nor on referring patients with LGBTQ issues (78.7%). Overall accuracy on LGBTQ knowledge questions was 51.0%. This study revealed a lack of cultural competency and much need for improvement as primary care providers endorsed negative attitudes, biases, inconsistencies in clinical practice, and deficiencies in medical knowledge in specialty-specific ways. There is a need for greater LGBTQ-specific education to increase providers? comfortability and competency in the needs, management, and referrals within LGBTQ health care.

Predictive validity of the SSDO was almost as high as that of the SSD6; internal reliability, however, was considerably lower. Further, as hypothesized, individuals exhibiting lower levels of SDO, as assessed by both SDO6 and SSDO, exhibit lower levels of speciesism as well as higher levels of empathic concern. In addition, as hypothesized, ethical vegans, as compared to carnists, display lower levels of SDO and speciesism, and higher levels of empathic concern.

AB  - The recent migratory crisis has multiplied the number of school age people that are forced to immigrate. The integration of the minors in host countries demands not only schooling, but also an inclination of the educational community to accept the said reality and critically manage European immigration policies. At the European level there is a growing rejection toward the migratory phenomenon and European policies. This study analyzes the attitudes toward refugees through the perception of real threat, symbol, and the affective reactions that the future professors experience. Furthermore, it explores in what extent the attitudes toward refugees are related to an inclusive European citizenship. It involves survey research (a sample of 624 education students from southeast Spain in recent years) with a transversal design. The used instrument is a modified version of the scale of attitudes and a scale of inclusive European citizenship itself. The results show a marked indifference toward the related issues with refugees, but not a perceived elevated threat or marked emotional reactions. While the attitudes toward refugees are not very positive, there is a positive inclusive European citizenship that legitimizes the reception of refugees in European states, the cession of equal rights and possibilities of new forms of coexistence. This study manifests a marked correlation between attitudes toward refugees and inclusive European citizenship, where the perceived threat appears like the principal predictor of inclusive citizenship. The results permit us to place these future teachers inside the European panorama as one of the social sectors less affected by the growing xenophobia and discredit toward the European Union. However, they are precise and urgent programs of training in intercultural, antiracist and migratory education

AB  - This article reports on a formative qualitative evaluation conducted to identify potential barriers and facilitators prior to implementation of a two-part educational intervention designed to increase older adults' participation in clinical research. We conducted focus groups with 35 older adults from diverse racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds (Mean age = 74.5 +/- 7.4 years), and six clinical researchers involved in aging research. Two older adult patient stakeholder advisors participated as members of the research team. Findings from thematic analysis showed that common barriers to research participation included older adults' fear and mistrust of researchers and the medical community as well as misperceptions and negative attitudes about clinical research. A commonly held belief was that most clinical research is conducted by "greedy" pharmaceutical companies who are more interested in profits than finding cures for disease. Results provide useful insights regarding enrolling members of hard-to-reach older adult populations in clinical research.

The aim of this study was to assess schistosomiasis related levels of knowledge, attitude, and practices of communities in lowland areas of western Ethiopia, where schistosomiasis is endemic.MethodsA community-based multilevel triangulation mixed-methods design was conducted in three schistosomiasis endemic villages in the Abbey and Didessa valleys of the Benishangul Gumuz Region of Western Ethiopia, where mass drug administration (MDA) was done 30years back and again the last 5 years. A structured survey questionnaire, in-depth interviews, focused group discussions, and observation was conducted to assess levels of knowledge, attitude, and practices related to schistosomiasis in the communities.ResultsAmong the survey participants, 13% reported having heard of schistosomiasis, locally called Pecka (meaning worm). The majority of this 13% believe that schistosomiasis is caused by the biting of the worm Pecka, while others say drinking dirty water is the cause of infection, or they didn't know what the cause is. A majority of respondents answered "I don't know" to most of the questions about established knowledge of schistosomiasis. Male participants and students were more aware of schistosomiasis than their counterparts, and awareness increased with the educational level. Only one participant perceived that schistosomiasis was a serious disease. There were negative attitudes and misconceptions about the drug used in the mass treatment and many complaints were raised related to the size of the tablet and its side effects. There was no local budget and specific plan to prevent and control the disease. Local health personnel had insufficient knowledge about schistosomiasis, and the diagnosis and treatment capacities of local health institutions were poor.ConclusionIn the current research area, schistosomiasis prevention and control recommendations should be redesigned to change the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the community and local health workers. It is also necessary to have the local budget and trained manpower in order to diagnose and treat schistosomiasis locally. There is a great need to have a safer Praziquantel pediatric formulation.

AB  - In a location-based social network, users socialize with each other by sharing their current location in the form of check-in, which allows users to reveal the current places they visit as part of their social interaction. Understanding this human check-in phenomenon in space and time on location based social network (LBSN) datasets, which is also called check-in behavior, can archive the day-to-day activity patterns, usage behaviors toward social media, and presents spatiotemporal evidence of users' daily routines. It also provides a wide range of opportunities to observe (i.e., mobility, urban activities, defining city boundary, and community problems in a city). In representing human check-in behavior, these LBSN datasets do not reflect the real-world events due to certain statistical biases (i.e., gender prejudice, a low frequency in sampling, and location type prejudice). However, LBSN data is primarily considered a supplement to traditional data sources (i.e., survey, census) and can be used to observe human check-in behavior within a city. Different interpretations are used elusively for the term check-in behavior, which makes it difficult to identify studies on human check-in behavior based on LBSN using the Weibo dataset. The primary objective of this research is to explore human check-in behavior by male and female users in Guangzhou, China toward using Chinese microblog Sina Weibo (referred to as Weibo), which is missing in the existing literature. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is utilized to explore the spatiotemporal distribution geographically and weighted regression (GWR) method was applied to observe the relationship between check-in and districts with a focus on gender during weekdays and weekend. Lastly, the standard deviational ellipse (SDE) analysis is used to systematically analyze the orientation, direction, spatiotemporal expansion trends and the differences in check-in distribution in Guangzhou, China. The results of this study show that LBSN is a reliable source of data to observe human check-in behavior in space and time within a specified geographic area. Furthermore, it shows that female users are more likely to use social media as compared to male users. The human check-in behavior patterns for social media network usage by gender seems to be slightly different during weekdays and weekend.

AB  - Objectives: Self-compassion functions as a psychological buffer in the face of negative life experiences. Considering that suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) are often accompanied by intense negative feelings about the self (e.g., self-loathing, self-isolation), self-compassion may have the potential to alleviate these negative attitudes and feelings toward oneself. This meta-analysis investigated the associations of self-compassion with STBs and NSSI.
   Methods: A literature search finalized in August 2020 identified 18 eligible studies (13 STB effect sizes and seven NSSI effect sizes), including 8,058 participants. Two studies were longitudinal studies, and the remainder were cross-sectional studies. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted using CMA 3.0. Subgroup analyses, meta-regression, and publication bias analyses were conducted to probe potential sources of heterogeneity.
   Results: With regard to STBs, a moderate effect size was found for self-compassion (r = -0.34, k = 13). Positively worded subscales exhibited statistically significant effect sizes: self-kindness (r = -0.21, k = 4), common humanity (r = -0.20, k = 4), and mindfulness (r = -0.15, k = 4). For NSSI, a small effect size was found for self-compassion (r = -0.29, k = 7). There was a large heterogeneity (I-2 = 80.92% for STBs, I-2 = 86.25% for NSSI), and publication bias was minimal. Subgroup analysis results showed that sample characteristic was a moderator, such that a larger effect size was witnessed in clinical patients than sexually/racially marginalized individuals, college students, and healthy-functioning community adolescents.
   Conclusions: Self-compassion was negatively associated with STBs and NSSI, and the effect size of self-compassion was larger for STBs than NSSI. More evidence is necessary to gauge a clinically significant protective role that self-compassion may play by soliciting results from future longitudinal studies or intervention studies.

KW  - qualitative research
AB  - The article critically evaluates liberal nationalist perspectives on immigration by drawing on findings from a qualitative research project undertaken in 2014 among White British interviewees in England. From one perspective the study's participants' attitudes seem to support arguments made by David Goodhart and other liberal nationalists regarding immigration, social trust and integration. However, further analysis suggests that these attitudes are to a very significant extent drawn first from partially imagined ideas surrounding immigration and second from potentially unreliable sources. These findings thus provoke the question of whether social trust and notions of a national community are actually being disrupted by immigration, or whether they are being disrupted by prejudiced nationalist and xenophobic perceptions about immigration and immigrants. The article will conclude by arguing for more nuanced research into attitudes towards immigration and in favour of a sceptical approach to nationalist frameworks for interpreting society and politics in Britain today.

AB  - Essentialist theories are the beliefs that there are immutable essences underlying observed differences between social groups (e.g. racial group, cultural group). This paper reviews the intergroup dynamics and intrapersonal processes associated with essentialism. It also explores the interplay between the two. By explicating the intricate relationship between these psychological processes, the current paper aims to advance our understanding of intergroup relations and identify their implications for the study of multiculturalism. We posit that although the commonly observed negative intergroup outcomes, such as prejudices and biases, can be the byproducts of basic cognitive processes associated with essentialist theories, the social power dynamics in a given society also play important roles in shaping the relationships between essentialism and intergroup outcomes. We then discuss the implications of this understanding to our increasingly multicultural world.

AB  - The paper presents a wall-climbing robot featuring self-compliance for variable curvature facades. The high payload and maneuverability make it highly potential in heavy-duty operation of industrial applications. The robot consists of two traction modules and one link module. Each traction module is equipped with magnetic adhesion and crawler traction submodules. The two traction modules are connected by the link module with 4 degrees of freedom (DoF) of passive compliance. Variable curvature facade self-compliance is achieved by the passive compliant link module, which results in the attitude change decoupling of the two traction modules. The attitude can be adjusted under the effect of magnetic adhesion force to comply with the curvature variations. High payloads are achieved by the large contact area between the crawler and the surface. Omni-directional high maneuverability is enabled by the speed difference between the motors of two traction modules. The robot can maneuver in any direction on the surface with a minimum radius of 1 m and carry 36 kg payload on vertical surfaces.

AB  - This paper analyses how terrorist attacks and high inflows of immigrants impact public attitudes towards immigrants from outside the European Union (EU). It makes an original contribution by analysing both effects in tandem, using an extended longitudinal framework to assess both shorter and longer term impacts and taking into account the role of uncertainty. Ordered probit regression models are applied to data from nine consecutive Eurobarometer (EB) surveys to examine impacts of 25 terrorist attacks in Western Europe in 2014-2018. Attacks with higher number of deaths significantly increase negative attitudes to immigrants although the effect fades over time. However, the 2015 migration crisis had a significant, greater and more sustained impact on attitudes towards immigrants than terrorist attacks. The differences in attitudes to migrants in the EU15 countries and post-communist countries provide support for the assumptions of the intergroup contact theory rather than the group threat theory.

AB  - This paper examines the effects of the safari hunting ban of 2014 on rural livelihoods and wildlife conservation in Northern Botswana using the social exchange theory. The paper used both primary and secondary data sources. Data were analysed qualitatively. Results indicate that the ban led to a reduction of tourism benefits to local communities such as: income, employment opportunities, social services such as funeral insurance, scholarships and income required to make provision of housing for the needy and elderly. After the hunting ban, communities were forced to shifts from hunting to photographic tourism. Reduced tourism benefits have led to the development of negative attitudes by rural residents towards wildlife conservation and the increase in incidents of poaching in Northern Botswana. The implications of hunting ban suggest that policy shifts that affect wildlife conservation and rural livelihoods need to be informed by socio-economic and ecological research. This participatory and scientific approach to decision-making has the potential to contribute sustainability of livelihoods and wildlife conservation in Botswana.

AB  - The attitudes of individuals who receive, provide, or influence opioid use disorder (OUD) medication services, also called stakeholders, may enhance or hinder their dissemination and adoption. Individuals who have resolved a significant alcohol or other drug (AOD) problem are a group of key stakeholders whose OUD medication attitudes are not well understood empirically. This group subsumes, but is not limited to, individuals who identify as being "in recovery." Analyses leveraged the National Recovery Study, a geo-demographically representative survey of U.S. adults who resolved a significant AOD problem (N = 1,946). We examined the prevalence of positive, neutral. and negative attitudes toward agonists, such as buprenorphine/naloxone and methadone, and antagonists, such as oral and extended-release depot injection naltrexone. Single-predictor logistic regression models tested for demographic. clinical, and recovery-related correlates of these attitudes and, for those significant at the .1 level, multivariable-predictor logistic regression models tested unique associations between these correlates and attitudes. Results showed that participants were equally likely to hold positive (21.4 [18.9-24.01%) and negative agonist (23.8 [21.2-26.71%) attitudes but significantly more likely to hold negative (30.3 [27.4-33.31%) than positive antagonist attitudes (18.0 [15.9-20.4%). Neutral attitudes were most commonly endorsed for both agonists (54.8 [51.6-57.91%) and antagonists (51.7 [48.5-54.81%). For agonists, more recent AOD problem resolution was a unique predictor of positive attitude, whereas Black and Hispanic raoes/ettinkities, compared with White, were unique predictors of negative attitude. For antagonists. older age group (45-59 and 60+ vs. 18-29 years), lifetime opioid antagonist medication prescription. and past 90-day non-12-step mutual-help attendance were unique predictors of positive attitude, whereas greater spirituality was a unique predictor of negative attitude. This population-level study of U.S. adults who resolved an AOD problem showed that agonist attitudes may be more positive than anecdotal evidence suggests. Certain characteristics and experiences, however. highlight a greater likelihood of negative attitudes, suggesting these factors may be potential barriers to OUD medication adoption.
