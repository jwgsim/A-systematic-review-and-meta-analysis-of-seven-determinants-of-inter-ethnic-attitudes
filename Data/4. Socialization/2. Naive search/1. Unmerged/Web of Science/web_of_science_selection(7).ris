AB  - Introduction Population ageing, the rise of chronic diseases and the emergence of new viruses are some of the factors that contribute to an increasing share of gross domestic product dedicated to health spending. COVID-19 has shown that nursing staff represents the critical part of hospitalisation. Technological developments in robotics and artificial intelligence can significantly reduce costs and lead to improvements in many hospital processes. The proposed study aims to assess expectations, attitudes and ethical acceptability regarding the integration of socially assistive humanoid robots into hospitalised care workflow from patients' and healthcare professionals' perspectives and to compare them with the results of similar studies. Methods/design The study is designed as a cross-sectional survey, which will include three previously validated questionnaires, the Technology-Specific Expectation Scale (TSES), the Ethical Acceptability Scale (EAS) and the Negative Attitudes towards Robots Scale (NARS). The employees of a regional clinical centre will be asked to participate via an electronic survey and respond to TSES and EAS questionaries. Patients will respond to TSES and NARS questionaries. The survey will be conducted online. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval for the study was obtained by the Medical Ethics Commission of the University Medical Center Maribor. Results will be published in a relevant scientific journal and communicated to participants and relevant institutions through dissemination activities and the ecosystem of the Horizon 2020 funded project HosmartAI (grant no. 101016834). Ethical approval date 06 May 2021. Estimated start of the study December 2021.

AB  - Social work strives to be inclusive of all cultural groups and religious identities. However, a tension exists in the profession between freedom of religious expression and full acceptance of lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. David Hodge and others claim social work is oppressive to evangelical Christians. This article critiques primarily Hodge's arguments using an analysis of biblical scriptures, new class theory, freedom of expression, and social work ethics. Social work and human rights principles are discussed as a guide for negotiating these issues in the social work educational environment. Intergroup dialogue is offered as a pedagogical method for addressing the tension in social work classrooms.

AB  - The current study utilized regulatory focus theory to explain how online deliberations are processed differently depending on a participant's information processing style and the characteristics of a discussion topic. An experiment was conducted to investigate the relationship between informational characteristics (hedonic vs. utilitarian) and attitude change toward information, as well as the moderating effect of regulatory focus (promotion vs. prevention). Results from 207 students indicated that promotion-focused participants were more likely to change their attitude toward information than prevention-focused participants during online deliberations. Furthermore, when presented with hedonic information, attitude changes toward information were stronger for promotion-focused participants as compared to prevention-focused participants. However, when presented with utilitarian information, attitude changes were stronger for prevention-focused participants. The present findings enable researchers and practitioners to understand the interactive influence of informational characteristics and regulatory foci of participants during online deliberations, as well as influence participants' biased information processing.

AB  - Based on the theory of planned behavior, the aim of this study was to describe the influencing factors of patient delay intentions and behaviors in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients and to provide a reference for the development of a patient delay intention scale. This study was carried out over 4 months in 2021 in Daqing, Heilongjiang, China. The participants were 20 patients with BPH who were aged 60 to 82 years and experienced patient delay; participants were selected through a purposive sampling method. The data were collected via face-to-face semistructured interviews. Five main themes emerged from the interviews, including an insufficient understanding of symptoms, experiences of coping instead of seeking health care, negative attitudes toward care-seeking, the influence of others on decision-making for careseeking, and obstacles to seeking health care. In conclusion, the patient delay intentions and behaviors of BPH patients are the result of a combination of many factors.

AB  - A longitudinal study (N = 774) explored the short and longer term impacts of anti-Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Trans (LGBT) hate crime experienced directly, indirectly, and through the media. In the short term, being a victim (direct) or personally knowing of a hate crime victim (indirect) was positively associated with vulnerability, emotional responses, and behavioral intentions after reading about a hate crime. Direct victims were also less empathic toward other victims and engaged in more victim-blaming. A structural equation model showed direct experiences (via personal vulnerability and empathy) and media experiences (via group-threat and victim-blaming) to be cross-sectionally associated with behavioral intentions. Media experiences also had lasting demobilizing impacts on actual behaviors, again serially mediated by group-threat and victim-blaming. The findings highlight the emotional and behavioral impacts of hate crimes on both direct victims and on the wider LGBT community. They also raise questions about media reporting of hate crimes and the role of victim-blaming.

AB  - This study examines strategies for improving the work attitude and mental health of airlines' "problem employees". Based on a review of previous studies, five different handling methods for problem employees were derived: (1) duty assignment according to ability, (2) confidence beliefs, (3) managerial coaching, (4) human understanding, and (5) mentor system. The study hypothesized that these five approaches influence employees' work attitudes, mental health, and job performance. To verify these hypotheses, empirical data were collected from 200 airline crew members. The analysis found that only three of the "five different handling methods of problem employees" positively influence job attitudes, mental health, and job performance: (1) duty assignment according to ability, (2) confidence beliefs, and (3) mentor system. In contrast, managerial coaching negatively impacted outcome variables. The study also found that the current handling approaches implemented in the industry have positive and negative outcomes on problem employees. Therefore, airline companies need to manage problem staff based on the findings of this study. Particularly, when conducting managerial coaching, supervisors should check employees' work attitude change status. Research implications, limitations, and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Research examining the efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in reducing recidivism has paid little attention to treatment factors contributing to response variability. Using an archival sample of 448 participants exposed to a risk-need-responsivity (RNR)-informed CBT program or no treatment, a multigroup latent profile analysis yielded a four-profile solution: a treatment-nonresponsive group and three treatment-responsive groups. Among the treatment-responsive profiles, reduced criminal attitudes were most predictive of desistance from reoffending. Elevated rates of recidivism and negligible gains following treatment were associated with pretreatment elevations in antisocial traits, risk level, and negative attitudes toward treatment. These findings underscore a greater need for individualized assessment of risk and treatment motivation, the importance of altering criminal sentiments to prevent reentry into the system upon release, and challenge the idea that 200 hours of treatment is sufficient for lasting change. Study limitations and further directions are discussed, including the need for correctional treatment outcome research to better isolate individual differences.

AB  - Communication in social media is increasingly being found to reproduce or even reinforce ethnic prejudice and hostility toward migrants. In Russia of the 2010s, with its world's second largest immigrant population, polls have detected high levels of hostility of the Russian population toward migranty (migrants), a label attached to resettlers from Central Asia and the Caucasus. We tested the online hostility hypothesis by using the data of 363,000 posts from the Russian-language LiveJournal. We applied data mining, regression analysis, and selective interpretative reading to map bloggers' attitudes toward migranty, among other ethnicities and nations. Our findings significantly alter the picture drawn from the polls: Migranty neither provoke the biggest amount of discussion nor experience the worst treatment in Russian blogs, in which Americans take the lead. Furthermore, Central Asians and North Caucasians are treated very differently.

AB  - Despite the massive interest in open innovation, limited attention has been expressed concerning the intra-organizational challenges in implementing it. An exemplary issue is the unwillingness of employees to undertake extra-organizational knowledge transactions in the form of negative attitudes against the sourcing of external knowledge (the not-invented-here (NIH) syndrome) and against the external exploitation of knowledge assets (the not-shared-here (NSH) syndrome). Using survey data collected from 331 firms, this article empirically assesses the theoretical assertion that the NIH and NSH syndromes have negative impacts on the adoption of inbound and outbound open innovation. Furthermore, it investigates how their effects can be reduced through competence-building programs based on the training of employees. By focusing on two attitudinal antecedents to openness, the findings offer an explanation for the problems that firms face in benefiting from inflows and outflows of knowledge and possible guidance as to how managers can disengage such attitudes.

AB  - Purpose Tobacco prevention media campaigns are an important tool to address youth tobacco use. We developed a theory-based perceived message effectiveness (PME) Scale to use when vetting messages for campaigns. Methods Participants were a national sample of N=623 US adolescents (ages 13-17 years) recruited from a national probability-based panel. In an online experiment, we randomised adolescents to view tobacco prevention ads. All participants viewed an ad on smoking or vaping from the US Food and Drug Administration's The Real Cost campaign and a control video, in a random order. After ad exposure, we assessed PME using nine candidate items and constructs for convergent and criterion validity analyses. We used confirmatory factor analysis and examined information curves to select the scale items. Results A brief PME scale with three items (alpha=0.95) worked equally well for demographically diverse adolescents with different patterns of tobacco use. The Real Cost ads generated higher PME scores than the control videos for both vaping and smoking (convergent validity; p<0.05). Higher PME scores were associated with greater attention, fear, cognitive elaboration and anticipated social interactions (convergent validity; r=0.31-0.66), as well as more negative attitudes toward and lower susceptibility to vaping and smoking (criterion validity; r=-0.14 to -0.37). A single-item PME measure performed similarly to the three-item version. Conclusions The University of North Carolina PME Scale for Youth is a reliable and valid measure of the potential effectiveness of vaping and smoking prevention ads. Employing PME scales during message development and selection may help youth tobacco prevention campaigns deploy more effective ads.

AB  - We present results from a large (n = 3,016) field experiment at a global organization testing whether a brief science-based online diversity training can change attitudes and behaviors toward women in the workplace. Our preregistered field experiment included an active placebo control and measured participants' attitudes and real workplace decisions up to 20 weeks postintervention. Among groups whose average untreated attitudes-whereas still supportive of women-were relatively less supportive of women than other groups, our diversity training successfully produced attitude change but not behavior change. On the other hand, our diversity training successfully generated some behavior change among groups whose average untreated attitudes were already strongly supportive of women before training. This paper extends our knowledge about the pathways to attitude and behavior change in the context of bias reduction. However, the results suggest that the one-off diversity trainings that are commonplace in organizations are unlikely to be stand-alone solutions for promoting equality in the workplace, particularly given their limited efficacy among those groups whose behaviors policymakers are most eager to influence.

AB  - Introduction: Almost a billion people in the world are affected by Vitamin D deficiency. During pregnancy, the deficiency of Vitamin D can manifest as gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, or miscarriage in the early stages of pregnancy. The objective of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice and importance of Vitamin D among pregnant women via focus group.
   Methods: A qualitative study was carried out at Changu Narayan Municipality, Duwakot ward no. two, Bhaktapur district from November to December 2019 after approval from Institutional Review Committee of Kathmandu Medical College (Ref. 181020192). Participants were selected via the Female Community Health Volunteer's pregnant women list by purposive sampling method. Focus group discussion was conducted among pregnant women. The interview questions were open-ended and the data were analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Study participants showed limited knowledge on vitamin D. Few participants had information regarding sun exposure for vitamin D. But many participants had negative attitudes towards sun exposure and lack of knowledge on sun exposure requirements. The participants have a huge knowledge gap between Vitamin D and its importance in pregnancy.
   Conclusions: Increasing awareness of the importance of Vitamin D among pregnant women is required.

AB  - Overt and covert experiences of prejudice and discrimination have been associated with increased stress and distress among people with disabilities. Although researchers have explored people with disabilities' experiences with microaggressions, no measure exists to assess disability microaggressions. The present research was conducted to develop and validate a scale that measures microaggressions experienced by people with physical disabilities, the Ableist Microaggressions Scale (AMS). Study 1 developed the preliminary AMS based on eight primary disability microaggressions domains outlined in Keller and Galgay's (2010) qualitative study, as well as expert feedback, cognitive interviews, and a pilot study. Study 2 consisted of exploratory factor analysis (N = 559) to determine factor structure, and a 4-factor model emerged. Study 3 confirmed the factor structure through confirmatory factor analysis (N = 833), and demonstrated adequate validity and reliability for the 20-item AMS. Additional findings, implications, and limitations are discussed.

AB  - The Attitudes Toward Religion Scale (ATRS) was developed to access the level of interest in and position toward the five state-approved religions in China. Data were analysed across two samples of Chinese college students. With Sample 1 (N = 278), exploratory factor analyses were used to select the 10 ATRS items corresponding to two factors: Interest and Position. With Sample 2, confirmatory factor analyses (N = 270) cross-validated the two-factor oblique model as well as a bifactor model. Cronbach alphas of ATRS subscale scores in the two samples ranged from .75 to .85. ATRS-Interest and Position were both positively associated with number of close relationships with religious people. In addition, negative attitudes toward religion was associated with being religiously proselytised by strangers. Moreover, female students reported more favourable attitudes toward religion compared to their male counterparts. The overall results support ATRS as a psychometrically strong and promising measure.

AB  - What are the effects of judicial action and policy implementation on attitude change? The previous literature indicates that attitudes may change, but there is some debate about its direction. According to some theories, legislation or litigation should strike a backlash, resulting in greater disapproval of the issue. Other perspectives contend that these acts reflect consensus, legitimate, or polarize the issue. We analyze panel data on attitudes toward same-sex marriage and feelings toward lesbians and gay men. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court made historic decisions on same-sex marriage, and residents in some states had same-sex marriage legalized. Given this variation, we decompose the multiple pathways attitudes change among residents in different policy contexts over time. We find that residents of states that had same-sex marriage policy introduced had the greatest reduction of anti-gay attitudes. We consider consensus and legitimacy as most applicable and provide minimal indication of backlash or polarization.

AB  - Background. Negative attitudes of health professionals towards suicide may hamper their willingness and skills to work with attempt survivors.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore the attitudes of physicians and nurses towards suicide and the suicidal patient.
   Methods: A semi-structured qualitative interview was conducted on Twenty five (25) health professionals: (15 physicians and 10 casualty nurses) from five hospitals in Accra, the capital of Ghana.
   Results: Findings showed that while majority of physicians viewed suicide as an existential crisis, most of the nurses viewed it as a moral infraction. Three key attitudes towards suicide and the suicidal patient were observed: stable, dissonant and transitioned. The findings are discussed under three main themes: Contexts, Theorizing suicide, and Shades of attitudes.
   Conclusion: Nurses and Physicians are key gatekeepers in suicide prevention in Ghana. Training is however, needed to improve both attitudes (especially for nurses) and competence towards suicide prevention in the country.

AB  - Projected estimates for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer (LGBTQ) populations in the United States reach 4 to 8 million older adults by 2030. Healthy People 2020 created goals to improve the health, safety, and well-being of these individuals. However, not all political agendas point to resolutions favorable for this population. Provisions under the Affordable Care Act once considered status quo protections for the LGBTQ community are now threatened as law makers are rolling back health care mandates, exposing members of the LGBTQ community to potential exacerbations of prejudice, discrimination, and stigmatization previously seen as historical violations of human rights. The purpose of this article is to identify how current health care policies have created legal windows of opportunity for persons to discriminate and create juxtaposition with goals and objectives of Healthy People 2020, promoting barriers in the health care continuum for LGBTQ aging adults.

T2  - LAW & SOCIETY REVIEW

KW  - VILIFICATION
AB  - This article examines the effects of hate speech laws in Australia. Triangulating data from primary and secondary sources, we examine five hypothesized effects: whether the laws provide a remedy to targets of hate speech, encourage more respectful speech, have an educative or symbolic effect, have a chilling effect, or create "martyrs." We find the laws provide a limited remedy in the complaints mechanisms, provide a framework for direct community advocacy, and that knowledge of the laws exists in public discourse. However, the complaints mechanism imposes a significant enforcement burden on targeted communities, who still regularly experience hate speech. We find a reduction in the expression of prejudice in mediated outlets, but not on the street. We find no evidence of a chilling effect and we find the risk of free speech martyrs to be marginal. We draw out the implications of these findings for other countries.

AB  - Population density has been identified as an ecological factor with considerable behavioral implications. The present research aimed to examine whether the mere perception of more (vs. less) populated places can change consumers' luxury-linked brand attitudes. To this end, we experimentally manipulated consumers' perceptions of population density using pictorial exposure to high (vs. low) population density cues. The results revealed a significant interaction between manipulated population density and perceived brand luxury on brand attitudes. Specifically, exposure to high rather than low population density cues resulted in more positive (negative) attitudes toward brands deemed to be more (less) luxurious. These findings support our prediction that high population density cues can shift people's perceptions in consumption contexts linked to luxury. Our work contributes to the growing stream of literature on population density and suggests that this (geo-) demographic factor can exert important downstream effects on consumer behavior.

AB  - In this paper we highlight key conceptual, empirical, and theoretical contributions of the sociology of race and racism, particularly those relevant to education scholars. We suggest that educational researchers could benefit from incorporating some of the insights of sociological research on race and racism into their scholarship as such engagement would help to refine and deepen understandings of what race is and is not, how racial dynamics shape what happens in schools, and how schools matter for society. Similarly, studies of school processes, practices, politics, and outcomes can help us to understand more about the construction, negotiation, and transformation of racial knowledge, racial boundaries, and racial hierarchies. We thus advocate for more robust interdisciplinary exchange and believe that the potential benefits are substantial not only to academic fields but also to efforts to advance racial justice more generally. How we conceptualize race informs how we measure it and how we make sense of the pervasive racial inequity that defines our society and pervades educational institutions.

AB  - We propose a theoretical framework to study the determinants of ethnic and religious identity along two distinct motivational processes: cultural distinction and cultural conformity. Under cultural conformity, ethnic identity is reduced by neighborhood integration, which weakens group loyalties and prejudices. On the contrary, under cultural distinction, ethnic minorities are more motivated in retaining their own distinctive cultural heritage the more integrated are the neighborhoods where they reside and work. Using data on ethnic preferences and attitudes provided by the Fourth National Survey of Ethnic Minorities in the UK we find evidence that might be consistent with intense ethnic and religious identity mostly formed as a cultural distinction mechanism. Consistently, we document that ethnic identities might be more intense in mixed than in segregated neighborhoods. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The continuing significance of race in U.S. society and culture begs the question of what role history and social studies education can and should play in preparing students to critically and constructively address race and racism in contemporary U.S. society and culture. However, research on history and social studies curriculum and practice continues to demonstrate significant problems in meaningfully including and representing race. racism, and racial violence in U.S. history, underscoring the need for additional research to improve how we address race and racism in history and social studies education.
   Purpose: I examined how teachers' understandings of race and racism, which informed their use of curricular materials, and the content, focus, and framing of race and racism in the formal curriculum shaped the inclusion and representation of race and racism. in the enacted U.S. history curriculum in their classes.
   Research Design: Qualitative methods were used to study U.S. history instruction in three teachers' classes at a suburban high school. This included daily observations in each teacher's class over a 7-month period, observation of weekly teacher planning meetings, individual interviews with teachers and group interviews with students, and collection of all curricular materials, and samples of student work.
   Findings: Race and racism were addressed in lessons on U.S. imperialism in the late 1800s and early 1900s in a U.S. foreign policy unit and in a civil rights unit that focused on the civil rights movement. In both units race remained an elusive concept, for example referencing skin color but also culture and nationality, and racism was represented as shared beliefs in the superiority of whites over nonwhites. However. during the civil rights unit, the representation of racism as an individual psychological phenomenon of prejudice and stereotyping came to be privileged over other representations and, coupled with ambiguous understandings of race, this enabled the decaupling of race from representations of racism. Additionally, race was eventually forgotten in accounts of civil rights movement events as teachers' use of the formal curriculum deflected attention away from discussions of race and racism.
   Conclusions: More robust understandings of race as a process of racialization and representations of racism as structural and systemic would assist teachers in presenting a continuous history of racism in the United States that would better outfit students to constructively engage racism in the present.

TI  - 'Forgotten Female Soldiers in an Unknown Army': German women working behind the lines, 1914-1918
T2  - WOMENS HISTORY REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - WAR
AB  - Some 50,000 German women served behind the lines during the First World War, as nurses, war auxiliaries and in the civilian administrations of Belgium and Russian Poland. After the war only nurses had a place in the collective memory while the women who served in the women's war auxiliary service and those who worked within the occupied territories were forgotten. Although women's war auxiliaries were held in disrepute by some contemporaries, an exploration of the service reveals not only the high regard in which the majority of women and their work were held by their employers but also the class and generational prejudices of the upper- and upper-middle-class women running the service and the tensions in their relationships with the German women working within the civilian administrations, who displayed organisational flair and strong collegiality.

AB  - Background: Genetic testing has been gradually permeating the practice of medicine. Health-care providers may be confronted with new genetic approaches that require genetically informed decisions which will be influenced by patients' knowledge of genetics and their attitudes toward genetic testing. This study assesses the knowledge of genetics and attitudes toward genetic testing among college students. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a multistage stratified sample of 920 senior college students enrolled at King Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia. Information regarding knowledge of genetics, attitudes toward genetic testing, and sociodemographic data were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Results: In general, students had a good knowledge of genetics but lacked some fundamentals of genetics. The majority of students showed positive attitudes toward genetic testing, but some students showed negative attitudes toward certain aspects of genetic testing such as resorting to abortion in the case of an untreatable major genetic defect in an unborn fetus. The main significant predictors of knowledge were faculty, gender, academic year, and some prior awareness of 'genetic testing'. The main significant predictors of attitudes were gender, academic year, grade point average, and some prior awareness of 'genetic testing'. Conclusion: The knowledge of genetics among college students was higher than has been reported in other studies, and the attitudes toward genetic testing were fairly positive. Genetics educational programs that target youths may improve knowledge of genetics and create a public perception that further supports genetic testing. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - The United States is a classic country of immigration that has long defined itself as having been built by successive waves of immigrants. Social scientists often speak of a multicultural or cultural pluralist 'model of integration' in the US that recognizes, sometimes even celebrates, diversity at the same time as it assumes and expects immigrants and their children to assimilate and become American. This article complicates the picture. It brings in history to show how national models of integration in the US are not stable but have changed over time. In fact, the very incorporation of earlier waves of immigrants in the past has contributed to these changes. It also considers local-level variation-that is, differences among US cities in policies as well as in widespread understandings about the integration of immigrants. Despite these complications, there are clearly ways that national models of integration matter in the US, which is the theme of the concluding section.

AB  - This article investigates consequences of spatial contexts on interethnic contact. Despite the acknowledged integrative effects of pleasant interethnic relationships, several unresolved issues remain in this research field: investigations at two contextual levels simultaneously-i.e. neighbourhood and municipality levels; investigations of several contextual characteristics simultaneously, e. g. ethnic concentration, physical contact opportunities, population size; investigations on different kinds of interethnic contact, for example, contact with neighbours, with friends or in general. The present study contributes to these issues by analysing interethnic contact from a native's perspective using a German nation-wide dataset. A considerably high proportion of Germans (72 per cent) have contact with foreigners in at least one out of four measured types. Ethnic concentration is the strongest contextual predictor for all kinds of interethnic contact. Physical contact opportunities in the immediate neighbourhood foster interethnic contact in the neighbourhood only, while municipality size mostly diminishes interethnic contact.

AB  - Background: There are increasing efforts and attention focused on the delivery of mental health services in primary care in low resource settings (e.g., mental health Gap Action Programme, mhGAP). However, less attention is devoted to systematic approaches that identify and address barriers to the development and uptake of mental health services within primary care in low-resource settings. Our objective was to prepare for optimal uptake by identifying barriers in rural Liberia. The country's need for mental health services is compounded by a 14-year history of political violence and the largest Ebola virus disease outbreak in history. Both events have immediate and lasting mental health effects.
   Methods: A mixed-methods approach was employed, consisting of qualitative interviews with 22 key informants and six focus group discussions. Additional qualitative data as well as quantitative data were collected through semi-structured assessments of 19 rural primary care health facilities. Data were collected from March 2013 to March 2014.
   Results: Potential barriers to development and uptake of mental health services included lack of mental health knowledge among primary health care staff; high workload for primary health care workers precluding addition of mental health responsibilities; lack of mental health drugs; poor physical infrastructure of health facilities including lack of space for confidential consultation; poor communication support including lack of electricity and mobile phone networks that prevent referrals and phone consultation with supervisors; absence of transportation for patients to facilitate referrals; negative attitudes and stigma towards people with severe mental disorders and their family members; and stigma against mental health workers.
   Conclusions: To develop and facilitate effective primary care mental health services in a post-conflict, low resource setting will require (1) addressing the knowledge and clinical skills gap in the primary care workforce; (2) improving physical infrastructure of health facilities at care delivery points; and (3) implementing concurrent interventions designed to improve attitudes towards people with mental illness, their family members and mental health care providers.

AB  - The country risk indicator, as measured by the JP Morgan's EMBI or grades of rating agencies such as Standard Poor's (SP's) or Moody's, does not seem to truly reflect the fundamentals of an economy. Countries that pursue sound economic policies are frequently placed on the same level as countries with a populist orientation or with a recent history of default or debt restructuring. Such circumstance generates a feeling of unease with regard to these ratings. The objective of this article is to investigate whether these indicators truly reflect market fundamentals or whether some sort of prejudice, or intolerance towards certain countries, can be identified. We use the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition to analyse the differences in country risk, measured as by EMBI+, for a group of emerging markets. This decomposition allows us to separate the 'justified' (differences in fundamentals) from the 'unjustified' differences (same fundamental differently evaluated).

AB  - As LGBTI issues become visible within society there is a growing belief that society is ready to confront prejudices around sexuality and gender. But who is represented in these processes of visualization? The LGBTI agenda has focused on the defense of marriage, Don't Ask Don't Tell, federal hate crime statutes and the Employment Non-discrimination Act. The political strategy around these issues has been defined by a moderate approach based on demanding inclusion into existing institutions. A look at the normalization of sexual politics reveals that minorities remain at the margins. I approached activists from QUEEROCRACY and immigration activist Felipe Baeza to discuss: What are the social issues young people care about ? What forms of activism do young people favor and what motivates them to organize? What forms of visuality do young queer activists use and how do these relate to the strategies of the previous generations?

AB  - Youth who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning (LGBTQQ) often experience heterosexism, homophobia, prejudice, and bullying in addition to the typical demands of adolescent development. Applied theatre programs have been shown to empower youth, improve mental health and well-being, and create positive identity and interpersonal relationships and, as such, have the potential to strengthen a range of protective factors for LGBTQQ youth. However, when programs engage participants in personal narratives, practitioners must be prepared to deftly navigate between the two domains of theatre in health and drama therapy. Since 2017, the University of Florida's (UF) Center for Arts in Medicine has offered an afterschool theatre program for LGBTQQ youth in partnership with clinicians from UF Health's Youth Gender Clinic and faculty in the Mental Health Counseling training program in the College of Education. Theatre practitioners lead the program in partnership with mental health professionals, who participate in sessions and are "on call" for participants. Program facilitators have developed a set of guidelines for organizations attempting to start LGBTQQ or other youth theatre programs in their local communities, which include the following recommendations: (1) prioritize safe and ethical practice through creating sustainable partnerships between mental health counsellors, experienced theatre practitioners, and local LGBTQQ organizations; (2) develop a clear contract between participants and facilitators regarding program goals; (3) utilize Baim's drama spiral as a conceptual tool and limit program activities to the first four spiral rings; (4) emphasize "play" and skill building rather than LGBTQQ topics.

AB  - This study, based on the Cognitive Theory of Metaphor and Conventional Figurative Language Theory, presents a cross-linguistic comparison of the idioms on drunkenness in Chinese and Spanish, applying the analytical method with three hierarchical levels (iconic models > archi-metaphors > particular metaphors). The findings show that, on the one hand, though linguistically and culturally very distant, these two languages share some iconic models (i.e. ANIMAL, MOVEMENT, BODY PART, PLANT and AGGRESSION) in their idioms on inebriation; on the other hand, they also have their own ways in expressing drunkenness, due to their particular cultural backgrounds, i.e. religions, superstitions, history, ethnic prejudices, legends, etc. The present investigation also proves the universality of the cognitive thinking model of human beings as well as the cognitive specialization in different cultures, giving an insight into idiom comprehension and intercultural communication.

AB  - Stanley Milgram was motivated to show how something as horrible as the Holocaust could happen. To what extent does his research provide understanding of this? This article reviews a conception of the origins of genocide and other mass violence, based on case studies of actual instances, ranging from the Holocaust to the genocide in Rwanda and great violence in the Congo, in which psychological and social science principles were applied to historical data. This analysis and conception shows that a multiplicity of societal conditions and cultural characteristics together lead to group violence. Under certain societal and cultural conditions, many people rather than obey, seek, and join, and then subsequently follow, leaders, and groups. However, one cultural characteristic that is usually present and is relevant to Milgram's work, strong authority orientation, promotes the tendency to obedience and reduces the likelihood of resistance. The article also discusses the multiplicity of influences present both in Milgram's experiments and other violence-producing situations, which includes people following rules of conventional behavior, and the multiplicity of psychological processes that arise, and questions some interpretations of Milgram's findings. It discusses the neglected but important role of personality, and the potential inherent in socialization and education to promote inclusive caring and resistance to violence producing situations. It points to the great potential of bystanders, their authority, in preventing violent behavior.

AB  - Electromagnetic spectrum distribution prediction is the basis for the development of wireless communication technology. Due to the high randomness of the rough sea surface, it is difficult to accurately predict the offshore electromagnetic spectrum distribution. We present a prediction model of offshore electromagnetic spectrum distribution based on ray tracing method and Pierson-Moskowitz (PM) wave spectrum model. Based on the antenna attitude and the antenna directional pattern, the field strength calculation formulas of the electromagnetic wave sight line ray (SLR) propagation and the electromagnetic wave reflecting line ray (RLR) propagation off the sea surface are established. As the sea surface and the antenna attitude change, the effective rays from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna also change. This paper focus on the electromagnetic spectrum distribution prediction by calculating the effective angle (EA) of the transmitting antenna. We relate the EA to the antenna tilt angle and the antenna directional pattern, and combine the PM wave spectrum to establish the offshore electromagnetic spectrum distribution prediction models. Finally, we simulated the electromagnetic spectrum distribution prediction based on specific PM wave spectrum data.

AB  - There is growing discourse on the post-gay environment era where sexuality is not seen as a dividing factor, causing gay spaces and events such as Pride to lose relevance. This study consequently explored how lesbian, gay, and bisexual (queer) people perceive the role of Pride events in Sydney, Australia, and Johannesburg, South Africa. Using in-depth interviews, the findings indicate queer people still experienced unique struggles; however, prejudice was now disproportionately experienced by queer people of colour, those with disabilities, and trans people. Pride events serve a personal role in helping to affirm queer identities and provide a sense of normality and connection. It helped LGBTQIA+ people more broadly to come out by giving them a sense of community while drawing queer people's attention to minorities within the LGBTQIA+ communities. Finally, it helped provide the broader community with exposure to queer people while pushing the boundaries of acceptance.

AB  - Integrating information technology into healthcare has the potential to bring treatment to hard-to-reach people. Individuals with serious mental illness (SMI), however, may derive limited benefit from these advances in care because of lack of computer ownership and experience. To date, conclusions about the computer skills and attitudes of adults with SMI have been based primarily on self-report. In the current study, 28 psychiatric outpatients with co-occurring cocaine use were interviewed about their computer use and opinions, and 25 were then directly observed using task analysis and think aloud methods as they navigated a multi-component health informational website. Participants reported low rates of computer ownership and use, and negative attitudes towards computers. Self-reported computer skills were higher than demonstrated in the task analysis. However, some participants spontaneously expressed more positive attitudes and greater computer self-efficacy after navigating the website. Implications for increasing access to computer-based health information are discussed.

AB  - Using focus groups, we examined support and opposition for Donald Trump prior to the 2016 presidential election. When ingroup members participate in discussion, this conversation alone typically strengthens and intensifies members' initial attitudes. We used a pre- to post-focus-group questionnaire to assess attitudes toward Trump, his campaign, and policies. We argue that group polarization influenced people's opinions about Trump such that attitudes became more extreme after discussion with like-minded individuals. We report changes for Trump nonsupporters for which group polarization occurred on attitudes toward illegal immigration, political correctness, the military, women, and veterans after the group discussion. For each, level of support for Trump's views decreased. To further explore potential psychological mechanisms associated with group polarization, we employed network science methods to examine the structure of the language associated with these issues and identify potential drivers of attitude change. Results provide some support for a common mechanism for group polarization, which may be driven by language dynamics specific to individual attitudes.

AB  - While a fair amount of research has examined consumer boycotts, prior research has yet to adequately examine the interaction of religious boycotts and backing by religious leaders influence consumption behavior, particularly in locations where there is a separation of church and state (a novel contribution that our paper addresses). Through a focus group and an experimental study, this research examines how boycotts that are encouraged by religious leaders versus those that are not influence consumption. Specifically, the focus groups show that refutational defenses and supportive defenses induce participation. The experimental study finds that participation in religiously motivated boycotts is greater for consumers that are more religious and when backed by religious leader support. Additionally, negative attitudes toward a business mediate this relationship. Discussion builds on the literature on consumer boycotts, inoculation theory, and value attribution theory as well as provides implications for marketing practitioners.

AB  - Inter-public conflict has largely been neglected in PR research. When left to fester, such conflict may perpetuate prejudice, injustice, inequality, and other societal ills. From a PR standpoint, organizations may find it increasingly difficult to operate in the resulting climate of hostility. This piece aims to shift focus from managing direct, organization-public conflict to navigating indirect, inter-public conflict, thus broadening conflict management perspectives. Based on contingency and social identity theories, we test the dual orientation conflict model (DOCM) in the field of government public relations. The model posits two dimensions (embracing/ excluding and in-group/out-group) and categorizes four types of conflict orientation (adaptation, in-group adoption, out-group adoption, and avoidance). The proposed four-factor model, comprised of 16 items, was found to be reliable and valid in an online survey of 2498 South Korean citizens across different conflictual problems. Theoretical and strategic implications are discussed.

AB  - This article analyses how British popular music culture defined and responded to Krautrock, a subgenre of West German underground rock, during the 1970s. It examines and contextualises British and West German interactions in popular music immediately before Krautrock and at the time of its early definition. The article then explores how so-called Krautrock bands related to the British public and press and how they were described and understood in relation to their nationality. The article suggests that stereotypes and prejudices, shaped by the memory of World War 2, remained a significant aspect of British discourse on West Germany into the 1970s. However, interest in Krautrock gave rise to social and cultural interactions that inspired some to challenge and renegotiate ideas of Germany and Germanness. To some, bonds made through music, culture and politics proved more profound than the history of conflict between Britain and Germany.

AB  - Competitive hypothesis testing may explain differences in predictive power across multiple health behavior theories.
   We tested competing hypotheses of the Health Belief Model (HBM) and Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) to quantify pathways linking subjective norm, benefits, barriers, intention, and mammography behavior.
   We analyzed longitudinal surveys of women veterans randomized to the control group of a mammography intervention trial (n = 704). We compared direct, partial mediation, and full mediation models with Satorra-Bentler chi (2) difference testing.
   Barriers had a direct and indirect negative effect on mammography behavior; intention only partially mediated barriers. Benefits had little to no effect on behavior and intention; however, it was negatively correlated with barriers. Subjective norm directly affected behavior and indirectly affected intention through barriers.
   Our results provide empiric support for different assertions of HBM and TRA. Future interventions should test whether building subjective norm and reducing negative attitudes increases regular mammography.

AB  - In the process of building a smart city, face recognition can be applied to the transformation of enterprises, communities, and parks. The combination of building security system and face recognition technology can improve the security experience of enterprises and citizens through the solution of hardware and software integration. Face recognition is still facing the challenges of illumination, occlusion, and attitude change in the actual application process. In addition, the end-to-end convolutional neural networks (CNN) seldom make use of the hierarchical feature of the network. So, we propose a hierarchy feature fusion method for face recognition, which uses supervisory information to learn shallow and deep facial features. The features are fused to enhance the recognition accuracy of face recognition against illumination and occlusion. The method is applied to the transformation of the visual geometry group network and Lightened CNN. The face recognition experiments are carried out using the hierarchy network. Our method has achieved good recognition results in the labeled faces in the wild (LFW) and AR face databases.

AB  - This analysis compared medication attitudes and reasons for nonadherence in three distinct groups of patients with serious mental illness (SMI). Cohort 1 had 43 patients with bipolar disorder (BD) treated in a community mental health setting, cohort 2 had 43 patients with BD taking an atypical antipsychotic and treated in an academic medical center, and cohort 3 had 30 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who had been homeless in the last year. Standardized attitudinal scales found generally negative attitudes toward medication and limited illness insight. Although the three cohorts differed with regard to severity of symptoms, age of onset, education, baseline adherence, and race, the groups had similar medication attitudes before and after treatment. Despite group differences in demographic and clinical variables, our analyses found more similarities than differences in medication attitudes among these three discrete groups of poorly adherent, symptomatic patients with SMI. The common attitudinal characteristics have implications for delivery of health care services that can enhance treatment adherence in high-risk SMI patients.

AB  - This article provides a review of sexualities scholarship within the social sciences between 1970 and 2015. It takes an innovative approach by focusing on the way in which bisexuality is addressed in this body of literature. The article reveals the marginalisation, under-representation and invisibility of bisexuality within and across the social sciences in relation to both bisexual experience and identity. Reasons for this varied across the different eras, including the heterosexist nature of the literature, the impact of gay and lesbian-focused identity politics, and queer deconstructionism. In addition, patterns of bisexual erasure and invisibility were uneven, with some scholarship taking inclusive approaches or criticising prejudice against bisexuality. The initial findings of the review were enriched by critical commentary from key relevant sociologists and political scientists. The article concludes that future sexualities scholarship could be enhanced by greater consideration of bisexuality.

AB  - This paper explores the role of masculinities in animal harm and conceptions on the Masculinities Offender, primarily motivated by power and masculine behaviors. Within "masculinities crimes," the exercise of power allied to sport or entertainment is significantly linked to organized crime and gambling. Masculinities crimes also include elements of cruelty or animal abuse and perceptions by offenders of their actions having cultural significance, and where toughness, masculinity, and smartness combine with a love of excitement. Examples include badger digging, badger baiting, cock-fighting, and other crimes involving the "sporting" killing or taking of wildlife. This article explores masculinities offender rationalizations and associated masculinity-based negative attitudes towards animals and animal harm. The public policy response to masculinities crimes reflects acceptance of the violent nature of offenders. Yet arguably enforcement and punishment through use of surveillance activities and undercover operations, and reliance on prison as the primary deterrent/sanction risks being counter-productive and reinforcing the very masculinities that underlie offending behavior.

KW  - RESOLUTION
AB  - Radio frequency (RF) measurement technology provides a relative navigation solution that can be of great importance to have significant potential for application to the satellite groups. With the development of the RF relative measurement sensors, it is found that the antenna configuration of the sensors affects the precision of relative position and attitude measurement. This study proposes improvements to the precision of the sensors by the virtue of the optimal antenna configuration. Furthermore, the concept of dilution of precision (DOP) is extended to the RF relative measurement sensors, and a new dilution called IDOP is proposed as a benchmark to determine the precision of relative position and attitude measurement in engineering applications of the space mission. In order to select the optimal antenna configuration in real time in a scene where the intersatellite position and attitude change dynamically, this study presents an optimal antenna configuration selection strategy and models the antenna configuration selection as a combinatorial optimization problem. Furthermore, the genetic algorithm (GA) with two encoding mechanisms is proposed to solve this problem. Finally, numerical results are presented to verify the robustness.

AB  - Monin, Sawyer, and Marquez (2008) demonstrated that a rebel who refused to participate in a racially prejudiced decision task was derogated by actors who had themselves taken part in the task, but exalted by uninvolved observers. These authors argued that this rejection resulted from actors who expected and resented imagined moral reproach from the rebel. Two new studies address alternative explanations for such rejection of moral rebels. Study 1 rules out both (a) self-presentation and (b) a more cognitive alternative wherein anchoring on one's first impression of a task leads to do-gooder derogation. Study 2 breaks down the principled rebellion into its two components, a principled stance and rebellion itself, to show that both seem to play a part in derogation. Individuals imagine that moral others would reject them, which in turn leads to rejecting those deviants.

AB  - People with mental illness (PWMI) are faced with a number of social and health-related challenges especially stigma and discrimination which tend to have negative effects on their lives. This paper presents narrative monologues portraying the experiences and effects of psychiatric stigma and discrimination on PWMI in South Africa. These narratives voice out the concerns of the stigmatizers (specifically family members and significant others of PWMI) and the stigmatized in a poetic fashion. The society is still not very sympathetic to the plights of PWMI and this affects their general health and well-being. Traditional beliefs and prejudice still drive public attitude towards PWMI especially in African settings. These narratives presented in a poetic fashion in this paper highlight some salient issues relating to the experience and effects of stigma and the desires of PWMI to be treated with love and respect and helped to lead healthy normal lives.

AB  - Although intergroup contact is an effective way of reducing prejudice, negative expectancies about interacting with out-group members often create a barrier to intergroup contact. The current study investigated cognitive appraisals by which negative expectancies may arise. Specifically, we examined whether increasing Anglo Australians' appraisals of their knowledge about Muslims would reduce their negative expectancies about an (ostensible) upcoming interaction with a Muslim Australian. Participants (89 Anglo Australians) completed a test that provided positive feedback either on their knowledge about Muslims or on their general knowledge (control). As predicted, Anglo Australians who received positive feedback on their knowledge about Muslims had a lower threat appraisal and expected to feel less anxious during the intergroup interaction compared with those who were in the control condition. This provides support for the precursory role out-group knowledge may have as a resource that is appraised upon the prospect of an intergroup interaction.

AB  - Introduction Pacific Islanders living in Hawai'i with ancestral ties to islands in the western Pacific region of Micronesia are common targets of uninhibited forms of prejudice in multiple sectors, including healthcare. Whether the explicit societal-level attitudes toward this group are reflected in implicit attitudes among healthcare providers is unknown; therefore, we designed a pilot study to investigate this question. Our study measures implicit racial bias toward Pacific Islanders from Micronesia among Obstetrician-Gynecologists (OB-GYNs) in Hawai'i.
   Methods We developed 4 new implicit association tests (IATs) to measure implicit attitudes and associations (i.e., stereotypes) toward Pacific Islanders from Micronesia in 2 conditions: (1) Micronesians vs. Whites and (2) Micronesians vs. Japanese Americans. Participants were practicing OB-GYNs in Hawai'i. The study was conducted online and included survey questions on demographic and physician practice characteristics in addition to IATs. The primary outcome was the mean IAT D score. Associations between IAT D scores and demographic and practice characteristics were also analyzed.
   Results Of the 49 OB-GYNs, 38 (77.6%) were female, mean age was 40 years, 29.5% were Japanese, 22.7% were White, and none were from a Micronesian ethnic group. The mean IAT D score in the Micronesian vs. White condition (N = 29) was 0.181, (SD: 0.465, p < 0.05) for the Attitude IAT and 0.197 (SD: 0.427; p < 0.05) for the Stereotype IAT.
   Conclusion The findings from this pilot suggest a slight degree of implicit bias favoring Whites over Micronesians within this sample of OB-GYNs and warrant a larger investigation into implicit biases toward this unique and understudied Pacific Islander population.

AB  - The UK's elite law firms have recently seen a shift from talking about equality of opportunity alone to the adoption of a diversity discourse as well. This article examines this transition for what it can tell us about the value of diversity strategies as a means for widening access to the corporate legal profession on the basis of social class, focusing on five elite law firms based in the City of London. A number of studies have demonstrated how cultural practices within the legal sector maintain exclusionary mechanisms based on class. There has been less attention to how this is sustained within an amended institutional framework which outwardly 'celebrates' difference. This research suggests that though diversity strategies do little to change organisational cultures, those that recognise both the depth of professional prejudice within the sector and the reality of educational inequality across the UK may prove relatively progressive nonetheless.

AB  - This study investigated the acceptability of daily use of free oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and associated factors among transgender women sex workers in Shenyang, China, following a briefing on PrEP. A total of 183 HIV negative or sero-status unknown participants completed the cross-sectional survey. The prevalence of acceptability of daily use of free oral PrEP was 61.2%. Adjusting for education level and monthly income, variables on negative attitudes toward PrEP (i.e., having concerns about the side-effects of PrEP) [Adjusted odds ratios (AOR): 0.26], perceived subjective norms (i.e., perceiving support from male partners to take PrEP) (AOR: 2.08), and perceived behavioral control (e.g., perceiving complete control over using PrEP) (AOR: 2.10-16.72) were significantly associated with acceptability of daily use of free oral PrEP. In addition, experiencing violence during sex work, perceived risk of contracting HIV from clients and probable anxiety were also significant. Future PrEP promotion campaigns should consider these factors.

AB  - The present study aims (1) to study stereotype contents of a target population, and (2) to test the predictive power of three contesting theoretical models in the communication framework of who -> says what -> in which channel -> to whom -> with what effect (Lasswell, 1948). A purposive sample of (N = 291) Vietnamese high school and college students found that they have positive stereotypes about Americans in general and a mix of positive and negative stereotypes about Black/African-Americans. Of the three theoretical models, the communication model had collectively the strongest predictors, followed by the psychological model, and then the contact model. Theoretical as well as practical implications of the study is discussed.

AB  - This study investigates the question of how to build an inclusive environment for intercultural dialogue. Using the university campus as a context for our research, we conducted a facilitated idea generation workshop in which participants identified a set of dialogic competencies, followed by individual interviews in which we explored participants' perceptions of the relationships among these competencies. Interviews were conducted utilizing a software-assisted, idea-structuring methodology referred to as Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM). Based on our results, we constructed a framework that depicts the overall flow of influence among the set of dialogic competencies identified by the participants. While findings confirm the importance placed in current literature on factors such as listening and empathy, they provide a more sophisticated and nuanced perspective on how to accomplish one of the oft-stated goals of intercultural dialogue, which is to help participants examine their unconscious biases, prejudices, and privileges.

AB  - This article compares the public perceptions of various types of migrants in Japan and examines whether Japanese view them equally. Using an original survey, which presented six types of migrants that Japanese people most commonly face in their daily lives, I show several interesting results. First, respondents express the most negative views toward labor migrants. Second, respondents who have migrant friends tend to have more positive feelings for all types of migrants. In contrast, simple coexistence with migrants fails to enhance public sentiment toward labor migrants, particularly those whose stay is temporary. Overall, my statistical results suggest that Japanese people are not pessimistic about every kind of migrant, and their openness increases as migrants acculturate into Japanese society and interact with Japanese people. These findings provide evidence to influence policy discussions on whether Japan should recruit labor migrants in its current form in order to fight its aging population.

AB  - The HPTN 065 (TLC-Plus) study tested the feasibility and effectiveness of using financial incentives (FIs) to increase linkage to care (L2C) among individuals with newly diagnosed HIV and those out of care in the Bronx, NY and Washington, DC. Qualitative data collection with a subset of participating patients and staff focused on experiences with and attitudes about the FI intervention. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 15 patients and 14 site investigators. Four focus group discussions were conducted with a total of 15 staff members. The use of FIs for L2C was generally viewed favorably. Patients were grateful and benefited financially, but sites had some challenges implementing the program. Challenges included the timing and sensitive introduction of the intervention immediately after an HIV diagnosis, negative attitudes towards paying people for health behaviors, and the existence and strength of existing linkage programs. Future programs should consider optimal timing and presentation of FIs.

AB  - Race relations became the dominant paradigm by the time the official report on the 1919 Chicago riot, The Negro in Chicago, was published. It expressed a new appreciation of the danger to Whites of conflict based on colour. Before 1905 most observers assumed the inferiority of Blacks and saw race conflict as the fault of African Americans. But a new possibility arose when the fate of African Americans was linked to the rising power of Japan, occurring after the defeat of Russia by Japan in 1904-5. Race conflict, in this new model, was a form of conflict between nations. Race relations pioneer Robert E. Park, in his 1913 article, Racial Assimilation in Secondary Groups', noted that under conditions. . . of individual liberty and individual competition, characteristic of modern civilization, depressed racial groups tend to assume the form of nationalities. A nationality, in this narrower sense, may be defined as the racial group which has attained self-consciousness, no matter whether it has at the same time gained political independence or not.' Yuill's paper will explore the thesis that a liberal perspective based on developments in contemporary international relations slowly changed the way race was regarded in the United States. From 1905 onwards, a new liberal paradigm sought to manage race conflict. It was thisrather than labour-based racial antipathies or commitment to racial equalitythat shaped US race relations in the twentieth century.

AB  - When studying change in urban infrastructure landscapes, technical, political, and aesthetical choices are often considered in isolation. Yet, large-scale infrastructures such as urban motorways are the crystallisation of design entanglements. The decisions taken by an engineer-to build an elevated highway instead of a tunnel, to erect soundproof walls, to destroy a church instead of a housing block-are the expression of technical knowledge, cultural prejudices, socio-political frameworks, and value-based opinions reframed as expertise. This paper will be focussing on the 'social imagination' of the designers, by calling for a recontextualisation of design choices within their professional and cultural discourses, practices and imaginaries in order to question these infrastructural artefacts as socially produced. This paper will illustrate the relevance of applying a critical design framework to study infrastructure landscape change by focussing on the Boulevard Peripherique of Paris, and specifically on the emergence of noise from road traffic as nuisance.

AB  - This appraisal highlights the productive engagement between feminism and discursive psychology (DP). It discusses some of the confluence and tensions between DP and feminism. The two share critical perspectives on science and psychology, a concern with prejudice, and have ideas in common about the constructed nature of social categories, such as gender. One difficulty arises from the relativism associated with the post-structural theoretical underpinnings of DP, which can be understood as politically paralyzing. Another problem comes from an endorsement of a conversation analytic mentality, where identity categories such as gender can only be legitimately used in an analysis when participants orient to their relevance. The high-profile debates and literature in DP shows it has made a notable contribution to social psychology and its influence can also be found in other areas. A particular influence of DP highlighted in the present appraisal is on gender and language research.

AB  - This article presents the qualitative findings from a larger mixed methods study of the barriers and costs associated with disability in New Zealand. A social model of disability framework was integrated with an economic cost model using consensual budget standards to (1) identify key barriers disabled people experience in their everyday living and (2) develop consensus about the resources disabled people agree they require to reduce or remove them. Forty-nine people with physical, hearing, vision or intellectual impairment participated in a series of 8 impairment-based focus groups. The analysis identified inaccessible environments, negative attitudes, unreliable transportation and poor access to information as key barriers. However, lack of adequate and appropriate resources (e.g. equipment, modifications, support, transport and time) to address these barriers was the overarching obstacle to participation. The inclusion of time as both a barrier and a valuable resource is arguably the most important contribution of the study.

AB  - Over the past few decades, the worldwide lesbian and gay movements have diversified and increased their rights claims. The achievement of gay rights claims in society is the result of an interplay among various social factors and forces. Media is one of most influential players in building homosexual images and promoting mutual understanding. Chinese homosexuals were not treated as criminals or mental illness patients any-more in 1997 and 2001, respectively, after decriminalization and depathologization. Thus this article aims to explore how homosexuals were portrayed in the official media of China, particularly the People's Daily, to illustrate the changing perception of homosexuals in China's political and social spheres. It argues that representation of homosexuals in the People's Daily changed gradually from a negative perception to a more positive one with less discrimination and prejudice as shown by the article's quantitative and qualitative results.

AB  - Aging with intellectual disability has become an important topic in light of the significant increase in life expectancy of this population. More specifically, the combination of gender, age, and intellectual disability raises unique social issues. The aim of this research was to capture and analyze the aging experience of women with intellectual disability from their own voice and viewpoint within the Israeli experience. A phenomenological qualitative method was used in this study. In-depth interviews were conducted with 19 women with mild-to-moderate intellectual disability. Four key themes arose from the interviews: (a) the importance of work and reluctance to retire, (b) ageism and the fear of getting old, (c) the importance of a significant partner in old age, and (d) today's positive self-perception. A meaningful aging process can be constructed within the context of gender and disability. It was manifested in this study as a disability-neutral experience. However, ageism and negative attitudes toward old age still need to be addressed.

AB  - Drawing on long term ethnographic research in the SE Peruvian Amazon this article asks what kinds and forms of learning do indigenous women value, how are the knowledge and skills they value changing over time and what is the nature of their agency in the face of the discrimination and prejudice that permeate their lives. Harakmbut women's lives have been transformed over the past 40 years in the wake of neoliberal globalisation, rapacious exploitative economic practices and unregulated illegal gold mining. Within this context, three types of learning emerge as important: learning about indigenous cosmology and way of life; experiential learning through engagement with an expanding capitalist society; and learning through training and capacity building for participation, voice and rights-based advocacy. The article argues that all three types of learning give meaning to Harakmbut women's lives, their relationship to their history and their views of the world.

AB  - In our current political moment, discrimination against minority racial and religious groups routinely makes headlines. Though some press coverage of these occurrences acknowledges parallels and links between racial and religious prejudices, these intersections remain undertheorized in legal and historical scholarship. Because scholars typically study race and religion separately, they have overlooked the legal significance of how race and religion coexist in both perpetrators and victims of discrimination. By contrast, this Article demonstrates that the intersection of racial and religious identities has meaningfully influenced legal and political efforts to achieve equality.
   Drawing from extensive archival research, this Article unearths forgotten yet formative connections between racial and religious antidiscrimination efforts, at the local through federal levels, from the 1930s through the 1950s. To examine these links, this account centers on the Domestic Relations Court of the City of New York, an unusually influential and high-profile trial court. In the 1930s, the Domestic Relations Court welcomed the most diverse bench ever assembled in the United States by that time (including women and men; blacks and whites; and Protestants, Catholics, and Jews), a development celebrated as bolstering American democracy and countering Nazi bigotry abroad. Several judges held leadership positions in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Jewish Congress, pathbreaking civil rights organizations with legal arms headquartered in New York City.
   The city's family court served as a testing ground for identity-related legal arguments that later rose to the national level because of its judges' views and the fact that it merged two antidiscrimination focal points: public institutions' treatment of children and the application of fair employment practices. Longstanding policies required the court to match probation officers to juvenile delinquents by race and religion, an approach one prominent commenter argued should be eliminated in order to promote "racial and religious democracy." By the 1940s, a coalition of black and Jewish judges regarded both types of identity matching as unlawful segregation. These judges successfully fought against their white Christian colleagues to end race matching, but their challenge to religion matching proved more difficult, both legally and politically. While the opponents of religion matching perceived the practice to be discriminatory and a violation of the separation of church and state, its supporters saw it as a lawful and beneficial protection for religious identity.
   Foreshadowing, connecting, and continuing through canonical Supreme Court Establishment Clause and civil rights cases-such as McCollum v. Board of Education and Brown v. Board of Education-the family court judges and their allies both anticipated and influenced doctrine and norms that remain with us today. This history complicates and raises important questions about ongoing issues ranging from the significance of judges' racial and religious backgrounds to the scope of religious groups' involvement in child welfare services and penal contexts. This Article also calls for additional studies that free racial civil rights and First Amendment religion scholarship from their current silos in order to better understand the concurrent development of these crucial and contested areas of law.

TI  - PREJUDICIAL OR PROBATIVE: DETERMINING THE ADMISSIBILITY OF DECISIONS IN INTER PARTES REVIEW PROCEEDINGS
T2  - BOSTON UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - The recent implementation of inter partes review proceedings has created an additional forum for parties to challenge the validity of issued patents. While this process was intended to provide an efficient way to invalidate bad patents, it has the potential to complicate patent infringement litigation. As more actions are brought using the inter partes review process, courts will need to decide how to treat decisions from inter partes review proceedings in subsequent infringement litigation. Specifically, courts will need to determine whether decisions from inter partes review proceedings should be admitted into evidence, given the fact that evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice. This Note will analyze whether courts should admit decisions in inter partes review proceedings into evidence in infringement litigation, while taking into account the different standards used by the federal courts and the patent office when determining patent validity.

AB  - Simple Summary It has been shown that people within the horse industry have preconceived ideas about horse behaviour, temperament and rideability, based solely on the sex of the horse. Such ideas can have welfare implications, if personnel allow bias to affect their interactions with particular horses. Such welfare implications include employment of harsher training methods, and increased horse wastage. The current study explored data on riders' and trainers' reports of ridden horse behaviour. Reported sex-related behavioural differences were evaluated based on 1233 responses from the pilot study of the Equine Behaviour and Research Questionnaire (E-BARQ) survey. Results from the study suggest there are some sex-related differences in behaviour between male and female horses; geldings are more likely to chew on rugs and lead ropes when tied, and mares are more likely to move away when being caught in paddock. However, there was no evidence of sex-related differences associated with behaviour when ridden which may warrant further investigation. Findings from this study may be used to educate riders and trainers about the need to regard behaviour and motivation in ridden horses as sex-neutral.
   Abstract Horse trainers and riders may have preconceived ideas of horse temperament based solely on the sex of the horse. A study (n = 1233) of horse enthusiasts (75% of whom had more than 8 years of riding experience) revealed that riders prefer geldings over mares and stallions. While these data may reflect different sex preferences in horses used for sport, they may also reduce the chances of some horses reaching their performance potential. Further, an unfounded sex prejudice is likely to contribute to unconscious bias when perceiving unwanted behaviours, simplistically attributing them to demographic characteristics rather than more complex legacies of training and prior learning. The current study analysed reported sex-related behavioural differences in ridden and non-ridden horses using data from responses to the pilot study of the Equine Behaviour Assessment and Research Questionnaire (E-BARQ) survey. Respondents (n = 1233) reported on the behaviour of their horse using a 151-item questionnaire. Data were searched for responses relating to mares and geldings, and 110 traits with the greatest percentage difference scores between mares and geldings were selected were tested for univariate significance at p < 0.2. Multivariable modelling of the effect of sex (mare or gelding) on remaining traits was assessed by ordinal logistic regression, using a cumulative proportional log odds model. Results revealed mares were significantly more likely to move away when being caught compared to geldings (p = 0.003). Geldings were significantly more likely to chew on lead ropes when tied (p = 0.003) and to chew on rugs (p = 0.024). However, despite sex-related differences in these non-ridden behaviours, there was no evidence of any significant sex-related differences in the behaviours of the horses when ridden. This finding suggests that ridden horse behaviour is not sexually dimorphic or that particular horse sports variously favour one sex over another.

AB  - Background: Stigmatizing attitudes against individuals diagnosed with mental illness could increase the severity of psychiatric symptoms, lead to delay in getting medical support, and decrease adherence to treatments. Identifying the groups most associated with stigmatization could orientate actions to reduce this prejudice and improve patients' prognosis. Objective: To investigate variables associated with stigmatization toward psychiatric disorders in Brazil.
   Methods: A Web-based survey was sent out to assess the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents and their perception of mental illness. Included participants were composed of Brazilians aged 18 years or over, with access to the internet and social networks. The questionnaire was available from June to August 2018 on Facebook.
   Results: A total of 2414 respondents were included. The majority were female, white, aged between 18 and 29 years, and had more than 10 years of study. The variables associated with stigma were male sex, fewer years of education, lower household income, the presence of a psychiatric disorder in a first-degree relative, and internalized stigma.
   Conclusions: The present study identified variables associated with the stigma against psychiatric disorders. Future studies should propose intervention strategies, such as to foster education about mental illness and to promote the importance of seeking help from a mental health professional, to address this problem in Brazil.

AB  - This article examines refugee-related violence by exploring the effect of extensive refugee rights on the risk of civil conflict and violent attacks against refugees by local population. The provision of fundamental rights, such as the freedom of movement, can reduce refugee groups' grievances, the risk of radicalization, and the ability of militant organizations to recruit refugees, thereby decreasing the risk of civil conflict. Regarding the behavior of local population toward refugees, two opposing effects of refugee rights may be at play. Extensive refugee policies may trigger civilian backlash by aggravating the perception of threat posed by refugees and increase the risk of civilian attacks against refugees. On the other hand, allowing refugees to integrate into society may provide economic benefits for locals and facilitate socialization between groups, reducing the motivation of citizens to target refugees. Using an original global dataset on refugee rights, I find that liberal refugee policies are associated with a reduction in the risk of civil conflict as well as anti-refugee violence in host states. This suggests that host governments and international organizations should give greater priority to guaranteeing refugee rights and promoting income-generating activities among uprooted populations to minimize potential security risks associated with refugees.

AB  - Introduction The possible presence of negative attitudes towards mathematics in preservice primary education teachers is a matter of concern if we consider that such attitudes will affect their university education and will have an impact on their future teaching practice.
   Method. Anxiety and self-confidence towards mathematics, as dimensions of attitude, are analyzed using a descriptive and correlational method. The study sample contained 488 preservice teachers enrolled in the first year of the Primary Education Degree at the University of Granada.
   Results. The preservice teachers had a mean anxiety level of 2.76 and self-confidence level of 3.32, out of a possible 5. In addition, the data reflect a high, significant, negative correlation between these two attitudinal dimensions.
   Discussion and conclusions. The levels of anxiety and self-confidence obtained are inadequate for proper formation in mathematics. We underscore a need to implement training actions designed to improve confidence and reduce anxiety towards mathematics in this population.

AB  - This study explores how the financial regulator through interaction with the long-term insurance industry can give effect to greater market inclusion and financial stability. It follows a qualitative approach and we interview both industry representatives and the regulator. The results show that there is a possible tension between the regulatory objectives of market stability and financial inclusion and that an unbalanced focus on either objective could adversely affect the other. It suggests that the best way to ensure this balance is for industry, the regulator and government to coframe issues, rather than being obliged to rely on the regulator to draft regulation in isolation. The entry level (base of the pyramid) insurance market may require a different paradigm to 'usual' insurance constructs and this requires a more innovative approach from all stakeholders. The findings highlight strategic measures that may assist regulators in giving effect to greater market inclusion without prejudicing the stability of the market.

AB  - Cancer survivors treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplant rely on their social network for successful recovery. However, some survivors have negative attitudes about using social resources (negative social network orientation) that are critical for their recovery.
   We examined the association between survivors' social network orientation and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and whether it was mediated by social resources (network size, perceived support, and negative and positive support-related social exchanges).
   In a longitudinal study, 255 survivors completed validated measures of social network orientation, HRQoL, and social resources. Hypotheses were tested using path analysis.
   More negative social network orientation predicted worse HRQoL (p < .001). This association was partially mediated by lower perceived support and more negative social exchanges.
   Survivors with negative social network orientation may have poorer HRQoL in part due to deficits in several key social resources. Findings highlight a subgroup at risk for poor transplant outcomes and can guide intervention development.

AB  - Aims: To examine sociodemographic factors associated with attitudes regarding dementia.
   Method: A cross-sectional, convenience sample of 616 adults aged 40-65 years completed an online survey examining sociodemographic factors and dementia attitudes. The associations between sociodemographic variables and dementia attitudes were examined using general linear modelling.
   Results: Four attitudinal factors were identified. Three were associated with negative attitudes (Personal Avoidance, Fear of Labelling and Fear of Discrimination) and one with more positive attitudes (Person Centredness). Demographic factors (e. g. age, sex, education) were significantly associated with some attitudinal factors. For example, men (P = 0.001) and individuals with lower education levels (P = 0.03) had higher scores on the Personal Avoidance factor.
   Conclusions: This study is the first to examine correlates of attitudes towards dementia in an Australian sample. Future research could improve understanding of distinct factors associated with dementia and lead to strategies to reduce stigmatised views of people with dementia in the community.

AB  - Released in the aftermath of the 1958 Notting Hill riots, Flame in the Streets [Baker, Roy. 1961. UK: The Rank Organisation.] remains a distinctive British film of the 1960s in its examination of the racial prejudices that defined African-Caribbean's antagonous relations with the wider British Society. In Baker's attempt to expose the passive racisms of Jacko Palmer by paralleling his family conflict between his wife and daughter with his industrial conflicts as a trade union representative defending the rights of a black co-worker despite the disquiet that his ethnicity has generated from the white workers, the film presents ethnic minority characters in a form that links the personal with the political, interweaving themes of both class and race. Through a historicization and contextualization, this article sets out to examine the ways in which twentieth century post-war immigration and subsequent race struggles influenced the socio-political character of Flame in The Streets.

AB  - The aim of this research is to reveal the effects of brochures and virtual reality, which are among the promotional tools in destination marketing, on the purchasing intention and compare the results of these two promotional tools. The theoretical background of the research was established within the framework of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). 120 potential tourists living in Eskisehir who intend to go on holiday, have been reached during the implementation phase of the research. Two questionnaires, i.e. the brochure involvement and virtual reality involvement questionnaires, were obtained from the participants. The data were analyzed through Smart PLS v.3.2.7. Research findings demonstrate that virtual reality is more successful in the perceived service quality and product attitude development. However, the effect of the brochure on the development of advertising attitudes is higher. Some suggestions are presented in line with the results of the research.

AB  - Ambivalent sexism theory states that prejudice toward women comprises two interrelated ideologies. Endorsement of hostile sexismaggressive and competitive attitudes toward women-is linked with endorsement of benevolent sexism-paternalistic and patronizing attitudes toward women. We conduct the first systematic tests of how endorsement of sexism differs across age and across time, using six waves of a nationally representative panel sample of New Zealand adults (N = 10,398). Results indicated U-shaped trajectories for men's endorsement of hostile sexism, women's hostile sexism, and women's benevolent sexism across the life span. However, over time, endorsement of these sexist attitudes tended to decrease for most ages. In contrast, men's benevolent sexism followed a positive linear trajectory across age and tended not to change over time. These results provide novel evidence of how ambivalent sexism differs across age and highlight that benevolent sexism is particularly tenacious.

AB  - The present study explored whether variables previously shown to relate to pro-social attitudes and behaviours could be applied to the intention to engage in bystander anti-racism on behalf of Indigenous Australians. 149 non-Indigenous participants were asked to indicate how likely they were to engage in bystander anti-racism in response to an 'everyday' racial discrimination scenario presented within an online survey. Being female, older, and politically left leaning correlated with bystander anti-racism intentions, as did higher levels of collective guilt, anger, empathic concern and lower levels of prejudice. Regression analysis revealed that being older and having higher levels of empathic concern predicted the intention to engage in bystander anti-racism. While it may seem rational that the ability to feel for the plight of another (empathic concern) is necessary for bystander anti-racism to ensue, older individuals may feel more competent in their ability to effectively intervene.

AB  - Nonlinguistic information such as facial expression, gesture, and tone of voice plays an essential role in communication between humans. However, most human-machine interfaces are not designed to utilize nonlinguistic information. In order to develop a natural human-machine interface, this paper presents a system for discriminating positive-negative attitudes from nonlinguistic information. Our system utilizes prosody information and natural facial expression observed in a dialogue. For example, the questioner asks a subject to do something, for example, "Won't you go shopping with me?" And then, the subject shows an ambiguous response, for example, "Umm, shopping..." The proposed system analyzes prosody information and facial expression obtained from the subject. The system combines optical flows and prosody information to increase the accuracy in the discrimination. Evaluation experiments using 678 videos obtained from 23 subjects have shown that our system achieved 81.4% accuracy, which is 4.8% higher in the case when only optical flows were used as training data and 13.8% higher in the case when only prosody information was used as training data.

AB  - Aiming at multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems, especially the attribute values of 2-tuple linguistic numbers and the interrelationships between each attribute needing to be considered, this paper proposes a new method of analysis. Firstly, we developed a few new aggregation operators, like the 2-tuple linguistic dependent weighted Maclaurin symmetric mean (2TLDWMSM) operator, the 2-tuple linguistic dependent weighted generalized Maclaurin symmetric mean (2TLDWGMSM) operator, and the 2-tuple linguistic dependent weighted geometric Maclaurin symmetric mean (2TLDWGeoMSM) operator. In the above operators, Maclaurin symmetric mean (MSM) operators can take the relationships between each attribute into account and dependent operators can mitigate the unfair parameters' impact on the overall outcome, in which those incorrect'' and prejudiced'' parameters are distributed with low weights. Next, a method used by the 2TLDWMSM, 2TLDWGMSM, and 2TLDWGeoMSM operators for MAGDM is introduced. Finally, there is an explanative example to confirm the proposed approach and explain its availability and usefulness.

AB  - We hypothesized that individuals may differ in the dispositional tendency to have positive vs. negative attitudes, a trait termed the dispositional attitude. Across 4 studies, we developed a 16-item Dispositional Attitude Measure (DAM) and investigated its internal consistency, test-retest reliability, factor structure, convergent validity, discriminant validity, and predictive validity. DAM scores were (a) positively correlated with positive affect traits, curiosity-related traits, and individual preexisting attitudes; (b) negatively correlated with negative affect traits; and (c) uncorrelated with theoretically unrelated traits. Dispositional attitudes also significantly predicted the valence of novel attitudes while controlling for theoretically relevant traits (such as the Big 5 and optimism). The dispositional attitude construct represents a new perspective in which attitudes are not simply a function of the properties of the stimuli under consideration, but are also a function of the properties of the evaluator. We discuss the intriguing implications of dispositional attitudes for many areas of research, including attitude formation, persuasion, and behavior prediction.

AB  - Although Christianity was a new and small religion in Korea at the time, in 1945-48 Christian politicians and church leaders were prominent in establishing an independent South Korea as the Cold War began. Kang In-cheol and others argue that this was because Christians were prejudiced against communists and acted out of self-interest, and they hold them complicit in the subsequent Korean War. We shall argue that many Christian leaders were willing to work with communists to preserve the unity of the nation but their experience convinced them that communist aims were incompatible with religious freedom and with their own vision of a democratic nation founded on Christian principles. Our argument contributes not only to an understanding of Korean nationalism, but also to the broader literature on the roles of Christianity in democratisation. It reveals the significant influence of Christian actors at this critical juncture in Korean and world history, the impact of which is still being felt today.

AB  - The group decision method is an important branch in the decision problems. A critical issue in group decision methods is how to determine the weights of the group members. To reduce the possible prejudice due to the social influences, we propose a novel group decision method under social influences based on information entropy. Firstly, the interaction degrees between the group members under social influences are determined. Secondly, the entropy of each expert from the decision group is computed. Then, according to the entropy, the weights of the experts can be determined. Finally, based on the evaluation matrix, the weighted values of the alternatives can be obtained and the alternatives are ranked. The decision steps are provided in detail and the practicality of the proposed method is illustrated through an example. The proposed decision method considers interactions between the group members, so that the possible biases due to the social influences can be reduced to some extent.

AB  - Research indicates that the memory of collective trauma influences attitudes towards contemporary social and political issues. We suggest that the specific attributions for trauma that members of victim and perpetrator groups make provide a more nuanced understanding of this relationship. Thus, we constructed and validated a measure of attributions for the Holocaust. Then, we ran a preregistered study on representative samples in Germany (N = 504) and Israel (N = 469) to examine whether attributing the Holocaust to essentialist or contextual causes influences attitudes towards the immigration crisis and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Results indicated that, among Germans, attributing the Holocaust to German character was associated with positive attitudes to immigration via collective guilt. Among Israelis, attributions to German character were associated with negative attitudes to non-Jewish immigration, a hawkish stance in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and pro-Israel attitudes via a sense of perpetual victimization. Results reveal how attributions about past trauma affect contemporary social and political attitudes among victims and perpetrators.

KW  - INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE
AB  - Acupuncture is a traditional treatment method that has been extensively used for centuries in a number of Asian countries for pain control as well as for treatment of various diseases. Acupuncture has been known to be a safe procedure with little side effects, but at times serious complications such as infection, pneumothorax, central or peripheral nerve injury and cardiac injury may occur. Cases of cerebral hemorrhage by acupuncture are rare with few being reported. A 32-year-old woman presented with a headache that occurred after acupuncture at posterior neck. We diagnosed her symptoms initially as peripheral nerve irritation by acupuncture and administered analgesic only. However, the final diagnosis was turned up to be intraventricular hemorrhage. The authors emphasize that acupuncturists and emergency physicians should know that acupuncture can lead to intracranial hemorrhage as a serious complication and this should be considered in all causes of headache for diagnosis without prejudice.

AB  - Drawing on a new biographical database of the current provincial leaders, this article aims to test the hypothesis whether women, non-Han minorities, intellectuals, and non-Communist members are discriminated against in the Chinese political sphere. Our findings indicate that women, despite being underrepresented in leadership positions, do not suffer from discrimination in obtaining chief positions, after controlling for their capability related variables. Non-Communist members are still facing the glass ceiling, preventing their rise to the top of China's power structure, while at the same time being underrepresented in leadership positions. However, there is no evidence showing that intellectuals (i.e., doctoral degree holders) and non-Han minorities are suffering from underrepresentation, inequality, and discrimination. Further analysis indicates that traditional prejudice, discriminatory rule manipulation, and no well-defined and legally binding quotas are fundamental causes contributing to women's underrepresentation in power structure and non-Communist members' political discrimination.

AB  - The importance of Foreign Direct Investment in our international economic system cannot be overstated. Nevertheless, due to a perceived absence of arbitrator autonomy and a growing quantity of conflicting and contradictory investment resolutions, the current investment arbitral system's legitimacy is presently getting questioned, resulting in a disassembled organization of International Investment Law. Hence, the current investment system's risk increases investor protection or state liability's unpredictability, reducing Foreign Direct Investment' flows. Furthermore, some states have refused to participate in investor-state arbitration altogether due to the significant arbitration decisions against some. This article seeks to examine the legal analysis and the possibility of establishing a Permanent International Investment Court under International Investment Law. This Permanent International Investment Court will also improve the global investment system's consistency, dispel the impression that investment arbitrators are prejudiced against investors, and generally enhance Investor-State Dispute Settlement and International Investment Law' legitimacy. Permanent International Investment Court is needed to advance International Investment Law.

AB  - Sexual minority college students report experiencing interpersonal heterosexism, ranging from subtle insults to blatant physical violence. Such negative experiences can complicate developmental tasks common to adolescence and emerging adulthood. Studies examining the nature of heterosexism on college campuses have focused on blatant manifestations, yet subtle forms are more prevalent. Guided by ecological theory, we investigate the microsystem (e.g., perceived social support from friends, ambient heterosexism on campus), mesosystem (e.g., interaction between social support and ambient heterosexism), and macrosystem level (e.g., knowledge of gay-straight alliances on campus) covariates of interpersonal microaggressions, avoidance behaviors, verbal threats, and physical threats. Participants consisted of 530 self-identified LGBQ college students from 37 states. Regression results suggest that at the microsystem level, ambient heterosexism was positively associated with interpersonal microaggressions, avoidance behaviors, and verbal threats. At the mesosystem level, perceptions of LGBQ student support within one's institution moderated the effects of ambient heterosexism on three types of interpersonal heterosexism. At the macrosystem level, students who reported knowing that their campus had a sexual-orientation inclusive anti-discrimination policy reported encountering fewer verbal threats. Directions for future research and implications for campus programming are discussed.

AB  - In recent years a substantial literature has emerged concerning bias, discrimination, and fairness in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Connecting this work to existing legal non-discrimination frameworks is essential to create tools and methods that are practically useful across divergent legal regimes. While much work has been undertaken from an American legal perspective, comparatively little has mapped the effects and requirements of EU law. This Article addresses this critical gap between legal, technical, and organisational notions of algorithmic fairness. Through analysis of EU non-discrimination law and jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and national courts, we identify a critical incompatibility between European notions of discrimination and existing work on algorithmic and automated fairness. A clear gap exists between statistical measures of fairness as embedded in myriad fairness toolkits and governance mechanisms and the context-sensitive, often intuitive and ambiguous discrimination metrics and evidential requirements used by the ECJ; we refer to this approach as "contextual equality." This Article makes three contributions. First, we review the evidential requirements to bring a claim under EU non-discrimination law. Due to the disparate nature of algorithmic and human discrimination, the EU's current requirements are too contextual, reliant on intuition, and open to judicial interpretation to be automated. Many of the concepts fundamental to bringing a claim, such as the composition of the disadvantaged and advantaged group, the severity and type of harm suffered, and requirements for the relevance and admissibility of evidence, require normative or political choices to be made by the judiciary on a caseby-case basis. We show that automating fairness or non-discrimination in Europe may be impossible because the law, by design, does not provide a static or homogenous framework suited to testing for discrimination in AI systems. Second, we show how the legal protection offered by non-discrimination law is challenged when AI, not humans, discriminate. Humans discriminate due to negative attitudes (e.g. stereotypes, prejudice) and unintentional biases (e.g. organisational practices or internalised stereotypes) which can act as a signal to victims that discrimination has occurred. Equivalent signalling mechanisms and agency do not exist in algorithmic systems. Compared to traditional forms of discrimination, automated discrimination is more abstract and unintuitive, subtle, intangible, and difficult to detect. The increasing use of algorithms disrupts traditional legal remedies and procedures for detection, investigation, prevention, and correction of discrimination which have predominantly relied upon intuition. Consistent assessment procedures that define a common standard for statistical evidence to detect and assess prima facie automated discrimination are urgently needed to support judges, regulators, system controllers and developers, and claimants. Finally, we examine how existing work on fairness in machine learning lines up with procedures for assessing cases under EU non-discrimination law. A 'gold standard' for assessment of prima facie discrimination has been advanced by the European Court of Justice but not yet translated into standard assessment procedures for automated discrimination. We propose 'conditional demographic disparity' (CDD) as a standard baseline statistical measurement that aligns with the Court's 'gold standard'.
   Establishing a standard set of statistical evidence for automated discrimination cases can help ensure consistent procedures for assessment, but not judicial interpretation, of cases involving AI and automated systems. Through this proposal for procedural regularity in the identification and assessment of automated discrimination, we clarify how to build considerations of fairness into automated systems as far as possible while still respecting and enabling the contextual approach to judicial interpretation practiced under EU non-discrimination law.

AB  - Objectives This study aimed to explore and identify facilitators and barriers to help-seeking behaviours among adolescents in Oman, by exploring the relationship between knowledge, attitude, and behaviour towards mental health help-seeking. Methods A cross-sectional descriptive study was used and 424 adolescents were recruited to participate in the study. Participants were asked to complete five self-reported questionnaires, including two open-ended questions about the main motivations and barriers to seeking professional help for mental problems. Results It was found that those with positive help-seeking attitudes towards mental health were more knowledgeable about mental health, had more positive attitudes towards mental illness, and had higher intention to help seeking. On the contrary, those with higher help-seeker stereotypes had more negative attitudes towards mental illness. Having an adequate support system, being positive and knowledgeable about mental illness, and the reputation of mental health are the main factors facilitating seeking professional help. However, fear, lack of family support, and the time-consuming procedures were the main barriers emerging from the open-ended questions. Conclusions This study contributes by identifying facilitating factors as well as barriers in an Arabic context (Oman) to fill the exiting knowledge gap; both need to be considered when planning interventions targeting the younger individuals in this society.

AB  - This thought experiment uses agent-based modeling (computational simulation) to demonstrate how colorism might operate within a local policing context. Colorism is the allocation of privilege and disadvantage based on skin color, with a prejudice for lighter skin. Colorism might help to explain some of the racial disparities in the US' criminal justice system. I use simulated scenarios to explore the plausibility of this notion in the form of two questions: (1) How might colorism function within an organization, and (2) What might occur when managers apply the typical dilemmatic responses to detected colorism? The simulated world consists of three citizen-groups (lights, mediums, and darks), five policy responses to detected colorism, and two policing behaviors (fair and biased). Using NetLogo, one hundred simulations were conducted for each policy response and analyzed using one-way ANOVA and pairwise comparison of means. When the tenets of colorism were applied to a simulated organizational setting, only some of the tenets held true. For instance, those in the middle of the skin color spectrum experienced higher rates of incarceration when aggressive steps were taken to counter colorism, which ran counter to the expectations of the thought experiment. The study identified an opportunity to expand the description of colorism to help describe the plight of those in the middle of the skin color spectrum. The major contributions from this work include a conceptual model that describes the relationship between the distinct levels of colorism, and it progresses the notion of interactive colorism. The study also explored conditional statements that can be converted into hypotheses for future experiments.

AB  - The aim of the study is to analyze the effect of smokers' guilt on regret and the effect of regret on attitudes and repurchase intention towards tobacco smoking. In addition, it is aimed to determine whether attitudes have a mediating effect on the relationship between regret and repurchase intention towards smoking. Face-to-face survey is conducted to collect data with 429 tobacco smokers in Izmir-Turkey by judgment-sampling method. The findings showed that the post-purchase guilt felt by consumers in terms of health, financial and moral guilt resulted in a feeling of regret. Regret was also found to affect repurchase intention due to the mediating effect of attitudes towards smoking. Another finding also displays that, despite the sample of consumers' represent negative attitudes, they could still exhibit repurchase behavior towards tobacco smoking. The contribution of this study is to investigate guilt and regret simultaneously, to reveal their effects on attitudes and, repurchasing intention towards smoking within the context of social marketing.

AB  - Since the start of the Reform Era in 1978, vocational education and training (VET) in China has been seen as inferior to academic routes and positioned at the bottom of the educational hierarchy. VET students are stereotyped as being 'stupid and lazy' and suffer considerable prejudice in Chinese society. Drawing on Foucault's disciplinary power and Ball's idea of performativity, this paper analyses how academically focused, exam-driven societal attitudes, as a form of meritocratic discourse, impact on these students and on how they perceive their stereotyped position within the Reform Era educational system. The findings reveal that these students have internalised the ideology of meritocracy, coming to see themselves as inferior and inadequate compared to their academic counterparts. Turning 'the gaze' upon themselves, they examine whether they 'add up' and assume responsibility for their own 'failures'. VET students are trained to be the new kind of youthful subject required to sustain the Reform Era China's engagement with neoliberal governance.

AB  - Although replication is a central tenet of science, direct replications are rare in psychology. This research tested variation in the replicability of 13 classic and contemporary effects across 36 independent samples totaling 6,344 participants. In the aggregate, 10 effects replicated consistently. One effect - imagined contact reducing prejudice - showed weak support for replicability. And two effects - flag priming influencing conservatism and currency priming influencing system justification - did not replicate. We compared whether the conditions such as lab versus online or US versus international sample predicted effect magnitudes. By and large they did not. The results of this small sample of effects suggest that replicability is more dependent on the effect itself than on the sample and setting used to investigate the effect.

AB  - This article conducts the first contextual analysis of ethnic-based discrimination in an Australian rental housing market: metropolitan Sydney. Logistic regression is employed to investigate how the likelihood of five behaviors by rental agents that may favor Anglo home seekers varies according to characteristics of the agent, home seeker, dwelling, and neighborhood. We find that several forms of discrimination favoring Anglos are consistently more likely in neighborhoods characterized by lower crime rates and shares of renter households, regardless of the ethnicity of the agent. Other patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that, in general in the Sydney rental market, agents regardless of ethnicity are motivated to discriminate by statistical discrimination. Our result that profit, not prejudice, drives discrimination implies that it will prove resilient to unfettered housing market forces and changes in societal ethnic tolerance, but instead, must be addressed through enhanced civil rights enforcement strategies.

AB  - This study examined the psychometric properties and factor structure of the Spanish version of the Homophobic Content Agent Target (HCAT) scale in a sample of 1848 high school students. Participants completed an online survey including measures of homophobic bullying, depression, and anxiety. The factor structure showed adequate fit indices in Spanish adolescents similar to the original scale. An exploratory factor analysis showed a simple factor solution of two related factors strongly correlated describing the extent to which students use homophobic language (agent) and the extent to which students are called homophobic epithets (target) due to sexual orientation. The Spanish HCAT scale showed high Cronbach's alpha coefficient at the subscale score levels, as well as good convergent validity. This study contributes a Spanish-language validated measure of homophobic victimization to be used among adolescents. Implications for understanding homophobic bullying in adolescents are discussed.

AB  - Ever since Twombly and Iqbal introduced the doctrine of plausibility pleading, a cottage industry of legal scholars (including myself) has undertaken to detect the effects of Twombly and Iqbal on litigants and case outcomes. Results so far have been equivocal, and it has been hard to make sense of the disparate methodologies and findings. In this article, I develop a comprehensive yet nontechnical framework for empirically testing the effects of Twombly and Iqbal on lower courts and litigants, taking into account a wide range of confounding factors and the numerous ways in which Twombly and Iqbal may have indirectly affected litigant behavior. Using this framework, I test for effects of Twombly and Iqbal on district court and litigant behavior using two datasetsone of administrative data covering over 700,000 cases, and one of detailed, hand- and machine-coded docket and complaint data covering a representative sample of nearly 2,000 cases. I also review existing findings. I find only limited evidence that Twombly and Iqbal, the two most important pleading cases in 50 years, have had a major effect on the behavior of lawyers and judges across all cases. For represented plaintiffs, rates of dismissal with prejudice have held steady, motions to dismiss remain uncommon, and settlement and filing patterns have not changed appreciably in the wake of Twombly and Iqbal. There is, however, some evidence of effectspotentially major effectson pro se plaintiffs. Further, while case outcomes for represented plaintiffs have been largely unaffected by Twombly and Iqbal, there is evidence that lawyers changed their pleading and motion practice in the wake of those cases.

AB  - How do counterterrorism policies in the United States reproduce anti-Black racism? Research on U.S. domestic counterterrorism post-9/11 has largely focused on the experiences of Muslim Americans while marginalising both overlapping and separate effects of counterterrorism policy on non-Muslim people of colour, particularly non-Muslim Black communities. I argue that domestic counterterrorism policy, as an act of determining what kinds of political contention the state finds non-threatening, has roots in the historical treatment of Black resistance and continues to derive power and legitimacy from oppressing Black communities. Using the case of the Black Liberation Army and its members, I show that federal counterterrorism institutions were shaped by opposition to Black liberation, alongside more well-studied threads of xenophobia and Islamophobia. This article thus extends understandings of discrimination and prejudice within the U.S. counterterrorism apparatus and advocates for greater attention to anti-Blackness not only in policing but in security institutions more broadly.

AB  - In an online Qualtrics panel survey experiment (N = 1620), we found that scientists posting self-portraits ("selfies") to Instagram from the science lab/field were perceived as significantly warmer and more trustworthy, and no less competent, than scientists posting photos of only their work. Participants who viewed scientist selfies, especially posts containing the face of a female scientist, perceived scientists as significantly warmer than did participants who saw science-only images or control images. Participants who viewed selfies also perceived less symbolic threat from scientists. Most encouragingly, participants viewing selfies, either of male or female scientists, did not perceive scientists as any less competent than did participants viewing science-only or control images. Subjects who viewed female scientist selfies also perceived science as less exclusively male. Our findings suggest that self-portraiture by STEM professionals on social media can mitigate negative attitudes toward scientists.

AB  - Objective This study examined the potential acceptability of wearable devices (e.g., smart headbands, wristbands, and watches) aimed at treating mental health disorders, relative to conventional approaches.
   Methods A questionnaire assessed perceptions of wearable and nonwearable treatments, along with demographic and psychological information. Respondents (N = 427) were adults from a community sample (M-age = 44.6, SDage = 15.3) which included current (30.2%) and former (53.9%) mental health help-seekers.
   Results Perceived effectiveness of wearables was a strong predictor of interest in using them as adjuncts to talk therapies, or as an alternative to self-help options (e.g., smartphone applications). Devices were more appealing to those with negative evaluations of psychological therapy and less experience in help-seeking.
   Conclusions Interest in using wearable devices was strong, particularly when devices were seen as effective. Clients with negative attitudes to conventional therapies may be more responsive to using wearable devices as a less directive treatment approach.

AB  - The objective of this study was to identify vulnerability to tuberculosis (TB) related to knowledge about the disease among 76 nursing students and professionals. A quantitative descriptive study was conducted using a closed questionnaire for the collection of data regarding transmission, preventive and biosafety measures, diagnosis, and prejudice regarding the disease. The SAS software version 9.1.3 was used for data analysis, with the level of significance set at 5% (p < 0.05). Nursing students and professionals showed a vulnerability to TB related to knowledge about transmission, preventive and biosafety measures, and diagnosis of the disease. With respect to transmission, vulnerability was higher among nursing professionals. The results indicate the need for investment by healthcare institutions surrounding this topic in view of the important role of nursing in the establishment of strategies for prevention and control of the disease.

AB  - Introduction: This study aims to examine the challenges faced by migrant Arab Muslim women in accessing maternity services and to suggest ways to improve the childbirth experience for them. Methodology: An interpretive ontological-phenomenological perspective guided by the philosophical tenets of Heidegger was used to examine the childbirth experiences of Arab Muslim women. Results: The sample size was 24 in-depth semistructured audiotaped interviews with eight women in the United Kingdom. The "Vulnerable Woman" was the main theme of our findings, which was discussed in five subthemes: language exclusion, discrimination and prejudice, bureaucracy and "stiff upper lip," conflicting ideology, and the conventional as strange. Conclusions: Maternity care should be culturally competent and emphasize the importance of recognizing differences as well as creating trusting relationships. At the same time, midwives should be aware of the dangers of labeling women because of their cultural and religious beliefs.

AB  - Stigma has negatively influenced the lives of people living with HIV since the beginning of the epidemic. It affects every facet of their lives and can cause mental health problems, loss of human rights, and barriers to care. Studies in developing countries have shown a high prevalence of HIV stigma among health care workers. Few studies have been conducted in the United States. We used a validated instrument to survey 330 health care workers in Washington, DC, a high HIV prevalence area. The goal was to obtain data to assess the severity of the problem. We found that stigmatizing beliefs and attitudes were prevalent as reflected in responses from 66% of the participants. Of clinicians surveyed, 31% reported using double gloves. Participants with stigma training had lower stigma levels, whereas older individuals and support staff were more stigmatizing. Negative attitudes affect access to care and have major public health implications.

AB  - Many women experience changes in sexual health as they age, and discussing these changes with health care providers is an essential component of optimal health management. The purpose of this study was to understand aging women's perspectives about communicating with providers about sexual health. We used the integrative model of behavioral prediction as a theoretical lens to explore women's attitudes, perceived norms, and perceived self-efficacy that promote or inhibit the likelihood of communicating about sexual health. In this theory-based qualitative study, we interviewed 28 community-dwelling older women in the Midwestern United States. Through thematic analysis, we identified both positive and negative attitudes about communicating with providers. Women seemed most inclined to discuss sexual health if they perceived that important patient-provider conditions, such as trust and rapport, were in place. Despite situational obstacles and perceived norms, these women held strong beliefs about their abilities to discuss sexual health topics with providers.

AB  - Purpose Given the training and experience of lawyers, we assumed that a study of lawyers' willingness to disclose disability in the workplace would provide an example of the actions of a group knowledgeable about disability law. The current study accounts for the effect of visibility of disability, onset and type of disability, and whether the lawyer has made an accommodation request. We also investigate the role of other individual characteristics, such as sexual orientation, gender identity, race/ethnicity, age, and job-related characteristics, in willingness to disclose. Methods We use data from the first phase of a longitudinal national survey of lawyers in the USA to estimate the odds of disclosing disability to co-workers, management, and clients using proportional odds models. Results Lawyers with less visible disabilities, those with mental health disabilities, and those who work for smaller organizations have lower odds of disclosing to co-workers, management, and clients as compared to their counterparts. Attorneys who have requested accommodations are more willing to disclose as compared to those who have not, but only to co-workers and management. Women are less likely than men to disclose to management and clients. However, gender is not a significant determinant of disclosure to co-workers. Older attorneys are more likely to disclose to clients, whereas attorneys with children are less likely to disclose to co-workers. Lastly, lower perceived prejudice and the presence of co-workers with disabilities are associated with higher disclosure scores, but not for all groups. Conclusions Individuals who acquired a disability at a relatively early point in life and those with more visible disabilities are more likely to disclose. However, such willingness is affected by the intersection of disability with other individual and firm-level characteristics. Implications for Cancer Survivors. The findings imply that those with less visible disabilities and with health conditions acquired later in life are less likely to disclose. The relevance of the findings is heightened by the altered work conditions and demands imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic for cancer survivors.

AB  - While researchers have documented the significant issue of moral distress among nurses, few have explored moral distress among mental health nurses. In addition, no research to date has explored nursing students' experiences of moral distress during mental health clinical rotations, despite nursing students typically reporting negative attitudes towards mental health nursing. This manuscript reports on a qualitative study involving seven Canadian baccalaureate nursing students, who reported on their experiences of moral distress during a 13-week clinical rotation on inpatient psychiatric units. Overall, nursing students reported significant moral distress related to the perceived lack of nurses talking meaningfully to patients on the unit, a hierarchical power structure for physicians, a lack of information given to patients about their psychiatric medications, and an inability of their nursing instructors to advocate for ethical change on the units. Several students made a specific connection between their moral distress and not wanting to pursue a career in mental health nursing.

AB  - Negative attitudes toward people with mental illness are a widespread concern and may vary across countries. This study used a 36-item questionnaire to compare attitudes toward people with mental illness and beliefs about the causes of mental illness among medical students from the United States, Brazil, Ghana, Nigeria, and China (N = 1131). Exploratory factor analysis identified the underlying factor structure of the questionnaire, and analysis of covariance was then used to compare factors representing four nonstigmatized attitudes across students from the five countries. US Medical students scored highest on all four factors, followed by those from Brazil. Nigerian and Ghanaian students scored lowest on nonsupernatural etiology of mental illness, and Chinese students showed the lowest score on personal social acceptance and public policy acceptance of people with mental illness. Differences in medical student attitudes between these five countries suggest underlying sociocultural differences in attitudes with the more stigmatized attitudes in developing countries.

AB  - "Concept creep" is the gradual semantic expansion of harm-related concepts such as bullying, mental disorder, prejudice, and trauma. This review presents a synopsis of relevant theoretical advances and empirical research findings on the phenomenon. It addresses three fundamental questions. First, it clarifies the characterisation of concept creep by refining its theoretical and historical dimensions and presenting studies investigating the change in harm-related concepts using computational linguistics. Second, it examines factors that have caused concept creep, including cultural shifts in sensitivity to harm, societal changes in the prevalence of harm, and intentional meaning changes engineered for political ends. Third, the paper develops an account of the consequences of concept creep, including social conflict, political polarisation, speech restrictions, victim identities, and progressive social change. This extended analysis of concept creep helps to understand its mixed implications and sets a multi-pronged agenda for future research on the topic.

AB  - What cognitive and affective processes underlie the all-too-human tendency toward group-based affiliation and exclusion? Using a paradigm in which children are randomly assigned to previously unfamiliar and meaningless "minimal" social groups, we investigate the developmental origins of the tendency to prefer and positively evaluate the actions of social ingroup members. Using a procedure derived from evaluative priming as well as children's verbal descriptions of intergroup encounters, we show that 6-year olds but not 3-year olds manifest robust ingroup preference. These results suggest that the mechanisms underlying the wide range of human social group affiliations undergoes a striking increase in generality between ages 3 and 6, perhaps driven by a shift from an individual-level to a group-level or "sociocentric" orientation.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to evaluate effectiveness of cognitive behavioral intervention (CBI) to prevent substance use among first-year university students at high risk of substance use. Design/methodology/approach Sixty university students at high risk for substance use recruited and assigned to CBI and control groups (30 students per groups). Intervention impact was assessed on measures of attitudes toward substance use at three time points: baseline, postintervention and three-months postintervention. Findings The analysis showed that participants' negative attitudes toward substance use in the intervention group was increased post intervention. Although the mean score was significantly higher than the baseline (Time I) at Time II and dropped at Time III, the mean scores remained higher than time I, using repeated measure ANOVA (p< 0.05). Practical implications Findings of this study provide evidence that CBI is effective to sustain substance abstinence among this age group. Originality/value The paper is testing effectiveness CBI among a high-risk population of substance use. The study is highlighting the importance of sustaining substance abstinence using psychological preventive methods.

AB  - In order to enhance patient outcome and patient safety in healthcare, interprofessional education (IPE) has over the years become a specific area of interest focusing on teaching concepts, research methods, and implementation strategies. To achieve commitment and positive attitudes as part of the institutional readiness towards IPE, the adoption of change management aspects can support its early implementation. This short report presents results of a baseline survey on attitudes and preferences for IPE among first-year students in medicine and nursing, as well as among chief physicians, nurse directors, and administrative directors at the associated university hospital. For the survey, the UWE-IP (University of the West of England Interprofessional Questionnaire) was used along with ten customised questions. Overall, a high degree of approval for IPE was observed in all participants. Furthermore, participants showed positive attitudes in three of the four UWE-IP subscales. However, neutral to negative attitudes were documented in subscale interprofessional interaction.

AB  - The tourism phenomenon essentially entails a quest and encounter with the otherness, which are often articulated in the traveler's involvement with worlds, values, and lives of those inhabiting other cultures. Tourists however, as ordinary people, are not immune to intergroup biases, which constitute important behavioral determinants. Drawing on seminal accounts from intercultural communication, marketing, and psychology, the authors propose a Generalized Approach to Tourist Ethnocentrism (GATE) which considers biased perceptions toward out-group members and their culture, while moving beyond the traditional scope of the home country's economy. Additionally, the study explored and modeled the Generalized Ethnocentrism (GenE) scale for application in tourism research. A second data set (n=302) further confirmed the psychometric properties, along with the fit and robustness of the proposed model. The GenE is presented to tourism research as a Type II reflective first-order formative second-order construct, whose causal indicators include cultural bias and personal prejudice. Research implications are discussed.

AB  - The present study analyzes the preferences of residents around protected areas for brown bear conservation. We use a discrete choice experiment visualized with regional maps in order to explore preferences for bear conservation across six areas, namely three residential areas, popular tourist sites, and protected areas in Shiretoko Peninsula, Japan. The presented results show that the sampled residents have heterogeneous site-specific preferences. They prefer bear conservation in protected areas and they are more averse to conservation in residential areas. However, they support coexistence with bears in general. Moreover, residents' attitudes become more negative with closer proximity between bear habitats and their residences. In addition, the occupations of local residents also affect their preferences. Those residents that depend on agriculture and commercial fishing have more negative attitudes toward bear conservation relative to those that depend on tourism. Therefore, we conclude. that integrating the preferences of residents into zoning management planning helps promote wildlife conservation and resolve potential human-wildlife conflicts.

AB  - The article is concerned with the life experiences of infertile women going through infertility treatment and their need for social and psychological support, which they try to find in their immediate social environment. The Internet has become one place where everyone can find "people like oneself." The best support is received from these people who are in the same life situation and are able and willing to share their lived experiences with each other. Communication via the Internet and the formation of a virtual community of patients has both positive and negative aspects, all of which are examined in the article. On the one hand, it creates a psychologically favorable atmosphere and might potentially increase the success rate of In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatment. On the other, this leads to the seclusion of patients within the circle of "similar people" and sometimes to negative attitudes towards people outside the circle. The article is based on the author's "netnography" research of a virtual community of Russian IVF1 patients.

AB  - Aims. Syrian refugees may have increased mental health needs due to the frequent exposure to potentially traumatic events and violence experienced during the flight from their home country, breakdown of supportive social networks and daily life stressors related to refugee life. The aim of this study is to report evidence on mental health needs and access to mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) among Syrians refugees living in Sultanbeyli-Istanbul, Turkey.
   Methods. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among Syrian refugees aged 18 years or over in Sultanbeyli between February and May 2018. We used random sampling to select respondents by using the registration system of the municipality. Data among 1678 Syrian refugees were collected on mental health outcomes using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Checklist (PCL-5) and the Hopkins Symptoms Checklist (HSCL-25) for depression and anxiety. We also collected data on health care utilisation, barriers to seeking and continuing care as well as knowledge and attitudes towards mental health. Descriptive analyses were used.
   Results. The estimated prevalence of symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety was 19.6, 34.7 and 36.1%, respectively. In total, 249 respondents (15%) screened positive for either PTSD, depression or anxiety in our survey and self-reported emotional/behavioural problems since arriving in Sultanbeyli. The treatment gap (the proportion of these 249 people who did not seek care) was 89% for PTSD, 90% for anxiety and 88% for depression. Several structural and attitudinal barriers for not seeking care were reported, including the cost of mental health care, the belief that time would improve symptoms, fear of being stigmatised and lack of knowledge on where and how to get help. Some negative attitudes towards people with mental health problems were reported by respondents.
   Conclusions. Syrian refugees hardly access MHPSS services despite high mental health needs, and despite formally having access to the public mental health system in Turkey. To overcome the treatment gap, MHPSS programmes need to be implemented in the community and need to overcome the barriers to seeking care which were identified in this study. Mental health awareness raising activities should be provided in the community alongside the delivery of psychological interventions. This is to increase help-seeking and to tackle negative attitudes towards mental health and people with mental health problems.

AB  - Overvaluation of shape and weight in binge-eating disorder (BED) is associated with greater eating-disorder psychopathology and greater weight-bias internalization, which arein turnassociated with poorer mental and physical health. Little is known, however, about the significance of other cognitive processes, such as rumination, in BED. This study examined rumination and overvaluation of shape/weight with eating-disorder psychopathology and weight-bias internalization among 237 treatment-seeking patients with BED and comorbid obesity. Hierarchical multiple regressions indicated that rumination was associated with eating-disorder psychopathology and weight-bias internalization above and beyond the influence of overvaluation of shape/weight. Findings suggest that, among patients with BED/obesity, rumination is an important cognitive process associated with severity of eating-disorder psychopathology even after accounting for overvaluation of shape/weight. Patients with greater rumination might be more likely to dwell on weight-based discrimination experiences and internalize these negative attitudes. Additional controlled examination could determine whether rumination represents another potential target for BED/obesity treatment.

AB  - In the 1990s, Canadian historian Peter Hart claimed tens of thousands of native southern Irish Protestants experienced something akin to "ethnic cleansing" at the hands of the IRA in the early 1920s. Hart's research revised the "Irish nationalist revolution" (ca. 1917-1923) as an essentially ethnic conflict, and this article re-examines his evidence and methodology. Exaggerating the number of forced migrations, Hart's analysis rests on erroneous statistical proofs which he supported with a gross evidence selection bias. To better understand Hart's revision, his work is compared with Michael A. Bellesiles' Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture (2000), which also exhibited similar but also very different statistical errors. A central argument in this article is that erroneous statistical proofs are best understood as social constructs, where they articulate the prejudices of their host academies. Greater awareness of this problem is needed if it is to be avoided in the future.

AB  - Senior centers must re-envision their programs to appeal to today's increasingly older and more diverse older adults. Using a purposeful aging framework, this study aims to inform senior center programming by capturing diverse older adults' perspectives on future goals, perceptions of aging, attitudes about senior centers, and experience with technology. Participants age 70 and older (N = 64) joined one of eight focus groups organized by race/ethnicity and preferred spoken language. Transcripts were coded using a grounded theory approach to identify perspectives in each domain. Across groups, shared perspectives included aspirations to make a difference, maintain health and independence, continue learning, and embrace positive perceptions of aging. However, both positive and negative attitudes about participating in senior centers and the effects of technology were presented. We discuss how to redesign senior center programming to meet members' proactive approach to aging and future goals, and facilitate more confidence with new technology.

AB  - This paper presents the examination of a particular theoretical framework that incorporated the moderating role of demographics in a mediated by negative attitudes relationship between values and pro-environmental behaviour. The hypothesised hierarchical impact of Universalism (Un) on pro-environmental purchasing behaviour (PPB) through the mediation of environmental unconcern (EU) was verified, while age was found to moderate the relationship between attitudes and behaviour. Yet, a clear generational effect was indicated as younger consumers (less than 35 years old), who are less inhibited by environmental unconcern, are more likely to get engaged in PPB than their older counterparts are. The verification of this particular theoretical framework revealed nested, not apparent, aspects of the grid of PPB antecedents. It is implied that the overall effort towards PPB should start by inculcating self-transcendence values in young people's minds and continue by acknowledging, understanding and facing their unconcern tendency instead of just reporting some alleged direct motives towards PPB.

AB  - Background Family-centred care is the dominant model for providing nursing care in paediatrics. Unit layout has been shown to impact nurses' ability to provide family-centred care. Little is known about the meanings and experiences of paediatric intensive care unit nurses concerning the care they provide to families within their unique physical setting. Aim This study examined paediatric intensive care unit nurses' lived experience of caring for families following a major hospital transformation project, which included the construction of a new unit and quality improvement changes. Study design A hermeneutic-phenomenological design was selected to study a paediatric intensive care unit in a large Canadian paediatric teaching hospital. Methods Data were collected over a 6-month period through individual interviews, photographs, participant observation, and document review. The sample consisted of 15 paediatric intensive care unit nurses who experienced the unit both pre- and post-transformation. Data were analysed in an ongoing fashion using the method described by Benner to identify common and divergent meanings. Results Despite pride in offering a family-friendly environment, nurses' practice prejudiced a family focus in favour of patient-centred care. Nurses in this study negotiated physical and practice spaces with families by interpreting that nurses do not belong in the home-like patient room and exhibiting gatekeeping comportments. Conclusion Although similar nurse comportments have been identified in prior works, no previous studies have identified these as forming a pattern of negotiating spaces with families. Relevance to clinical practice This study provides insights into the lived experience of paediatric intensive care unit nurses in relation to family care, which can stimulate reflections at an organizational level about creating environments where nurses and families can both feel at home.

AB  - The present research investigated whether intergroup disgust sensitivity (ITG-DS) predicts greater Islamophobia, and whether this positive association is modulated (strengthened or weakened) by the experience of concurrent incidental non-disgust emotions (fear, sadness, anger, happiness). In Study 1 (N = 225) participants completed measures of ITG-DS (an emotionally charged individual difference variable reflecting heightened tendency to experience disgust and revulsion reactions toward ethnic outgroup encounters) and dispositional measures of fear, sadness, anger, and happiness. Results revealed that among those experiencing greater (vs. lower) fear or sadness, the positive relation between ITG-DS and Islamophobia was significantly stronger. In Study 2 (N = 174), fear, sadness, and happiness were experimentally induced. Among those induced to experience fear, the positive relation between ITG-DS and prejudice toward Muslims was significantly strengthened relative to control. Overall, specific negative emotions, especially fear, interacted with individual differences in intergroup-relevant disgust sensitivity to inform outgroup evaluations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The concept of the field' is significant in ethnographic research as well as qualitative research methods more generally. However, how a field researcher enters the field is usually taken for granted after gaining access to the field. We suggest that entrance is a distinct phase of fieldwork that differs from negotiating access. Entrance is not a trivial event; rather, it is a rite of passage into a complex practice world and marks a critical field moment. Drawing on our ethnography and insights from hermeneutics and anthropology, we show that a practical understanding of the field represents a fusion of horizons where a fieldworker is thrown. The concept of thrownness highlights the fact that the fieldworkers' own historicity and prejudices affect their entrance into the field; hence, entrance into the field orientates an ethnographer in the field and influences the entire period of fieldwork that follows. Our theorizing is intended as a contribution towards advancing the discussion of qualitative research methods.

KW  - PREJUDICE
AB  - We investigated whether imagining contact with an out-group member would change behavioral tendencies toward the out-group. In Experiment 1, British high school students who imagined talking to an asylum seeker reported a stronger tendency to approach asylum seekers than did participants in a control condition. Path analysis revealed this relationship was mediated by out-group trust and, marginally, by out-group attitude. In Experiment 2, straight undergraduates who imagined an interaction with a gay individual reported a stronger tendency to approach, and a weaker tendency to avoid, gay people. Path analyses showed that these relationships were mediated by out-group trust, out-group attitude, and less intergroup anxiety. These findings highlight the potential practical importance of imagined contact and important mediators of its effects.

AB  - The aim of this study is to explore the effect of exposure to sexist humor about women on men's self-reported rape proclivity. Earlier studies have shown that exposure to this type of humor increases rape proclivity and that funniness responses to jokes are a key element to consider. However, the role of aversiveness responses has not been studied. In a between-group design, 109 male university students are randomly exposed to sexist or nonsexist jokes. Participants are asked to rate the jokes according to their degree of funniness and aversiveness. Participants' levels of hostile and benevolent sexism were also measured. Results about the relationship between sexist attitudes and sexist humor and the relationship between sexist attitudes and rape proclivity are consistent with those of earlier studies. However, exposure to sexist humor affects rape proclivity only when aversiveness shown to this type of humor is low. The results are discussed in the light of the prejudiced norm theory.

AB  - Existing literature is dominated by accounts which position gay teachers as victims. We were concerned that this only presented a partial insight into the experiences of gay teachers. This study researched the personal and professional experiences of four gay teachers in England. It builds on existing research by presenting positive narratives rather than positioning gay teachers as victims. We use the term "chalkface" to illustrate that all were practicing teachers. The purpose of the study was to explore their experiences as gay teachers throughout their careers. The study used the life history method to create narratives of each participant. Semi-structured interviews were used. The study found that the repeal of Section 28 in England in 2003 did not have an immediate effect on the identities, resilience, and agency of the participants. The 2010 Equality Act in England and changes to the school inspection framework had a greater influence in supporting their agency, resilience, and willingness to merge personal and professional identities. All but one participant managed to use their identities as gay teachers to advance inclusion and social justice through the curriculum. Although the narratives that we have presented do illuminate some negative experiences, the accounts are largely positive, in contrast with existing literature which positions gay teachers as victims.

AB  - In the 1980s and early 1990s, homophobia and prejudice were ubiquitous in Australian HIV/AIDS hospital wards and clinics. The association of HIV/AIDS with "deviant" subjects, namely gay men and intravenous drug users, meant that both patients and health care workers experienced and witnessed discrimination. These wards and clinics however, also became sites of solidarity and collaboration that extended across diverse lines of identity. While some HIV/AIDS nurses were gay men, many were heterosexual working-class women. In a context of increasing industrial radicalism amongst nurses, nurses and their unions played a crucial role in fighting for the rights of people living with and dying from HIV/AIDS. They fought and won a political battle with doctors and surgeons for a socially progressive approach to testing and infection control. Drawing on both archival research and oral testimony, this article considers this important, though under-examined, chapter in Australian labour history.

AB  - This article draws on in-depth research on the nature and intensity of neighbour relations in an area in Peckham, London, which underwent urban regeneration aimed at improving the urban environment and increasing the area's tenure mix. Drawing on the literature on neighbouring, the article explores residents' perceptions and attitudes towards their neighbours and the dynamics of their routine interactions. Despite findings pointing towards a general atmosphere of cordiality and solidarity, interactions were casual, coexisted with prejudiced views towards certain groups and areas, and were viewed by residents as part of their everyday social practices of community. As a result, very little else was exchanged between tenures, putting into question some policy assumptions that the increased physical proximity between housing tenures can potentially lead to instrumental interaction that can benefit low-income households in social housing. Reflecting on these findings, the article discusses some implications that have relevance for policy and research.

AB  - A student's weight is a particularly important characteristic in physical education. Research has shown that physical education teachers and people working in this area are particularly likely to hold strong negative implicit biases toward overweight students and that these students tend to earn lower grades in physical education. Stereotypes of overweight people might color teachers' judgments of these students. In this study, we experimentally investigated whether overweight students received lower grades from physical education teachers on an exercise than normal weight students. We presented a verbal description of an exercise and asked teachers to grade a student's performance and to judge the student's social and working behaviors. Teachers gave lower grades to the overweight student, and regression analyses showed that their stereotypical beliefs predicted their judgments. Teachers' motivation to control prejudice had no relation to their judgments. Nonetheless, our results showed that the same performance was graded worse only because the student was overweight.

AB  - Based on the scarcity theory, this study focuses on exploring the relationship between the severity of public health emergencies (i.e., COVID-19) and individual irrational consumer behaviors through the serial mediating variables of perceived scarcity (PS) and negative mentality (NM). An online questionnaire was used to collect data from participants in China and we obtained 466 effective (115 male and 351 female) questionnaires in total. The findings showed that the relationship between each pair of factors - perceived pandemic severity, PS, NM, and irrational consumption behaviors - was significantly positive. Although the perception of the severity of this public health emergency did not directly predict irrational consumer behavior, the effect was mediated by PS and NM independently and serially. These findings reveal that people who strongly perceive scarcity and are prone to negative attitudes are more likely to demonstrate irrational consumer behaviors (such as rushing to buy and hoard living supplies) once the public perceives a public health emergency as severe. This effect occurs because the PS that results from the epidemic affects people's cognition, emotion, and behavior.

AB  - Psychological resilience refers to the human capacity to cope with distressing events such as abuse, disaster, and other stressful or traumatic circumstances. Previous investigations by using self-report questionnaires have focused exclusively on explicit aspects of psychological resilience. The present study investigated the relationship between implicit and explicit aspects of psychological resilience. We used a self-report questionnaire consisting of four types of psychological resilience scales as a measure of explicit aspects of psychological resilience. At the same time, we measured implicit aspects of psychological resilience by employing an implicit association test (IAT) that was designed to reveal participants' implicit associations between closely related people (family member, companion, and friend), and calm/anxiety attitudes. Our results showed that TAT scores exhibited significant interactions with questionnaire scores. We discuss potential links between explicit and implicit aspects of psychological resilience in terms of the availability of companion as environmental resources.

AB  - Courts have historically regulated the use of character in trials because of its potential to prejudice juries. In order to regulate this type of proof, courts must be able to recognize what is and is not character evidence, but past attempts to define character in the law of evidence have been unsatisfactory. This Note proposes a new framework to help courts unravel this age-old mystery. By considering legal scholarship in conjunction with psychological research and employing common tools of statutory interpretation, this Note contends that proof must have two components for it to be regulated by the character scheme in the Federal Rules of Evidence: propensity and morality. It then explains the elements of each component under the Federal Rules regime, examines several evidentiary examples drawn from real cases to illustrate how courts would apply the proposed framework, and concludes by discussing the broader implications of this new perspective on character evidence.

AB  - Objective: To understand the experience of adults living with cystic fibrosis. Method: A qualitative study based on the social phenomenology by Alfred Schutz, carried out with 12 adults interviewed in 2016. The statements were analyzed and organized into concrete categories. Results: l he following categories were evidenced: "The biopsychosocial impact of the disease on daily life", "Social prejudice as a generator of embarrassment", "Coping strategies" and "Fear, uncertainties and the desire to carry out life projects". Final considerations: The understanding of the experience lived by adults with cystic fibrosis allowed unveiling intersubjective aspects experienced by this public that should be considered by health professionals in the care of this group. It is up to the professionals involved in assisting these people to develop care strategies aimed at completeness, respect for the world of meanings of each individual, their life history, and intersubjectivity that is specially built in the relationship between professionals and people with cystic fibrosis.

AB  - Racism impacts every aspect of medicine, including the careers and lives of Black physicians. The story of William Augustus Hinton (1883-1959), who invented the Hinton Test for syphilis before becoming the first African American full professor at Harvard University in 1949, offers an instructive perspective on the intersection of interpersonal and systemic racism, and personal determination, just over our historical horizon. Yet there are sobering and instructive lessons throughout this history. Hinton had to navigate prejudice throughout his career. Indeed, while there is much to be inspired by in the telling of Hinton's story, the forms of racism faced by Hinton and his contemporaries remain persisting features of academic medicine. This article focuses on encounters with racism that affect the course of medical careers and scientific innovation. Hinton's story holds important implications for many health professionals in the twenty-first century and provides unique insights into the history and impact of interpersonal and systemic racism alike in academic medicine.

AB  - As tropical landscapes become increasingly human-dominated, conflicts between people and wildlife threaten ecological processes. Old World fruit bats such as flying foxes are especially susceptible to extinction risk because there is low interest in their conservation, particularly when they are considered pests. In order to arrest fruit bat declines, there is an urgent need to understand human-bat conflict and its implications. On a tropical island in Peninsular Malaysia, we conducted a questionnaire survey to investigate coexistence between people and the island flying fox (Pteropus hypomelanus). Among 119 respondents, knowledge of ecosystem services provided by flying foxes was extremely low. Most respondents held negative attitudes towards the bats, and older male locals were more likely to support killing them. This was also true for older owners of fruit trees who derived income from selling fruit, and experienced flying fox raids. Our results can be used to design appropriate interventions to support conservation efforts, and has important implications for managing conflicts between humans and synanthropic wildlife.

AB  - This paper addresses the question of interaction between home and international students using qualitative data from 100 home students at two 'teaching intensive' universities in the southwest of England. Stephan and Stephan's Integrated Threat Theory is used to analyse the data, finding evidence for all four types of threat that they predict when outgroups interact. It is found that home students perceive threats to their academic success and group identity from the presence of international students on the campus and in the classroom. These are linked to anxieties around 'mindful' forms of interaction and a taboo around the discussion of difference, leading to a 'passive xenophobia' for the majority. The paper concludes that Integrated Threat Theory is a useful tool in critiquing the 'internationalisation at home' agenda, making suggestions for policies and practices that may alleviate perceived threats, thereby improving the quality and outcomes of intercultural interaction.

AB  - This paper focuses on the ways in which Islamophobia operates within a university environment and how it is impacting the everyday experiences for a sample of British Muslim students. Qualitative methods were adopted to interview a select of participants attending a Russell Group institution located in Northern England. The findings revealed that they most frequently encountered subtle and inconspicuous forms of racism. Otherwise known as microaggressions. The narratives suggested that the participants experienced Islamophobic microaggressions relating to their appearances. The methods and behaviours that the perpetrators utilised included maintaining excessive distance, peculiar staring and hurling racial jokes. What emerged was how the accumulation of religious prejudice had taken its toll on the participants psychological being as they claimed to have developed symptoms pertaining to mental health issues. The discussion explored a number of avenues as to how the participants could mitigate any long-lasting detriment. The options included conversing with members of the Ummah; and accessing university support systems for professional help.

AB  - Despite the growing number of Latino families in the United States (Passel et al., 2011), Latino fathers are an understudied segment of the population. We examined a subsample of Latino residential fathers (n = 859) from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study. Measures of fathers' generational status and fathering beliefs, including adherence to traditional gender roles and fathering identity salience, were collected at child's birth; father involvement was collected at infant age 1 year. We tested longitudinal mediations between fathers' generational status, fathering beliefs, and involvement using structural equation modeling. Fathers' generational status impacted the amount of time fathers spend with their children in tasks relating to direct caregiving, but not necessarily cognitive engagement. Findings highlight the importance of considering cultural context in early Latino father involvement.

AB  - Parallels are drawn between representations of early 20th century Finnish maritime labourers on foreign merchant ships and present-day Estonian blue-collar commuter workers who work in the construction sector in Finland. We ask how the workers at both the times comment the media representations of them and how the possible analogues can be understood. The study focuses on two themes: stereotypes and masculinity ideals related to mobile work. The data comprise seamen's letters, construction workers' interviews, and media sources. By combining anthropological and historical analyses, we show that, rather than being occupation specific or related to time, certain features related to mobility, physical work, and gender tend to reappear in different kinds of circumstances. The features are characterised by the paradox of positive expectations and negative prejudices. We suggest that present-day discussions on cross-border work benefit not only from comparisons between different areas and occupations but also from historical juxtapositions.

AB  - Religion could play a positive role in intergroup relations. However, this potential is usually overlooked and religion is often perceived as divisive and polarizing, perhaps even a source of intergroup conflict. This study examined religion as a possible tool for achieving positive intergroup encounters. A randomized control trial research design was used to study the contribution of religion to the enhancement of positive relations between Jewish and Arab high school students in Israel. The 255 eleventh-grade students were randomly assigned into three groups: encounters based on religious content, encounters based on social content, and a control group. Findings revealed that the religion-based intervention was more effective than the social-based one, which merely slowed down the deteriorating relationships between the groups. The results suggest that religion can serve as a common denominator for different national and social groups and be used for enhancing tolerance and understanding between conflict groups.

AB  - In an era of rising global intra-regional migration, in-depth explorations of attitudes toward immigrants and immigration (ATII) in emerging migrant-receiving societies in Asia are scarce. Using Taiwan as a case of an emerging non-Western, democratic migrant-receiving context with a racially homogeneous population, aging social structure, and vibrant civic culture, this is the first study to examine receptivity to three major migrant types. The study contributes to the ATII literature and sociological research through discovering something old (perceived group threat of foreign professionals and labor migrants at the individual level), something new (link between positive attitudes toward same-sex marriage and higher receptivity to blue-collar migrants), something borrowed (civic behavior), and something context-specific (effect of the high visibility of marriage immigrants in certain places on receptivity). This study highlights the importance of uncovering patterns and mechanisms of nativity-, ethnicity-, and class-based foreigner exclusionism in emerging non-Western migrant destinations. The findings on receptivity toward intra-Asia migrants in a 21st-century Asian society illuminate possibilities for reinventing theories on the social organization of difference and the socio-cognitive construction of ethnicity, with broader relevance to inter-minority relations among Asians in traditional Western immigrant societies.

AB  - Negative attitudes towards litigants in person (LiPs) are long-standing. But despite their persistence, no study has ever considered: how did we get here? This is what this article sets out to do, analysing when the term LiP first appears, and the context in which this occurs. I argue this moment is a by-product of broader changes taking place for the legal profession in the nineteenth century. Drawing on Larson's "professional project" I argue the new county courts become a battleground for attorneys to distinguish themselves, and it is the introduction of certain kinds of distinction that undermines the self-represented party. This article ultimately argues that the LiP role is not simply self-representation, but is rather self-representation that can only occur in the latter stages of the professional project. This means, perversely, that the creation of the term LiP does not indicate the facilitation of lay participation in legal forums; it marks instead the moment when they are displaced. As I conclude, this displacement has profound consequences for LiPs to this day.

AB  - Owing to concerns about the safety and tolerability of exposure therapy, many clinicians deliver the treatment in an overly cautious manner, which may limit its effectiveness. Although didactic training in exposure reduces clinician concerns about the treatment to a moderate extent, improved training strategies are needed to minimize these concerns and improve exposure delivery. The present study compared the effectiveness of a standard (i.e., didactic) exposure therapy training model to an "enhanced" training paradigm encompassing strategies derived from social-cognitive theory on attitude change. Clinicians (N = 49) were assigned to one of the two training approaches. Relative to standard training, clinicians who received enhanced training showed: (a) significantly greater reductions in concerns about exposure from pre- to post-training, and (b) superior self-reported delivery of the treatment. Reduction in concerns during training mediated the effects of training condition on clinicians' self-reported exposure delivery. These findings underscore the importance of addressing clinician concerns about exposure therapy in training contexts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Inferences about moral character may often drive outrage over symbolic acts of racial bigotry. Study 1 demonstrates a theoretically predicted dissociation between moral evaluations of an act and the person who carries out the act. Although Americans regarded the private use of a racial slur as a less blameworthy act than physical assault, use of a slur was perceived as a clearer indicator of poor moral character. Study 2 highlights the dynamic interplay between moral judgments of acts and persons, demonstrating that first making person judgments can bias subsequent act judgments. Privately defacing a picture of Martin Luther King, Jr. led to greater moral condemnation of the agent than of the act itself only when the behavior was evaluated first. When Americans first made character judgments, symbolically defacing a picture of the civil rights leader was significantly more likely to be perceived as an immoral act. These studies support a person-centered account of outrage over bigotry and demonstrate that moral evaluations of acts and persons converge and diverge under theoretically meaningful circumstances.

AB  - With Laspeyres, Paasche and other authors such as Drobisch and Lehr, Germany made quite a promising start in index theory in the last decades of the 19th century. However, it soon lost ground after this period, which is described in this paper. The focus is not on biographies but on controversies where these persons acted as opponents and developed the views for which they are well known. The issues selected are primarily those which are still interesting and controversial today, e. g. the merits and demerits of certain index formulas, the definition and updating of weights, "pure" price comparison vs. chain indices etc. However, in order to aid a better understanding of how Laspeyres etc. arrived at their index formulas and views about the purposes index numbers should serve, some attention is also given to the typical disputes and prejudices of that time (e.g. regarding inflation under the regime of a gold currency).

AB  - Neuroimaging research in adults has consistently found that differential perception of race is associated with increased amygdala activity. We hypothesized that such neural biases unlikely reflect innate processes but instead emerge over development. In the current study, we used fMRI to examine the neurodevelopmental trajectory of the amygdala in response to race across childhood and adolescence ranging from 4 to 16 years. Thirty-two youths viewed African American and European American faces during a functional brain scan. Results suggest that differential amygdala response to African American faces does not emerge until adolescence, reflecting the increasing salience of race across development. In addition, greater peer diversity was associated with attenuated amygdala response to African American faces, suggesting that intergroup racial contact may reduce the salience of race.

TI  - Social change innovations, citizen science, miniSASS and the SDGs
T2  - WATER POLICY
LA  - English
AB  - The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) describe a course of action to address poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all (https://sdgs.un.org/goals). More specifically, SDG 6 clarifies how water quality, quantity and access are crucial to human well-being, and yet human activities are compromising water resources through over-exploitation, pollution, as well as contributing to the spread of disease. Globally aquatic ecosystems are highly threatened and concerted efforts by governments and civil society to 'turn the situation around' are simply not working. Human-created problems require human-centred solutions and these require different ways of thinking and acting to those behaviour patterns that are contributing to the challenges. In this paper, we first consider causal approaches to attitude change and behaviour modification that are simply not working as intended. We then explore enabling responses such as citizen science and co-engaged action learning as more tenable alternatives. SDG 6 has a focus on clean water and sanitation for all. The SDGs further clarify how the extent to which this goal can be realized depends, to a large extent, on stakeholder engagements and education. Through stakeholder engagements and educational processes, people can contribute towards SDG 6 and the specific indicator and target in SDG 6.b - Stakeholder participation. Following a three-year research process, that investigated a wide range of participatory tools, this paper explores how the Stream Assessment Scoring System (miniSASS; www.minisass.org) can enable members of the public to engage in water quality monitoring at a local level. The paper continues to demonstrate how miniSASS can contribute to the monitoring of progress towards Sustainable Development Goal 6.3.2., as a Level Two indicator. miniSASS is proving popular in southern Africa as a methodology for engaging stakeholder participation in water quality monitoring and management. The technique costs very little to implement and can be applied by children and scientists alike. As a biomonitoring approach, it is based on families of macroinvertebrates that are present in most perennial rivers of the world. The paper concludes by describing how useful the miniSASS technique can be for addressing SDG 6.3.2 and that it can be applied in most regions of the world.

AB  - Approximately 20% of U.S. residents are currently living with a disability. Ableism values a specific type of physical, mental, and/or emotional capital as well as supports socially constructed expectations of ability, valuing these expectations over different types of ability and disability. One way in which ableism is perpetuated is through microaggressions, or acts of aggressions that occur at the more interpersonal-or micro-level. Microaggressions are everyday interactions that perpetuate inequalities and stereotypes against people who belong to marginalized communities. Experiencing multiple microaggressions has been referred to as "death by a thousand paper cuts," indicating the severity of the sum total of these casual types of prejudice and oppression. Research demonstrates that experiences of identity-related microaggressions can negatively impact mental health outcomes, increase somatic symptoms, and increase negative affect. This mixed methods study explores how to measure ableist microaggressions by developing the 65-item ableist microaggression scale using qualitative interviews with stakeholders (N = 13) and a nationwide survey in the United States (N = 984).

KW  - China
AB  - Jane Austen's Gothic parody Northanger Abbey was first published in 1818 and translated into Chinese in 1958 under the title Nuosangjue Si (sic). However, the novel has remained unpopular in China to this day and has received considerably less critical attention than Austen's other works, especially Pride and Prejudice (1813). This article examines the reception of Northanger Abbey in China since the early twentieth century, considering in particular the reasons for contemporary readers' lukewarm response to the novel. It argues that a knowledge of Gothic conventions and elements is crucial to an understanding of the literary satire in Northanger Abbey-and yet Ann Radcliffe's Gothic novels were not available to Chinese readers in translation until very recent decades. It also addresses the difficulties that arose when translating the Gothic-sounding title of Northanger Abbey from English into Chinese and explores the influence of Marxist literary criticism on the first translation of the novel.

TI  - Regulatory challenges relating to tissue banks in South Africa: Impediments to accessing healthcare
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOETHICS AND LAW
LA  - English
AB  - The demand for human tissue in the medical context has increased rapidly since the early 1980s, when the use of human bone in allografts in orthopaedic surgery became the norm. During the 1990s, the demand for human tissue turned towards tissue-engineered products in the field of regenerative medicine. Tissue engineering, as an established and growing interdisciplinary field comprising different specialties, such as medicine, materials science, cell biology, genomics and chemical engineering, aims to develop biological substitutes to restore, maintain or improve tissue function, thus offering patients the chance to regain normal functionality in their bodies. The purpose of this article is to explore some of the gaps that exist in the current regulatory framework that governs tissue banks in South Africa (SA), and to make certain recommendations aimed at closing these gaps. The discrepancies and gaps cause confusion and may lead to undesired and unforeseen consequences regarding the use of human tissue, as well as prejudice the welfare of patients in SA.

TI  - Everywhere and Nowhere: Reflections on Phenomenology as Impossible and Indispensable (in Psychology and Psychiatry)
T2  - CRITICAL INQUIRY
LA  - English
AB  - This essay argues for the necessity of a phenomenological perspective on mind and mental disorder while also emphasizing the inherent difficulty of adopting such an orientation. Here I adopt a via negativa approach-by considering three forms of error that the phenomenologists Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, and Maurice Merleau-Ponty recognize as needing to be guarded against, lest they subvert the project of attaining an adequate understanding of consciousness or subjectivity: namely (1) prejudices deriving from theory and common sense, (2) distorting effects of reflection, and (3) what Heidegger termed the forgetting of the ontological difference. Phenomenology insists on the importance of studying subjective life while also acknowledging the epistemological paradoxes inherent to this domain-a domain whose very self-evidence is inseparable from mystery, whose visibility conceals a deeper invisibility. I consider these issues in light of phenomenology's relevance for certain issues in psychopathology and literary representation.

AB  - Little is known to date regarding how the framing of investment communication impacts retail investor propensity to engage with financial products. To explore this lacuna, we apply insights from regulatory focus theory and construal level theory, and we vary investment communications in terms of the motivation (protect vs. achieve) and the time horizon (distant vs. near) presented in a 2 x 2 quasi-experimental design. We also include an analysis of investor characteristics and find that communication of 'short-term achieve' investments attracts particularly risk-tolerant and sensation-seeking individuals, posing questions of responsibility towards potentially vulnerable groups. We also find that negative attitudes towards finance may be troublesome, as they can stop individuals from engaging with 'long-term' investment products. Positive attitudes towards finance, in contrast, lead investors to engage with 'protect' products of both 'short-' and 'long-term' horizon, highlighting benefits for individuals and society from interventions aimed at financial education and exposure. The study concludes by discussing insights for the literature and practitioners from the application of new theory and new data to the management of investment communications.

AB  - This commentary addresses the development of intergroup relations. We argue that children's reasoning about particular groups is strongly influenced by cues that shape the extent to which they conceive of group members in an undifferentiated way versus as distinct individuals. These cues include opportunities for contact with group members as well as the form and content of the information about social groups that children are exposed to. This approach to conceptualizing intergroup conflict builds upon important theoretical frameworks such as psychological essentialism, and it can be used to generate predictions about how intergroup attitudes will develop.

AB  - The Remotely Piloted Commercial Passenger Aircraft Attitude Scale (RPCPAAS) was created to measure positive and negative attitudes towards a new and plausible form of air travel. This information was then used, in combination with a latent class logit model built on data generated from a stated choice experiment to gain insight into the choice behaviour between conventionally' piloted aircraft (CPA) with a pilot on-board and remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) with a pilot on the ground. The results revealed that individuals, on average, if presented a choice between a CPA and a RPA of equivalent attributes, would elect for the CPA option. However, there is variability in the passengers' sensitivity to various flight attributes, and these sensitivities were influenced by individuals' attitude towards the new technology (i.e., RPA). From an operational perspective, and assuming that one day passengers of commercial airlines are offered the choice between CPA and RPA, the strategies employed by airlines to encourage the use of the new technology need to be different, based on individuals' attitude towards RPA.

AB  - While deviance can foster innovation within groups, research does not always find beneficial effects. The current studies provide an information processing account of the influence of deviants in group decision-making. We predicted deviants would undermine decision confidence and promote greater elaboration when tasks were difficult. Study 1 manipulated the strength (systematic cue) and gender (heuristic cue) of a job applicant to investigate the effect of a deviant in a difficult task. As predicted, a deviant was associated with lowered confidence, greater elaboration, and higher decision quality, but also decreased group cohesion and task satisfaction. Study 2 investigated the effect of a deviant during a simple task and found the same decrease in group cohesion and task satisfaction, but this time with no increase in elaboration or improvement in decision outcome quality. Results indicate that deviance, when seen as justified, has the potential to reduce the occurrence of prejudice and produce fairer decision outcomes during decision-making.

AB  - This paper examines the global provenance of Australian Islamophobia in the light of the Christchurch massacre perpetrated by a white-supremacist Australian. Anti-Muslim racism in Australia came with British imperialism in the nineteenth century. Contemporary Islamophobia in Australia operates as part of a successor empire, the United States-led 'Empire of Capital'. Anti-Muslim stories, rumours, campaigns and prejudices are launched from Australia into global circulation. For example, the spate of group sexual assaults in Sydney over 2000-2001 were internationally reported as 'ethnic gang rapes'. The handful of Australian recruits to, and supporters of, IS, is recounted in the dominant narrative as part of a story propagated in both the United Kingdom and Australia about Islamist terrorism, along with policy responses ostensibly aimed at countering violent extremism and targeting Muslims for surveillance and intervening to effect approved forms of 'integration'.

AB  - This paper presents findings from an evaluation of the Computer Clubs for Girls, an initiative originally delivered in the South East of England, designed to encourage more girls to take up information technology (IT) courses and careers. By targeting girls aged 10-14, the club aimed to provide members with a gender relevant' experience of IT, tackling issues of access, confidence and negative attitudes about IT. The evaluation, conducted over four years, included the collection of quantitative and qualitative data from members and non-members of the clubs. It included a longitudinal component in order to assess the longer-term impacts of the club. The findings support the critical view that initiatives based on assumptions about the relationship between girls and IT misinterpret the problem' about female under-representation in IT, and are unlikely to have a significant or sustained impact on what remains an occupational and subject area divided by gender typing. The paper argues for an approach which challenges the social and cultural discourses that maintain this gender divide.

AB  - African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans are disproportionately affected by cancer, yet underrepresented in cancer clinical trials. Because of this, it is important to understand how attitudes and beliefs about clinical trials vary by ethnicity. A national, random sample of 860 adults was given an online survey about attitudes toward clinical trials. We examined willingness to participate in clinical trials, attitudes toward clinical trials, trust in doctors, attitudes toward alternative and complementary medicine, and preferred information channels. Results indicate that African-American and Hispanic-American participants have more negative attitudes about clinical trials, more distrust toward doctors, more interest in complementary and alternative medicine, and less willingness to participate in clinical trials than white/non-Hispanics, although specific factors affecting willingness to participate vary. The channels people turn to for information on clinical trials also varied by ethnicity. These results help explain the ethnic disparities in cancer clinical trial enrollment by highlighting some potential underlying causes and drawing attention to areas of importance to these groups.

AB  - When individuals grow up with autonomy-thwarting parents, they may be prevented from exploring internally endorsed values and identities and as a result shut out aspects of the self perceived to be unacceptable. Given the stigmatization of homosexuality, individuals perceiving low autonomy support from parents may be especially motivated to conceal same-sex sexual attraction, leading to defensive processes such as reaction formation. Four studies tested a model wherein perceived parental autonomy support is associated with lower discrepancies between self-reported sexual orientation and implicit sexual orientation (assessed with a reaction time task). These indices interacted to predict anti-gay responding indicative of reaction formation. Studies 2-4 showed that an implicit/explicit discrepancy was particularly pronounced in participants who experienced their fathers as both low in autonomy support and homophobic, though results were inconsistent for mothers. Findings of Study 3 suggested contingent self-esteem as a link between parenting styles and discrepancies in sexual orientation measures.

TI  - Home: The place the older adult can not imagine living without
T2  - BMC GERIATRICS
LA  - English
AB  - Background: Rapidly aging populations with an increased desire to remain at home and changes in health policy that promote the transfer of health care from formal places, as hospitals and institutions, to the more informal setting of one's home support the need for further research that is designed specifically to understand the experience of home among older adults. Yet, little is known among health care providers about the older adult's experience of home. The aim of this study was to understand the experience of home as experienced by older adults living in a rural community in Sweden.
   Methods: Hermeneutical interpretation, as developed by von Post and Eriksson and based on Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics, was used to interpret interviews with six older adults. The interpretation included a self examination of the researcher's experiences and prejudices and proceeded through several readings which integrated the text with the reader, allowed new questions to emerge, fused the horizons, summarized main and sub-themes and allowed a new understanding to emerge.
   Results: Two main and six sub-themes emerged. Home was experienced as the place the older adult could not imagine living without but also as the place one might be forced to leave. The older adult's thoughts vacillated between the well known present and all its comforts and the unknown future with all its questions and fears, including the underlying threat of loosing one's home.
   Conclusions: Home has become so integral to life itself and such an intimate part of the older adult's being that when older adults lose their home, they also loose the place closest to their heart, the place where they are at home and can maintain their identity, integrity and way of living. Additional effort needs to be made to understand the older adult's experience of home within home health care in order to minimize intrusion and maximize care. There is a need to more fully explore the older adult's experience with health care providers in the home and its impact on the older adult's sense of "being at home" and their health and overall well-being.

AB  - Research has indicated that many video games and virtual worlds are populated by unrealistic, hypersexualized representations of women, but the effects of using these representations remain understudied. Objectification theory suggests that women's exposure to sexualized media representations leads to self-objectification. Further, we anticipated this process would lead to increases in rape myth acceptance (RMA). Two experiments (Study 1, N = 87; Study 2, N = 81) examined the effects of avatar features on women's experiences of self-objectification. In both studies, college women exposed to sexualized avatars experienced higher levels of self-objectification after the virtual experience than those exposed to nonsexualized avatars. Furthermore, in Study 2, self-objectification mediated the relationship between controlling a sexualized avatar and subsequent levels of RMA. We discuss the implications of women using sexualized avatars in video games and virtual environments, which may lead to negative attitudes about the self and other women off-line due to heightened self-objectification.

AB  - A secondary analysis of survey data of Hong Kong school students (N=2,865) examines social learning about persons with a (physical) disability (PWDs). Path models, connecting recalled information in communication about PWDs of different sources (media, significant others, and contact) and content (assistance, pity, and fear) with perceptions, general attitude, and behavior inclination toward PWDs, showed content as better predictor than either media channels or interpersonal sources. Interpersonal sources were better predictors than media channels were. The effects were also mediated by perception of PWDs' capabilities, perception of PWDs' inner state, and general attitude toward PWDs. The findings are interpreted and discussed.

AB  - Purpose - Current research methodologies in the field of information science employ induction or deduction, ignoring the third fundamental mode of cognition, retroduction. This paper seeks to introduce the Retroductive Recognition of Absence (RRA) methodology that expands inquiry from its current inductive and deductive bases to include the intuition-based retroduction/abduction of Charles Sanders Peirce.
   Design/methodology/approach - In brief, RRA consists of an iterative performance, of its nine-step heuristic, with each iteration narrowing the scope of the research, while increasing the depth of examination. The nine steps are: perceive a phenomenon leading to surprise, perform the fundamental and primary retroduction; synthesize the phenomenon into a hypothesis; bracket intuitive prejudices; immerse in the data; conceptualize; hypothesize; select the hypothesis most efficient to test; and test the hypothesis. The iterations continue until the researcher reaches a hypothesis testable by inductive or deductive methods. This RRA methodology incorporates a "definition heuristic" that defines any previously undefined concept, a heuristic based on Spradley and McCurdy's classification of definitions.
   Findings - A study of Compelled Nonuse of Information (CNI) demonstrated the usefulness of RRA in the study of phenomena from an initial "hunch" to a testable hypothesis. As such, the RRA methodology decreases subjectivity and imparts rigor to the study of absent or newly emergent phenomena that have no theoretical basis, no data, and no pre-existing, coherent body of literature.
   Originality/value - This paper presents the philosophy and practice of the RRA methodology and the retroductive philosophical inquiry postulated by Peirce.

AB  - In the present research, we offer a novel method for informing consumers about the sugar content in sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). With a series of experiments, we present evidence that this method curbs preference for SSBs and leads to more negative attitudes toward SSBs. We propose that people view SSBs more negatively and show less preference for SSBs when they are able to concretely visualize the quantity of sugar in SSBs. For example, we suggest that people might have more negative views toward the idea of consuming 28 sugar cubes (concrete information), compared to consuming "70g" of sugar (abstract information). Indeed, we found that, without any intervention, people struggle to convert sugar grams into a concrete, physical sugar representation (Experiment 1). But, when people are provided ways to convert abstract sugar-nutrition information into a concrete representation, they find SSBs less attractive (Experiment 2) and are less likely to select SSBs in favor of sugar-free beverage options (Experiments 3 and 4). These findings offer direct applications to the design of public-health messages and nutrition-education interventions. Such applications might benefit society in its battle with the obesity epidemic. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   Animal encounters have been favourite subjects for a long time and it would scarcely be novel to report such stories for their own sake, even though the ones told here are dramatic enough to stand on their own. The questions addressed in this paper are twofold. The first question is: What influence may particular and dramatic animal encounters have on the human observer and how dependent is such a response on previously held attitudes? This paper provides three cases studies of extraordinary moments that changed the lives of the human participants and turned them into advocates of the species they had encountered. The next question asked is how we can be respectful of animals without anthropomorphising them and study them in ways that help us understand their abilities and their needs rather than impose questions that mean much to the human researcher but could be irrelevant to the species? The examples given here compare and contrast species that are especially close to us (great apes) with studies of those that are distant from us in their evolution (birds) and show how different attitudes change the questions that can be asked by scientists, demonstrably leading to new and even stunning results.
   This paper presents three case studies of exceptional human encounters with animals. These particular examples were selected because they enabled analysis of the underlying reasons that led the human participants to respond in new ways to their animal counterparts. The question asked here is whether sudden insights into the needs and abilities of an animal arises purely from an anthropocentric position as empathy because of genetic closeness (e.g., chimpanzees) or is something else and whether new insights can be applied to other phylogenetic orders not close to us, e.g., birds, and change research questions and implicit prejudices and stereotypes. Particularly in avian species, phylogenetically distant from humans, the prejudices (anthroprocentric position) and the belief in human uniqueness (human exceptionalism) might be greater than in the reactions to primates. Interestingly, in studies of great apes, contradictory opinions and controversies about cognitive abilities, especially when compared with humans, tend to be pronounced. Species appropriateness in test designs are desirable present and future goals but here it is suggested how different experiences can also lead to different questions that explode the myth of human uniqueness and then arrive at entirely different and new results in cognitive and affective abilities of the species under investigation.

AB  - Aim The aims were to (1) describe nurses' attitudes towards their jobs, (2) identify factors that contribute to nurses' job attitudes and (3) examine how nurses' job attitudes affect their ability to perform their jobs. Background Nurses' job attitudes affect their ability to do their jobs well. Methods This was a qualitative descriptive study of 18 semi-structured interviews with nurses who work in rural health facilities. Interviews were analysed using content analysis. Results Factors that influenced job attitudes included support from co-workers, workload, access to material resources, access to information, patient rapport and nurses' personal resilience. Nurses reported that positive attitudes helped them to do their jobs well and negative attitudes diminished their ability to do their jobs well. Conclusions This study's findings support investment in factors to promote positive nurse attitudes and job performance such as a healthy work environment and self-efficacy. Implications for Nursing Management Nurse managers can improve nurses' attitudes by advocating for tangible supports for staff such as appropriate staffing ratios, sufficient equipment, necessary training and work environments that allow safe patient interactions.

AB  - Background: The complexity of modern healthcare increases the risk of adverse events and harms to patients. To prevent errors from occurring, more emphasis should be placed on patient safety education, especially for medical students and trainees.
   Study design: An evidenced-based course on patient safety and medical error was designed. Medical students in a large teaching hospital in Tehran were asked to complete a knowledge, attitudes and skills questionnaire before and after the course. Pretest and posttest scores were compared using t-paired test.
   Results: of the 145 questionnaires, 132 (91%) in pretest and 99 (69%) in posttest were returned. The total knowledge score, 8 items in attitudes section and 3 items in skills section improved significantly following introducing the course. Students were largely satisfied with the course with 72% rated it highly.
   Conclusions: Before attending the course, medical students demonstrated little understanding of the patient safety concept and negative attitudes toward it. The course led to positive changes in final year medical students' knowledge, attitudes and skills.

AB  - Research on sexual and reproductive health including contraception use has predominantly focussed on women's behaviour. Much less is known about men's behaviour. We investigated the links between marriage practices and decision-making about contraception use among young married men in rural Odisha. This cross-sectional study used a mixed methods design. Data were collected through household surveys and in-depth interviews. Study findings revealed that over half of men were ill prepared for marriage and lacked understanding about what it would entail. Familiarity and communication between spouses were higher in self-arranged marriages and this contributed considerably to contraception use, while negative attitudes and lack of access to contraceptive supply and counselling hindered it. Many young men shied away from seeking contraception services at community level since the majority of frontline health workers providing such services were female. Findings reinforce the need for health system change to actively engage and involve young married men in decision-making about contraception use as well as to introduce male frontline health workers who can reach out to young men on SRH issues.

AB  - Limited research has been conducted on the ways in which land agents were involved in the administration and management of poor relief on estates. Literature on the old poor laws has focused on the individuals vested with powers under law to administer poor relief (such as parish officers and magistrates) and literature on land agents has overlooked this role. In order to address this deficiency, this article examines the richly detailed correspondence of William Spencer, who worked in Leicestershire for John Frewen Turner, and his role in the implementation of a deterrent workhouse system in the early nineteenth century. Spencer directed the establishment of the new institution, negotiated between the landowner and key individuals in the community, and gleaned information about poor relief practices in other locations. Spencer also held prejudices against individuals in the community, and reported their resistance to the new workhouse. This case study illustrates some of the ways in which land agents influenced and managed poor relief system in nineteenth-century rural England.

AB  - One of the most important social identities that children learn to define themselves and others by is sex, becoming a salient social category by early childhood. Although older children begin to show greater flexibility in their gendered behaviors and attitudes, gender rigidity intensifies again around the time of puberty. In the current study, we assessed behavioral and neural biases to sex across a wide age group. Ninety-three youth (ages 7-17 years) provided behavioral rating of same-and opposite-sex attitudes, and 52 youth (ages 4-18 years) under-went an fMRI scan as they matched the emotion of same-and opposite-sex faces. We demonstrate significant age-related behavioral biases of sex that are mediated by differential amygdala response to opposite-sex relative to same-sex faces in children, an effect that completely attenuates by the teenage years. Moreover, we find a second peak in amygdala sensitivity to opposite-sex faces around the time of puberty. Thus, the amygdala codes for developmentally dependent and motivationally relevant social identification across development.

AB  - Background: Providing end of life (EOL) care is a component of palliative care but dealing with dying patients and their family members is stressful for the healthcare providers. To prepare them for providing EOL care, the high-fidelity simulation could be used as a pedagogy in which real-life scenarios are used on the computerized manikins mimicking the real patients. Aims: The aim of this study was to measure the effectiveness of high-fidelity simulation to teach EOL care in the palliative nursing course in the undergraduate nursing education program at the School of Nursing and Midwifery at Aga Khan University which is private university in Karachi, Pakistan. Methods: This study was approved by the ethics review committee of Aga Khan University. It was hypothesized that exposure to high-fidelity simulation will lead to an increased positive attitude in participants towards the care of dying. A quasi-experimental design was used. In line with the design, there was no control group. The same group of students (n = 42) were assessed through Frommelt Attitudes Toward Care of the Dying (FATCOD) Part B assessment tool. Permission for using this tool was obtained from Dr. Katherine Frommelt, the author of this tool. Research participants filled this tool before and after the intervention, i.e., providing EOL care to a patient in a high-fidelity simulation lab. Results: Out of 30-FATCOD items, significant attitude change was detected on 11-items of which 8 were positively worded statements and 3 were negatively worded statements. As per the hypothesis, it was expected for the positively worded statements that the mean score for the posttest would be significantly greater than the pretest mean score (pretest score < posttest score). The hypothesis was proved for items 1, 4, 10, 18, 22, 25, 27, and 30 as their t-value was significant at 0.05 alpha value (one-tailed). For the negatively worded statements, it was expected that the mean score for the posttest would be significantly lower than the pretest (pretest score > posttest score). The hypothesis was proved for items 5, 6, and 11 as their t-value was significant at 0.05 alpha value (one-tailed). Conclusion: In this research teaching, EOL care through high-fidelity simulation had improved the attitudes of students toward providing care. This pedagogy also provided the participants with a learning opportunity to deal with their own emotions. These findings provide a way forward for teaching EOL and other complex skills of clinical practice.

AB  - This paper presents the outcomes of an anti-corruption educational intervention among Ukrainian students based on an online experiment. More than 3,000 survey participants were randomly assigned to one of three different videos on corruption and its consequences (treatment groups) or a video on higher education (control group). The data suggest a high level of academic dishonesty and misconduct among young people, but also a negative attitude toward corruption in general, highlighting the ambivalence of corruption in the country. We find that one video, which presented a thrilling story abut a victim of corruption related to common bribery in an accessible way, was effective in promoting awareness of the negative consequences of corruption. In contrast, the other two treatment videos, which more closely followed the style of TV news or documentaries on corruption, did not generally promote negative attitudes toward corruption. Presenting corruption issues in a catchy way therefore appears to matter for the effectiveness of such interventions.

AB  - Ageing anxiety is the expression of peoples' fear of ageing (Lynch, 2000). Despite greater longevity in the population, there is a lack of research into this aspect of life (Lasher & Faulkender, 1993). This research explored fears of ageing across four dimensions: Fear of Old People, Physical Appearance, Psychological Concerns, and Fear of Losses. Three hundred and forty eight participants aged 18-88 participated in an online survey. Findings were: (a) men and women have different fears of ageing; (b) greater quality contact is related to less ageing anxiety; (c) poor health is related to greater ageing anxiety, (d) ageism, defined by Nelson (2005) as prejudice toward ageing is positively correlated with ageing anxiety. The implications of these findings are that better quality contact and more positive attitudes toward ageing are associated with less ageing anxiety. As such, possible key target areas in developing appropriate interventions are provided, with hope to prepare adults of all ages for the inevitablelife is a terminal illness, so enjoy while you can.

AB  - Aim and objectives. To determine the implicit or unconscious attitudes of Nursing and Psychology majors towards overweight individuals in medical and non-medical contexts. Background. Obesity is a leading health concern today, which impacts both physical and psychological health. Overweight individuals confront social biases in many aspects of their lives including health care. Examining the views of Nursing and Psychology students may reveal implicit attitudes towards overweight individuals that may lead to prejudiced behaviours. Design. A mixed design experiment with one between-subjects variable (student major: Nursing or Psychology) and one within-subjects variable (condition: congruent or incongruent) was used to assess implicit attitudes in two convenience samples of Nursing and Psychology students. Methods. A computerised implicit association test was used to determine implicit attitudes towards overweight individuals in medical and non-medical contexts. A total of 90 students from Nursing (n = 45) and Psychology (n = 45) were recruited to complete an implicit association test. Reaction times in milliseconds between the congruent trials (stereotype consistent) and incongruent trials (stereotype inconsistent) were compared with determine adherence to social stereotypes or weight bias. Results. A statistically significant implicit bias towards overweight individuals was detected in both subject groups and in both target settings (medical vs. non-medical). Stronger weight bias was found when the stimulus targets were female than male. Conclusions. Findings from this study expand understanding of the implicit attitudes and social biases of Nursing and Psychology students. The views held by these future healthcare professionals may negatively impact patient care. Relevance to clinical practice. Providing education and support to overweight individuals is central to Nursing practice in a society struggling to manage obesity. Negative stereotypes or beliefs about these individuals may result in poor patient care. Therefore, nurses and other healthcare professionals must be aware of personal biases and work to develop methods to address weight-related issues in a therapeutic manner.

AB  - This paper focuses on the response of the global Anglican Communion to the issue of homosexuality, drawing on case studies of parishes in three different national contexts (UK, USA and South Africa). It traces some of the complex connections (e.g. through flows of money, resources and discourses) between places differently located within this transnational religious network to identify a complex geometry of power. Through its attention to the deployment of racist, disablist, colonial and sexist discourses in debates about homosexuality, this paper contributes to geographies of difference by showing how prejudices can intersect in complex ways to facilitate but also to undo or cancel each other out. The conclusion reflects on issues of authority, the meaning of communion and how local insights might be scaled-up to imagine a practical response to the institutional crisis about homosexuality in the global Anglican Communion. In doing so, the paper contributes to understanding how differences may be reconciled within a transnational religious context.

AB  - When studying sensitive issues, including corruption, prejudice, and sexual behavior, researchers have increasingly relied upon indirect questioning techniques to mitigate such known problems of direct survey questions as underreporting and nonresponse. However, there have been surprisingly few empirical validation studies of these indirect techniques because the information required to verify the resulting estimates is often difficult to access. This article reports findings from the first comprehensive validation study of indirect methods. We estimate whether people voted for an anti-abortion referendum held during the 2011 Mississippi General Election using direct questioning and three popular indirect methods: list experiment, endorsement experiment, and randomized response. We then validate these estimates against the official election outcome. While direct questioning leads to significant underestimation of sensitive votes against the referendum, indirect survey techniques yield estimates much closer to the actual vote count, with endorsement experiment and randomized response yielding the least bias.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate clinical characteristic of girls with Turner syndrome (TS) and to search for associations between phenotype and birth weight or karyotypes. Subjects and methods: Subjects included 60 TS girls underwent growth hormone (GH) stimulation testing for short stature. All patients performed provocative tests with a combination of at least two of the following: arginine, levo-dopa or insulin. Cytogenetic finding, height, weight, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-3, peak GH after stimulation were collected. Results: The mean age at diagnosis was 10.9 +/- 3.5 years. Thirty-one cases had 45,X, which accounted for 51.7% of total group. The patients were divided into two groups by their karyotypes: 45,X group and miscellaneous karyotypes (MK) group. There were no differences in age at diagnosis, weight, body mass index (BMI), height of their parents, incidence of GM deficiency (GHD), birth weight, basal luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone levels, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels between two groups. However, height standard deviation scores (SDS) at diagnosis were -4.13 +/- 1.44, -3.12 +/- 1.3 for 45,X and MK group respectively (P=0.014). The incidence of ovaries absence in 45,X group was higher than MK group (33.3% vs. 12.5%, P=0.046). There was no correlation between height SDS and GH peak values (r=-0.182, P=0.182), IGF-1 (r=-0.075, P=0.583)and IGFBP-3 (r=-0.019, P=0.891). Birth weight was positively related to their height SDS and weight SDS (r=0.364, P=0.007; r=0.378, P=0.005) respectively. There were no correlations between birth weight and BMI, IGF-1 and other indexes. Conclusions: Karyotypes and birth weight have important impact on height SDS in TS girls.

AB  - With the growing concern over climate change and aided by technology development, photovoltaic (PV) installation has risen rapidly in China. Because PV modules are fully packed and the sites for PV installation may be remote from investors, it is difficult for investors to determine the actual quality of PV modules. To simulate the information asymmetry of PV quality and its impacts on market reaction, an agent-based model at social network scale is applied based on the data of Chinese PV market. To mitigate the quality problem while expanding the financing scale for PV projects, two policy options are proposed, including information disclosure and penalties. The simulation results indicate that investors are more sensitive to the negative attitudes of surrounding people, and that raising dividend ratios will drive both defaults and joining ratios higher. We further discuss policy implications of findings to ensure the prosperity of the PV financing market and the high quality of PV systems at the same time.

AB  - This study examines why Americans have positive or negative affect towards the US federal government. Specifically, it draws on existing theoretical and empirical research regarding individual attitudes towards the European Union, examining the effect of ethnocentrism on American attitudes towards the federal government. Relying on this existing research regarding the EU, it is hypothesized that those who are more ethnocentric will be more negative towards the US federal government. To test this expectation, we use longitudinal data from the American National Election Study from 1992 to 2012. We find those who are more ethnocentric are significantly more likely to possess negative attitudes towards the federal government. These findings have important implications for policymaking at both the federal and state levels, as well as party positioning both at the time of and between American elections, and the overall stability of multilevel governance in the United States. Additionally, the findings of this study indicate that theories designed to explain phenomena in the European Union are applicable to the US case.

AB  - In this study, we analyzed the accidents associated with the Asian elephant (Elephas maximus Linnaeus) and issues pertaining to compensation in Xishuangbanna Nature Reserve from 2011 to 2018. We conducted interviews and a questionnaire survey with 217 villagers. The results show that: (1) the main Asian elephants damage is crop loss (more than 95% of the total damage), and the villagers suffer economic losses; (2) through the influence of traditional culture and natural education, the majority of local villagers still have a favorable impression of Asian elephants; (3) female respondents, those engaged in agricultural production, those who had experienced crop loss and those who had never seen Asian elephants had more negative attitudes toward Asian elephants; (4) most villagers believe that the Asian elephant population has increased in the past decade; and (5) the villagers are quite passive in the human-elephant conflict, and most of them do not take action. Finally, based on the research results, this paper discusses the causes of human elephant conflict and proposes targeted mitigation measures.

AB  - The hip-hop culture has evolved from the ghettos of The Bronx, New York in the 1970s, into a global phenomenon. Despite such prominence there is an absence of academic research on the hip-hop culture element: breakdance. Through eight months of participant observations and 17 qualitative interviews, this study investigates the identity construction process among breakdancers with diverse ethnic backgrounds in Norway. The aim is to provide an insight into the lives of young people and their impression management in constructing a breaker identity. The analysis highlights the complex and contested nature of breakdance as it is experienced and viewed by young people performing breakdance in Norway. Through deliberate impression management the breakdancers construct an alternative identity detached from other social categories. As a result, breakdance seems to counter social oppression and to have an empowering and liberating potential different from the common stigmatization and stereotypical prejudices regarding gender and ethnicity that many have experienced.

AB  - With the increase in the number of childcare facilities, childcare providers' coping skills to take quick action in emergencies have become crucial. This study was to examine Korean childcare providers' knowledge, attitudes, concerns, and practices regarding febrile convulsions (FCs), and to identify factors influencing their management of FCs. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a questionnaire of 216 Korean childcare providers. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample characteristics and FC questionnaires. The differences in the FC practice by demographic variables were assessed using t-test and one-way analysis of variance. The relationships between FC practice and other variables were investigated using Pearson correlations and regression analysis. The childcare providers showed unfavorable levels of outcomes regarding FCs with a low percentage of correct answers on FC knowledge and recommended practices as well as negative attitudes and concerns toward FCs. Additionally, results indicated that the knowledge, education, attitudes toward, and actual experiences of FCs were related to FC practices. The current findings provide important evidence to develop interventions targeting childcare providers.

AB  - Nurses have major responsibilities to treat cancer pain in an optimal way. Their knowledge and attitudes are the key to success cancer pain management (CPM) process and impact the outcomes of pain treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes toward CPM among Jordanian nurses working at oncology units. A cross-sectional descriptive design was used to collect data from 135 nurses who were working at four oncology units using Knowledge and Attitudes Survey Regarding Pain. The percentage of correct answers was 51.5% indicating that participants had fair knowledge and attitudes toward CPM. Nurses appeared knowledgeable about CPM guidelines but were unfamiliar regarding pharmacological management and had negative attitudes toward opioids addiction and pain assessment. Significantly, knowledge and attitudes were higher among nurses who had previous education programs (P<.001) and worked in a pain team (P<.001). Therefore, including CPM topics in nursing curricula and postgraduate educational programs is needed. Additionally, initiating pain management teams and using CPM guidelines will contribute to effective treatment of cancer pain.

AB  - We worry about becoming non-existent, but not about coming into being. But both events are similarly bad according to Deprivationism; hence, it seems that we should display symmetric attitudes towards both. This entails the implausible conclusion that we should display negative attitudes towards the time of our birth. In a series of articles Brueckner and Fischer offered one of the most prominent attempts to block this conclusion by appealing to a temporal bias towards future pleasures. Inspired by Yi's criticism of their view, we argue that there is an appropriate sense of deprivation in which late birth can deprive of future pleasures. Hence, Brueckner and Fischer's Temporal Bias does not explain the attitudinal asymmetry. In addition, to make sure that one picks out the appropriate sense of deprivation, we offer a restriction, the Historical Condition, that prevents us from considering that every value one would otherwise have is value that one was deprived of due to one's actual birth/death. Finally, we present a novel account for the attitudinal asymmetry that relies on what we call 'Interests Proximity Bias'.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the oldest infectious diseases that affected humankind. A quintessential social disease, TB remains one of the world's deadliest communicable diseases, with still a high mortality and burden of disease. Social representations of TB focus on aspects associated to feelings and manifestations awakened by the disease, sometimes reinforcing stigmas and prejudices about the way of perceiving TB. TB is a historic disease now reborn with a deeper social stigma. Despite the modest reduction in TB incidence worldwide, its incidence is still rising in certain crisis-affected populations like refugees, and in those bearing high prevalence of HIV, persisting poverty, especially in the developing world. Fear and stigma may appear justified with the increasing rates of multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB, and now extremely drug resistant (XDR) TB. However, stigmatization of TB poses serious obstacles to current TB control efforts, as socio-cultural aspects can influence adherence to TB treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article is a snapshot of the current attitudes manifested by the Romanian Orthodox seminarians towards interdenominational networking from the perspectives of individual interests, cultural representation, and institutional structure. Using the interdenominational networking as a social platform, the article considers the tension between rational choice and structuralism, whereby an Orthodox seminarian navigates between individual interests and institutional constrains; while also instrumentalizing cultural representation. For this purpose, a face-to-face survey was administered to 133 Protestant and Orthodox seminarians in Romania enrolled as fulltime students in the pastoral theology programmes at five theological seminaries. The contribution of this research lies in the fact that the data we collected and analysed serves as a social barometer revealing not only the restrained attitudes of the Romanian Orthodox seminarians towards interdenominational networking, but also their inability to bypass the deep-seated religious prejudice due to indoctrination and competition for credibility.

AB  - Despite the lingering conflict between the government of Vietnam and the Vietnamese diaspora in the United States, issues of remittance and relationship relaxation between the refugees and Vietnamese government happened both in the 1990s. Recent years have seen the attitude-change of the returning diaspora and their shifting strategies of working in Vietnam. This paper describes the first step toward rapprochement between Vietnam and its diaspora in the United States, by analysing the attempts of Vietnam to approach its diaspora in the United States and the reactions of the diasporic community members. On the other hand, it also describes the efforts of Vietnamese Americans to empower Vietnamese people through philanthropic and civic engagement activities. The rapprochement via media and civic engagement reveals a shift from hard, intense ideological conflict to soft tactics in the transnational relation between Vietnam and the Vietnamese diaspora in the United States. This paper concludes that the process to rapprochement is still challenged by the significant differences in political views between the two sides. It suggests that the process of negotiation and conflict resolution be conducted with openness, honesty and acceptance of differences.

AB  - Most readers of the Old Testament know the matriarchs Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, and Leah along with their counterpart patriarchs (Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob). But fewer know the other matriarch, Hagar, the Egyptian, wife of Abraham and mother of Ishmael. If they know her, they often have negative misconceptions about Hagar and Ishmael. But when one reads the stories of Hagar in Genesis 16 and 21 carefully and without modern prejudices, one discovers that Genesis portrays neither Hagar nor Ishmael negatively. In fact, Hagar is exceptional among the matriarchs in that she is actually a Mother Patriarch, being promised multiplied seed (just like the patriarchs Abraham and Isaac) and providing for Ishmael's future as a patriarch would. Her son, Ishmael, mirrors Isaac in numerous ways and, like Jacob, he is the father of twelve princes. Hagar, the ultimate " other" as an Egyptian, is also the ultimate mother. She should be accorded her place as the mother of a nation and, indeed, a patriarch in her own right.

AB  - Background: Malnutrition in older people in hospitals leads to negative patient outcomes. Nurses often underestimate the problem, showing negative attitudes. Aims: To compare nurses' attitudes towards nutritional care of older people in surgical and medical wards. Design: Multicentre cross-sectional survey, conducted in January 2015. Methods: All nurses in surgical and medical wards in 10 hospitals in northern Italy were surveyed using the Staff Attitudes to Nutritional Nursing Care Geriatric Scale (SANN-G scale). Results: 799 out of 1,293 questionnaires were returned (61.8%). 23.2% (185) had a negative attitude, 56.6%(452) had a neutral attitude, and 20.2%(162), positive. Multivariate analysis showed no significant differences between medical and surgical wards (OR = 1.298; CI95% = .883-1.886, p = .18). Conclusions: It is necessary to raise nurses' awareness of poor nutritional care in both settings. More research is needed within the barriers to nutritional care. Impact statement: Strategies such as education and more clearly defined nutritional responsibilities are needed to improve nurses' attitudes.

AB  - In the first two decades of the 21st century, the previous democratization progress was partly reversed. It is well seen in the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe but also in other geographic regions. In search for causes of this warning trend, many authors point out economic factors such as economic stagnation, unemployment, inequality, consequences of the global financial crisis of 2007-2009 and side-effects of globalization. Not negating the role of economic factors, it is important, however, to see noneconomic determinants such as immature political institutions and their dysfunctionality, nationalism and cultural prejudices, and side-effects of the ICT revolution, which destroyed traditional media and public debate. The antidemocratic drift is dangerous not only for political and civil freedom but also has a negative impact on economic governance, making economies less open and competitive and easy victims of oligarchic predation ('crony' capitalism).

AB  - Payments for ecosystem services programs have become common tools but most have failed to achieve wide-ranging conservation outcomes. The capacity for scale and impact increases when PES programs are designed through the lens of the potential participants, yet this has received little attention in research or practice. Our work with small-scale marine fisheries integrates the social science of PES programs and provides a framework for designing programs that focus a priori on scaling. In addition to payments, desirable non monetary program attributes and ecological feedbacks attract a wider range of potential participants into PES programs, including those who have more negative attitudes and lower trust. Designing programs that draw individuals into participating in PES programs is likely the most strategic path to reaching scale. Research should engage in new models of participatory research to understand these dynamics and to design programs that explicitly integrate a broad range of needs, values, and modes of implementation.

AB  - A common reaction experienced by family members of patients with psychosis is grief for the loss of their healthy relative. Importantly, high levels of perceived loss have been related to the manifestation of high expressed emotion (EE), which includes the negative attitudes expressed by relatives toward an ill family member. However, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between relatives' perceived loss and EE attitudes in the early stages of psychosis are still not fully understood. In this regard, attachment theory has been suggested as a useful framework for understanding this link. The current study aimed to examine: (1) whether relatives' perceived loss was associated with relatives' EE dimensions (i.e., criticism and emotional over-involvement (EOI)), and (2) whether such associations were mediated by relatives' attachment dimensions (i.e., anxiety and avoidance). Seventy-eight relatives of patients with early psychosis completed the Mental Illness Version of the Texas Inventory of Grief for the assessment of loss reactions. Attachment dimensions and EE attitudes were assessed by the Psychosis Attachment Measure and the Family Questionnaire, respectively. Findings indicated that relatives' perceived loss was associated with EE dimensions. Relatives' attachment anxiety, but not avoidance, mediated the relationship of perceived loss with both criticism and EOI. Findings highlight the importance of examining the role of relatives' attachment characteristics for understanding how perceptions of loss might impact the manifestation of EE attitudes in the early stages of psychosis. Family interventions aimed at assisting relatives to improve their management of negative emotional reactions to loss are fundamental to prevent impairing loss reactions and the entrenchment of high-EE attitudes.

AB  - Epilepsy is surrounded by prejudice and stigma. Little is known about the perception of stigma by cohabiting relatives (CR) of people with epilepsy (PWE). The study investigated whether the Stigma Scale of Epilepsy (SSE) scores of 90 CR and 148 adult PWE were related to the PWE's clinical aspects and QOLIE-31 at a significance level of p < 0.05. The SSE scores of the CR were equivalent to those of PWE dyads (ICC = 0.385, p = 0.001). Cohabiting relatives of PWE with depressive disorder perceived more stigma (t-test: p = 0.038). Higher perceived stigma by PWE was significantly related to exclusively generalized seizures (p = 0.005), longer disease duration (p = 0.002), and higher perception of stigma by CR in the linear regression model. Both PWE and CR have high perception of stigma, which is related to clinical aspects. Higher perceptions of stigma by PWE and CR are associated with worse QoL in PWE. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This research integrates both motivational and cognitive approaches to better understand consumers' purchase behaviour of energy efficient household appliances in emerging markets. A unique values, knowledge, attitudes and behaviour model was developed, and then validated by obtaining data from Vietnamese consumers which yielded 682 usable responses. The findings confirm that consumers with stronger adherence to egoistic values are more likely to develop negative attitudes towards environmental protection, and they tend to formulate positive attitudes towards individual inconvenience associated with the purchase of energy efficient appliances. In contrast, biospheric and altruistic values facilitate consumers' purchase behaviour by enhancing their attitudes towards environmental protection, and by also reducing their attitudes in relation to individual inconvenience. Interestingly, consumers with high knowledge about energy efficient appliances tend to believe that the purchase of such products is important for environmental protection, and they are likely to negate the perception of inconvenience associated with the purchase. Attitudes were found to be significant determinants of both purchase intention and behaviour. The implications for policymakers, marketers and other stakeholders are discussed and future research directions presented.

AB  - South African law has traditionally denied property sharing rights to people in non-marital intimate partnerships, but a series of new cases has created the possibility of enforcing universal partnership contracts to claim a share in partnership property. However, evidential biases within these progressive cases reflect a historical disdain for women's contributions to relationships and a widespread reluctance to believe women's testimony about the existence of agreements to share. These biases bear strong resemblances to the gender stereotypes which have been the subject of feminist critique in rape law. Central to both rape and universal partnerships is the issue of consent or agreement between men and women. This, in turn, depends on social beliefs about male and female entitlements in the realms of sex and intimate relationships. The paper highlights the commonalities and parallels between the legal treatment of women's evidence about the existence of contracts on the one hand, and the prejudice faced by complainants in rape cases.

AB  - Survey and medical record data from 482 Veterans Affairs (VA) patients who recently received diagnoses of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were examined to determine need and predisposing factors associated with utilization of psychotherapy and counseling. More than half (58%) of participants initiated VA psychotherapy for PTSD within a year of diagnosis. Of those, one third completed eight or more sessions. Roughly two thirds of participants initiated counseling at a Vet Center. Initiating PTSD psychotherapy was associated with greater impairment but not with stigma, concerns about fitting in, or satisfaction with care. The use of Vet Center counseling was associated with desire for help, concerns about fitting in, and satisfaction with care. Unexpectedly, veterans with greater stigma concerns completed more psychotherapy visits and Vet Center counseling. Negative attitudes about mental health treatment did not seem to be substantial barriers to engaging in psychotherapy among these VA patients. Future research should consider enabling treatment system factors in addition to predisposing patient characteristics.

AB  - People who use drugs are a highly stigmatized population. This study explored within-group stigma associated with the use of synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRA) in a sample who accessed a support service in a large city in England. We used semi-structured interviews and a questionnaire that included two measures of stigma adapted for this population. Complete data were obtained from 42 participants (69.0% male, mean age 38.5 years). Increased contact with people who use SCRA (PWUS) was associated with reduced levels of stigma, and while qualitative data mirrored some stigmatizing views found in the wider population, mitigating factors such as the attribution of social and environmental influences on the use of SCRA were identified. While intersectional stigma was identified, for example between SCRA use, homelessness, or street activities such as begging, there was also evidence of mutual support within the service. Participants helped peers who were under the influence of SCRA, suggesting the role of safe environments in reducing harm for PWUS and for those who experience intersectional stigma. Aligned with intergroup contact and attribution theories, findings supported attempts to reduce SCRA-related stigma using peer educators, and the framing of substance use disorders from a viewpoint of social inequalities.

AB  - Little attention has been paid to the importance of the relationship between therapeutic jurisprudence (TJ) and the role of criminal defense lawyers in insanity and incompetency-to-stand-trial (IST) cases. That inattention is especially noteworthy in light of the dismal track record of counsel providing services to defendants who are part of this cohort of incompetency-status-raisers and insanity-defense-pleaders. On one hand, this lack of attention is a surprise as TJ scholars have, in recent years, turned their attention to virtually every other aspect of the legal system. On the other hand, it is not a surprise, given the omnipresence of sanism, an irrational prejudice of the same quality and character of other irrational prejudices that cause (and are reflected in) prevailing social attitudes of racism, sexism, homophobia, and ethnic bigotry, that infects both our jurisprudence and our lawyering practices. Sanism is largely invisible and largely socially acceptable, and is based predominantly upon stereotype, myth, superstition, and deindividualization. It is sustained and perpetuated by our use of alleged "ordinary common sense" (OCS) and heuristic reasoning in an unconscious response to events both in everyday life and in the legal process.
   This paper examines the literature that seeks to apply TJ principles to the criminal law process in general, drawing mostly on the work of Professor David Wexler. It considers why the lack of attention that I have referred to already is surprising (given TJ's mandate and the fact that many TJ issues are inevitably raised in any insanity or IST case). The paper then considers why this lack of attention is not surprising, given the omnipresence of sanism. It will consider some of the actual counseling issues that might arise in these contexts, and offer some suggestions to lawyers representing clients in cases in which mental status issues may be raised. The paper concludes that we must rigorously apply therapeutic jurisprudence principles to these issues, so as to strip away sanist behavior, pretextual reasoning and teleological decision making from the criminal competency and responsibility processes, so as to enable us to confront the pretextual use of social science data in an open and meaningful way. This gambit would also allow us to address-in a more successful way than has ever yet been done-the problems raised by the omnipresence of ineffective counsel in cases involving defendants with mental disabilities.

AB  - Consumer attitudes play an important role in the acceptance of new technologies. The success of food innovations depends on understanding how consumers form and change attitudes toward food technologies. Earlier post hoc explanations suggest that evaluative conditioning can change consumer attitudes toward food technologies. The present study tests how evaluative conditioning can affect consumer acceptance of new food technologies. Furthermore, authors investigate whether evaluative conditioning is resistant to extinction after a two-month period and whether the evaluative conditioning effect prevails in a product-related context. Within an evaluative conditioning paradigm including between-subjects control groups in addition to standard within-subjects control conditions, participants were presented with three food technologies (conventional, enzyme, and genetic technology) paired with affectively positive, neutral, and negative pictures. Subsequent evaluative measurements revealed that evaluative conditioning can explain attitude change toward food technologies when affective pictures are used. Furthermore, results indicate that evaluative conditioning is resistant to extinction after two months and acquired evaluative conditioning effect spills over in a product-related context.

AB  - Access to cesarean delivery is vital for quality obstetrical care, but the procedure can increase maternal mortality, morbidity, and complications in subsequent deliveries. The objective of this study was to describe obstetrician-gynecologists' (OB-GYNs) perspectives on labor and delivery care for Micronesian women in Hawai'i and possible factors contributing to higher cesarean delivery rates among that racial/ethnic group. The Framework Method guided the analysis of 13 semi-structured interviews with OB-GYNs. Study results indicated that OB-GYNs were more likely to attribute racial/ethnic differences in mode of delivery to challenges resulting from nonmedical factors, particularly communication and negative attitudes toward Micronesian patients, than to medical risk factors. In this study, we explored aspects of care that cannot be captured in medical charts or clinical data, but may impact health outcomes for this population. The findings could help improve care for Micronesian women, with lessons applicable to other racial/ethnic minority groups.

AB  - This study examines xenophobic attitudes of secondary school pupils in the Netherlands. This study builds upon a previous research in three ways. First, attitudes of pupils from both the ethnic majority and minority groups are examined. Second, the impact of positive as well as negative inter-ethnic contacts both within and outside the school environment is determined. Finally, hypotheses about inter-ethnic contacts are tested while simultaneously reckoning with alternative mechanisms that might explain xenophobic attitudes. Cross-classified multilevel regression analyses show that the level of xenophobia is lower when pupils evaluate their inter-ethnic contacts as positive, and higher when they perceive these contacts as negative. However, the impact of positive inter-ethnic contact in class disappears or even reverses when multiculturalism is more emphasized during lessons.

AB  - From November 2006 to April 2007, the daytime drama All My Children featured Zoe, the first transitioning transgender character on broadcast television. Acknowledging historical tension within the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) community over transgender acceptance, this study examines how lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) viewers of All My Children reacted to this character. LGB viewers were more likely to dislike the character than non-LGB viewers, yet were also more trans-supportive than non-LGB viewers. Further evaluation suggests LGB viewers' negative response to Zoe was tied not to the transgender status of the character but specifically to unhappiness with a plot development seen to threaten the identity of the lesbian character, Bianca. Applications of social identity theory and implications for community politics are discussed.

AB  - This article tells the empirical story of women from seven villages of Kwale, the most southeastern county in the Coast Province of Kenya that borders with Tanzania -Lunga Lunga, Godo, Perani, Umoja, Maasailand, Mpakani and Jirani- as they searched for community health, equity, gender equality and peace on their own terms. This article shows that creative health initiatives can be successfully used as mechanisms for peace building. Since 2010, the Nikumbuke-Health by All Means (N-HbAM) projects from the University of Madison-Wisconsin in the United States, have trained 57 health promoters and 32 female actors on disease prevention and health promotion that have outreached approximately 120,000 inhabitants around the county enhancing unity in diversity, and breaking down the walls of ethnic hostilities and prejudice. Because of its low cost and high effectivity, the United Nations awarded N-HbAM2 the 2013 Public Service Award as a model of best practice in gender, community development and sustainable wellbeing.

AB  - Does absolute justice exist or not? It may be argued that where absolute justice is impossible to realise, it is only reasonable to expect that the concept of partial or relative justice be invoked. Nursi defines justice either in terms of absolute as opposed to relative, or positive as opposed to negative. In this paper, we explore the binary nature of Nursi's approach to justice, with the aim of elucidating those areas of his thought which have not hitherto been researched. Focusing on the dichotomous nature of justice in Nursian thought may help to sharpen our understanding of existing theories of justice at the very least; it may even force us to rethink our prejudices and give us greater understanding of the concept of justice itself. Particular focus will be on the implications of human free-will for the concept of justice, both in its 'relative' and 'absolute' state. The paper raises questions about the possibility of absolute justice.

AB  - Internalized homonegativity (IH) is the internalization of negative attitudes and assumptions about homosexual people by homosexual people themselves. To measure IH, Smolenski, Diamond, Ross, and Rosser (2010) and Ross, Rosser, and Smolenski (2010) revised the Reactions to Homosexuality Scale (RHS) to develop the Short Internalized Homonegativity Scale (SIHS) with eight items. Using the European Men Who Have Sex With Men Internet Survey (EMIS) data, with an analytic sample of 130,718 gay and bisexual men in 38 European countries, we confirmed the validity of the SIHS scale in both training and validation data, in strata of Ross, Berg, et al.'s (2013) three homosexual discrimination country clusters, of age, and of education level. However, the performance was less adequate in comparison of gay versus bisexually identified individuals. The latent SIHS structure contains only minor variations across these three strata. The seven-item scale performed as well as the eight-item scale. The SIHS is a promising candidate for standard IH measures, which is invariant across cultural, age, and educational strata.

AB  - Introduction. There is an ample evidence of the impact of severe traumatic events, such as sexual abuse in childhood, on the formation of disorders - especially the non-psychotic ones: sexual, neurotic and personality. So far, an increase of the risk with the accumulation of traumatic factors has been indicated, but less attention has been paid to adverse events such as lack of sexual education, negative attitudes of the caregivers towards sexuality, etc.
   Aim. Assessment of the risk of such adverse events in childhood and adolescence, concerning the symptoms from the area of sexuality as well as other neurotic disorders areas.
   Material and method. The coexistence of the earlier life circumstances and currently present symptoms was examined on the basis of KO "0" Symptom Checklist and Life Inventory, completed prior to treatment in a day hospital for neurotic disorders.
   Results. In the group of 2582 females and 1347 males, there was a significant prevalence of symptoms related to sexuality, as well as of other neurotic symptoms. Patients reported traumatic events of varying frequency ( from a relatively rare incest, to much more frequent sense of lack of sex education). Regression analyses showed a significant relationship between the analyzed events and symptoms, for instance, lack of sexual satisfaction in adulthood co-occurred in women with punishing for childhood sexual plays or masturbation. The other analyzed symptoms - 'sexuality-unrelated ', such as panic attacks, were not so clearly related to the burdensome circumstances.
   Conclusions. The presence of adverse life events concerning sexuality, not necessarily the most serious ones e.g. abuses, but such as inadequate sex education, child punishing for masturbation or sexual plays, unwanted sexual initiation, are associated with a higher occurrence of most of the analyzed symptoms in the sphere of sexuality. Weaker connection for other than sexual neurotic symptoms suggests that the impact of childhood sexual trauma is mainly focused on the area of sexual dysfunctions.

AB  - We propose that institutions such as the U.S. Supreme Court can lead individuals to update their perceptions of social norms, in contrast to the mixed evidence on whether institutions shape individuals' personal opinions. We studied reactions to the June 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of same-sex marriage. In a controlled experimental setting, we found that a favorable ruling, when presented as likely, shifted perceived norms and personal attitudes toward increased support for gay marriage and gay people. Next, a five-wave longitudinal time-series study using a sample of 1,063 people found an increase in perceived social norms supporting gay marriage after the ruling but no change in personal attitudes. This pattern was replicated in a separate between-subjects data set. These findings provide the first experimental evidence that an institutional decision can change perceptions of social norms, which have been shown to guide behavior, even when individual opinions are unchanged.

AB  - Social stress resulting from stigma, prejudice, and discriminationminority stressnegatively impacts sexual minority individuals' health and relational well-being. The present study examined how being in a same-sex couple can result in exposure to unique minority stressors not accounted for at the individual level. Relationship timeline interviews were conducted with 120 same-sex couples equally distributed across two study sites (Atlanta and San Francisco), gender (male and female), and relationship duration (at least six months but less than three years, at least three years but less than seven years, and seven or more years). Directed content analyses identified 17 unique couple-level minority stressors experienced within nine distinct social contexts. Analyses also revealed experiences of dyadic minority stress processes (stress discrepancies and stress contagion). These findings can be useful in future efforts to better understand and address the cumulative impact of minority stress on relational well-being and individual health.

AB  - Purpose Australian paramedics regularly encounter patients experiencing mental illness. However, some paramedics hold negative attitudes towards the use of emergency services in providing care for these patients. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to examine the mental health literacy (MHL) of Australian paramedic students, and the training and experiential factors associated with MHL. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional online survey was delivered to paramedic students across Australia. A total of 94 paramedic students completed the survey examining MHL, mental health first aid (MHFA) intentions, confidence in providing help, personal and perceived stigma and willingness to interact with a person experiencing mental illness. Findings Participants generally had poor MHFA intentions in spite of good recognition of mental health disorders and good knowledge about mental health. Participants also demonstrated low stigmatising attitudes towards mental illness; however, they expressed a lack of willingness to interact with a person experiencing mental illness. Originality/value Our findings propose a combination of work-based experience and specific MHFA training may be beneficial to paramedic students to improve care for patients experiencing mental illness.

AB  - When do people find ambiguity intolerable, and how might this manifest in the workplace where roles, guidelines and expectations can be made to be more or less ambiguous? Compensatory Control Theory (CCT; Kay, Gaucher, Napier, Callan, & Laurin, 2008) suggests a potential driver: perceived control. Recent CCT theory (Landau, Kay, & Whitson, 2015) has posited that people with chronically lower levels of perceived control may be especially likely to seek coherent and structured environments. Given that ambiguous workplace situations - such as flexible roles and titles, or loose guidelines and expectations - necessarily represent a lack of structure, these types of situations may therefore be especially aversive to those lower in perceived control. Four studies support this prediction. Specifically, we observe that low perceived control (both measured or manipulated) predicts greater ambiguity intolerance as well as greater negative attitudes towards ambiguous situations (Studies 1, 2 and 3), but not other types of problematic workplace situations (Study 1), and that this process can exert important downstream consequences, ranging from behavioral intentions to perceived self-efficacy (Study 4).

AB  - Background:
   ADHD predicts higher levels of antisocial behaviour and distress while religiosity is related to lower levels of both. This raises the hitherto unexplored question of how these variables interact.
   Aims:
   The objective of this study was to explore how religious individuals with ADHD fare in terms of these psychosocial outcomes.
   Method:
   806 secular, religious and Ultra-Orthodox Jewish adults in Israel completed measures of ADHD symptoms and treatment, emotional strengths and difficulties, religious belonging, religious behaviour and antisocial behaviour.
   Results:
   Findings supported an additive-interactive model in which religiosity (a) correlates with lower levels of ADHD symptoms and diagnosis, (b) directly relates to less antisocial behaviour and less distress and (c) moderates the negative effects of ADHD on antisocial behaviour and distress. Findings further suggest that religious observance rather than religious belonging drives most of the moderating effect of religiosity, while religious belonging rather than religious observance drives negative attitudes towards ADHD.
   Conclusions:
   Implications include the importance of treating religious individuals with ADHD in a more nuanced manner and of providing more information on ADHD to religious communities.

AB  - Background and purpose: The majority of available studies in distance learning in nursing and health lack the sufficient details of course design and delivery processes which greatly affect the learning outcomes. Also, little is available about the fairness of this method of education to students with limited access to course resources. We describe the design and delivery processes and experience, in terms of satisfaction and achievement, of undergraduate nursing students in a distance course. The difference in achievement between the distance students and a comparable cohort of hybrid students is also examined. We also demonstrate the possibility of providing accessible education to students with limited technological resources.
   Methods: Participants included all undergraduate nursing students who were enrolled in a distance and a hybrid section of a communication skills course offered at a School of Nursing in Jordan. The distance course was created using Blackboard and Tegrity learning management systems. The design and delivery processes of the distance course incorporated three pedagogical principles that enhance: (a) course access and navigation; (b) communication and interaction; and (c) active and collaborative learning experiences. After course completion, distance students completed a 27-item satisfaction questionnaire. Achievement in the course and correlates of satisfaction were measured.
   Results: The final sample included 25 students in the distance section and 35 in the hybrid section (N = 60). The mean score of overall satisfaction in the distance section was 4.14 (0.32) out of a 5-point scale, indicating a high satisfaction. Results revealed significant associations between total satisfaction score and achievement in the distance course, grade expected in the course, and frequency of accessing the course materials (p < .05). All distance students, including students with limited technological resources available at home, managed to successfully complete the course. Major concerns reported by distance students were related to lack of time management skills and negative attitudes toward group assignments. The mean final course grade of the distance section (80 +/- 8.2) was significantly higher than the hybrid section (72.2 +/- 9.5), (t = 3.5, p < .05).
   Conclusions: The use of effective instructional strategies resulted in delivering successful distance learning, even for students with limited resources. Institutions have to make strategic decisions on how to optimize the use of technology to fit their individualized learning environments. Instructors need to become familiar with the characteristics of students cohort served by the course and design the course accordingly. In addition, students should be guided on how to manage their time in distance learning environments and work effectively in group assignments. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article examines the women's suffrage movement and other aspects of the first-wave women's movement through the lives and writing of two of the best-known Canadian suffragists: Nellie McClung (1873-1951) in Manitoba, Therese Casgrain (1896-1981) in Quebec. After a general introduction and some biography of each, we look more closely at stories McClung and Casgrain related about their activism in their autobiographies: McClung's Clearing in the West (1935) and The Stream Runs Fast (1945), and Casgrain's A Woman in a Man's World (1972) (Une Femme Chez les Hommes (1971)). Despite significant regional and cultural differences between these two figures, we find a number of striking commonalities, particularly in the strategies both used to battle the prejudice and entrenched conservatism of their place and time. This comparative analysis of McClung and Casgrain offers a cross-cultural case study of women's suffrage and related reform movements in English and French Canada in the early- to mid-twentieth century as well as a glimpse across Canada's fabled two solitudes.

AB  - This study analyzed gender differences in exposure to family violence in Serbia and its association with health symptoms. Using data from the National Health Survey 2006 in Serbia, univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were run to examine the association between exposure to physical violence in the family (in the past 12 months) and the occurrence of 15 different health symptoms (in the past 4 weeks). Out of 12,646 interviewed adults (older than 20), women reported experiencing family violence nearly 1.7 times more often than men (1.28 % vs. 0.75 %). Women had nine health symptoms significantly associated with experienced violence, while men had four, even after controlling for socio-demographic characteristics. Depression and insomnia were common for both genders. Results suggest that physicians should pay attention to health complaints, consider family violence as an associated factor, and address violence in a gender sensitive way that is free of prejudice and preconceptions.

AB  - Higher education students experience high rates of negative emotions such as stress, anxiety, and depression. Although emotions are known to influence attitudes per se, previous research has not examined how emotionality may relate to attitudes toward plagiarism. This study sought to examine how positive and negative emotionality relates to students' positive attitudes, negative attitudes, and subjective norms concerning plagiarism. University students (N = 685) completed the Attitudes Toward Plagiarism questionnaire and measures of anxiety, stress, depression, and negative and positive affect. Extending on previous research, it was found that a lack of positive affect and negative emotionality, specifically stress, were significant predictors of attitudes toward plagiarism. Emotionality predicted 8.9% and 10% of the variance in positive plagiarism attitudes and subjective norms, respectively. Interestingly, gender was unable to predict subjective norms relating to plagiarism. Support for negative and positive emotionality predicting attitudes toward plagiarism challenges the assumption that emotions do not predict attitudes within the plagiarism context. These findings are practically relevant, as they highlight the necessity of implementing interventions directly targeting mental health within the higher education setting.

AB  - Second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) align well with positive psychology philosophy and practices, but trials of SG-MBIs have largely focused on ill-being. This study developed a mindfulness-based positive psychology (MBPP) intervention integrating positive psychology with an SG-MBI to enhance well-being. A randomized control trial was performed to compare MBPP with a waitlist condition among 138 Chinese participants. The results showed that MBPP significantly reduced negative emotions for subjective well-being and significantly improved environmental mastery for psychological well-being. Improvements in self-compassion and negative attitudes but not avoidance, mediated changes in well-being. Changes in positive emotions, positive relations, and awareness were associated with the amount of meditation practice. These findings showed that MBPP is promising for improving well-being and that the positive psychology components play important roles. Broadly, the study illustrated that positive psychology and SG-MBIs can be effectively integrated, and it supported the further application of SG-MBIs from the positive psychology perspective.

AB  - Exclusionary attitudes-prejudice toward outgroups and opposition to policies that promote their well-being-are presenting challenges to democratic societies worldwide. Drawing on insights from psychology, we argue that non-judgmentally exchanging narratives in interpersonal conversations can facilitate durable reductions in exclusionary attitudes. We support this argument with evidence from three pre-registered field experiments targeting exclusionary attitudes toward unauthorized immigrants and transgender people. In these experiments, 230 canvassers conversed with 6,869 voters across 7 US locations. In Experiment 1, face-to-face conversations deploying arguments alone had no effects on voters' exclusionary immigration policy or prejudicial attitudes, but otherwise identical conversations also including the non-judgmental exchange of narratives durably reduced exclusionary attitudes for at least four months (d = 0.08). Experiments 2 and 3, targeting transphobia, replicate these findings and support the scalability of this strategy (ds = 0.08, 0.04). Non-judgmentally exchanging narratives can help overcome the resistance to persuasion often encountered in discussions of these contentious topics.

TI  - Losing a Generation The Impact of COVID-19 on Older Americans
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHOSOCIAL NURSING AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES
LA  - English
AB  - DAs COVID-19 is killing untold numbers of older adults around the world, it is important to reflect on the loss of this generation. Approximately eight in 10 deaths were in people aged >= 65 years. This is a devastating loss to our society-losses that will last long after the pandemic has run its course. Lockdowns and visitor restrictions that were meant to protect older adults created an isolation that often led to declining health. Ageist stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination are internalized by older adults as they face being devalued and viewed as a burden. Reflecting on what has been lost with the deaths of so many from this older generation can spur us to think about how society failed to protect them and to find ways to move beyond the stigma attached to being old. We have much to learn from this generation.

AB  - Recent media accounts have highlighted issues of use and abuse of police force and policing practices targeted at ethnic minorities within inner city areas. To date, little research has focussed specifically on the experiences and perceptions of youth gang members in dealing with police. Using data from 253 in-depth interviews with ethnic minority San Francisco-based youth gang members, we examine perceptions of respectful and disrespectful police behaviour. Premised on a procedural justice model, we explore how frequently disrespectful police behaviour is reported and how these negative experiences shape gang members' attitudes towards the police more generally. We refine our investigation by comparing adverse encounters to examples in which gang members are treated respectfully. Using a data-driven inductive and qualitative theory testing deductive approach, our data revealed that male and female gang members regularly experience disrespectful police behaviour in terms of physical and verbal abuse. Our findings indicate that these exchanges contribute to negative attitudes, fear and distrust of police, while respectful interactions are meaningful and can contribute to positive attitudes towards officers.

AB  - One of the most promising directions for reducing mental illness stigma lies in Allport's contact theory, which suggests that intergroup interactions reduce stigma. Here, we argue that stigmatizing attitudes are driven by the nature, magnitude, and valence of community-based ties to people with mental illness (PMI), not simply their presence. Using the 2018 General Social Survey (N = 1,113), we compare network-based measures of contact to traditional survey indicators. We find that knowing someone with mental illness, or even number of people known, explains little about desire for social distance, perceptions of dangerousness, or endorsement of treatment coercion. However, having stronger relationships with more PMI, having more friends and family (but not more peripheral ties) with mental illness, and knowing people in treatment are associated with less stigma endorsement. In contrast, we find that exposure to PMI who are perceived as dangerous is associated with greater levels of stigma.

AB  - Obesity is a complex medical condition, influenced by several factors. Weight bias refers to pervasive negative weight-related attitudes or beliefs, expressed as stereotypes, prejudice, and even open discrimination toward individuals because they have obesity. Obesity increases the risk of acquiring a wide range of associated diseases, as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. This chronic disease can also impair a person's well-being and quality of life. Nevertheless, the media, public, and even healthcare providers, including doctors, focus overwhelmingly on the contribution of individual choices and responsibility. The widely held assumptions are that individuals with obesity do not have self-control, don't "eat wisely," or do not want to be healthier. These assumptions are inherently linked to stereotypes and are likely to exacerbate stigmatizing attitudes towards people with obesity. Even with the growing incidence and prevalence of obesity worldwide, weight stigmatization did not recede.

AB  - Researchers explored the factor structure of Park's Heterosexism Scale (2001) with heterosexual parents of lesbian, gay, or bisexual sons or daughters. Results suggested a two-factor solution, but results varied from Park's two-factor model. Additionally, relations between the Heterosexism Scale subscales and measures of cognitive flexibility, religious commitment, and general family functioning were examined. Implications for clinical practice and future research are discussed.

AB  - PURPOSE: Firefighters are exposed to high physical and psychological occupational factors while providing an essential service to our communities. Female firefighters represent a minority group in this male dominated occupation. The purpose of this study was to qualitatively determine the impact of a male dominated, physically demanding occupation on women's work health and job satisfaction through the experiences of female firefighters.
   METHODS: A phenomenological approach was used to collect data through semi-structured, recorded interviews with female firefighters. The recorded interviews were transcribed into text and inductive thematic analysis was used to qualitatively analyze the transcripts.
   RESULTS: Review and analysis of the participant responses identified seven themes: physical demands/difficulties, gender related physiological differences, compensatory strategies, equipment mal-adaptation, earning respect, negative attitudes of male counterparts: impact on social inclusion and health behaviors, recognition of injury risk.
   CONCLUSION: Female firefighters are exposed to increased risk of injury due to the psychological and physical occupational stressors in firefighting. Implications of this research are provided and include recommendations for future research to target the physical and psychosocial aspects of firefighting.

AB  - Indian English Fiction has mostly portrayed Dalit characters from a humanist perspective. Manu Joseph's debut novel Serious Men (2010) departs from such a convention by deploying sexist language to render subversive authority to the Dalit protagonist, Ayyan Mani. While Serious Men (2010) revises the passive depiction of Dalits in Indian English Fiction through its experimental usage of language, its subversion is undermined by its representation of women and lower-caste politics. This article is interested in exploring the intersections between language politics and the politics of caste in the novel, since it seems subversive in expressing the rant of an angry Dalit man, yet it also nevertheless reflects the overt sexualization of urban, upper-caste women. By interrogating the novel's politics of Dalit representation and its critical reception, the article argues how despite satirizing casteist attitudes through the eyes of the Dalit protagonist, the novel inevitably undermines its critique of caste structures through its prejudiced portrayal of women and caste politics.

AB  - This study demonstrates how communication research can be strategically applied to address environmental problems in modern societies. To accomplish this goal, this research advances an integrated communication model based on psychological reactance theory and the theory of planned behavior to explain negative attitude change that can occur when people are exposed to water conservation campaigns [Liang, Y. J., Henderson, L.K., & Kee, K. F. (2017). Running out of water! Developing a message typology and evaluating message effects on attitude toward water conservation. Environmental Communication. doi:10.1080/17524032.2017.1288648]. The data fit the hypothesized model, synthesizing message-, social-, and individual-based processes to predict their effects on behavioral intention towards water conservation. Interestingly, data show that (1) combinations of message strategies affect reactance differently, and (2) subjective norm and perceived behavioral control negatively correlated with threat to freedom. These results point to the practical implication that environmental communication to promote voluntary water conservation are effective when campaign messages are designed to reduce threat to freedom, induce social norms, and increase self-efficacy. We call the documented research process strategic environmental communication, which focuses on the joint application of evidence and theory towards addressing environmentally motivated problems.

AB  - HIV stigma is a pressing concern for people living with HIV, and particularly when it is perpetuated by health care providers, as it may affect quality of life and access to health care services. The current study describes the development and initial validation of a contextually appropriate HIV stigma scale for health care providers in North America. A ground-up qualitative approach was used to develop the scale, and it was assessed psychometrically with health care trainees across Canada. The measure demonstrates excellent internal consistency reliability and test-retest reliability, as well as convergent and divergent validity. The study supports a tripartite model of HIV stigma consisting of stereotyping, prejudice and discrimination. The scale provides a new tool to assess HIV stigma in health care providers and can be used to inform training, intervention and self-evaluation of stigmatizing attitudes, beliefs and behaviors among providers.

AB  - Research on fathers has increased substantially over the last several decades, but research comparing the gender-typed characteristics and gender role attitudes of stay-at-home and employed fathers is still in its infancy. Stay-at-home (n = 35) and employed (n = 49) fathers completed measures on gender-typed characteristics and gender role attitudes. Stay-at-home fathers also rated the importance of various reasons they stayed home. Compared to employed fathers, stay-at-home fathers reported similar levels of traditional feminine and masculine characteristics, but less traditional gender role attitudes. Wanting to be a stay-at-home father was rated the most important reason for staying home. The more important the female partner was in influencing the decision to stay home, the lower the levels of masculine characteristics and the more enjoyment men reported in being a stay-at-home father. Future research should focus on comparisons of paternal involvement in stay-at-home and other fathers, the reasons men decide to become or not to become stay-at-home fathers, and the factors that influence those reasons, such as their partners' attitudes and experiences with prejudice and discrimination.

AB  - This paper aims to deepen our understanding of the social and historic dimension of the Wesleyan Mission Station, Plaatberg, located in the Free State province of South Africa. It argues that the footprint of the mission station, exposed during an archaeological study of this landscape, lays bare the individual, as well as the general Methodist philosophy and political ideals. By placing acts of enclosure at the centre of the study it forefronts the missionary mind-set, and the desire to emulate a European social landscape. The paper also reflects on how, within the context of the broader imperial campaign, the Methodists' ideal becomes a fleeting reality, but also how the mirage of a colonial town and country rapidly dissolved as the British withdrew from the Orange River Sovereignty. Finally, the paper considers the role of the boundary walls in the landscape, the region's shifting political borders and the less tangible boundaries of prejudice that conferred obligations, responsibilities and expectations on the people who lived at Plaatberg.

AB  - Studies have shown that attitudes about gender roles and attitudes about sexuality are often intertwined. Heterosexual individuals expressing more traditional gender role attitudes, for example, tend to be less tolerant towards sexual minorities. Research examining sexual minorities' attitudes toward gender roles, however, is comparatively sparse. This study utilizes a nationally representative survey to compare the gender role attitudes of heterosexual individuals to gay or lesbian and bisexual individuals. We examine overall differences and gender-specific differences between sexual identity groups. Our analysis shows that, when it comes to household and family roles, both gay men and lesbian women are more likely than their heterosexual peers to reject traditional gender roles. This is partly a function of differences in political and religious ideology across the sexual identity groups. However, when it comes to gender roles in the public sphere, specifically the suitability of women for political office, gay men's opinions do not differ from the opinions of their heterosexual counterparts.

AB  - Background: Mental health care providers commonly encounter suicide ideation and suicidal behaviors among their patients despite a frequent lack of adequate knowledge and competence regarding suicide risk management. Aims: This study examined the associations among self-perceived sufficiency of training, self-efficacy, anxiety, and attitudes related to working with suicidal individuals. Method: Participants were 289 mental health care providers who completed a self-report survey. Results: Path analysis results indicated that perceived sufficiency of training was indirectly associated with negative attitudes (i.e., avoidance and discomfort) and cognitive and somatic anxiety about working with suicidal individuals through assessment self-efficacy. Limitations: The current study utilized cross-sectional data, and there were occupational heterogeneity and geographical homogeneity among the mental health care providers sampled. Conclusion: These findings suggest that sufficient suicide-related training focused on risk assessment may decrease mental health professionals' negative and anxious reactions toward suicidal individuals and enhance confidence in suicide risk management.

AB  - We survey the job situation of women in astronomy in Germany and of German women abroad and review indicators for their career development. Our sample includes women astronomers from all academic levels from doctoral students to professors, as well as female astronomers who have left the field. We find that networking and human support are among the most important factors for success. Experience shows that students should carefully choose their supervisor and collect practical knowledge abroad. We reflect the private situation of female German astronomers and find that prejudices are abundant, and are perceived as discriminating. We identify reasons why women are more likely than men to quit astronomy after they obtain their PhD degree. We give recommendations to young students on what to pay attention to in order tobe on the successful path in astronomy ((c) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim)

AB  - In this article, I describe how psychologists who work with language-in particular, naturally occurring social interaction-can develop evidence-based communication training for professionals. I start by situating my research in discursive psychology and conversation analysis and explaining some points of (dis)connection between mainstream and qualitative/critical psychology that nevertheless enable practical application and impact. I explain how I developed the Conversation Analytic Role-Play Method (CARM), which analyzes interaction "in the wild" in diverse institutional settings to explore what constitutes effective practice. Drawing on police crisis negotiation and community mediation intake telephone calls, I show how psychological matters (e.g., identity, prejudice) are relevant to and affect the progress and outcome of encounters. I explain how these data and findings, rather than hypothetical cases and simulations, have been used in workshops with practitioners. Overall, the article makes the case for discursive psychology and conversation analysis to provide rigorous, empirically grounded communication training with integrity.

AB  - Polynczuk-Alenius's article contributes to a better understanding of the racist moment in Poland that began in the aftermath of the 'refugee crisis' in 2015. It does so by zooming in on Christian far-right discourse and reconstructing a cognitive map of the social world manufactured therein. To this end, it analyses the blog of the former Catholic priest Jacek Miedlar, now a far-right activist and one of the leaders of the anti-refugee movement. In doing so, the article relies on two compatible bodies of research that have rarely been used together. Theoretically, the article approaches Christian far-right discourse as an articulation of the paranoid style and concentrates on its conspiratorial aspect. Analytically, it uses the fourfold model of authoritarian communication developed by the Frankfurt School to dissect systematically the conspiratorial tale expounded on Miedlar's blog. Accordingly, the empirical analysis of 116 blog posts treats the following themes: 1) the discontent diagnosed by Miedlar (anti-Polonism, epitomized by the suppression of nationalist and Christian values in favour of European universalism); 2) the alleged operators of anti-Polonism (the Jewish-orchestrated conspiracy bent on dominating the world and its puppets); 3) the movement that will rise up against this cabal (namely, the Polish Catholic nationalists armed with conservative values); and 4) the leader of the struggle (Miedlar himself as a Christ-like martyr figure). The article concludes that the anti-Muslim discourse, premised on an appeal to racist sentiments, served as a gateway into the conspiratorial, deeply antisemitic world-view of the Christian far-right milieu. In Poland, as elsewhere, such a world-view, stored and transmitted through the fringe far-right discourse, usually seems to gain traction in wider society during times of crisis.

AB  - Marchi examines how the French Nouvelle Droite (ND) was introduced into Portugal at the end of the Salazarist regime and during the transition to democracy. The relevance of the Portuguese case lies in the fact that the early diffusion of the ND in Europe coincided with the profound crisis of the radical right in Portugal as it faced the liberalization of the authoritarian regime and repression during the revolutionary transition. For that reason the far right in Portugal, in comparative terms, can be seen to have been subject to historical constraints quite different from those in Spain and other Western European democracies. Marchi describes the groups on the Portuguese radical right, and certain figures who were inspired by the ND and disseminated its ideas in Portugal. His analysis of their main publications, their statements and the media campaign to promote the ND from the end of the 1960s to the beginning of the 1980s highlights the different reasons for and ways in which Portuguese radicals engaged and dealt with the ND. Marchi also looks at the reactions of the national right-wing milieu to the spread of ND ideas. As part of his paper's contribution to comparative studies on the transnational radical right, it also provides new evidence, derived from the Portuguese case, of the way in which one of the most important schools of right-wing thought at the end of the twentieth century has influenced extreme-right milieux all over Europe. In light of Tamir Bar-On's analysis of the ND's cultural and pan-European impact, the findings presented here confirm its transnational character while drawing on this and other cases from southern Europe to question the French movement's long-term effectiveness in reorienting the culture of the right-wing milieu.

AB  - Objectives: Advance care planning (ACP) enables people to define goals and preferences for future medical treatment and care. Despite universal recognition of the importance of ACP for people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) internationally, there is little support for its implementation in China. The viewpoint of family caregivers is crucial in making clinical decisions about AD. Therefore, it's critical to understand the family caregivers' perspectives on ACP in order to promote its practice among people with AD in China.
   Methods: Seventeen family caregivers of people with AD were purposively selected in three communities in Guangzhou. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to collect data and the data were analyzed using the thematic analysis.
   Results: Three main themes were extracted: (1) Attitudes toward ACP including positive and negative attitudes; (2) Social pressure influencing ACP decision; (3) Behavioral willingness of the implementation of ACP.
   Conclusions: Attitudes, social pressure, and behavioral willingness characterized the behavioral intentions of family caregivers of people with Alzheimer's disease. It is recommended to strengthen efforts to publicity of advance care planning and promote legislation in China.

AB  - There is limited knowledge about cancer patients' experiences of uncertainty while waiting for genome sequencing results, and whether prolonged uncertainty contributes to psychological factors in this context. To investigate uncertainty in patients with a cancer of likely hereditary origin while waiting for genome sequencing results, we collected questionnaire and interview data at baseline, and at three and 12 months follow up (prior to receiving results). Participants (N = 353) had negative attitudes towards uncertainty (M = 4.03, SD 0.68) at baseline, and low levels of uncertainty at three (M = 8.23, SD 7.37) and 12 months (M = 7.95, SD 7.64). Uncertainty about genome sequencing did not change significantly over time [t(210) = 0.660, p = 0.510]. Greater perceived susceptibility for cancer [r(348) = 0.14, p < 0.01], fear of cancer recurrence [r(348) = 0.19, p < 0.01], perceived importance of genome sequencing [r(350) = 0.24, p < 0.01], intention to change behavior if a gene variant indicating risk is found [r(349) = 0.29, p < 0.01], perceived ability to cope with results [r(349) = 0.36, p < 0.01], and satisfaction with decision to have genome sequencing [r(350) = 0.52, p < 0.01] were significantly correlated with negative attitudes towards uncertainty at baseline. Multiple primary cancer diagnoses [B = -2.364 [-4.238, -0.491], p = 0.014], lower perceived ability to cope with results [B = -0.1.881 [-3.403, -0.359], p = 0.016] at baseline, greater anxiety about genome sequencing (avoidance) [B = 0.347 [0.148, 0.546], p = 0.0012] at 3 months, and greater perceived uncertainty about genome sequencing [B = 0.494 [0.267, 0.721] p = 0.000] at 3 months significantly predicted greater perceived uncertainty about genome sequencing at 12 months. Greater perceived uncertainty about genome sequencing at 3 months significantly predicted greater anxiety (avoidance) about genome sequencing at 12 months [B = 0.291 [0.072, 0.509], p = 0.009]. Semi-structured interviews revealed that while participants were motivated to pursue genome sequencing as a strategy to reduce their illness and risk uncertainty, genome sequencing generated additional practical, scientific and personal uncertainties. Some uncertainties were consistently discussed over the 12 months, while others emerged over time. Similarly, some uncertainty coping strategies were consistent over time, while others emerged while patients waited for their genome sequencing results. This study demonstrates the complexity of uncertainty generated by genome sequencing for cancer patients and provides further support for the inter-relationship between uncertainty and anxiety. Helping patients manage their uncertainty may ameliorate psychological morbidity.

AB  - Objective: To understand the daily lives of people with Parkinson's disease. Method: Qualitative research, using as methodological and theoretical referential the Grounded Theory and Symbolic Interactionism, respectively. The in-depth interview was conducted with 30 people with Parkinson's disease. Results: From data analysis, three themes were selected: Living with the disease - living with the treatment and changes in lifestyle; Modifying of one's job performance - revealing incapacity for work and the need to anticipate retirement and; Living with the stigma - the feeling of prejudice against the disease and the perceived limitations of the health services. Final considerations: Living with a chronic and non-transferable disease encompasses social, physic al and cultural effects, along with the personal experiences of each unique individual. This study assists the improvement of care to people with the disease, because the care practice emerges from the interactions between the subjects.

AB  - Timely and appropriate pain management in the pre-hospital environment is paramount to effective patient care. Experts agree that there are many factors that hinder the delivery of adequate pain management to patients with pain. The purpose of this study was to use the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) model to identify the factors influencing Ambulance Paramedics' intention to administer morphine to patients with pain. Participants of this study were Advanced Care and Intensive Care Paramedics who were deemed competent in morphine administration. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire that used the constructs of the TPB, including subjective norm, perceived behavioural control and attitude. Whilst participants reported strong intentions to administer morphine they also reported negative attitudes towards the behaviour. The constructs of the TPB explained 26% of the variance in intention to administer morphine with subjective norm being the strongest significant predictor. The findings related to specific attitudes and normative pressures provide an understanding into Paramedic's pain management behaviour. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - People from marginalized groups are often discriminated against in traditional recruitment processes. Yet as companies faced with skill shortages change their recruitment strategies, the question arises as to whether modern recruitment trends such as the use of professional social network sites, active sourcing, and recruitment assignment to external agencies are affected by implicit or explicit discrimination. In our mixed-method study, we first conducted expert interviews with different types of recruiters to explore the potential for discrimination in the modern recruitment process. We then analyzed panel data from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) in Germany to see whether there is quantitative evidence of discrimination in modern recruitment. A content analysis of the interviews shows that active sourcing and assignment of recruitment to private agencies are potentially affected by explicit discrimination. We identified three sources of discrimination in personnel selection: recruiters' own attitudes, explicit instructions from managers, and the recruiters' assumptions regarding companies' preferred candidates. The results of mixed multilevel analyses with the company as a second level resonate with the qualitative findings: companies actively approach female employees, older employees, and employees who are born in Southern/Eastern Europe less often and offer women jobs less often. The effects for gender were still significant when we included far-right voting as a moderator variable on the employee level, but the interactions were not significant. Effects for gender and older people in active sourcing were also significant and robust when controlling for income, number of children, level of school completion, and educational background. Our findings suggest that current legislation may be insufficient to protect candidates who belong to marginalized groups from discrimination in modern recruitment.</p>

AB  - Two studies investigate the relationship between racial attitude (dis)similarity and interpersonal liking for racial minorities and Whites in same-race and cross-race pairs. In nationally representative and local samples, minorities report personally caring about racial issues more than Whites do (Pilot Study), which we theorize makes racial attitude divergence with ingroup members especially disruptive. Both established friendships (Study 1) and face-to-face interactions among strangers (Study 2) provided evidence for the dissimilarity-repulsion hypothesis in same-race interactions for minorities but not Whites. For minorities, disagreeing with a minority partner or friend about racial attitudes decreased their positivity toward that person. Because minorities typically report caring about race more than Whites, same-race friendships involving shared racial attitudes may be particularly critical sources of social support for them, particularly in predominately White contexts. Understanding challenges that arise in same-race interactions, not just cross-race interactions, can help create environments in which same-race minority friendships flourish.

AB  - Despite the direct connection between anal sex and pleasure, the majority of academic literature frames anal sex in terms of homophobia and/or disease. In the large body of literature on anal sex, only two academic articles have been published on anoreceptive heterosexual males (ARHMs), despite evidence of this type of sexuality dating back to Ancient Egypt and Greece. A review of the literature suggests that the lack of empirical research on ARHMs is due to compulsory heteronormativity, which can instill sexual shame in those with nonconforming sexual preferences. Some ARHMs are BDSM-oriented, and given that BDSM behavior and identity are also stigmatized, BDSM-oriented ARHMs have an additional concealable status that is subject to prejudice. Skills such as higher level communication and self-reflection often inform BDSM interactions and relationship structures, therefore, BDSM-oriented ARHMs may have more opportunity to develop skills to offset shame and stigma, and may take pride as well as pleasure in subverting traditionally heteronormative anoreception roles.

AB  - Social psychological research on multiculturalism has mostly looked at recognition of differences and much less at equitable participation. The present study investigated adolescents' fairness judgements of three democratic decision-making procedures (representative democracy, equal group representation, and proportional group representation) and one nondemocratic procedure (cultural group oligarchy) among Hindu (N = 844), Muslim (N = 630) and Creole (N = 310) adolescents in Mauritius. We examined these judgements in two different contexts (i.e. school and national), and in relation to ethnic group identification, age and gender. Results show that representative democracy was viewed as the fairest decision-making procedure and cultural group oligarchy as the most unfair one. The group representation procedures were judged as relatively unfair although there were significant differences by ethnic group, age and gender. Strength of ethnic identification was linked to higher fairness ratings of democratic group representation procedures. The results are discussed in terms of morality, group positions and ideological representations of the Mauritian nation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The population of older adults in the United States is growing in size and diversity, presenting challenges to health care providers and patients in the context of health care decision making (DM), including obtaining informed consent for treatment, advance care planning, and deliberations about end-of-life care options. Although existing literature addresses providers' need to attend to patients' cultural values and beliefs on these issues, less attention has been paid to how the corresponding values and beliefs of providers color the care they deliver and their assessments of older adults' DM capacity. The provider's challenge is to understand her own unacknowledged anxieties, prejudices, and fears around such charged issues as truth telling, individual agency, capacity, death and dying, and the value of life itself and address their impact on the delivery of care. A social constructivist perspective and the clinical concept of cultural countertransference are proposed as aides in achieving this awareness and improving care.

AB  - The Dark Duo Model of Post-Colonial Ideology states that post-colonial nations possess a specific set of sociostructural conditions that foster a unique pair of complementary ideologies responsible for maintaining the status quo. These are the ideologies of Historical Negation and Symbolic Exclusion. Together, these ideologies articulate a pair of discourses that draw upon culturally sanctioned repertoires to effectively resolve the collective dissonance created by pastand presentinjustices experienced by Indigenous peoples. Historical Negation and Symbolic Exclusion form a joint ideological system that legitimizes inequality in two critical social domains common to all post-colonial societies: one domain relating to resource allocations for Indigenous peoples and the other domain relating to representation and membership in the nation's identity. In the current article, we review and integrate over 10 years of research on post-colonial intergroup relations in New Zealand, leading up to a formal presentation of the Dark Duo Model. Our work in this area indicates that Historical Negation and Symbolic Exclusion are psychometrically distinct constructs that are stable over time. A meta-analytic review of 13 independent samples (N=18,903) shows that both ideologies are independently associated with Social Dominance Orientation and Right-Wing Authoritarianism among members of the dominant (European) group in New Zealand. We review and explain why there are systematic ethnic group differences in support for these dual ideologies and why positive intergroup contact with the dominant group attenuates resistance to Symbolic Exclusion amongst Maori (the Indigenous peoples). We also show that Historical Negation and Symbolic Exclusion exert powerful unique effects on voter sentiment and support for different social policies relating to biculturalism and that these ideologies mediate the effects of Social Dominance Orientation and Right-Wing Authoritarianism on various sociopolitical attitudes. Our Dark Duo Model is a context-specific extension of the Dual-Process Model of Ideology and Prejudice that explains how specific post-colonial ideologies are generated and used to maintain social inequalities that systematically disadvantage Indigenous peoples.

AB  - This study explored the successful career transition experiences of Korean college athletes who ceased to participate in sport prior to completing their college eligibility. In particular, the research addressed the ways in which they overcame challenges while pursuing their desired post-sport career paths. A qualitative approach was adopted to explore participants' life transitions, uncovering six primary themes: (1) entering the athletic specialist system: motivations and goals; (2) exit from sport: injury, failure of rehabilitation, bullying, and abandonment; (3) challenges in transition: prejudice, exclusion, and stigmatisation; (4) cultivating academic integrity to obtain degrees; (5) social networking outside of athletic culture; and (6) financial and emotional support. The findings were analysed by drawing on Bourdieu's concepts of habitus, field, social capital, and cultural capital, including physical and educational forms of capital. Findings help to identify factors that aided former athletes in overcoming barriers and gaining competencies to succeed in their careers after sport.

AB  - In recent years, sexism has played an increasingly pivotal role in American politics, and scholarship examining the importance of gender attitudes for political behavior has surged. Researchers have largely relied on the hostile sexism scale to measure prejudice against women, and this scale seems particularly relevant to political science research. However, this scale measures attitudes with an agree-disagree response format, which has long been recognized as a source of substantial measurement error. In this paper, we introduce a revised version of the hostile sexism scale that instead relies on an item-specific question format. Across three studies, we show that the item-specific scale is strongly related to the agree-disagree scale, but that the item-specific version reduces problems with truncation and tends to improve discriminant and predictive validity. Given these advantages, we conclude by recommending that researchers adopt the item-specific hostile sexism scale.

AB  - Nurses working in palliative care settings encounter death and dying regularly and face a greater risk of developing death anxiety and negative attitudes than their counterparts. Such distress and apprehension can cause care fatigue and affect patients' quality of life. Death anxiety remains an underresearched area in Asia, where death and dying are still considered taboo. This study explored death anxiety and its impact on community palliative nurses in Singapore and was conducted at a community hospital in Singapore from January to June 2018. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 16 nurses of different job grades for the face-to-face interviews, which were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using the data analytical approach of Miles et al. Four overarching themes were generated: (1) intrinsic factors influencing death anxiety, (2) extrinsic factors influencing death anxiety, (3) emotional struggles and coping, and (4) need for death education and psychological support. Gaps in palliative care education and death education need to be contextualized to increase the community palliative nurses' awareness and acceptance of death and enhance their death literacy in a multicultural setting.

AB  - Background: A growing body of evidence has shown that persons with physical disabilities experience substantial barriers in accessing primary healthcare (PHC) services in rural areas. Negative attitudes from healthcare providers and inaccessible healthcare facilities and equipment are common experiences that negatively affect access to quality healthcare for persons with physical disabilities. However, there is limited research that explores this issue from the perspectives of healthcare providers. This qualitative study explores the perspectives of healthcare providers in delivering PHC services to persons with physical disabilities in rural Ghana. Understanding healthcare providers' perspectives could help leverage previous findings from clients' experiences to more fully inform the development of specific and actionable research and interventions to improve healthcare delivery for disabled people. Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews with 15 healthcare providers and used thematic analysis to analyze the data. Results: Participants reported their perspectives in three major themes: challenges in providing healthcare (eg, limited availability of drugs and medical equipment, limited healthcare providers, financial constraints, and inaccessible facilities and equipment); strategies in navigating the challenges (eg, improvising techniques and employing professional values, referring clients, and providing financial assistance to clients); and positive experience in providing healthcare (eg, feeling rewarded and appreciated). Conclusion: The findings reinforce the need to consider the availability of rehabilitation professionals and services to address the specific healthcare needs of disabled people at the PHC level in Ghana. The findings also point to a need for further research on the perspectives of healthcare policymakers about how to navigate the systemic barriers encountered by providers in providing care to persons with physical disabilities in rural Ghana in particular, and other similar rural areas.

AB  - The period of the 1950s to the late 1960s has often been touted as the Golden Era of the Malaysian film industry. This paper examines the extent to which films of the Golden Era, specifically P. Ramlee's Sesudah Suboh (1967) and Gerimis (1968), i.e. two significant films of the era which portray stories about inter-ethnic romantic relationships, visualise the possibilities of inter-ethnic engagement through the films' narrative and the implied issues of ethnic and cultural differences. The discussion highlights the fact that there are significant moments of inter-ethnic dialogue and engagements between the characters within the narratives of the two films which outweigh the evidences of inter-ethnic prejudices that are portrayed in the films. The main conclusion that is derived from the film analysis is that the two films are significant spaces through which the borders between identities and cultures can be negotiated in the form of meaningful dialogue and engagement.

AB  - Background: Biographers aim to create a balanced interpretation of an individual life, both in the narrative of the life and the portrayal of the circumstances in which it was lived.
   Problem and method: Factors that may distort balance in the account of a life are identified in a review of selected literature of experienced biographers.
   Findings: Biographical evidence, the biographer's relationship with the protagonist and ethical and privacy matters and are discussed in relation to the quality, adequacy and accessibility of records; maintaining distance from the protagonist; keeping the life in perspective; selecting an appropriate approach and dealing with private or intimate matters.
   Conclusion: Partiality in the form of prejudice or bias and inaccuracy to the point of being untruthful, are threats to creating a balanced narrative. The credibility of a biography depends upon its honesty. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Australian College of Nursing Ltd.

KW  - Chicago
AB  - Frank Lloyd Wright's Broadacre City seems anomalous in twentieth century urban history. First presented in 1930 as a critique of existing American cities, the project developed into a program for territorial decentralization over the ensuing decade. Although Wright's often elliptical rhetoric can seem disengaged from urban discourse, this article argues that Broadacre City was based on prevailing suburban trends that it attempted to intensify. In doing so, the article makes two significant claims about Wright's work. The first is that Broadacre City was not a utopian master plan but rather a hermeneutical framework for managing socio-spatial change. The second is that the project was as critically attentive to changes in and around American cities as it was uncritically informed by existing forms of privilege and prejudice. If Broadacre City appears to be better grounded in urban history as a result, then its historiographic status needs to be revisited.

AB  - This paper examines how anti-corruption educational campaigns affect the attitudes of Russian university students toward corruption and academic integrity in the short run. About 2000 survey participants were randomly assigned to one of four different information materials (brochures or videos) about the negative consequences of corruption or to a control group. While we do not find important effects in the full sample, applying machine learning methods for detecting effect heterogeneity suggests that some subgroups of students might react to the same information differently, albeit statistical significance mostly vanishes when accounting for multiple hypotheses testing. Taking the point estimates at face value, students who commonly plagiarize appear to develop stronger negative attitudes toward corruption in the aftermath of our intervention. Unexpectedly, some information materials seem inducing more tolerant views on corruption among those who plagiarize less frequently and in the group of male students, while the effects on female students are generally close to zero. Therefore, policy makers aiming to implement anti-corruption education at a larger scale should scrutinize the possibility of (undesired) heterogeneous effects across student groups.

AB  - Background: Due to lack of information and illiteracy, epilepsy remains a stigmatized disease in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Objectives: The main aim of the study was to determine, among community dwellers in Asokore Mampong Municipality (Ghana): (i) the knowledge on risk factors, signs and symptoms, management of epilepsy, and (ii) factors associated with attitudes toward marrying, employing, or driving people with epilepsy (PWE).
   Methods: A cross-sectional study of 100 randomly selected individuals aged 18 years and older in Asokore Mampong Municipality was conducted in February 2019. A self-administered questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge about epilepsy and attitudes toward marrying, employing, and driving people with epilepsy. Frequencies and corresponding percentages were used to describe the study participants, their knowledge regarding epilepsy and attitudes toward marrying, employing, or driving people with epilepsy. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the factors associated with attitudes toward marrying, employing, or driving people with epilepsy.
   Results: Majority (33%) of the respondents indicated that epilepsy is caused by possession of evil spirits or witchcraft. More than 60% of the respondents correctly identified all signs and symptoms presented in the survey. Almost half (45%) of the respondents selected orthodox/medical treatment as the treatment for epilepsy. The odds of marrying PWE among Akans and Ewe/Ga Adangbe were 90% [adjusted Odds ratio (aOR) = 0.10, 95% CI: 0.01-0.67] and 84% lower [aOR = 0.16, 95% CI: 0.04-0.62] compared to odds of marrying PWE among Northerners, respectively. Compared to respondents with no formal education, the odds of employing PWE were 88% lower [aOR = 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03-0.40] among those with tertiary education. In addition, the odds of driving a person with an epileptic attack among Muslims/Traditionalists were 81% lower [aOR = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.05-0.68] than Christians. Respondents between 18 and 30 years old had more than 5 times higher odds of driving a person with an epileptic attack [aOR 5.28, 95% CI: 1.15-24.84] compared to respondents above 30 years.
   Conclusions: Individuals in Asokore Mampong have less knowledge about the risk factors and treatment of epilepsy. Generally, they have negative attitudes toward marrying, employing, and driving PWE. Findings from this study highlight the need to increase education to reduce the stigma associated with epilepsy.

AB  - Previous research has shown negative effects of discrimination on ethnic minority members' health and well-being. In this study, we examined cross-sectional and longitudinal effects of discrimination by members of the police and security personnel over and above other types of discrimination and ethnic victimization on the health of immigrant minority students from three different European countries (N = 4,334 immigrant students from 580 ethnically mixed school classes in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden). Results indicate that perceptions of ethnic victimization in the school (measured via social network data) as well as three types of discrimination outside school (discrimination in clubs, public transportation as well as by the police and private security) are associated with current and future negative health outcomes (i.e., psychosomatic problems) in immigrant minority students. Among the different types of discrimination, discrimination by the police and private security personnel was most common and had the most negative effect on immigrant minority students' health. Practical and political implications of our findings as well as differences in discrimination and violence by the police between the United States and Europe are discussed.

AB  - Objectives: To explore medical students attitudes towards communication skills and the evolution of these attitudes from their first to fourth academic years.
   Methods: A cohort of 91 medical students completed the Communication Skills Attitudes Scale (CSAS) at the beginning of their medical studies and at the end of their fourth year after having engaged in a training program in communication skills with experiential characteristics (individual encounters with simulated patients, observations in small groups, feedback, and practice). We analyzed students positive and negative global attitudes and their affective, cognitive, and respect dimensions towards learning communication skills.
   Results: Medical students attitudes toward communication skills declined from their first (52.8) to fourth year (49.6) (p=.011). Along with this significant decrease in positive attitudes, a significant increase in negative attitudes toward communication skills was also observed in trained students (32.2 vs. 34.2; p=.023). The decline in students attitudes mainly involves a decline in their affective (51.4 vs. 47.3, p=.001) but not cognitive (18.3) attitudes. Female students have more positive attitudes towards communication skills than male students.
   Conclusions: The decline in students attitudes, mainly in the affective dimension, could be related to their accumulated learning experiences during the learning process and particularly their experiential training in communication skills. Nevertheless, the importance students give to communication skills in the cognitive dimension remains unchanged. Students gender also seems to influence their attitudes. Further research is needed to assess the role of other factors involved in this decrease in positive and affective attitudes.

AB  - This article explores attacks by neighbours and/or members of local communities on women with disability as a form of hate crime and, more specifically, targeted violence. We draw on interviews conducted in 2017 with women with disability living in Victoria and New South Wales, Australia. These women spoke about ongoing experiences of physical, sexual, psychological, emotional and financial violence perpetrated by members of their local communities. They stressed the severity of this violence, the impact on their security and feelings of safety, and barriers to accessing justice. These women faced both disbelief and police indifference after reporting. Their experiences convey how they met with prejudice that casts the lives of people with disability as less worthy, and the effects of a hatred/vulnerability dichotomy that ultimately limits adequate responses. In the absence of a shared understanding of these crimes, disablist norms prevail, exposing women to ongoing violence and limiting access to justice.

AB  - The greatest proportion of new HIV infections among men who have sex with men (MSM) is occurring among young Black MSM (YBMSM) ages 13-24. Consequently, research is needed to understand the psychosocial pathways that influence HIV risk and resilience in YBMSM. Minority Stress Theory proposes that the stigma, prejudice, and discrimination facing sexual and racial minorities are chronic stressors that lead to increased engagement in risk behaviors. The present study examined whether minority stress is associated with stimulant use and sexual risk behaviors by depleting psychosocial resilience. We recruited 1817 YBMSM, ages 18-29, from multiple venues in two major cities in Texas for participation in a brief survey. Results from structural equation modeling indicated that decreased resilience partially mediated the association of minority stress with sexual risk behavior. Resilience was also negatively associated with stimulant use. Interventions focused on cultivating psychosocial resilience could mitigate the deleterious consequences of minority stress and reduce stimulant use in YBMSM.

AB  - Objective To compare the knowledge, beliefs, and practices regarding HPV vaccination among mothers of vaccine-eligible girls in Mexico and the USA.Methods Similar samples of Mexican mothers with vaccine-eligible daughters were surveyed at two clinics in Cuernavaca, Morelos, from July to October 2012 (n=200) and at two clinics in Oxnard, California, from August to November 2013 (n=200).ResultsAlthough mothers in the USA had less knowledge and more negative attitudes toward the vaccine than their counterparts in Mexico, vaccine uptake rates were higher in the USA (49% vs. 40%). US mothers were more likely to have discussed and been offered the HPV vaccine by a clinician than mothers in Mexico. In multivariate analyses, having been offered the HPV vaccine was the most important predictor of vaccine uptake.ConclusionsOur results suggest that healthcare access or other system, clinic, or provider factors are the main drivers of vaccine receipt in this binational sample of Mexican mothers. Interventions and programs that encourage clinicians to offer the HPV vaccine should be developed to increase vaccine uptake in both countries.

AB  - This study aimed to compare the level of attitudes toward homosexuality among nurses in Taiwan between 2005 and 2017 and with various demographic characteristics, as well as the roles of demographic characteristics in the changing trend of attitudes toward homosexuality between 2005 and 2017. This survey study recruited nurses from three hospitals in 2005 (Survey 2005, N = 1176) and 2017 (Survey 2017, N = 1519). Participants' four dimensions of attitudes toward homosexuality, including condemnation, immorality, avoiding contact, and stereotypes, were assessed using the Taiwanese version of the Attitudes Toward Homosexuality Questionnaire. The results demonstrated that nurses in 2017 exhibited lower levels of avoiding contact with lesbian and gay patients and stereotypes toward homosexuality but higher levels of condemnation of gay and lesbian individuals and perceptions of gay and lesbian individuals as immoral than did nurses in 2005. Age moderated changes in some dimensions of attitudes toward homosexuality from 2005 to 2017. The need to develop training programs aimed at improving not only the quality of nursing skills but also their negative attitudes regarding homosexuality is urgent.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a "gay-sounding" voice on heterosexual music teachers' perceptions of music teaching effectiveness. Music teachers across the United States (N= 575) listened to two men between the ages of 18 and 25 years old with stereotypically gay and straight voices, respectively, reading a short paragraph. After hearing each speaker in counterbalanced order, participants rated the likelihood of each speaker's ability to demonstrate top skills and behaviors associated with effective teaching using a 4-point Likert-type scale. Listeners rated the gay voice higher on measures of maintaining high musical standards and organization; they rated the straight voice higher on measures of leadership, classroom management, and maturity. Strategies to combat these stereotypes are discussed.

AB  - Background. Validated measures of sexual minority stress (Meyer, 2003), including that caused by experiences of discrimination directed toward gay, lesbian and bisexual (GLB) people, GLB-related stigma, and internalized homonegativity, are not readily available in Russia. Given the particular context of Russia with respect to GLB rights, it is to be expected that there would be cross-cultural variations in dimensions of minority stress, including internalized homo-negativity.
   Objective. For the present study, we aimed to back and forward translate the commonly used Szymanski and Chung's (2001) Lesbian Internalized Homonegativity Scale (LIHS), and explore its cross-language validity.
   Design. Our design consisted of a completion of the adapted LIHS by a sample of 74 Russian lesbian-identified women; participants were asked about their age of coming out to self, friends, and family.
   Results. Based upon an examination of construct validity and internal consistency, the results suggest support for a modified four-component, 24-item Russian version of the LIH (R-LIH). The components were: Connection with Lesbian Communities (9 items); Public Identification as a Lesbian (7); Public Visibility as a Lesbian (5); and Cultural Awareness of Lesbian Communities (3). From the original LIHS scale, Personal Feelings about Being a Lesbian, Moral and Religious Attitudes toward Lesbians, and Attitudes toward Other Lesbians failed to demonstrate cross-cultural validity.
   Conclusion. The adapted R-LIH scale suggests there are some constructs of internalized homonegativity that are salient in both U. S. and Russian communities, however, there are others (i.e., Moral and Religious Attitudes, Attitudes Toward Other Lesbians) that may not be relevant in Russian lesbian communities. The implications for the use of the translated version are described.

AB  - Persons living with dementia and their carers experience stigma. Stigma intensifies social exclusion and threatens health and well-being. Decreasing stigma associated with dementia is a public health priority across national and international settings and is a key component of National Dementia Strategies. Research-based drama is an effective public health strategy for reducing stigma and enhancing well-being. In this article we focus on survey data from an evaluation of a research-based drama called Cracked: new light on dementia. Our analysis illustrates the effectiveness of Cracked in reducing stigma by: decreasing health care practitioners' and family carers' prejudice, fostering critical reflection about relational practices, and fostering a commitment to individual and collective action to address stigma. Cracked is well-positioned to respond to urgent calls for culture change, which include reducing societal misconceptions and stereotypes around dementia and promoting inclusive and meaningful engagement of persons living with dementia across all levels of society.

AB  - Objective: The objective of the study was to characterize and compare the attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions about epilepsy across community and patient cohorts in Uganda.
   Methods: This was a descriptive study utilizing two samples: a randomly selected, national survey community sample and a hospital-based patient sample of people with epilepsy (PWE) and their caregivers attending clinic settings in Kampala and Mbarara, Uganda for epilepsy care. Both samples were surveyed about their beliefs about epilepsy, its treatment, and people who have the illness. Multivariate linear regression was used to examine group differences and variables associated with specific beliefs.
   Results: Among the 15,818 community survey participants who participated in this study, 435 study participants reported symptoms suggestive of recurrent seizures, and all 626 subjects in the hospital-based sample had confirmed epilepsy. Results revealed significant differences across groups in their endorsement of epilepsy as a contagion: 37% of people in the community unaffected by epilepsy, and 39% of people with suspected epilepsy who did not seek care believed that epilepsy was contagious by touch, in contrast to 8% of PWE or their caregivers attending regular hospital-based care. Higher educational attainment and income, and seeking regular hospital-based medical care were associated with less endorsement of epilepsy as a contagion, while age, education, income, area of residence, and presence of seizure symptoms, were significant predictors of support or belief in the basic rights of PWE. Study participants within the community who screened negative for seizures placed the most restrictions on rights for PWE. To varying degrees, the samples all endorsed the effectiveness of allopathic, traditional, and religious providers, and the use of pharmaceutical drugs, traditional rituals and herbs, and prayer.
   Conclusions: People with epilepsy who are attending biomedical care for routine epilepsy care think differently about epilepsy, its treatment, and the rights of those with the disease than the general population. Within the community setting, more erroneous beliefs and negative attitudes about epilepsy and PWE persist, and they not only contribute to stigma but also interfere with the patients' health-seeking behavior. Further confounding the care of PWE, the pluralistic healthcare system in Uganda is evident in endorsements spanning biomedical, traditional, and religious treatment methods. Focused awareness campaigns utilizing local epilepsy societies are needed to promote epilepsy health literacy, to favorably impact acceptance and opportunities for PWE in Uganda. and to facilitate efficient uptake of biomedical care.

AB  - Multiple treatments may be used in the management of patients with brain metastases including surgical resection or radiosurgery. In order to determine whether initial surgical resection in any way prejudices the subsequent efficacy of radiosurgery for recurrence at the operated site, a retrospective review of patients undergoing radiosurgery at the time of relapse was undertaken. All patients had previously received whole brain irradiation as part of initial management. A comparison of radiosurgical planning technique was made for recurrent brain metastases occurring at sites of a previous surgical resection versus unresected recurrences. Although recurrences of tumour at a resected site were more likely to be treated radiosurgically using larger and multiple collimators, there was no significant difference in subsequent local control. Assuming that the recurrence of a brain metastasis at a previously resected site is considered treatable radiosurgically, subsequent local control is no different from that achieved in previously unresected recurrences.

TI  - Validity evidence for a novel instrument assessing medical student attitudes toward instruction in implicit bias recognition and management
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
LA  - English
AB  - Background: Implicit bias instruction is becoming more prevalent in health professions education, with calls for skills-based curricula moving from awareness and recognition to management of implicit bias. Evidence suggests that health professionals and students learning about implicit bias ("learners") have varying attitudes about instruction in implicit bias, including the concept of implicit bias itself. Assessing learner attitudes could inform curriculum development and enable instructional designs that optimize learner engagement. To date, there are no instruments with evidence for construct validity that assess learner attitudes about implicit bias instruction and its relevance to clinical care.
   Methods: The authors developed a novel instrument, the Attitude Towards Implicit Bias Instrument (ATIBI) and gathered evidence for three types of construct validity-content, internal consistency, and relationship to other variables.
   Results: Authors utilized a modified Delphi technique with an interprofessional team of experts, as well as cognitive interviews with medical students leading to item refinement to improve content validity. Seven cohorts of medical students, N = 1072 completed the ATIBI. Psychometric analysis demonstrated high internal consistency (alpha = 0.90). Exploratory factor analysis resulted in five factors. Analysis of a subset of 100 medical students demonstrated a moderate correlation with similar instruments, the Integrative Medicine Attitude Questionnaire (r = 0.63, 95% CI: [0.59, 0.66]) and the Internal Motivation to Respond Without Prejudice Scale (r = 0.36, 95% CI: [0.32, 0.40]), providing evidence for convergent validity. Scores on our instrument had low correlation to the External Motivation to Respond Without Prejudice Scale (r = 0.15, 95% CI: [0.09, 0.19]) and the Groningen Reflection Ability Scale (r = 0.12, 95% CI: [0.06, 0.17]) providing evidence for discriminant validity. Analysis resulted in eighteen items in the final instrument; it is easy to administer, both on paper form and online.
   Conclusion: The Attitudes Toward Implicit Bias Instrument is a novel instrument that produces reliable and valid scores and may be used to measure medical student attitudes related to implicit bias recognition and management, including attitudes toward acceptance of bias in oneself, implicit bias instruction, and its relevance to clinical care.

AB  - The Government of Canada and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada both recommend a daily multivitamin supplement containing 400 mu g folic acid (FA) for the primary prevention of neural tube defects among low-riskwomen from before conception and throughout lactation. Prenatal supplements marketed and prescribed in Canada typically exceed the recommended dose, usually providing >= 1000 mu g FA/d. This high daily dose, coupled with staple-food FA fortification, has resulted in the observation of very high blood folate concentrations among reproductive-aged women consuming FA-containing supplements. The longterm consequences of high folate status on fetal development are unknown; however, evidence from animal studies and some human epidemiologic data suggest potential adverse consequences. To address this issue, a workshop was convened with the overall goal to identify challenges and solutions to aligning supplemental FA intakes with current evidence-based recommendations. Thirty eight stakeholders from academia, industry, government, and health professional groups participated. Group discussions facilitated the identification and prioritization of 5 key challenges for which solutions and implementation strategies were proposed. The 5 themes encompassed clarity and harmonization of evidence-based guidelines, reformulation or relabeling of FA-containing supplements, access to FA for all women, knowledge dissemination strategies and education of the public and health care professionals, and attitude change to overcome the perception of "more is better." A combination of the proposed implementation strategies involving all key stakeholders and directed to health care professionals and the public may enable a sustainable change to align FA intake during the periconceptional period with evidence-based recommendations.

AB  - There are concerns about adequacy of nurses' knowledge and skill in effective pain management since effective pain management promotes early recovery after surgery. This study explores factors that accounted for Ghanaian nurses' inadequate knowledge of postoperative pain management using a focused ethnographic design for data collection at a tertiary teaching hospital in Ghana. Fourteen nurses designated as key informants with different backgrounds as nurse educators and leaders were purposively sampled to participate. Data were collected through in-depth individual interviews; all interviews were conducted in English, audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. The study revealed that nurses' inadequate pain management knowledge might have resulted from curriculum gaps during training; inadequate clinical supervision, study days, and workshops for practising nurses; lack of funding for organising regular workshops; and, negative attitudes of nurses whereby new information learned at workshops was not readily applied in clinical practice. It was concluded that nursing curricula at all levels of training in Ghana should incorporate credit-bearing courses on pain management, and appropriate pain management education programmes should be instituted for practising nurses. Regular monitoring and evaluation of the impact of such education programs is required. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Backward Cloud Model Based Feature Extraction of Aircraft Echoes and Target Classification
T2  - PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH M
LA  - English
AB  - As a kind of complicated targets, the nonrigid vibration of aircraft, their attitude change, and the rotation of their rotating parts will induce complicated nonlinear modulation on their echoes from low-resolution radars. These kinds of modulation play an important role in target classification. However, due to the influence of clutter and noise, these kinds of modulation have the characteristics of fuzziness and randomness. As a quantitative to qualitative conversion model based on traditional probability statistics theory and fuzzy theory, backward cloud model can be used to model and analyze the modulation characteristics of the conventional low-resolution radar echoes from aircraft targets. By considering the sample values of the echo data as individual cloud droplets, the paper extracts cloud digital features such as the expectation, entropy, and hyper-entropy of each group of echo data, and investigates the application of these features in aircraft target classification based on support vector machine. The research results show that the backward cloud model can describe the aircraft echoes well, and the echo cloud digital features can be effectively used for the classification and identification of aircraft targets.

AB  - We study the welfare impacts of domestic support schemes for generation capacity when energy markets are interconnected. We find that if transmission system operators (TSOs) can't reduce export capacity and neighbors stay energy-only, a capacity market is ineffective unless transmission capacity is small. If TSOs can reduce export capacity, the capacity market attracts investments and Security of Supply (SoS) of non-domestic markets shrink. A neighboring energy-only or strategic reserve market will thus be prejudiced in the long-run and may have to implement a capacity market as well in order to meet its SoS standard. Hence, capacity markets may spread in Europe thanks to their negative cross-border effect on investment incentives. This is in sharp contrast with the conventional wisdom, based on short-term arguments, that energy-only markets will free-ride the SoS provided by neighboring capacity markets. Our conclusions urge for the harmonization of capacity remuneration schemes across Europe.

Participants consisted of 24 black employees (males = 50%, females = 50%; support staff = 50%, academic staff = 50%). The employees completed a semi-structured interview that elicited their perceptions of the settings in which gossip about black employees occurred, the perceived intentions of such gossip, and their responses to it. The data obtained was thematically analysed. Findings suggested that the gossip targeted black employees who were absent from meetings, and that such gossip undermined the work performance and morale of these employees.

AB  - Institutions that teach Western classical music in higher education in the West have been increasingly reliant on international students from Asia, particularly China, to fulfill recruitment targets. This article examines research in music performance tuition and the general higher education literature on pedagogy for international students. After demonstrating that Asian musicians feel the presence of a covert racial and cultural prejudice caused by assimilationist values in both Western classical music and in higher education, it reviews various approaches to teaching international students in higher education and brings this into dialogue with research on music performance pedagogy. Identifying various pitfalls of attempting to promote a greater awareness of students from different backgrounds, such as stereotyping and the indiscriminate use of racialized discourses, it argues nonetheless that a greater sensitivity to cultural difference is needed in music performance tuition. By reconsidering through an intercultural lens what teachers currently do and their beliefs about music and teaching that they transmit to their students, music education research can play an important role in breaking down assimilationist attitudes to the performance and teaching of Western classical music.

AB  - This study is grounded in Allport's intergroup contact theory and Herek's sexual prejudice theory. We aimed at (a) investigating the mediational role of sexism and homonegativity on the relation between gender, age, and contact with gay and lesbian people with gender stereotypes about gay men and lesbians; and (b) replicating and corroborating the direct associations found in previous research among these variables. The present research used secondary data from a survey conducted by the Italian National Institute of Statistics and comprehending a representative sample of 5,863 Italian adults. The results from path analysis indicated that both homonegativity and sexism partially mediated the effect of gender and age on gender stereotypes, whereas they totally mediated the effect of contact with gay and lesbian persons. Findings suggest that reducing sexist and homonegative attitudes and increasing contact with gay and lesbian people may reduce stereotypical beliefs about homosexual people.

AB  - Recent commentaries on the resurgence of populist nationalism have referred back to the early twentieth century. Such analogies are criticised by scholarly historians, but in a frame of post-humanist theory, the very method of comparison recalls early modernist treatments of political and historical language as essentially metaphoric and fictive. The essay focuses on T.E. Hulme's writing, drawing attention to three challenges to humanism described in his work. Firstly, it examines his critique of excessive scientific confidence that led to a 'nightmare of determinism'. Secondly, it shows how Hulme was both fascinated and disturbed by forms of vitalism that gave individuals agency but seemingly also a vulnerability to manipulation. Thirdly, Hulme advocates a form of a politics subordinated to a transcendent deity, again in reaction to humanist ideals. Through analysis of Hulme's essays on crowd psychology, historical prejudice, and the political use of metaphor, the essay tests parallels between political narratives in the 1910s and the present day, and considers the constructive ends to which Hulme's problematic worldview could be put.

AB  - The internment of Boer civilians in concentration camps by the British military authorities during the South African War of 1899-1902 was a highly controversial policy, not least because around 26,000 women and children were estimated to have died as a result of epidemics in the camps. Both supporters and opponents of the camps addressed the policy using gendered language rooted in ideas about British standards of 'civilization'. Apologists defined the camps as one of the protective measures of the chivalrous British authorities, and downplayed the significance of the mortality rates by blaming infant deaths on the maternal shortcomings of Boer women. Opponents, however, stressed similarities between the British and Boer peoples, and invoked gendered language to attack what were held to be barbaric policies towards defenceless members of the community. At the heart of both discourses was a belief in British aspirations to embody an ideal 'civilization', underpinned by traditional gender ideologies. The association of this concept of 'civilization' with not merely cultural but racial difference led to the development of a racialized image of the enemy, rooted perhaps more strongly in perceptions of the female Boer civilian than of the male soldier.

AB  - While intergroup contact and group position scholars have found that individuals can maintain prejudice despite associational contact and affective ties, this study finds that integrated organizations can specifically mediate ethnic relations through managing threat to the privileged majority's group position. In Slovakia, where Roma are generally even more impoverished and interethnic relations are just as tense, group-level interethnic conflict occurs less often than in the neighboring Czech Republic. Integrated church organizations in Slovakia seem to provide opportunities for associational interethnic contact, known to contain conflict. In reality, while Slovak church leaders manage to integrate their organizations to varying extents, perceived threat to majority group position limits their ability to truly transform unequal ethnic relations. A comparison to the socially and politically similar Czech case, where neither secular and religiously affiliated organizations are able to play this role among a generally nonreligious population, demonstrates that Whites perceive both service provision and advocacy as threatening their group position. Organizations thus settle for brokering relationships between Romani communities and official institutions, not with their White neighbors. With evidence from semi-structured interviews with key respondents conducted between 2014 and 2015, I argue that Slovak churches and church-affiliated organizations racially integrate and maintain peaceful relations not through the expected routes, but through mediating structured interethnic relations. By focusing on service provision, limiting Romani participation, or internally segregating the organization, Whites can mentally maintain their superior group position despite integration. These findings have implications for all multi-ethnic societies interested both in maintaining interethnic peace and pursuing racial equity.

AB  - Cancer-related illness uncertainty has been associated with poorer psychological outcomes for patients. While some cancer patients believe obtaining genomic information will reduce their illness uncertainty, the complexity of genomics has the potential to compound illness uncertainty. The aim of this mixed-methods study was to investigate uncertainty in patients with a cancer of likely heritable origin immediately following their decision to have germline genome sequencing. Participant (N = 348) negative attitudes toward uncertainty were associated with higher satisfaction with decision to have germline genome sequencing and greater fear of cancer recurrence. Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with a subset of participant (N = 20) revealed the following four themes: (a) germline genome sequencing to reduce illness uncertainty; (b) germline genome sequencing to reduce uncertainty related to relatives' risk; (c) uncertainty generated by germline genome sequencing; and (d) resilience and coping with uncertainty. This study demonstrated the complexity of uncertainty in germline genome sequencing in cancer patients. These results provide genomic healthcare professionals with important information about cancer patient's motivation to pursue germline genome sequencing, the specific uncertainties generated by germline genome sequencing, and how cancer patients cope with uncertainty.

AB  - Transgender people often experience oppression because of gender nonconformity. They represent an extremely stigmatized population at high risk of developing mental health problems. The minority stress model is a theoretical model used to understand social stigma as a potential cause of mental health disparities faced by the transgender population. In Italy, studies applying this model to the transgender population are limited. The current study applied the minority stress model to a sample of Italian transgender people (n = 149), analyzing effects of prejudice events, expectations of rejection, and internalized transphobia, and their interaction with protective factors (resilience and social support), on mental health. The results suggest that exposure to everyday discrimination and internalized transphobia are associated with increased mental health problems, while perceived social support from family and resilience significantly reduced the strength of association between everyday discrimination and mental health. Findings have important implications for both social issues and policies.

AB  - We report longitudinal data in which we assessed the relationships between intelligence and support for two constructs that shape ideological frameworks, namely, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO). Participants (N = 375) were assessed in Grade 7 and again in Grade 12. Verbal and numerical ability were assessed when students entered high school in Grade 7. RWA and SDO were assessed before school graduation in Grade 12. After controlling for the possible confounding effects of personality and religious values in Grade 12, RWA was predicted by low g ([3=.16) and low verbal intelligence ((3=.18). SDO was predicted by low verbal intelligence only ((3=.13). These results are discussed with reference to the role of verbal intelligence in predicting support for such ideological frameworks and some comments are offered regarding the cognitive distinctions between RWA and SDO.

AB  - Historically, the family and, more generally, gender policies have been a central issue in both nationalist and far-right rhetoric. This holds particularly for Germany, where the so-called male-breadwinner model and the rhetoric of Kinder, Kuche, Kirche (children, kitchen, church) have a long tradition. At the same time, Germany's National Socialist past confers a negative connotation on notions of the family as a continuation of the nation. In this article, Fangen and Lichtenberg examine the family policies and views on gender roles, as well as the views on Muslims, of politicians from two German far-right parties and their youth organizations, as well as one German anti-immigrant social movement organization. Their study, based on press releases, party programmes and social media posts, adds to the growing literature on the importance of gender in nationalist and far-right politics in general, and in far-right critiques of Islam in particular. Their specific contribution is a detailed focus on the similarities and differences in various organizations on the German far right, as well as an analysis that draws on concepts such as femonationalism and, in a similar vein, Rogers Brubaker's notion of civilizationism.

AB  - This paper has been written to assist researchers and practitioners to have an alternative view of investigating the effectiveness of personalized ads on social media. The current literature shows that consumers mostly have negative attitudes and perceptions towards social media advertising but on the other hand, few studies indicate that these ads are quite effective. The literature review, in this article, illustrates that relevance as a construct has not been given enough attention which possibly is the cause of the unclear conclusion about the role and usefulness of personalized ads, therefore, analysis is done on the relevance of personalized ads on social media. Henceforth, instead of relying on predetermined effectiveness measures, it is important to understand the role of relevance in the effectiveness of personalized social media ads (Proposition 1). Also, the literature indicates that there is an emotional experience that consumers go through that affects the way consumers respond to the personalized ads (Proposition 2). Furthermore, the analysis shows that the relevance of a personalized ad on social media is an antecedent of advertising value (Proposition 3).

AB  - Does a board with greater gender diversity make better investment decisions? Drawing on Austrian economic cycle theory and work groups theory, we argue that such board openness will help male board members to overcome gender biases, discrimination, and conflicts; integrate different perspectives under the economic cycle and crisis; and foster an environment in which better decisions are made. The results of an empirical study of 14,609 firm-quarter observations from 1,555 listed firms in China between 2007 and 2009 strongly support our arguments. We find that a Chinese board is more likely to accept female directorship during an economic crisis than during an economic prosperity stage. Boards with greater gender diversity are more likely to make tough, counter-cyclical investments to improve firm performance during a crisis. Our study enriches the board decision-making literature by exploring the impacts of board gender diversity on firm performance within the context of an economic crisis. The results of our study also carry significant managerial implications for overcoming gender stereotypes, biases, and prejudices on a board.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, Online Tutoring Platforms (OTPs) have been applied extensively in education in China. The aim of this study is to investigate the determinants that influence college students' behavioural intention of using OTPs to acquire knowledge. This study also explores how students' attitude change in using OTPs five months after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic based on a hierarchical component model which is combined by the Social Impact Theory (SIT) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Partial least squares (PLS) analysis is employed to analyse the data collected from 1133 students in Mainland China. The results of the analysis indicate that social impact consists of three dimensions (compliance, identification, internalization) significantly influences college students' attitude toward OTPs and further affects college students' behavioural intention toward OTPs usage. Furthermore, performance expectancy and effort expectancy also positively affect students' behavioural intention toward using OTPs to acquire knowledge. This study makes several suggestions for universities to encourage students using OTPs to cope with the situation of Covid-19 pandemic and for educators to promote online tutoring for reforming universities in the future.

AB  - Our experience and prejudice concerning food play an important role in modulating gustatory information processing; gustatory memory stored in the central nervous system influences gustatory information arising from the peripheral nervous system. We have elucidated the mechanism of the 'top-down" modulation of taste perception in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and demonstrated that gustatory imagery is mediated by the prefrontal (PFC) and insular cortices (IC). However, the temporal order of activation of these brain regions during gustatory imagery is still an open issue. To explore the source of "top-down" signals during gustatory imagery tasks, we analyzed the temporal activation patterns of activated regions in the cerebral cortex using another non-invasive brain imaging technique, magnetoencephalography (MEG). Gustatory imagery tasks were presented by words (Letter G-V) or pictures (Picture G-V) of foods/beverages, and participants were requested to recall their taste. In the Letter G-V session, 7/9 (77.8%) participants showed activation in the IC with a latency of 401.7 +/- 34.7 ms (n = 7) from the onset of word exhibition. In 5/7 (71.4%) participants who exhibited IC activation, the PFC was activated prior to the IC at a latency of 315.2 +/- 56.5 ms (n = 5), which was significantly shorter than the latency to the IC activation. In the Picture G-V session, the IC was activated in 6/9 (66.7%) participants, and only 1/9 (11.1%) participants showed activation in the PFC. There was no significant dominance between the right and left IC or PFC during gustatory imagery. These results support those from our previous fMRI study in that the Letter G-V session rather than the Picture G-V session effectively activates the PFC and IC and strengthen the hypothesis that the PFC mediates "top-down" control of retrieving gustatory information from the storage of long-term memories and in turn activates the IC.

TI  - Interests, Values, and Geopolitics: The Global Public Opinion on China
T2  - EUROPEAN REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - The essay discusses the public opinion surveys on the rise of China in the United States, Asia and Latin America since 2010, conducted by Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Duke University's collaborative research team headed by the author. It examines the world public recognition of China's growing influence, their attitudes toward China's influence, and reactions to the 'China Model' and impressions of China's political, economic, social, and cultural development. These assessments of China's domestic issues or internal behavior show not only the amount of information and knowledge that the people in various countries know about China, but the intrinsic value judgments and ideological biases that influence their perceptions of China. The essay argues that the rise of China is a complicated phenomenon with a multifarious nature, including material dimensions, such as military power, economic development, and technological innovation, as well as ideational dimensions, such as perception, understanding, or prejudice. Public opinion, attitudes and perceptions of China's rise are the outcome of dynamic interactions and assemblage of factors, a synergy of material interests, ideational and emotional reactions, and values, ideologies, principles, unraveling themselves against a highly volatile, precarious and contentious geopolitical backdrop, in which the interests of nation-states and individuals became all intertwined and inseparable.

AB  - This study analyzes residential segregation by introducing the concept of ethnicity clustering externality. In an economy with two areas, namely the center and suburb, households with different ethnic characteristics (termed the majority and minority), both of which have identical skill levels, endogenously choose their residential location in the long run. By analyzing stable residential equilibria, we show that, because of their ethnic clustering preferences, minority residents are more likely to cluster in one area than majority residents. In addition, when the commuting cost is low, minority residents always cluster, widening the population gap between areas. At the same time, majority households migrate to a less crowded area to avoid the residential congestion caused by minority clustering, thus reducing the population gap. In this sense, the majority acts as an equalizer of population sizes between the center and suburb under low commuting costs.

AB  - Using evidence from a 2006 postal survey of NHS organisations, plus eight case studies and source country interviews (India; Philippines; Zimbabwe; Poland; Spain) in 2007-2008, the paper explores the impacts of England's 'ethical' recruitment policy as it developed from the late 1990s onwards. It shows that a Code of Practice and bilateral agreements did positively influence the behaviour of NHS organisations and commercial agencies at the height of England's international recruitment drive from 2001 to 2006. However, such policies could only go so far; and other actions are needed to mitigate the downside effects of migration on source countries. One key step is an attitude change that sees countries like England receiving internationally mobile health professionals for the 'value added' that they bring - rather than regarding them primarily as a numerical addition or substitute for the domestically-trained workforce. Another is to plan and manage the domestic workforce in order to deliver on self-sufficiency ambitions. Finally, 'ethical' stances mean placing health professional recruitment/migration into wider development agendas - as a platform for training and skills development for the developing world. Overall, it was the winding down of England's active recruitment policy from 2006 together with subsequent general immigration and professional registration rule changes that had most influence on migration numbers.

AB  - Consumers commonly encounter products with descriptors. Descriptors with meanings understood by consumers clearly affect judgments of the described products. However, can descriptors for which consumers do not know the word's semantic meaning (as is increasingly common in a globalized world) still affect judgments in systematic ways, via altering the product's perceived prototypicality? We examine two kinds of judgments that typically move in the same direction, but which we propose are affected by prototypicality in opposite directions: (a) judgments of how expensive the product is and (b) expectations of the subjective quality of the product. Four experiments show that meaningless descriptors lead consumers to assume that a product is a less prototypical version in its category, increasing price judgments but decreasing quality expectations. Altogether, meaningless descriptors lead to more negative attitudes toward products. This research thus sheds light on the impact of encountering descriptor words with unknown meaning, showing that encountering such words does not lead to the typical effects wherein factors that lift price judgments also lift quality expectations.

AB  - Research aims: This study examines perceived self-efficacy and its role in fostering pro-environmental attitude and behaviours.
   Design/Methodology/Approach: This study employs a quantitative approach to explain the relationship among the variables. The data of 500 individuals are collected and then analysed through the partial least squared (PLS) approach.
   Research findings: Results show that perceived self-efficacy has a positive influence on attitude; it enables individuals to orchestrate their capabilities in pursuing pro-environmental behaviours.
   Theoretical contributions/Originality: This study expands on previous literature by adapting lifestyle-centric pro-environmental behaviour and social cognitive theory to identify the factors that motivate pro-environmental behaviours.
   Practitioner/Policy implications: This study provides insights for marketers and other policy makers to better understand how perceived self-efficacy impacts the attitude and pro-environmental behaviours of individuals. The results imply that practitioners need to include attitude change campaigns and intervention programmes that can increase self-efficacy so as to encourage individuals to engage in more challenging environmental behaviours.
   Research limitation: Since this study focusses on the urban population of Malaysia only, the generalisability of the findings may be restricted. Future studies need to incorporate a larger and more diverse samples.

AB  - The number of students with mental health disorders (MHDs) in postsecondary institutions is increasing. Teachers' attitudes are among the main factors that influence these students' academic success. Unfortunately, their attitudes are little studied, in part because of lack of validated scales. Therefore, this article has two purposes: (1) analyse the construct validity of new scales assessing teachers' attitudes, as well as existing scales without an established construct validity; and (2) report the correlations between the variables assessed in these scales, with a special focus on two variables: (a) teachers' negative attitudes; and (b) the measures offered to students by teachers. The participants are 232 teachers from 16 French and English CEGEPS in Quebec, Canada. The questionnaire includes three scales created by the research team and three scales from the Mental Illness Awareness Survey. Correlational and factor analyses were conducted. The scales present good construct validity. Four variables were associated with the two variables of interest: confidence in one's ability to convince a student to seek help; familiarity with MHDs; knowledge and understanding of MHDs; favourable perception of the accommodations offered by adapted and psychosocial services. Based on these results, strategies are proposed to improve teachers' attitudes.

AB  - Public attitudes towards sex offenders are believed to play a key role in the development of legislation and public policy designed to manage the risks posed by known sex offenders who live in the community. There have, however, been few previous attempts to validate methods by which public attitudes can be measured. The current study aims to address this issue by establishing the factor structure of the Community Attitudes Towards Sex Offenders (CATSO) scale with an Australian community sample and examine the extent to which demographic variables and support for sex offender management policies influence these attitudes. A sample of 552 participants recruited through online social media sites completed the CATSO as well as a number of items developed by the researchers designed to assess individuals' support for specific sex offender policies. Results of an exploratory factor analysis suggested the presence of four distinct factors which were labelled 'social tendencies', 'treatment and punishment', 'crime characteristics' and 'sexual behaviour'. Individuals with higher levels of educational attainment rated sex offenders less negatively than those with lower educational attainment, while those who reported being supportive of community notification reported more negative attitudes towards sex offenders.

AB  - Backpacking is an increasingly popular, but sometimes controversial, activity in protected areas. Very few studies have examined the impacts associated with backpacker tourism in environmentally sensitive regions of China. Using data collected from a survey of backpackers visiting Mt Taibai in the Qinling Mountains, this paper analyses the environmental and management challenges posed by travellers in a protected area. We observed that many backpackers gained unauthorized access to the study area, sometimes even to the most fragile sections of natural reserves. This unauthorized use of protected areas poses serious risk of injury and has environmental implications, including damage to vegetation and soils, pollution and wildlife habitat disturbance. But most respondents had little awareness of their environmental impacts and held negative attitudes toward restricted activities in the non-tourist district of protected areas. To promote environmentally responsible attitudes, reduce the risk of accidents and alleviate pressure on reserve managers, we recommend strengthening regulations as well as developing a multi-department management system, expanding community participation and improving environmental education. In a way, this study provides a strategic plan for improved accessibility and land management practices in mountainous protected areas.

AB  - Cancer is the second leading cause of death among Native Americans, who havesome of the poorest cancer survival rates of any race/ethnicity nationwide. Considering the cancer burden experienced by Native Americans and the lack of research exploring Northeastern tribal communities' cancer experiences, a qualitative investigation of Native Americans' cancer coping strategies and health education needs was undertaken. Data were collected through group (74) and individual (17) interviews with 91 Native Americans from the Northeast. Relationships between intergenerational mistrust, individual mistrust, and utilization of biomedical health care systems for Northeastern Native Americans are presented. Trust is central to the provider-patient relationship and the foundation for developing and maintaining connections to Native American communities. Intergenerational mistrust, shaped by historical and contemporary issues of prejudice and miscommunication, affect cancer health experiences and views. Approaches for reducing mistrust and building relationships between health care providers and Native communities are highlighted.

AB  - This paper explores how far the scientific discovery process can be automated. Using the identification of causally significant flow structures in two-dimensional turbulence as an example, it probes how far the usual procedure of planning experiments to test hypotheses can be substituted by 'blind' randomised experiments and notes that the increased efficiency of computers is beginning to make such a 'Monte-Carlo' approach practical in fluid mechanics. The process of data generation, classification and model creation is described in some detail, stressing the importance of validation and verification. Although the purpose of the paper is to explore the procedure, rather than to model two-dimensional turbulence, it is encouraging that the Monte Carlo process naturally leads to the consideration of vortex dipoles as building blocks of the flow, on par with the more conventional individual vortex cores. Although not completely novel, this 'spontaneous' discovery supports the claim that an important advantage of randomised experiments is to bypass researcher prejudice and alleviate paradigm lock. It is finally noted that the method can be extended to three-dimensional flows in practical times.

AB  - In this qualitative study, the experiences of persons who frequently visit the emergency department (ED) for mental health-related reasons were explored. Interpretive Description guided the design, and data were collected through interviews with 10 adults who made 12+ ED visits within a 1-year time frame (2015). Thematic analysis was used to analyze data inductively. The participants' experiences were described with the help of three themes emerging from the data: The Experience, The Providers, and Protective Factors. The participants felt compelled to come to hospital. For them, every visit was necessary, and dismissal of their needs by staff was interpreted as disrespect and prejudice. We noted differences in ED utilization patterns according to psychiatric diagnosis, and more research is needed to explore the phenomenon of frequent use by particular patient populations. Furthermore, health care providers implementing interventions designed to improve emergency care should consider tailored approaches rather than a one-size-fits-all strategy.

AB  - Protection motivation theory (PMT) has become a popular theory to explain the risk-reducing behavior of residents against natural hazards. PMT captures the two main cognitive processes that individuals undergo when faced with a threat, namely, threat appraisal and coping appraisal. The latter describes the evaluation of possible response measures that may reduce or avert the perceived threat. Although the coping appraisal component of PMT was found to be a better predictor of protective intentions and behavior, little is known about the factors that influence individuals' coping appraisals of natural hazards. More insight into flood-coping appraisals of PMT, therefore, are needed to better understand the decision-making process of individuals and to develop effective risk communication strategies. This study presents the results of two surveys among more than 1,600 flood-prone households in Germany and France. Five hypotheses were tested using multivariate statistics regarding factors related to flood-coping appraisals, which were derived from the PMT framework, related literature, and the literature on social vulnerability. We found that socioeconomic characteristics alone are not sufficient to explain flood-coping appraisals. Particularly, observational learning from the social environment, such as friends and neighbors, is positively related to flood-coping appraisals. This suggests that social norms and networks play an important role in flood-preparedness decisions. Providing risk and coping information can also have a positive effect. Given the strong positive influence of the social environment on flood-coping appraisals, future research should investigate how risk communication can be enhanced by making use of the observed social norms and network effects.

AB  - The US public consistently ranks climate change as a low national priority due, in part, to a lack of personal engagement and a sense of temporal and spatial distance from the environmental effects (Leiserowitz 2006). Yet, the chief method for climate change mitigation, the reduction of fossil fuel use, would also reduce particulate air pollution, which is implicated in over three million deaths worldwide each year (Lim et al. 2013). Indeed, in the US, improved public health ranks among the top perceived benefits of reducing fossil fuel use (Leiserowitz et al. 2013), and the scientific community has been promoting these benefits-such as reduction in hospitalizations and premature deaths -for over a decade (Cifuentes et al. 2001; West et al. 2013). Furthermore, the health behavior literature demonstrates that personal perception of risk, which is likely to be linked to health, is one of the strongest motivators of behavioral change (Few 2007; Maibach and Parrott 1995). Thus, one possible method for garnering support for carbon emissions reduction is to emphasize the added co-benefit of reducing present-day, health-related impacts. However, it remains to be understood whether public health messaging can lead to improved climate change mitigation efforts, or how specific segments of the US population will respond to this message. In particular, emphasizing health co-benefits may be a strong motivator of attitude change among individuals who are less concerned about environmental threats or who deny the existence of anthropogenic climate change.

AB  - Purpose We explore the relationship between the balanced scorecard (BSC) and neo-bureaucracy by investigating whether the operationalization of the BSC incorporates "neo-bureaucratic" ideas and whether the BSC implemented in a Portuguese Local Health Unit (LHU) demonstrates a neo-bureaucratic approach. Design/methodology/approach We conduct semi-structured interviews with LHU staff and analyse documents to assess whether features of bureaucratic organization were evident in the use of a BSC by the LHU. Findings We found nine bureaucratic features evident in the LHU's BSC. These were systematization, rationality, authority, jurisdiction, professional qualification, knowledge, discipline, transparency and accountability. The BSC used at the LHU demonstrated a neo-bureaucratic approach. Originality/value Our study helps to demystify bureaucracy and overcome prevailing prejudices regarding some of its principles. Health care managers should recognize and endorse neo-bureaucratic principles in developing a BSC. They should recognize the BSC as involving a neo-bureaucratic approach. The BSC is a valuable management tool that hospital managers should find useful in fostering flexibility, collaboration, innovation and adaptation - all of which should help lead to improved healthcare outcomes.

AB  - Flag-displays can be used within national groups to communicate majority supremacy over ethnic minorities. In two studies set in an Australian context (N= 88 andN= 102), we explain how mode of national identification (glorifying identifiers versus attached identifiers) differently predicts support for multicultural values and national flag-displays. In line with the hypotheses, we found that attached identifiers were more supportive of multicultural values and national flag-displays by ethnic minorities than glorifying identifiers. In contrast, glorifying identifiers supported flag-displays by the majority more than did the attached identifiers. Study 2 demonstrates that glorifying identifiers' use of the national flag is explicitly meant to exclude other groups. As expected, support for multicultural values and endorsement of the flag as an exclusion tool helped to explain the relationship between identification and flag-displays. As such, results revealed the attitudes behind a novel form of prejudice that is currently on the rise.

AB  - In the present paper, we investigated the link between stereotype threat, school achievement, and domain identification in language arts. We hypothesized that stereotype threat may lead to higher intellectual helplessness, lower working memory capacity, lower achievement, and domain identification but only in young men highly identified with their gender group. To test these assumptions we used self-descriptive measures of stereotype threat, intellectual helplessness, gender identification, and domain identification. We also evaluated working memory capacity by working memory test and school achievement using grade point average. Our predictions were tested in structural equation modeling on a nationwide sample of 319 young men from coeducational schools, aged 14-16 years. The results revealed that working memory was a mediator of achievement (gamma = 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.34, 0.55]), while intellectual helplessness was related to both domain identification (gamma = -0.13, 95% CI = [-0.22, -0.04]) and achievement (gamma = -0.13, 95% CI = [-0.21, -0.06]). The proposed model extends our previous work on the role of intellectual helplessness in mathematics by testing the same intervening variable in a different domain, that is, in language arts. We discuss these results in light of previous research on stereotype threat and present practical implications.

AB  - This article examines the lived experiences of women in Ethiopian higher education (HE) as a counterpoint to understandings of gender equity informed only by data on admission, progression and completions rates. Drawing on a critical qualitative inquiry approach, we analyse and interpret data drawn from focus group discussions with female students and academic women in two public universities in Ethiopia. Individual accounts and shared experiences of women in HE revealed that despite affirmative action policies that slightly benefit females at entry point, gender inequality persists in qualitative forms. Prejudice against women and sexual violence are highlighted as key expressions of qualitative gender inequalities in the two universities. It is argued that HE institutions in Ethiopia are male-dominated, hierarchical and hostile to women. Furthermore, taken-for-granted gender assumptions and beliefs at institutional, social relational and individual levels operate to make women conform to structures of disadvantage and in effect sustain the repressive gender relations.

AB  - Individual actions to avoid, benefit from, or cope with climate change impacts partly shape adaptation; much research on adaptation has focused at the systems level, overlooking drivers of individual responses. Theoretical frameworks and empirical studies of environmental behavior identify a complex web of cognitive, affective, and evaluative factors that motivate stewardship. We explore the relationship between knowledge of, and adaptation to, widespread, climate-induced tree mortality to understand the cognitive (i.e., knowledge and learning), affective (i.e., attitudes and place attachment), and evaluative (i.e., use values) factors that influence how individuals respond to climate-change impacts. From 43 semistructured interviews with forest managers and users in a temperate forest, we identified distinct responses to local, climate-induced environmental changes that we then categorized as either behavioral or psychological adaptations. Interviewees developed a depth of knowledge about the dieback through a combination of direct, place-based experiences and indirect, mediated learning through social interactions. Knowing that the dieback was associated with climate change led to different adaptive responses among the interviewees, although knowledge alone did not explain this variation. Forest users reported psychological adaptations to process negative attitudes; these adaptations were spurred by knowledge of the causes, losses of intangible values, and impacts to a species to which they held attachment. Behavioral adaptations exclusive to a high level of knowledge included actions such as using the forests to educate others or changing transportation behaviors to reduce personal energy consumption. Managers integrated awareness of the dieback and its dynamics across spatial scales into current management objectives. Our findings suggest that adaptive management may occur from the bottom up, as individual managers implement new practices in advance of policies. As knowledge of climate-change impacts in local environments increases, resource users may benefit from programs and educational interventions that facilitate coping strategies.

AB  - Prolonging the working life of older adults has been suggested by various researchers and policymakers as a strategy to alleviate challenges posed by the inevitable ageing of the population. It is thus important to have measures with which to assess and monitor factors relevant to older adults' employment. Research indicates that negative attitudes towards older workers are at the heart of employment discrimination; hence, the current research developed and assessed a new measure of attitudes towards older workers. A questionnaire asking about older workers was prepared in three versions (male, female, and gender neutral). Each version of the Attitudes towards Older Workers Scale (AOWS) was pilot tested, refined, and field tested with random samples totalling 246 hiring decision-makers and 219 undergraduate students. Internal consistency ranged between .89 and .95 across the samples and questionnaire versions. Testretest reliability correlations for male, female, and gender-neutral versions were .83, .78, and .90, respectively. The AOWS will be a valuable tool for research, development of interventions, and for informing policy formulation in the areas of ageing, retirement, and employment.

TI  - WISCONSIN'S "GREATER LATITUDE" RULE: A BACKDOOR TO UNCONSTITUTIONAL PROPENSITY EVIDENCE
T2  - WISCONSIN LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - Wisconsin's greater latitude rule is unconstitutional as a due process violation because it not only admits propensity evidence, but it also fails to exclude evidence when its undue prejudice substantially outweighs its probative value. First, the greater latitude rule is unconstitutional under a theory based on the reasoning of Crawford v. Washington, which struck down hearsay rules that conflicted with the original meaning of the Sixth Amendment. Using Crawford's originalist reasoning, the greater latitude rule conflicts with the original meaning of due process. Second, the rule also interferes with the modem conception of due process, which requires procedures that produce accurate, reliable means of adjudicating criminal cases. By analogy to persuasive authority, the rule should be unconstitutional under the reasoning of federal appeals courts that have dealt with similar issues. I advocate a return to Wisconsin's traditional approach to admitting propensity evidence, which would accord with the United States Constitution and other jurisdictions' rules. This approach would also provide a basis for effective appellate review.

AB  - Background: Despite the dangers associated with hookah tobacco smoking, use and popularity in the United States among young adults continue to increase. While quantitative studies have assessed users' attitudes toward hookah, qualitative research can provide a more in-depth description of positive and negative attitudes and beliefs associated with hookah use. Objectives: To determine outcome expectancies associated with hookah use among young adults. Methods: We conducted six focus groups in 2013 to identify outcome expectancies associated with hookah use. Participants (N = 40) were young adults aged 18-23 who reported hookah use in the past three months. Using Outcome Expectancy Theory perspective, we posed the question "Hookah smoking is _______?" to elicit words or phrases that users associate with hookah use. Results: Over 75% of the users' hookah use outcome expectancies were positive, including associating hookah smoking with relaxation and a social experience. Content analysis of the words engendered six themes. These themes included Social Appeal, Physical Attractiveness, Pleasant Smoke, Comparison to Cigarettes, Relaxation, and Deterrents. Fewer negative hookah use expectancy words and phrases were identified, but included "tar" and "cough." Conclusions: The findings suggest that participants lacked basic knowledge about hookah tobacco smoking, had misconceptions about its danger, and had many positive associations with hookah use. Incorporating components addressing positive hookah expectancies may improve the efficacy of established and new hookah use prevention and cessation interventions and policies.

AB  - There is a growing trend to both theoretically and empirically explain public punitiveness from a general social theory of late modernity. Yet, research which has tested the generalizability of this perspective regarding societies other than Western ones remains rare. Relying on a theoretical perspective and empirical findings, this study aimed to explore whether the hypothetical model, which assumes that abstract late modern anxieties (economic anxiety and identity anxiety) affect punitiveness via more tangible fears and negative attitudes toward others in terms of fear of crime, xenophobic attitudes, and social dominance orientation (SDO). The study considered whether this model can be applied to Japanese society, which is experiencing drastic social, economic, and political transformations. Accordingly, data from a nationwide Japanese sample was analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM). The results revealed that all of the hypothesized paths had significant relations, except for a path between xenophobic attitudes and fear of crime, which generally supported the hypothetical model. Moreover, it was shown that all of the variables have a significant total effect on punitiveness. The results were discussed in light of the social circumstances of Japan and recommendations for further international comparative research were made.

AB  - Given their critical gatekeeper function regarding naloxone access in rural areas, the purpose of the current study was to examine rural pharmacists' knowledge and attitudes regarding naloxone use and access (Georgia, 2019), all 364 rural community pharmacies in Georgia were contacted using "secret shopper" methodology and asked about the availability, accessibility, and use of naloxone. A script provided specific questions for data collection. Callers recorded general notes about the call, including the dispositions and impressions of the pharmacists. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify key themes. Rural pharmacists exhibited two classes of attributes: Active Facilitators and Passive Hindrances. Active facilitators supported callers in their search for naloxone, but passive hindrances discouraged callers in a way that was not perceived to be malicious or intentional. Three types of active facilitators emerged: positive approach, helpful suggestions, and knowledgeable and informed. Two types of passive hindrances emerged: negative attitudes and insufficient knowledge. Community pharmacies are sometimes the only formal healthcare access point in rural communities. It is vital for pharmacists to be active facilitators of naloxone access for maximized public health impact. Specific interventions are needed to increase the ability of rural pharmacists to support access to naloxone.

AB  - Background: A high percentage of those who complete suicide are not in contact with the psychiatric services and this is particularly evident among men who are the most at-risk group.Aim: To examine take-up of psychiatric services and attitudes to treatment among a sample of men who made a suicide attempt.Method: Fifty-two males, aged between 18 and 30 years, who made a medically serious suicide attempt, were followed up 7 years later using chart information and national mortality records.Results: On discharge from hospital all participants were referred to psychiatric aftercare services but one-third (32.7%) never presented and 20% attended only for a short period. Yet almost half (48%) of the sample made a subsequent attempt and 12% completed suicide. Factors contributing to low take-up of services include lack of awareness of psychiatric symptoms, reluctance to disclose distress and negative attitudes to seeking professional help.Conclusion: Young males are reluctant to seek professional help for psychiatric problems even following a serious suicide attempt. Factors influencing this include health behaviours linked to traditional expectations for men as well as the type of services provided.

AB  - Use of traditional medicines for treatment of cancers has increased worldwide. We used a qualitative approach to explore barriers to biomedical care and reasons for use of traditional medicines for the treatment of cervical cancer in Gulu, northern Uganda. We carried out 24 focus group discussions involving men and women aged 18-59 years. We employed content analyses technique in data analysis. Traditional medicines were used mainly due to barriers to biomedical care for cervical cancer. The barriers included health system factors, for example long distances to health facilities and unavailability of medicines; health workers' factors, for example negative attitudes towards patients and demands for bribes; individual patient's factors, for example inability to pay for medical care; and socio-cultural beliefs about superiority of traditional medicines and perceived greater privacy in accessing traditional healers. Barriers to biomedical care and community beliefs in the effectiveness of traditional medicines encourage use of traditional medicines for treatment of cervical cancer but might hinder help-seeking at biomedical facilities. There is need for targeted culturally sensitive awareness campaign to promote effectiveness of modern medicine and to encourage cautious use of traditional medicines in the treatment of cervical cancer.

Method: This is a qualitative study whose sample had nine health managers from municipalities belonging to the 4th Health Region of Paraiba. The data were collected by the interview technique and analyzed based on French Discourse Analysis. Results: For managers, the factors leading to the delay in the diagnosis of Tuberculosis are related to the delay in seeking health services and to perceive illness, lack of knowledge about the disease, prejudice, difficulties in accessing health services and lack of perception of professionals in identifying suspected cases. Conclusion: It is necessary that managers and health professionals create actions aimed at both the family and the elderly, which needs to be seen as a group at risk of tuberculosis.

AB  - This paper examines how speakers deploy narrative devices in talking about Sudanese refugees. Particularly, we show how narrative constructions form an important basis for the advancement of accounts about integration problems into the local polity. We analyse talkback phone-in calls to a local Adelaide radio station that provide callers an opportunity to give accounts of events and social phenomena that concern them in their local settings. Analysis shows that speakers regularly deployed narrative constructions, first-hand witnessing devices that functioned to legitimate accounts as veridical versions of events, and contrast devices to explicate the moral and behavioural aberrance of Sudanese refugees. The analysis illustrates how these discursive devices function rhetorically in interaction, in ways that differentiate Sudanese refugees as problematic. Through this analysis, we contend that narrative devices precipitate and bolster socio-political policies that have serious, negative consequences for Sudanese refugees.

AB  - This article discusses the digital inequalities experienced by prisoners and the potential opportunities that providing new' media in prisons offer for offender rehabilitation and resettlement. Currently denied access to online and social media that most of us take for granted, and unable to communicate in ways that have become ordinary' in the wider community, it is argued that prisoners experience profound social isolation and constitute one of the most impoverished groups in the digital age. In prisons which provide selected prisoners some access to information and communication technologies, their high socio-cultural status and consequent construction as a privilege' frequently results in them being used in the exercise of soft' power by prison officer gatekeepers. Moreover, when prisoners come to the end of their sentences, they not only are faced with prejudice and poor job prospects due to their criminal record, but their digital exclusion during a period of incarceration may have compound effects and lead to long-term and deep social exclusion.

AB  - Healthcare is dynamic and complex, and against this background, nursing students must negotiate the transition from lay person to healthcare professional. Diverse life experiences and learning styles can further complicate this journey of transformation. The contemporary role of the nurse includes caring for and making clinical decisions about patients based on ethical principles. Learning about and integrating ethical comportment as part of the transformative journey requires nurse educators to create and implement learning experiences that challenge nursing students to think deeply and broadly about the experiences they encounter, to question their previous assumptions and prejudices, to consider the world of healthcare through a new lens, and to reflect on and learn from the process. The judicious use of film has the potential to assist students to recognize and develop ethical comportment as they prepare for real-world clinical practice experiences. In this paper, we present three film exemplars and related teaching strategies designed to facilitate transformative learning and development of ethical comportment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: There is mounting evidence to suggest that as the population ages, negative perceptions of aging reduce involvement in preventive health behaviours and ultimately prove harmful to mental and physical health. One group that may be at particular risk of developing poor attitudes toward aging are athletes, seeing that they are significantly invested in their physical performance and aging stereotypes reinforce that physical performance declines with age.
   Methods: This study examined aging attitudes and knowledge of aging in athletes (n = 67) and non-athletes (n = 78). It was hypothesized that athletes would hold a more negative view of aging than non-athletes. Athletes were members of varsity sports teams and non-athletes were primarily undergraduate psychology students.
   Results: Results showed that athletes were more invested in their physical fitness; however both groups, were relatively equal in their knowledge of aging and their expectations for aging.
   Conclusions: These data suggest consistency in both knowledge of, and expectations for, aging among athletes and non-athletes. Future research should consider methods that reduce or eliminate negative attitudes towards aging as this may lead to better health in the future for younger and older cohorts.

AB  - The current study investigated the quality of media coverage on issues regarding people with disabilities in Jordan from the perspectives of journalists and special education teachers. Although Jordan has adopted legislation to support and protect people with disabilities, people with disabilities are three times more likely to be illiterate & half as likely to be employed. Although physical accessibility creates some barriers, negative attitudes and stigma are major barriers. Since media can play a significant role in attitudes towards people with disabilities, this study surveyed journalists' and special education teachers' perceptions of the quality of media coverage in Jordan. Using convenience sampling, 160 journalists and 208 special education teachers from Amman and Irbid cities participated in the study by completing self-administered paper-and-pencil questionnaires. Results indicate that, overall, journalists and special education teachers felt the quality of media coverage for issues related to people with disabilities in Jordan was acceptable (but not good or excellent), although journalists were statistically significantly more likely to rate the quality of coverage was better than the rating provided by special education teachers.

AB  - Background: The availability of electronic health (eHealth) information and disease-related community forums has grown over the last decade. Although patients and families frequently use these resources, their content has not been characterized in terms users, content, or reliability of information. eHealth communities therefore represent a potentially valuable but uncharted source of information about key patient issues, communication terminology, and unmet needs. We hypothesized that eHealth forums would contain terminology, themes, and advice inconsistent with resources from medical providers and references. To test this hypothesis, we performed a qualitative analysis of posts and responses from an open-access peripheral artery disease (PAD) eHealth community forum to characterize the discussion, participants, and the information being exchanged.
   Methods: Posts were collected from an online PAD Medical Support Community forum (MedHelp), which is open access, does not require participants to identify themselves, and is based in the United States. Posts were selected from threads in which the main topic was PAD, including diagnosis, symptoms, and treatment. Original posts and related responses were analyzed for thematic content, common vernacular, and self-reported characteristics of the participants using a qualitative analysis software program. Disease-specific comments and advice were evaluated for congruence with contemporary PAD treatment guidelines.
   Results: A total of 103 posts were collected and analyzed, including 40 original posts and 63 responses. Forty-five percent of the original posts and 19% of the responses were authored by participants who self-identified as patients with PAD. The remaining posts were authored by people with undeclared relationships to patients with PAD, followed by children, spouses, and other relatives. The most common themes among original posts included PAD diagnosis (and differential) (25%), treatment (23%), epidemiology and pathophysiology (21%), disease symptoms and impacts on activities of daily living (15%), and health-care provider recommendations (13%). Themes of responses included medical advice (40.5%), personal experiences with PAD (32.8%), and social support (12.6%). Negative attitudes were identified in 10 of 18 (55.6%) posts related to experiences with health-care providers. Of all medical advice, 15.1% was inconsistent with clinical treatment guidelines.
   Conclusion: eHealth communities are a rich source of information related to the experiences of patients with PAD, their treatment preferences, questions they consider important, and terminology that they use. This information can be used to understand unmet patient needs, develop educational resources, and improve communication.

AB  - Research has documented the stigma of obesity extensively, but little attention has been given to the study of stigma toward formerly obese individuals. The present study examines whether the stigma of obesity in romantic relationships carries over to formerly obese individuals by using primary data collected from a Midwestern university in the United States (N = 363). We consider how an individual's own body weight, demographic characteristics, familiarity, and attitudes affect the willingness to form a romantic relationship with a formerly obese person. Results suggest that obese individuals are less likely to hesitate about engaging in a romantic relationship with a formerly obese person than underweight or normal weight individuals, but only when attitudes toward obese and formerly obese individuals are controlled. In terms of demographic characteristics, men and African Americans are more likely to hesitate about forming a romantic relationship than their respective counterparts. More familiarity with currently obese family members and formerly obese close friends appears to reduce the stigma minimally. Greater social distance is also desired if weight loss is believed to be temporary.

AB  - Examining the impact of various media sources on knowledge has a long tradition in political communication. Although much of the extant research focuses on the impact of traditional media on factual knowledge, research is expanding to include a variety of media sources and multiple dimensions of knowledge, in addition to understanding processes that better explain these relationships. Using a nationwide, opt-in online survey (n=993), we examine the relationship between partisan media and structural knowledge, which assess how interconnected people see political concepts. Utilizing understanding of the Affordable Care Act as the content area of interest, we examine whether exposure to partisan media has differential effects on attitudinal ambivalence-holding both positive and negative attitudes toward an object-based on the political ideology of the respondent, and whether this impact of ambivalence influenced structural knowledge. Our results show that exposure to attitude-consistent media decreased attitudinal ambivalence. This exposure to attitude-consistent media results in a positive indirect effect on structural knowledge through this decrease in ambivalence. We find the reverse effect for use of attitude-inconsistent media.

AB  - Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reflect the relationship among social, economic, and environmental aspects of society. Massive online open courses (MOOCs) represent an opportunity to promote lifelong learning (SDG 4), complementing university education or providing knowledge to society free and openly. The objective of this work is to analyze experiences in one MOOC about wastewater treatment applied to higher education in civil engineering (SDG 6). The proposed educational methodology and the achieved participation results are studied. The MOOC had three editions and was hosted on the Miriadax platform. Data about sociodemographic characteristics, initial motivation, and satisfaction level were collected from questionnaires. The results highlighted the importance of design decisions to obtain a high completion rate: defining a target audience, without prejudice to the course's open character, where the prior knowledge of students is crucial. The teaching methodology is based on autonomous and progressive learning, with short and direct master classes, social support, with the motivation of students to continue their training with opening complementary topics in the forums, following up on their doubts, and their combination with social networks.

AB  - Objective: Psychiatric patients often experience internalized stigma. This occurs when persons accept the negative attitudes of others towards them, then internalize and apply these beliefs to themselves. We assess the effects of internalized stigma on illness disclosure and on self-esteem in psychiatric outpatients, hypothesizing that internalized stigma is more pronounced in psychiatric patients than in medical patient controls and that internalized stigma is associated with avoidance of disclosure, as well as reduced self-esteem. Methods: Psychiatric and medical outpatients were randomly selected to participate in the study, conducted at a general hospital specialist outpatient clinic. Results: Psychiatric patients demonstrated significantly lower self-esteem than controls. Internalized stigma was the highest for singles, and the lowest among married and older patients. Among psychiatric patients, a higher internalized stigma was significantly associated with experienced discrimination and with lower levels of self-esteem. Those who avoided disclosure had significantly higher internalized stigma than those who self-disclosed. Conclusion: The results confirmed our study hypotheses. Marriage and older age seemed to confer a protective effect on self-esteem.

TI  - Compromises with Creditors - New Zealand Court Proposes a New Test for Class Composition that looks at Creditors' Economic Interests
T2  - INSOLVENCY LAW JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - A recent decision of the New Zealand High Court has held that the test for defining the composition of creditor classes in a creditors' compromise involves consideration not only of creditors' rights but also their economic interests. This article considers the law on composition of creditor classes in New Zealand and in other jurisdictions that have adopted compromise laws based on the English model. It suggests that the test adopted by the New Zealand High Court (and upheld by the Court of Appeal) is open to challenge and is unlikely to have more general application outside of New Zealand law, given the unique framing of the relevant insolvency laws in New Zealand. The New Zealand law has effectively collapsed the more usual three-stage compromise regime into a two-stage process, involving the creditors' vote and only one court hearing. It is suggested that in the New Zealand context it is appropriate to consider the differences in economic interests of creditors on the occurrence of a complaint by a creditor of unfair prejudice, which effectively corresponds to the approval hearing in other jurisdictions.

AB  - Can negative first names cause interpersonal neglect? Study 1 (N = 968) compared extremely negatively named online-daters with extremely positively named online-daters. Study 2 (N = 4,070) compared less extreme groups-namely, online-daters with somewhat unattractive versus somewhat attractive first names. Study 3 (N = 6,775) compared online-daters with currently popular versus currently less popular first names, while controlling for name-popularity at birth. Across all studies, negatively named individuals were more neglected by other online-daters, as indicated by fewer first visits to their dating profiles. This form of neglect arguably mirrors a name-based life history of neglect, discrimination, prejudice, or even ostracism. Supporting this argument, neglect mediated the relation between negative names and lower self-esteem, more frequent smoking, and less education. These results are consistent with the name-based interpersonal neglect hypothesis: Negative names evoke negative interpersonal reactions, which in turn influence people's life outcomes for the worse.

AB  - The long-held redistributive function of agricultural cooperatives - one of moral economy and poverty alleviation - has changed dramatically as they emerge as core brokers for agro-industrial development in the so-called 'green economy'. This article examines the changing role of cooperatives involved in brokering oil palm production and its impact upon the food security and livelihoods of smallholders who labour in plantation regimes situated in historically uneven agrarian political economies. Findings show how, increasingly, cooperatives reinforce uneven agrarian social relations of production and exchange in which indigenous smallholders experience loss of land, poor wage labour conditions tinged with insecurity and prejudice, and mounting debt in an expanding oil palm complex. The article suggests that these changes in agrarian social relations negatively influence indigenous farmers' food security pathways, with their access to and use of appropriate foods diminishing. It asserts that understanding the impacts of cooperatives on food security pathways requires a relational and situated analysis of livelihood change and agrarian relations in extractive frontiers.

AB  - Spanking, whipping, and choking are examples of aggressive behaviours that can be performed in consensual sexual encounters. However, within the pornography research literature, such behaviours are often perceived as being nonconsensual, categorised as 'violent', and argued to predict sexual aggression. Viewing nonconsensual pornography may be associated with negative attitudes towards consent; however, viewing consensual pornography that features typically violent behaviour may not. In this study, we sought to more clearly distinguish between consensual and nonconsensual pornography depictions by using vignettes to examine individuals' consent attitudes in relation to these pornographic vignettes. We also sought to assess the hypothesis that more frequent pornography engagement will be associated with greater comfort with the nonconsensual vignettes. A series of pornography vignettes were developed by the researchers and categorised by a group of sexual consent experts as 'consensual' or 'nonconsensual' vignettes during a three-round Delphi study. The finalised vignettes were administered to a convenience sample of Irish university students (n = 1121). More frequent pornography engagement was not associated with greater comfort with the nonconsensual vignettes. Greater comfort with the nonconsensual pornography vignettes was negatively associated with attitudes towards establishing consent and the endorsement of sexual consent norms.

AB  - It is often said that science is self-correcting, but the replication crisis suggests that self-correction mechanisms have fallen short. How can we know whether a particular scientific field has effective self-correction mechanisms, that is, whether its findings are credible? The usual processes that supposedly provide mechanisms for scientific self-correction, such as journal-based peer review and institutional committees, have been inadequate. We describe more verifiable indicators of a field's commitment to self-correction. These fall under the broad headings of 1) transparency, which is already the subject of many reform efforts and 2) critical appraisal, which has received less attention and which we focus on here. Only by obtaining Observable Self-Correction Indicators (OSCIs) can we begin to evaluate the claim that "science is self-correcting." We expect that the veracity of this claim varies across fields and subfields, and suggest that some fields, such as psychology and biomedicine, fall far short of an appropriate level of transparency and, especially, critical appraisal. Fields without robust, verifiable mechanisms for transparency and critical appraisal cannot reasonably be said to be self-correcting, and thus do not warrant the credibility often imputed to science as a whole.

AB  - A new method for the diagnosis of incipient transformer faults based on a combined decision model using IEC 60599 three-ratio method, grey system theory (GS) algorithm, Dempster-Shafer evidence (DS) theory, and backpropagation (BP) neural network diagnosis method is proposed in this paper. The new method will eliminate the influence of any one individual diagnosis method due to insufficient information or diagnostic prejudices. In order to minimize the sum-of-squared errors of the proposed method, the optimal weights of every individual method which comprises the combined decision model are calculated based on their own diagnosis error ratios. Thus a combined decision model based on optimal weights (CDMOW) is formed. Then the optimal diagnosis result is obtained based on CDMOW. Results of diagnosis instances show that the use of CDMOW not only gives a much higher diagnostic accuracy rate but also more stability in fault diagnosis than any single method composing it.

AB  - The form of political polarization where citizens develop strongly negative attitudes toward out-party members and policies has become increasingly prominent across many democracies. Economic hardship and social inequality, as well as intergroup and racial conflict, have been identified as important contributing factors to this phenomenon known as "affective polarization." Research shows that partisan animosities are exacerbated when these interests and identities become aligned with existing party cleavages. In this paper, we use a model of cultural evolution to study how these forces combine to generate and maintain affective political polarization. We show that economic events can drive both affective polarization and the sorting of group identities along party lines, which, in turn, can magnify the effects of underlying inequality between those groups. But, on a more optimistic note, we show that sufficiently high levels of wealth redistribution through the provision of public goods can counteract this feedback and limit the rise of polarization. We test some of our key theoretical predictions using survey data on intergroup polarization, sorting of racial groups, and affective polarization in the United States over the past 50 y.

AB  - Background: Consumer participation in mental health service delivery is now a policy expectation. Negative attitudes of health professionals towards collaboration with consumers have been identified as a major barrier to policy implementation. Consumers contributing to the education of nurses and other health positions have been identified as an effective strategy, particularly when consumers occupy academic positions. Attitudes of nurse and consumer academics to the consumer academic role remain under-researched. Aims: To explore the implementation of a consumer academic position from the perspectives of the broader academic team. Methods: Qualitative exploratory research was undertaken to give voice to different perspectives of the implementation of a consumer academic position. In-depth interviews were conducted with nurse academics, the consumer academic and the research team. Results: Thematic data analysis revealed five main themes: seeking a united perspective; who can provide a consumer perspective? How accurate is consumer perspective? One consumer, one opinion, one way, one delivery; bias and poor portrayal of nurses. Conclusions: Marked divergence in views and opinions was evident in terms of support for the role and its perceived value. Further investigation of factors facilitating successful implementation is required and strategies identified to facilitate mutual understandings and goal setting.

AB  - Objectives To understand the extent to which conventional and complementary health care are integrated for CAM users with chronic conditions.
   Methods In-depth interviews and a self-administered questionnaire were used to collect data on care-seeking, self-management and CAM use among people with type 2 diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease living in Victoria, Australia.
   Results Many participants reported regular, frequent and long-term use of CAM therapies to maintain their health or assist in the management of their chronic condition. They generally managed the interface between convention and complementary health care on their own, as the perceived or expressed negative attitudes of some doctors, or the belief that the doctor did not need to know, were barriers to the disclosure of CAM use. For a smaller group, there was interaction between conventional and CAM providers, which limited the extent of uncertainty and conflicting information being (mis)interpreted by consumers.
   Conclusions Greater interaction between CAM and medical providers would be beneficial to consumers. Structural barriers, related to financing and service organization, need to be addressed. Attitudinal shifts of some health-care practitioners also need to be addressed, in the context of workforce development.

AB  - While a number of prominent researchers have recently turned their attention to the likelihood or desirability of full world government, such an ideal has little current support in civic and popular discourse. This article seeks to identify some factors possibly reinforcing such globoscepticism'. After first discussing why it should not be seen as prima facie absurd to support global political integration, and noting widespread popular support in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, it turns to some findings on the sources of Euroscepticism. This phenomenon involves negative attitudes expressed by political elites and ordinary citizens towards European Union integration. Also considered are the determinants of attitudes towards international trade liberalisation. Insights from both areas can be applied to a preliminary exploration of globoscepticism. Specifically, they can enrich an analysis of domestic biases which naturally arise and are reinforced within a sovereign states system, and which tend to diminish support for comprehensive projects beyond the state. These pose challenges that must be addressed by academic advocates of full global integration, as well as advocates of still-ambitious but far less comprehensive projects of suprastate institution building.

AB  - The interaction of car drivers and cyclists is one of the main causes of cycle incidents. The role of attitudes and social norms in shaping car drivers' aggressive behaviour towards cyclists, is not well understood and merits investigation. A sample of 276 drivers completed an online questionnaire concerning their attitudes towards cyclists, attitudes towards risky driving, perception of social norms concerning aggressive driving towards cyclists, and the frequency with which they engage in such aggressive driving behaviours. The results showed that attitudes towards cyclists, as well as social norm perceptions concerning aggressive driving towards cyclists, were associated with aggressive driving towards cyclists. Negative attitudes towards cyclists were more pronounced in non-cyclists than cyclists and their association with aggressive driving behaviour was stronger in cyclists than non-cyclists. The perception of social norms concerning aggressive driving towards cyclists had a stronger association with aggressive driving in non-cyclists than cyclists. Attitudes towards risk taking did not affect aggressive driving towards cyclists. These findings can inform campaigns that aim to improve cyclist and car driver interaction on the roads, making them safer to use for cyclists. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to examine if perceived normative pressure (i.e., perception of the normative expectations of family and friends regarding one's intergroup attitudes) had a direct impact on majority youth's (N = 93) explicit attitudes and moderated the relationship between their implicit (measured with the ST-IAT) and explicit attitudes towards Russian immigrants in Finland. The results indicated that normative pressure is positively associated with the explicit attitudes of adolescents, and that the implicit attitudes of the adolescents towards immigrants surface on the explicit level only when they do not perceive a normative pressure to hold positive intergroup attitudes. More specifically, when there is no normative pressure, the explicit attitudes of youth are, at best, neutral, and reflect their implicit attitudes. In contrast, when normative pressure is perceived to be high, the level of explicit attitudes is generally more positive, and the expression of explicit attitudes is not determined by implicit attitudes. The effects of age, sex, quality of past intergroup contact experiences, and intergroup anxiety were controlled for in the analysis. The findings highlight the importance of taking normative pressure into consideration when studying socially sensitive ethnic attitudes among adolescents.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the discourses of professionals that work on the reference service about the critical points that affects the essential attributes of the Primary Health Care (PHC) related to the control of tuberculosis in the city of Joao Pessoa. Method: The empirical material collected from August to October in 2014, through the interview technique was analyzed through the methodological-theoretical framework of French Discourse Analysis. Results: The discourses demonstrated the critical points on the control of the disease on PHC as being the lack of bond and welcoming from the professionals in relation to patients with tuberculosis. It was realized that the professionals have prejudice about the disease, that they have difficulties on the access to conducting exams, appointments and treatments, as well as there are fails on the reference and counter-referencing system. Final Considerations: Managers should be aware about the results that were found, so that facing actions can be planned and executed in order to minimize the existent of critical points.

AB  - The present study aimed to adapt the Attitudes Toward Accompanied Driving Scale (ATADS) to a Chinese drivers sample and to examine its reliability and validity. Five hundred and seventy-two drivers aged 18 to 25 years old were asked to complete the ATADS and a validated Chinese version of the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory. The factorial structure of the ATADS was examined using exploratory factor analysis (N = 259) and confirmatory factor analysis (N = 313). The validity of the scale was evaluated by examining the associations between the ATADS factors, demographic variables and driving styles. The results showed that both the findings of the EFA and CFA showed a five-factor structure of the ATADS, including tension, relatedness, avoidance, disapproval and anxiety. Second, significant gender differences were found in tension, relatedness, avoidance and anxiety. Third, tension, avoidance, disapproval and anxiety were moderately or weakly correlated with risky, anxious, angry and careful driving styles. Moreover, the number of traffic accidents after the accompanying phase was positively correlated with disapproval and avoidance. The findings supported the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the ATADS and highlighted the adverse effects of young drivers' negative attitudes toward accompanied driving on their driving styles.

AB  - Japanese consumers are still hesitant to purchase products from Fukushima, although 7 years have passed since the Fukushima nuclear disaster, and these products are officially considered safe. In this study, we examined whether Japanese consumers have negative implicit attitudes toward agricultural and aquatic products from the Fukushima region and whether these attitudes are independent of their explicit attitudes. Japanese students completed an implicit association test and a questionnaire to assess their implicit and explicit attitudes toward products from Fukushima relative to another region. The results of two experiments reliably demonstrated that the public has negative implicit attitudes toward Fukushima products, whereas their explicit attitudes are consistently positive. These observations predominantly held for participants living close to Fukushima (Tokyo) as opposed to participants living far away (Hiroshima): Experiment 1 (n = 40). Furthermore, individual differences in aversion to germs contributed to the implicit attitudes; the implicit negative attitudes were attenuated among the participants with a relatively low aversion to germs: Experiment 2 (n = 60). These results suggest that the implicit attitudes associated with the behavioral immune system, which is conceptualized as a suite of psychological mechanisms designed to proactively resist pathogenic threats, may underlie the hesitation to purchase products from Fukushima.

AB  - As a form of leisure, Pride events offer LGBTQI+ people a chance to gain visibility, advocate for their rights, and construct and express their identity. The benefits such events offer are particularly crucial within rural communities, often perceived to be heteronormative spaces that may exhibit greater levels of prejudice against sexually and gender-diverse individuals. This paper examines the perceived social impacts Pride events can have within a rural community by studying an inaugural Pride event hosted in the Australian township of Wagga Wagga. Informed by an interpretivist approach and using a mix of participant observation and semi-structured interviews, the study found the event had three key outcomes. First, the event challenged assumptions about how acceptance of diverse sexualities and gender identities were in the town. Second, it appeared to help build community acceptance by providing a public space/time for LGBTQI+ individuals to be acknowledged as legitimate citizens. Finally, it contributed to identity construction and created opportunities for connection with other LGBTQI+ residents and the rural community more broadly.

AB  - Negative attitudes toward HIV medications may restrict utilization of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Indonesian prisons where many people living with HIV (PLH) are diagnosed and first offered ART. This mixed-method study examines the influence of medication attitudes on ART utilization among HIV-infected Indonesian prisoners. Randomly-selected HIV-infected male prisoners (n = 102) completed face-to-face in-depth interviews and structured surveys assessing ART attitudes. Results show that although half of participants utilized ART, a quarter of those meeting ART eligibility guidelines did not. Participants not utilizing ART endorsed greater concerns about ART efficacy, safety, and adverse effects, and more certainty that ART should be deferred in PLH who feel healthy. In multivariate analyses, ART utilization was independently associated with more positive ART attitudes (AOR = 1.09, 95 % CI 1.03-1.16, p = 0.002) and higher internalized HIV stigma (AOR = 1.03, 95 % CI 1.00-1.07, p = 0.016). Social marketing of ART is needed to counteract negative ART attitudes that limit ART utilization among Indonesian prisoners.

AB  - Objective: To explore common barriers medical students perceive to choosing psychiatry as a medical specialty as reflected in existing literature and the authors' own experiences and whether funding student attendance of a Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists Congress serves to overcome some of these perceptions.
   Conclusions: Common barriers to selecting psychiatry as a career include stigma due primarily to lack of information about this specialty; concerns about personal safety; concerns about losing clinical skills and fear of burn-out. Bursaries funding student attendance to the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2013 Congress were an excellent initiative that gave students a panoramic view of the variety of fields within the specialty and exposure to current debates and research, as well as the chance to discuss various subspecialties with keynote speakers and other professionals working in these areas. Undertaking more outreach activities and on-campus information sessions targeting final year students may help to further combat misperceptions and improve recruitment.

AB  - Due to societally imposed stigmatization, lesbian and gay (LG) older adults fear and prolong accessing long-term care (LTC) even though they need LTC at higher rates. Interventions that decrease negative attitudes toward LG older adults among LTC staff are a first step in addressing this problem. In this study, the influence of intergroup contact (IGC) on LTC staff members' attitudes toward LG was explored through the use of storytelling as a training mechanism. An embedded mixed-method approach was employed to collect and analyze responses of 60 LTC staff who participated in a storytelling event. Participants completed pretests, posttests, and participated in audio-recorded group discussions. The findings showed that storytelling had a significant (p = 0.001) and positive effect (d = 0.57) on participants attitudes toward LG. Qualitative analysis revealed 90 codes, 13 process codes, and 4 themes: making meaning of stories, seeking understanding, application to LTC setting, and debating. When guided by IGC theory, storytelling has potential for positively influencing attitudes of LTC staff members toward LG older adults. There is a need for longitudinal work to further test this model.

AB  - Although an ever-increasing number of social interactions are taking place virtually, people's relationships with their neighbors remain important. Apartment residents make up a growing proportion of the population in cities worldwide, but there is evidence that many find it challenging to form and maintain local social connections, especially those renting their home. This can negatively impact physical and mental health, and have implications for the management of apartment complexes and local area social sustainability. In this paper, we draw on interviews (n = 41) with renters of four large case study condominium complexes in Sydney, Australia, to investigate their local social interactions. The findings reveal that while many renters desire greater local connection, their opportunities and motivations are limited by factors relating to mobility, tenure security, prejudice, and exclusion from building-related governance. The paper concludes by considering the scope for interventions in design, management and governance to enhance opportunities for social connection.

AB  - In this paper, a tracking method for optoelectronic imaging platform of tethered balloon based on difference global positioning system/inertial navigation system is presented in detail. The location and attitude information of optoelectronic imaging platform, the azimuth and elevation angles of camera's line of sight are used by this method to locate the ground target at the centre point of the camera's field of view through corresponding coordinate transformation. And then, the method makes use of the update position and attitude information to solve the theoretical point of camera's line of sight inversely. Finally, an angle control commend will be sent to the inertially-stabilized turntable on the optoelectronic imaging platform, which will adjust its azimuth and elevation angle to make the camera's line of sight to the ground target. A lot of experiments are conducted, and the results show that the initial ground target is always in the centre of camera's field of view no matter how the balloon's position and attitude change, and the new location data of ground target has little difference with the initial location data, while the difference between them is close to 0.

AB  - Although employees' attitudes towards an autism employment programme may impact its ultimate success, there is limited research examining the implementation of these programmes from the perspective of non-autistic employees (i.e. co-workers and managers). This study explored the implementation of an Australian-based supported autism employment programme, drawing on qualitative data collected from 32 employees working with autistic trainees in the programme. Thematic analysis revealed three main themes. The programme benefits theme suggested that the employment programme and autistic trainees were generally viewed positively, with the programme benefitting both the trainees and the organisation, and leading to greater understanding of autism. However, negative attitudes and perceptions of special treatment contributed to programme challenges, which paralleled challenges that have been observed with other disability and diversity programmes. The design of this specific programme led to concerns about workforce integration, such as reduced opportunity for social and work integration into the broader workplace. This research extends the research on diversity management in the context of autism employment and provides practical insights into barriers and facilitators associated with implementing autism employment programmes.
   Lay abstract
   We asked 32 employees who work alongside autistic trainees for their thoughts about the autism employment programme that is running in their company. Specifically, we analysed their responses to understand how the employees perceived the autism employment programme's implementation and outcomes. How employees within an organisation view diversity, and the nature of specific programmes to increase the inclusion of certain groups of individuals (e.g. autistic employees) in their organisation, can impact the success of these programmes. Research in other organisations has suggested that diversity perspectives that fully support the inclusion of people with diverse backgrounds in the organisation lead to better outcomes. Thematic analysis of the responses in this study revealed that the views of the employees fit three main themes: programme benefits, programme challenges and concerns about workforce integration. The programme benefits theme suggested that the autism employment programme was viewed positively. However, negative attitudes and perceptions of special treatment contributed to programme challenges, which were similar to challenges that have been observed with other disability and diversity programmes. The design of this specific programme led to concerns about workforce integration, such as reduced opportunity for social and work integration into the broader workplace. This research extends the research on diversity management in the context of autism employment, and it provides practical understanding into ways in which organisational-based autism employment programmes are more and less successful.

AB  - Background. Provider biases and negative attitudes are recognized barriers to optimal pain management in sickle cell disease, particularly in the emergency department (ED).
   Measures. This prospective cohort measures preintervention and postintervention providers' attitudes toward patients with sickle pain crises using a validated survey instrument.
   Intervention. ED providers viewed an eight-minute online video that illustrated challenges in sickle cell pain management, perspectives of patients and providers, as well as misconceptions and stereotypes of which to be wary.
   Outcomes. Ninety-six ED providers were enrolled. Negative attitude scoring decreased, with a mean difference -11.5 from baseline, and positive attitudes improved, with a mean difference +10. Endorsement of red-flag behaviors similarly decreased (mean difference -12.8). Results were statistically significant and sustained on repeat testing three months after intervention.
   Conclusions/Lessons Learned. Brief video-based educational interventions can improve emergency providers' attitudes toward patients with sickle pain crises, potentially curtailing pain crises early, improving health outcomes and patient satisfaction scores.

AB  - Societal prejudice against people living with HIV infection is a formidable public health challenge that can negatively impact health and well-being. We recruited a multiethnic sample of 129 gay and bisexual men living with HIV who completed a brief survey; a subset of participants completed semi-structured qualitative interviews to contextualize the data. In bivariate analyses, stigma was positively and significantly correlated with depression (r = .402, p < .001) and negatively correlated with social support (r = -.482, p < .001). Qualitative interview results captured the mental suffering caused by stigma and coping strategies the men had developed. Although some of the coping strategies reduced the likelihood of experiencing acts of stigmatization, they also exacerbated the psychological stress of living with a stigmatized disease and limited the potential for social support. Our results highlight the need to scale up stigma-reduction programs, particularly those that can bolster social support networks. Copyright (C) 2017 Association of Nurses in AIDS Care

AB  - This study presents the findings of interviews conducted on the Orang Asli and stakeholders concerning the issue of representation of the community in media. The main objective of this research was to investigate the views and opinions of the community and stakeholders concerning the portrayal of the Orang Asli community in local newspapers. Interviews were conducted with members of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), personnel from the Department of Orang Asli Development (JAKOA), journalists from mainstream Malaysian newspapers and Orang Asli individuals. Findings revealed that a number of opposing views could be traced in terms of the prejudiced treatment given to the community in media. The NGO members and the Orang Asli individual unanimously advocated the various plights faced by the Orang Asli community in their daily lives, apart from being discriminated in the media. On the contrary, JAKOA members and journalists interviewed rebutted the claim that discriminatory projection of the community existed in the selected newspaper. Such contrary findings call for more studies investigating the portrayal of the community in the media to be undertaken.

AB  - Humans often behave discriminatorily towards others depending on their group membership. In this work, we establish a spatial Prisoner's dilemma model to investigate the relation between tag-mediated discrimination and cooperation. By introducing tag-mediated selective interaction, we find that if tag length is sufficiently large and individuals have moderate tolerance, cooperation can be promoted. Interestingly, both too high or too low tolerance may inhibit the emergence and maintenance of cooperation, which means that individuals may benefit from moderate tolerance in society. It is also shown that the high levels of cooperation stem from the high heterogeneity and clear boundaries between clusters. Our work should be helpful to understand both the evolution of human cooperation and the science of social identity. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: To explore exercise experiences and beliefs related to barriers among individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI).
   Methods: Seventy-four participants were recruited from a hospital, an independent living center, and online support groups. The Exercise Experiences and Spinal Cord Injury (EESCI) instrument included three scales to assess beliefs and experiences related to exercise participation.
   Results: Our study found 80% of participants do not currently engage in competitive exercise or sports, however 48.6% do participate in noncompetitive sports. Most participants found it difficult to gather up motivation and allocate time to exercise. Also, 52% of participants who visited fitness centers reported no availability of accessible exercise equipment and access for wheelchair users. T-tests and ANOVA analyses were conducted to compare group means between demographic variables. Results indicated the perceived barriers among persons with SCI regarding lack of personal resources/finances, beliefs about fitness center accessibility regarding equipment, and perceived negative attitudes held by fitness center employees and customers.
   Conclusion: Recommendations regarding how rehabilitation counselors can best work with clients on these issues including advocacy, counseling strategies, and future research directions are discussed.

TI  - "I Don't Feel Very Asian American": Why Aren't Japanese Americans More Panethnic?
T2  - SOCIOLOGICAL INQUIRY
LA  - English
AB  - Because Japanese Americans are among the oldest Asian American groups, they would be expected to have a high level of panethnicity since they apparently have much in common with other U.S.-born Asian Americans. However, most Japanese Americans interviewed for this paper did not identify panethnically with their Asian co-ethnics, but felt separate and distinct as Japanese Americans. Research on panethnicity has not sufficiently examined why some Asian Americans are not panethnic. Although Japanese Americans are homogeneously racialized as "Asians," they also resist their panethnic racialization by insisting on their distinct identity as Japanese descendants. They also continue to experience cultural and generational differences with other Asian Americans. In addition, even third and fourth generation Japanese Americans are not immune to the interethnic prejudices, hostilities, and homeland tensions that continue to simmer among different groups of Asian Americans. Finally, my interviewees were not interested in panethnic activism because they apparently no longer had compelling experiences of racial injustice and socioeconomic marginalization. Nonetheless, national-origins ethnicity and panethnicity should not be regarded as mutually exclusive opposites.

AB  - We propose that religion impacts trust and trustworthiness in ways that depend on how individuals are socially identified and connected. Religiosity and religious affiliation may serve as markers for statistical discrimination. Further, affiliation to the same religion may enhance group identity, or affiliation irrespective of creed may lend social identity, and in turn induce taste-based discrimination. Religiosity may also relate to general prejudice. We test these hypotheses across three culturally diverse countries. Participants' willingness to discriminate, beliefs of how trustworthy or trusting others are, as well as actual trust and trustworthiness are measured incentive compatibly. We find that interpersonal similarity in religiosity and affiliation promote trust through beliefs of reciprocity. Religious participants also believe that those belonging to some faith are trustworthier, but invest more trust only in those of the same religion religiosity amplifies this effect. Across non-religious categories, whereas more religious participants are more willing to discriminate, less religious participants are as likely to display group biases. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate the perceptions of health professionals who treat stroke patients in Kuwait regarding cultural influences on the experience of stroke and rehabilitation in Kuwait. Health professionals interviewed were from a variety of cultural backgrounds thus providing an opportunity to investigate how they perceived the influence of culture on stroke recovery and rehabilitation in Kuwait. Method: Semi-structured interviews were carried out with 12 health professionals with current/recent stroke rehabilitation experience in Kuwait, followed by thematic analysis of the verbatim transcripts. Results: The health professionals identified several features of the Kuwaiti culture that they believed affected the experiences of stroke patients. These were religious beliefs, family involvement, limited education and public information about stroke, prevailing negative attitudes toward stroke, access to finances for private treatment, social stigma and the public invisibility of disabled people, difficulties identifying meaningful goals for rehabilitation, and an acceptance of dependency linked with the widespread presence of maids and other paid assistants in most Kuwaiti homes. Conclusion: To offer culturally sensitive care, these issues should be taken into account during the rehabilitation of Kuwaiti stroke patients in their home country and elsewhere.

AB  - Sexual objectification is related to various negative attitudes and outcomes, including rape proclivity and reduced moral concern for the objectified, which suggests that objectification has implications for aggression. Our study examined the relationship between objectification and general aggressive behaviour in adolescents, including gang-affiliated youth. We hypothesized that (1) objectification would correlate with aggression towards girls, (2) gang affiliation would correlate with objectification and aggression towards girls, and (3) objectification and gang affiliation would interact such that strongly affiliated participants who objectified girls would be most aggressive towards them. We also hypothesized that sexual objectification would be a significant predictor of aggression above and beyond other factors, such as trait aggression. As predicted, objectification correlated with aggression towards girls and with gang affiliation, which also correlated with aggression. In addition, objectification predicted aggression towards girls, after controlling for other relevant factors. Further, we found an objectificationxgang affiliation interaction, which differed from our original predictions. Among participants low in gang affiliation, objectification of girls predicted levels of aggression towards them. Among those high in gang affiliation, however, objectification did not predict aggression. We discussed the implications of our findings for general aggression.

AB  - Skilled immigrant women represent a source of skills for the Australian economy. However, political and historical choices have formed and reinforced new emergent diasporic spaces in a country which remains marked by the British Empire's heritage. Drawing on 31 qualitative interviews, this article focuses on the career journeys of skilled immigrant women from the UK, India, China and the Philippines in a White Anglo-dominant society. By marking and de-neutralizing the racialized nature of Australian working spaces, the study examines how racism operates within Australian working spaces. It also addresses how White privilege dominates the Australian job market. By providing empirical data about highly skilled immigrant women's careers, this article sheds light on how racism and White privilege affected all the skilled immigrant women's career experiences, as there was prejudice and racism in hiring non-White women. The article, therefore, contributes to extending the literature on skilled immigrant women and racism in Australia.

AB  - We examine the degree to which women and men use humor to confront sexist jokes. We also test the social benefits and perceived effectiveness of confronting with humor. One-hundred-sixty-four (46% female) participants read about a male coworker who made a sexist joke and reported how they would respond in an open-ended format. Women were more likely than men to say they would respond with humor. Specifically, 16% of women, compared to 4.5% of men, spontaneously provided a humorous confrontation. Participants then read a second scenario that asked them to imagine a male friend making a sexist joke. We manipulated the confronter's gender and the type of confrontation (humorous versus serious) in the scenario. Confronters who used a humorous (versus serious) response were rated as more likeable but less effective. People often hesitate to confront sexism for fear of social repercussions. Given that humorous confrontation reduces social backlash, it might be worth slightly lower perceived effectiveness to increase overall rates of confronting sexism.

AB  - Background: Despite its efficacy, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is rarely available in the criminal justice system in the United States, including in problem-solving courts or diversionary settings. Previous studies have demonstrated criminal justice administrators' hostility towards MAT, especially in prisons and jails. Yet, few studies have examined attitudes among court personnel or compared beliefs among different types of personnel. Also, few studies have explored the relationship between MAT education/training and attitudes. Finally, few studies have directly compared attitudes towards methadone, oral buprenorphine, and extended-release naltrexone in the criminal justice system.
   Methods: We modified a survey by Matusow et al. (2013) to explore justice professionals' MAT attitudes, including associations with demographic variables, court role, and previous MAT education/training. After pi-loting the survey, we distributed it to a convenience sample of justice professionals registered for an educational summit held in Indiana in 2018. Data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods.
   Results: 231 Indiana court employees who had registered for a state MAT educational summit completed the survey prior to the summit, including judges, probation officers, law enforcement personnel, attorneys, probation officers, program directors, counselors, and case managers. Overall, participants had significantly more positive attitudes towards extended-release naltrexone than towards other medications (p value < 0.01). Court employee average attitudes towards methadone were significantly more negative than average attitudes towards oral buprenorphine; and average attitudes towards oral buprenorphine were significantly more negative than average attitudes towards extended-release naltrexone (p value < 0.01). Employment as a prosecutor or law enforcement officer was associated with more negative attitudes towards oral buprenorphine and methadone (p value < 0.05). Exposure to previous MAT training was associated with more positive attitudes for all medications (p value < 0.05). Compared to participants with graduate degrees, participants with less education had significantly more negative attitudes towards extended-release naltrexone (p < 0.05). Gender, age, rurality, and personal/family recovery history were not associated with differences in attitudes.
   Conclusion: As expected, court employees' attitudes significantly differ by medication, with average attitudes towards agonist medications being more negative than attitudes towards extended-release naltrexone. Despite a larger evidence base for the efficacy of methadone and oral buprenorphine, justice personnel may have more positive attitudes towards extended-release naltrexone due to targeted marketing by the pharmaceutical manufacturer, fears about diversion or misuse of agonist medications, and historic criminal justice hostility towards agonist medications. Importantly, previous education/training regarding MAT is associated with more positive attitudes, suggesting that more awareness-raising or capacity building educational interventions are needed, especially for prosecutors and law enforcement personnel.

AB  - Several studies have been conducted to confirm the robustness of intergroup contact theory to reduce sentiments among people from different races, nationalities, and languages. However, reviews conducted show that none of these studies examined the applicability of the intergroup contact theory to reduce prejudice among people from a multitribal context where the people share similar characteristics, but have sentiments against each other due to tribalism. The study examines the applicability of intergroup contact theory to promote positive attitudes among individuals to share knowledge in a multitribal context. A quantitative approach was adopted using questionnaires collected from two hundred and ninety-three lecturers from ten polytechnics in Ghana. Multivariate analysis revealed that equal status, cooperativeness and common goals have positive influence on an individual's attitude to share knowledge in a multitribal context. However, the influence of institutional support was not supported. The results of the study suggest the applicability of the intergroup contact theory explains how to promote a positive attitude in a multitribal context.

AB  - Bogda Nature Reserve is a World Heritage Site (WHS) in Xinjiang, China. Potential conflicts between community development and heritage conservation are important topics to study and may have an impact on the sustainable development of heritage sites. In this study, we conducted a survey with the community residents of the Bogda Nature Reserve to examine major potential conflicts arising from local residents' perceptions regarding conservation policy and its interventions. The results indicated that the local community supports heritage conservation and development, but they expressed negative attitudes towards their present living conditions, especially due to policy-induced loss of benefits. Through the research, three major conflicts were identified: (1) a divergence in residents' awareness of the WHS designation and the conservation policy (grazing restriction policy); (2) negative changes in living conditions compared to before the WHS designation; (3) the degradation of well-being caused by tourism. In addition, expectations from residents were combined to assess the implications for the present situation and advise on conservation plans to facilitate sustainable management in Bogda.

AB  - Since 2012, PMTCT Option B+ has been recommended by the World Health Organization to reduce vertical transmission but numerous adherence challenges remain. We conducted a qualitative study at baseline using six focus group discussions and 14 in-depth interviews to explore knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and challenges towards the Option B+ strategy for PMTCT among HIV-infected pregnant and post-partum women and health workers engaged in Uganda's national Option B+ PMTCT programme. Data were analysed using a thematic approach to capture latent and manifest content with the social ecological model as a theoretic foundation in order to make contextual sense of key stakeholders' needs for an effective Option B+ intervention. Overall, among all study participants, we found multi-level barriers to adhering to Option B+ cutting across all levels of the social ecological model. In line with the model, our study revealed barriers at personal, relational, organizational and societal levels. Some personal beliefs such as that the baby's health is more important that the mother's, organizational (negative attitudes and behaviour of health workers), structural such as poverty, work conflicts, fear and lack of disclosure related to community stigma were all critical obstacles to women adhering to the Option B+ programme. We found that both health workers and participants in the programme have a relatively clear understanding of the benefits of adhering to their treatment; though a more nuanced understanding and thus emphasis in counselling on side effects, is critical to helping patients adhere.

AB  - Background Sexual victimisation is an important problem that affects millions of people around the world, especially those with some kind of disability. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of self-reported and documented sexual abuse in people with mild or moderate intellectual disability and to analyse the sequelae that such experiences can have on their psychosocial health. Methods The sample consisted of 360 adults (50% men and 50% women) between 18 and 55 years of age (M = 39.87; standard deviation = 10.55). Results The prevalence of sexual abuse is 6.10% when it is self-reported (9.4% in women and 2.8% in men) and 28.6% when it is reported by professionals (27.8% in women and 29.4% in men). People who self-report cases of abuse present poorer quality of life, more negative attitudes towards sex and a lower capacity to identify situations that entail a risk of sexual abuse. Individuals who have suffered documented cases of abuse are more likely to present encopresis, social isolation, self-harm and a higher number of suicide attempts. Conclusions Our results evidence the need to have access to all sources of information so as to be able to obtain prevalence figures that match the real situation and to perform a proper analysis of the sequelae.

AB  - Purpose of the study: The Decisional Balance Scale (DBS) was developed to assess older adults' attitudes related to driving and includes both intrapersonal and interpersonal motivations for driving. This study examined the psychometric properties of the DBS ratings across 3 time points in a sample of 928 older drivers who participated in the Canadian Driving Research Initiative for Vehicular Safety in the Elderly (Candrive).
   Design and Methods: Measurement invariance of the DBS was assessed longitudinally and across gender.
   Results: Confirmatory factor analyses revealed that a two-factor model (positive and negative attitudes) for both driving beliefs related to the self and other provided a good fit to the data at each time point. Measurement invariance was supported across time and gender. Significant associations between the DBS factor scores and other driving measures (e.g., perceived driving ability and self-regulatory driving practices) provided evidence of convergent validity.
   Implications: The DBS appears to be a robust instrument for measuring attitudes toward driving and is recommended for continued use in future research on driving behaviors with older adults.

AB  - A large part of the European Roma community faces prejudices, discrimination, and social exclusion. This situation is more visible in Roma women. This study assesses gender sensitivity in the National Roma Integration Strategies (NRIS) of the Member States of the European Union. To do so, an adapted ad hoc tool was applied to the twenty-seven NRIS documents, making it possible to identify gender sensitivity in its "symbolic dimension"-declaration of principles and values that guide the action and/or proposing reasons of the intervention; and in its "operational dimension"-formal aspects of the intervention. In addition, this tool allowed us to classify the documents according to their gender approach. A low gender sensitivity is observed, which is more developed in the symbolic part. The line of action with greater gender sensitivity is health, followed by employment and education. Gender sensitivity is nonexistent for housing.

AB  - Background: Mental health nursing skills and knowledge are vital for the provision of high-quality healthcare across all settings. Negative attitudes of nurses, towards both mental illness and mental health nursing as a profession, limit recognition of the value of these skills and knowledge. Experts by Experience have a significant role in enhancing mental health nursing education. The impact of this involvement on attitudes to mental health nursing has not been well researched. Aim: To explore the impact of Expert by Experience-led teaching on students' perceptions of mental health nursing. Methods: Qualitative exploratory study involving focus groups with nursing students from five European countries and Australia. Results: Following Expert by Experience-led teaching, participants described more positive views towards mental health nursing skills and knowledge in three main ways: learning that mental health is everywhere, becoming better practitioners, and better appreciation of mental health nursing. Conclusions: Experts by experience contribute to promoting positive attitudinal change in nursing students towards mental health nursing skills and knowledge. Attitudinal change is essential for the provision of high-quality mental health care in specialist mental health services and throughout the healthcare sector.

AB  - PurposeIn Australia, nurse practitioners (NPs) were first endorsed in 2000. After more than a decade, the number of NPs remains relatively small with previous research suggesting medical resistance as a key reason for this. This article presents a selection of narratives from a study that explored the transition experiences of newly endorsed NPs with particular attention to relationships with their medical colleagues.
   Data sourcesA critical ethnographic approach was undertaken to explore the experiences of 10 Australian NPs who were interviewed three to four times for up to an hour throughout their first year of practice.
   ConclusionsParticipants' narratives provide insight into their transition to practice and the barriers and facilitators to their new role. In contrast to previous research, medical colleagues were generally supportive and collegial while resistance was demonstrated most often by senior nurses yielding positions of power.
   Implications for practiceThis study provides insight into the influences that key health professionals have over the transition of NPs. Despite the fact there are still negative attitudes being expressed by some medical associations, in this study medical colleagues were largely supportive of the NP role and that integral to the development of these interprofessional relationships was mutual respect and effective communication.

AB  - Significant changes to mental health policy have positioned consumers of mental health services as active participants in all aspects of service design and delivery, leading to the development and expansion of consumer workforce roles (Experts by Experience [EBE]). Negative attitudes of health professions pose a major limitation to the success of these positions. EBE involvement in mental health education has shown favourable outcomes, particularly enhancing more positive attitudes. Unfortunately, these positions remain limited in number and scope and have largely been supported by individual clinical academic champions (allies). This article presents findings from a qualitative study, involving individual interviews that explored the experiences and perceptions of allies who supported the implementation of academic positions for EBE. Data were analysed thematically. "Making it happen" was the overarching theme identified. It comprised the sub-themes: strategic or opportunistic?; developing an argument; using evidence; showing what EBE bring; getting buy-in and utilising existing relationships. The articulation of these processes provides a useful guide to other allies interested in supporting the implementation of these positions. The implementation of further positions will ultimately improve the attitudes of other health professionals towards Expert by Experience roles.

AB  - Background. Using measures of explicit attitudes, physical activity status has been established as a factor that reduces the stigma able-bodied people hold towards people with physical disabilities. This phenomenon is called the exerciser stereotype. However, whether the exerciser stereotype exists when using measures of implicit attitudes remains unknown. Objective. The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of negative implicit attitudes towards people with physical disabilities and determine whether implicit attitudes towards people with physical disabilities were influenced by the exerciser stereotype. Methods. One hundred able-bodied participants (82 females, 18 males) completed two implicit association tests (IATs): the Disability-Attitudes IAT and the Disability-Activity IAT. The Disability-Attitudes IAT measured implicit attitudes towards people who were not disabled relative to disabled; the Disability-Activity IAT measured attitudes towards people with a physical disability who were active relative to inactive. Results. Results revealed that 83.8% of participants had negative implicit attitudes towards people with a disability. Participants held more positive attitudes towards active versus inactive people with a physical disability. Conclusions. The study findings indicate that the exerciser stereotype exists implicitly and may undermine negative attitudes towards people with physical disabilities.

AB  - This paper examines limitations in how law enforcement and public health systems respond to domestic violence in Kyrgyzstan. Findings from interviews with domestic violence victims show that these women are subject to ineffectual practices and negative attitudes that tend to minimize domestic abuse and disempower victims. The findings reveal several problematic issues: inconsistencies in the implementation of the law, impunity for abusers because of both personal attitudes and social affinities between the police and abusers, ineffective enforcement of protective orders, and superficial processing of domestic violence cases by the legal system. Additional barriers to help-seeking include a lack of institutional support and guidelines for offering mental health services for victims as well as a scarcity of housing, childcare, and employment opportunities for women seeking to break the cycle of abuse. The findings underscore the need for society-wide changes in attitudes toward domestic violence, stricter mechanisms for enforcing the law, and mandatory training for service providers to facilitate the provision of more accessible and affirmative support to victims.

AB  - Objective. Global pandemic H1N1 was atypical of influenza in that it was associated with high symptom severity among young adults. Higher education institutions were therefore understandably concerned about the potential for high infection rates among students. This study examined intention to uptake H1N1 vaccine between November and December 2009, when the virus was classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as being in the pandemic phase. Design. A cross-sectional survey design was employed. Method. Two hundred university students completed a questionnaire battery comprised of health, belief/attitudes, and behavioural intention measures. Results. Findings suggested that non-intention to vaccinate is associated with a strong disbelief in its efficacy, in negative attitudes towards vaccinations, and in lack of perceived threat, which is underscored by a disinterest in others opinions, including authoritative bodies. Findings also suggested that there is resistance to the idea of vaccinations being mandatory. Conclusions. Vaccination intent is in some way linked to a range of attitudes and beliefs. The implication for health practitioners is that behaviour intent may be open to influence where psycho-education can create pro-vaccine attitudes and beliefs.

AB  - Buprenorphine partial opioid agonist pharmacotherapy, a key treatment for opioid use disorders (OUDs), is underutilized in the United States. Qualitative interviews, conducted in 2012/2013 and repeated in 2015, identified systemic barriers to providing buprenorphine treatment in Ohio. A representative sample of Ohio's Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Services (ADAMHS) county boards (n = 18) was selected based on percentage of OUD admissions, density of buprenorphine prescribers, and county board area population. Boards reported that the barriers to the use of buprenorphine in 2012/2013 included (1) negative attitudes toward the use of buprenorphine among substance use disorder treatment providers; (2) a lack of prescribers; and (3) lack of funding. The 2015 interviews suggested that the lack of prescribers surpassed lack of funding as the main impediment to buprenorphine expansion. Negative provider attitudes were no longer problematic. Concerns about buprenorphine diversion, however, had emerged as a new barrier. This article offers recommendations for future policy efforts to overcome these barriers and expand the use of evidence-based opioid treatments. It highlights the need for payers and policymakers to increase the number of buprenorphine prescribers to make best use of funding available to fight the opioid epidemic.

AB  - Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and the Broad Autism Phenotype (BAP) are more likely than individuals with typical development (TD) to report a sexual minority orientation (e.g., Bejerot and Eriksson, PLoS ONE 9:1-9, 2014; DeWinter et al., Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders 47:2927-2934, 2017; Qualls et al., Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders 48:3974-3983, 2018). This study operationalized and tested the fit of an existing model of sexual orientation to examine which factors are associated with increased sexual minority orientation (Worthington et al., The Counseling Psychologist 30:496-531, 2002) in individuals with TD, BAP, and ASD. The model was found to have adequate fit, chi(2) (130) = 374.04, p < 0.001; RMSEA = 0.07; CFI = 0.95; SRMR = 0.08. Heterosexism was found to be the only predictor of sexual minority orientation and a significant predictor in the BAP and ASD groups, with increased daily heterosexist experiences predicting greater sexual minority orientation in these groups.

AB  - Recent and forthcoming technological innovations highlight recycled paper products as a consumer market with promising potential. This study presents the examination of the recycled paper products purchasing behavior (RPPPB), as well as some of the factors that were assumed to affect these specific pro-environmental consumers' choices. Instead of the impact of the customary positive environmental attitudes, this study focused on those negative attitudes, namely Environmental Unconcern, that might be found able to inhibit RPPB. In addition, an effort was made to examine the role of an objective environmental knowledge scale, namely the Eco-literacy scale. A survey among 224 consumers residing in the Municipality of Thessaloniki, Greece was conducted. Multiple regression indicated that just Environmental Knowledge and not the Eco-literacy scale is a predictor of RPPPB. Further, SEM analysis though verified the theoretical assumption that knowledge moderates the relationship between attitudes and behavior. It was concluded that the negative direct relationship between environmental unconcern and the recycled paper products' purchasing behavior strengthens in the group of knowledgeable consumers. Implications are provided for all stakeholders that engage in the recycled paper products market.

AB  - Prejudices on psychiatric disorders frequently turn into stigmatizating attitudes, also among health care providers. The Opening Minds Stigma Scale for Health Care Providers (OMS-HC) was introduced in 2012 to measure stigma. No Italian versions of this tool exist so far. We wanted to investigate stigma among healthcare students in Italy, and to prepare an Italian version of the scale. A multicentric, cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of Nursing, Physiotherapy, Occupational therapy, and Dietistics students. The Italian version of the scale was obtained through back-translation.aEuro<spacing diaeresis>561 students were enrolled, median age 21 years, IQR [20;23], 62.22% females (n = 349). 262 students declared having met subjetcs affected by psychiatric disorders during their training; 50 had one or more psychiatric disorders in their lives. The Italian version proved valid and reliable. Older students had lower stigma scores. No differences existed between stigma scores according to gender and personal experience of mental illness.

AB  - Midwifery documentation is a recording and reporting evidence owned by midwives in performing care records that is useful for the interest of patient, midwives and health team. Documenting can be applied to the Subjective, Objective, Analysis and Planning (SOAP) method. This study aimed to determine factors associated with the implementation of the SOAP documentation by midwife in Pekanbaru City in 2016. This study was a quantitative analytical observational study with analytic cross-sectional study design. The population was all Independent Practice of Midwives or maternity hospital in Pekanbaru City with a total sample of 191 midwives with systematic random sampling procedure. Data were collected through interview using questionnaires and the midwives' documentation records. The results showed that variables which affected the implementation of SOAP documenting method were the documentation format (POR 15.988), supervision (POR 6.366) and attitude (POR 2.729). This means that midwives with the unavailable format are 16 times at risk of carrying out the documentation not in accordance with SOAP, while the midwives who are never supervised are 6 times at risk and the midwives with negative attitudes are 3 times at risk.

AB  - Despite evidence about the negative effects of verbal aggression in mental health wards there is little research about its prevalence or about the factors that predict the behaviour among inpatients. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of verbal aggression in a secure mental health service, and to examine the relationship of verbal aggression with risk factors for aggression in the risk assessment tool HCR-20 in order to establish whether, and with which factors, the behaviour can be predicted. Verbal aggression was measured using the Overt Aggression Scale (OAS) over a 3-month period across a heterogeneous patient group (n = 613). Over half the patients (n = 341, 56%) engaged in 1594 incidents of verbal aggression. The HCR-20 total, clinical, and risk management subscale scores predicted verbal aggression, though effect sizes were not large. Item-outcome analysis revealed that impulsivity, negative attitudes, and non-compliance with medication were the best predictors of verbal aggression and, therefore, should be targeted for intervention. There are key synergies between factors predicting verbal aggression and the core mental health nursing role. Nurses, therefore, are in a prime position to develop and implement interventions that may reduce verbal aggression in mental health inpatients.

AB  - Previous studies have down that erroneous Conspiracy Theory (CT) beliefs develop more strongly in people who have underlying conspiratorial reasoning styles and psychopathological traits and particularly when they are faced with stressful external events (Swami et al., 2013; van Prooijen, 2018). In this study, we test this proposition by examining the individual differences associated with the development of COVID-19-related CT beliefs during the pandemic. A total of 660 adults completed a survey that captured COVID-related CT beliefs and broader conspiracy beliefs, education, perceived stress and attitudes towards government responses. The results showed that COVID-19 related CT beliefs were: strongly related to broader CT beliefs, higher in those with lower levels of education; and, positively (although weakly) correlated with more negative attitudes towards government responses. However, no relationship was found between COVID-19 beliefs and self-reported stress. These findings hold implications for why some people are more likely to be resistant to public health interventions relating to COVID-19. The findings encourage more detailed exploration of the causes and sources of CTs and, in particular, the role of social media use and other information sources in the development and perpetuation of health-related CT beliefs.

AB  - Why do autocratic powers like China evoke negative attitudes from the citizens of some countries but not from others? Factors like economic and security threat are of course part of the answer, but this study finds that ideational factors exert a distinct effect. Drawing from social theories of the democratic peace and international relations more broadly, it observes that governments and their citizens form communities along ideological lines, which most prominently includes differences in liberal democracy. This argument implies that people within the liberal community tend to view authoritarian powers like China as having a harmful influence on the world. Furthermore, democratic citizens will evaluate China from the standpoint of liberal democratic norms. Because liberal norms are not just about having multiparty, electoral institutions, people's opinions on China could vary even if its single-party political system does not change. Three empirical studies drawing from cross-national observational data, two original survey experiment, and a difference-in-differences analysis of historical polls confirm that liberal democracy affects foreign perceptions about China. The findings advance debates about soft power, democracy and public opinion, and the role of ideology in international society.

AB  - Gypsies and Travellers are the unhealthiest group in British society, suffering from higher levels of physical and mental illness, lower life expectancy and with low levels of healthcare utilisation. They also continue to experience the highest level of prejudice and discrimination in society. While studies indicate that social networks play an important role in shaping health beliefs and the response to symptoms, evidence on the influence of networks on health is unclear and contradictory. This article draws on social network theory and research into the relation between discrimination and health to critically examine how networks mediate between collective experiences of racism and health-related behavior. Qualitative interviews with 39 adult Gypsies and Travellers were conducted in the South-East of England to explore the wider structural and institutional context and the influence those contexts play in shaping health beliefs and decisions whether to access formal health services. The findings indicate that the influence networks play in shaping health behaviour is dependent on the particular social context of the group and its status in relation to wider social structures, making generalization problematic.

AB  - Cigarette and water-pipe smoking are responsible for substantial harmful health consequences. However, studies have often examined these two types of smoking in separate study samples. Thus, this study examined differences and similarities among factors predicting cigarette and water-pipe smoking according to planned-behaviour theory within the same sample. Two hundred and twenty-one young Arab Israeli male adults (N = 221) completed demographic, self-esteem and planned-behaviour questionnaires. The study findings demonstrated that perceived ability to control one's water-pipe use was significantly higher than perceived ability to control one's use of cigarettes. With regard to attitudes, norms and intentions, no significant differences were found between cigarette and water-pipe use. Hierarchal multiple regressions showed that being Muslim, self-esteem, negative attitudes and negative norms contributed to the explained variance of both cigarette and water-pipe smoking. Self-control contributed to the variance in cigarette smoking, but not water-pipe smoking. The findings make an important contribution to our understanding of the differences and similarities in the factors predicting cigarette and water-pipe use among young male adults. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed.

AB  - The homeless are an underserved, local vulnerable population that can benefit from a service learning clinical practicum experience for baccalaureate prepared nursing students. Negative attitudes and disrespect among healthcare workers has been identified by the homeless as a barrier to healthcare. A service learning experience with a vulnerable population has been shown to change nursing students' attitudes and beliefs. A large university in a southern city partnered with a community based organization that provided services to the homeless to educate senior nursing students in a service learning experience. The goal of this project was to examine attitudes and perceptions of nursing students toward the homeless population before and after participation in a service learning clinical practicum experience. This case study utilized a pre and post experience questionnaire to collect qualitative data for the purposes of the project. The findings revealed students demonstrated a decrease in fear, an increase in empathy, and a deeper understanding of the advocacy role of nurses for people experiencing homelessness. Nurse educators are challenged to engage students with vulnerable populations to change the attitudes and perceptions for improvement in the overall health of communities served worldwide. Partnerships and service learning experiences can benefit all.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine how older LGTBQ adults were portrayed in mainstream Canadian newspapers and popular magazines. Our sample included stories that were published in English between July 1, 2016 and June 30, 2017 in three national newspapers, 13 provincial newspapers, one national online news website, and the five most widely-read popular magazines whose readerships included or catered to the mature market. Our content and thematic analyses of our sample of 190 stories resulted in three overarching findings: a) older LGBTQ adults were largely invisible; b) older LGBTQ persons were often depicted as victims of historical and ongoing discrimination and social exclusion; and c) older LGBTQ individuals were frequently portrayed as extraordinary role models and icons who demonstrated resilience and had paved the way for the younger generations. We discuss our findings in light of the extant research and theorizing concerning the role of the media in reflecting, reproducing, and/or challenging dominant social norms and ideologies, including heterosexism, homophobia, and age-based prejudice.

AB  - The emergency department is an important gateway for the treatment of self-harm patients. Nurses' attitudes towards patients who self-harm can be negative and often nurses experience frustration, helplessness, ambivalence and antipathy. Patients are often dissatisfied with the care provided, and meeting with positive or negative attitudes greatly influences whether they seek additional help.
   A quantitative design was utilised to measure emergency department nurses' attitudes towards deliberate self-harm. The 'Self-Harm Antipathy Scale', a validated questionnaire, was administered to a random sample of nurses in four emergency departments in the Republic of Ireland. A total of 87 questionnaires were returned (87% response rate). Results reveal that nurses show slightly negative antipathy overall, indicating positive attitudes towards self-harming patients. Attitudes were significantly different in accordance with a nurse's age. Education and social judgment also contribute to the way nurses view, interact and make moral decisions regarding self-harm patients.
   Evidence indicates there is need to improve the training, supervision and support of nurses caring for patients who self-harm, and that practical strategies should be implemented to manage the alienation process and inform practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim: The aim was to determine the initial knowledge of mothers about neonatal care and evaluate their knowledge, care and attitude changes following individual education.
   Materials and Methods: Questionnaire forms designed on the subject of infant care and nutrition were given to mothers right after delivery. Before being discharged they were informed by the doctor and breastfeeding nurse about nutrition, infant care, and the most common mistakes. These forms were reapplied on the 15th and 30th days in neonatal polyclinic controls and the changes were evaluated. The correct information was repeated to the mothers who were detected to have misinformation and wrong attitudes in the evaluations in each form application period.
   Results: A total of 100 mothers and their infants were included in the study. No difference was determined in the nutrition rates of infants with food other than breast milk on the first day, 15th and 30th days. However, the breastfeeding rates obtained were higher on the 30th day than on the 15th, with an interval of two hours, and in general breastfeeding rates were low on the 15th and 30th days. The rates of bathing the infants with and without a bathtub net were determined to be high on the 15th and 30th days. The change in the infants' sleeping positions, the place of sleep, and the presence of rails/guards around the crib on the 15th and 30th days were not found to be significant compared to the 1st day. There was a significant increase in the umbilical care rates on the 15th and 30th days. The increase in washing the clothes of the infants with soap powder, and the decrease in swaddling after the education were found to be significant. Furthermore, it was determined that the mothers received infant care information more frequently from the healthcare organisationon the 15th and 30th days compared to the 1st day. The highest correlation between the maternal education level and the post-education knowledge and attitude change was determined in uneducated and primary school graduate mothers (r(2)=0.35).
   Conclusion: The frequency and duration of the breastfeeding, infant umbilical care, swaddling, bathing, sensitivity to pinning jewellery on the infants, and whether or not mothers receive information about infant care from a healthcare organisation have changed positively after the education.

AB  - Background: The primary objective was to understand life satisfaction (LS) of patients with eating disorders (EDs) in relation to eating pathology severity, personal/familial ED history, and key demographic and anthropometric variables.
   Methods: Participants (N=60) completed the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), the Eating Pathology Severity Index (EPSI), and demographic questionnaires. Bivariate associations via correlations and multiple linear regression models were used to explore these relationships.
   Results: The SWLS mean score was 3.7 out of 7, suggesting it is below the population-based norm. LS was positively statistically significantly associated with private insurance, past ED, EPSI muscle building, EPSI restricted eating, and EPSI negative attitudes. When included in multiple linear regression, the model explained 33% of the variability of LS [F (7, 56)=3.4, rho=0.0054, R-2=0.33]. EPSI muscle building remained the strongest predictor (beta=0.13, rho=0.04).
   Conclusions: Based on the data, individuals who have/have had EDs scored lower on the SWLS than the general population. Individuals scoring within this range typically experience significant issues in several areas of life or a substantial issue in one area.

AB  - The Paternal Adjustment and Paternal Attitudes Questionnaire (PAPA) was designed to assess paternal adjustment and paternal attitudes during the transition to parenthood. This study aimed to examine the psychometric characteristics of the Portuguese versions of the PAPA-Antenatal (PAPA-AN) and -Postnatal (PAPA-PN) versions. A nonclinical sample of 128 fathers was recruited in the obstetrics outpatient unit, and they completed both versions of the PAPA and self-report measures of depressive and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy and the postpartum period, respectively. Good internal consistency for both PAPA-AN and PAPA-PN was found. A three-factor model was found for both versions of the instrument. Longitudinal confirmatory factor analysis revealed a good model fit. The PAPA-AN and PAPA-PN subscales revealed good internal consistency. Significant associations were found between PAPA (PAPA-AN and PAPA-PN) and depressive and anxiety symptoms, suggesting good criterion validity. Both versions also showed good clinical validity, with optimal cutoffs found. The present study suggested that the Portuguese versions of the PAPA are reliable multidimensional self-report measures of paternal adjustment and paternal attitudes that could be used to identify fathers with adjustment problems and negative attitudes during the transition to parenthood.

AB  - Our everyday life is influenced by an overproduction of images and by an iconogenic surplus that is connected to the proliferation of media. These contribute to both the quality and quantity of communication, but simultaneously amplify the knowledge gap between an audience that is able to critically process messages and another that is affected uncritically by prejudices and stereotypes. Bellino argues for a critical media education to address this gap by encouraging the development of students' critical thinking and social awareness. In this article we will discuss the results of a research-driven design project in which visual communication design students engaged with theories of cultural stereotypes and critiqued the role of media in their perpetuation. We adopted Kolb's model of experiential learning as recent published research demonstrates that art and design students have difficulties in conventional academic approaches to learning theory. In this regard students learned theories of stereotype through doing and making and embodied this learning in their critical project outcomes.

AB  - Previous research has shown that intrusive thoughts in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often focus on emotionally significant aspects of individuals' lives (e.g., values and beliefs). The current study sought to expand our understanding of OC symptoms related to sexual orientation (SO-OC symptoms) by investigating the roles of homophobia (i.e., negative attitudes, affect, and behaviors toward individuals with a same-gender orientation) and disgust propensity and sensitivity. A total of 592 self-identified heterosexual college students were recruited to complete measures of homophobia, disgust propensity and sensitivity, and SO-OC symptoms. Results of separate parallel mediation analyses indicated that the relationships between homophobic affect/attitudes and avoidance/aggression on one hand, and SO-OC symptoms on the other, were partially mediated specifically by disgust sensitivity, after controlling for gender. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed, including how homophobia can be conceptualized as a disgust response in the treatment of SO-OC symptoms, as well as how other constructs of potential interest (sexual and moral disgust, religiosity, conservative sexual ideology) can be examined in future research.

AB  - The authors examined the impact of race/ethnicity on responses to the Everyday Discrimination Scale, one of the most widely used discrimination scales in epidemiologic and public health research. Participants were 3,295 middle-aged US women (African-American, Caucasian, Chinese, Hispanic, and Japanese) from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN) baseline examination (1996-1997). Multiple-indicator, multiple-cause models were used to examine differential item functioning (DIF) on the Everyday Discrimination Scale by race/ethnicity. After adjustment for age, education, and language of interview, meaningful DIF was observed for 3 (out of 10) items: "receiving poorer service in restaurants or stores," "being treated as if you are dishonest," and "being treated with less courtesy than other people" (all P's < 0.001). Consequently, the "profile" of everyday discrimination differed slightly for women of different racial/ethnic groups, with certain "public" experiences appearing to have more salience for African-American and Chinese women and "dishonesty" having more salience for racial/ethnic minority women overall. "Courtesy" appeared to have more salience for Hispanic women only in comparison with African-American women. Findings suggest that the Everyday Discrimination Scale could potentially be used across racial/ethnic groups as originally intended.

AB  - The growing global trend of migration gives social psychological enquiry into acculturation processes particular contemporary relevance. Inspired by one of the earliest definitions of acculturation [Redfield, R., Linton, R., & Herskovits, M. (1936). Memorandum on the study of acculturation. American Anthropologist, 38, 149-152.], we present a case for considering acculturation as a dynamic intergroup process. We first review research stimulated by the dominant perspective in the field, Berry's acculturation framework. Noting several limitations of that work, we identify five issues which have defined our own research agenda: (1) the mutual influence of acculturation preferences and intergroup attitudes; (2) the influence of the perceived acculturation preferences of the outgroup on own acculturation and intergroup attitudes; (3) discrepancies between ingroup and outgroup acculturation attitudes as a determinant of intergroup attitudes; (4) the importance of the intergroup climate in which acculturation takes place; and (5) acculturation as a process developmental and longitudinal perspectives. We review research of others and our own that document each of these points: longitudinal and experimental studies, rarities in the acculturation literature, figure prominently. Research settings include Turkish-German relations in Germany, indigenous-nonindigenous relations in Chile, African migrants to Italy and ethnic majority-minority relations in the United Kingdom. We conclude with an agenda for future acculturation research and some policy implications of our analysis.

AB  - As a result of the pharmaceuticalization of chronic pain over the past three decades, opioid therapy became a common form of treatment for chronic pain patients. However, the overprescribing of opioids led to the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States. In response, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented guidelines reducing the number of opioid prescriptions-better known as opioid pharmacovigilance. Little is known about the sociocultural challenges during the transition to opioid pharmacovigilance for the resident/patient relationship. Using a thematic analysis, we analyzed 20 semi-structured interviews of residents and chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) patients in a family medicine residency practice. Findings suggest that due to the pharmaceuticalization of CNCP and the transition to opioid pharmacovigilance, residents develop a wariness to prescribe opioids, which leads to prejudice against patients. Patients report constrained care and a lack of alternative treatments for chronic pain, which inevitably leads to duplicitous behavior.

AB  - Although anticipated HIV-related stigma-the expectation that one will experience prejudice and discrimination in the future as a result of others learning his or her HIV positive status-is theorized to be a robust predictor of antiretroviral therapy (ART) non-adherence, the association between anticipated stigma and ART non-adherence has been inconsistent. It may be, however, that anticipated stigma reliably, but indirectly, contributes to poor ART adherence through other psychosocial mechanisms. In the current study, we examine whether anticipated stigma indirectly contributes to treatment non-adherence through increased medication concerns. In a cross-sectional study, 585 people living with HIV in Atlanta and Macon, Georgia completed measures of anticipated HIV-related stigma, HIV-medication concerns, and HIV-treatment adherence. A latent variable mediation analysis revealed that anticipated stigma was positively associated with increased medication concerns, which consequently contributed to treatment non-adherence. Results reveal a psychosocial mechanism by which anticipated stigma contributes to ART non-adherence.

AB  - An emerging theoretical framework suggests that neural functions associated with stereotyping and prejudice are associated with frontal lobe networks. Using a novel neuroimaging technique, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), during a face-to-face live communication paradigm, we explore an extension of this model to include live dynamic interactions. Neural activations were compared for dyads of similar and dissimilar socioeconomic backgrounds. The socioeconomic status of each participant was based on education and income levels. Both groups of dyads engaged in pro-social dialectic discourse during acquisition of hemodynamic signals. Post-scan questionnaires confirmed increased anxiety and effort for high-disparity dyads. Consistent with the frontal lobe hypothesis, left dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC), frontopolar area and pars triangularis were more active during speech dialogue in high than in low-disparity groups. Further, frontal lobe signals were more synchronous across brains for high- than low-disparity dyads. Convergence of these behavioral, neuroimaging and neural coupling findings associate left frontal lobe processes with natural pro-social dialogue under 'out-group' conditions and advance both theoretical and technical approaches for further investigation.

AB  - This article evaluates the use of deliberative methods for filling the democratic deficit arising from the shift to management through partnerships in conservation in developing countries. We ask whether deliberative approaches are feasible in a rural African context and the extent to which they can form a basis for socially just environmental decision making. In answering these questions we focus on two main concerns: the possibility of achieving satisfactory representation and the possibility of constructing counter-factual spaces of deliberation in which identity-based bias is suspended in favour of reasoned argument. Our survey data suggests that participants are themselves satisfied that representation is fair, and that the consensus attained at the end of deliberative events is not the result of domination of more powerful interests. Nevertheless, our more qualitative observations of individuals involved in deliberative events provide stronger cause for caution. It is not possible to leave power and prejudice out of deliberative processes, though well managed spaces of deliberation can temporarily mitigate these and in doing so provide some empowerment to normally marginalised participants.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand why young people and adults enrolled in co-produced, co-received Discovery College (a youth-focused Recovery College) courses, what their experience of participating was, and whether attitudes towards education changed as a result of course participation.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study used a pre- and post-participation survey to assess both the qualitative experience of participants in Discovery College courses, along with a quantitative component measuring change in attitudes to education and learning opportunities.
   Findings - The project found that participating in Discovery College benefitted young people through: an improved attitude towards education; and greater likelihood of participating in future study after completing a Discovery College course. People who participated in Discovery College courses, both young people and adults were positive about their experiences with the college and experienced positive attitude change. This work demonstrates the importance of Discovery College as part of a holistic approach to the care of young people with mental illness.
   Originality/value - This paper reports on one of the first evaluations of youth-focused Recovery Colleges globally. It provides evidence of the effectiveness of the Recovery College model for a youth cohort.

AB  - Background Across countries and disciplines, studies show male researchers receive more research funding than their female peers. Because most studies have been observational, it is unclear whether imbalances stem from evaluations of female research investigators or of their proposed research. In 2014, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research created a natural experiment by dividing investigator-initiated funding applications into two new grant programmes: one with and one without an explicit review focus on the calibre of the principal investigator.
   Methods We analysed application success among 23 918 grant applications from 7093 principal investigators in all investigator-initiated Canadian Institutes of Health Research grant programmes between 2011 and 2016. We used generalised estimating equations to account for multiple applications by the same applicant and compared differences in application success between male and female principal investigators under different review criteria.
   Findings Overall application success across competitions was 15.8%. After adjusting for age and research domain, the predicted probability of success in traditional programmes was 0.9 percentage points lower for female applicants than male applicants (95% CI 2.0 lower-0.2 higher; odds ratio 0.934, 95% CI 0.854-1.022). In the new programme, in which review focused on the proposed science, the gap remained 0.9 percentage points (3.2 lower-1.4 higher; 0.998, 0.794-1.229). In the new programme with an explicit review focus on the calibre of the principal investigator, the gap was 4.0 percentage points (6.7 lower-1.3 lower; 0.705, 0.519-0.960).
   Interpretation Gender gaps in grant funding are attributable to less favourable assessments of women as principal investigators, not of the quality of their proposed research. We discuss reasons less favourable assessments might occur and strategies to foster fair and rigorous peer review. Copyright (c) 2019 by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Religious fundamentalism is associated with Christian-Islamic conflicts globally, but the psychological reasons remain unexplored. Here, we show that fundamentalism is detrimental to interreligious relations because it makes Christians and Muslims alike reject common theological grounds and Abrahamic origins. Specifically, Study 1 demonstrated that such dual Abrahamic categories mediated the negative effects of fundamentalism on real monetary donations to outgroup children desperately in need (i.e., Save the Children Syria) among Christians but not Atheists. Of importance, this was the case only to the degree that Syrian children were perceived as Muslims and, hence, as part of an Abrahamic outgroup. Using a double-randomized experimental design, Study 2 demonstrated the causal effects of religious fundamentalism on Abrahamic categorization and of Abrahamic categorization on mutual resource distribution bias among Muslims and Christians. Together, these studies suggest that religious fundamentalism fuels interreligious conflicts because it crucially impacts basic categorization processes, with subsequent negative effects on intergroup relations.

AB  - We report the results of two experiments which test the potential of arts engagement for promoting prosocial intentions. Experiment 1 (N = 216) tested the impact of a participatory arts intervention (vs. a control condition) on children's empathy and interpersonal prosocial intentions. Experiment 2 (N = 174) tested the impact of a participatory arts intervention (vs. a control condition) on children's prosocial intentions toward outgroup members under competitive and non-competitive conditions. Experiment 1 showed that the participatory arts intervention significantly increased children's interpersonal prosocial intentions, but not their empathy. Experiment 2 showed that, under competitive conditions, the participatory arts intervention significantly increased prosocial intentions toward outgroup members, an effect that persisted for six months beyond the intervention. Under non-competitive conditions, the participatory arts intervention consolidated improvements in prosocial intentions toward outgroup members. Overall, the results confirm the hypothesis that participatory arts engagement can promote prosocial intentions during middle childhood.

AB  - Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurocutaneous genetic disorder that can be associated with severe complications, and it may shorten patients' lifespan and affect their quality of life negatively. This study aimed to examine quality of life constructs among adults with NF1 in Brazil. It is an exploratory, descriptive and cross-sectional study consisting of two stages, involving thirteen adult patients with NF1. The first stage was developed using a quantitative methodology, namely the WHOQOL-100 questionnaire; responses for the 13 patients were compared to a matched control group. The second stage comprised clinical-qualitative research whereby participants took part in a semi-structured interview; these data were analyzed using the categorical thematic analysis technique. There were no statistically significant differences in the questionnaire domains between the NF1 patients and the control subjects. Eighteen main themes were extracted from the interviews, showing interference of the NF1 visibility principally in psychological aspects and social relationships. Patients mentioned curiosity about NF1 and confusion about the distinctions between NF1 and contagious diseases, which lead to prejudice. They were concerned about the future and how the disease would develop in themselves and their offspring, and emphasized difficulties acquiring proper healthcare. These findings may help in planning healthcare for Brazilian NF1 patients and improving their quality of life.

AB  - Android access notifications are presented to users to obtain permission to access data and services on smartphones. The number of "unsafe" apps in the Android marketplaces underscores the importance of understanding what factors influence whether users engage in more effortful systematic processing of access notifications. We propose a multiple-motive heuristic-systematic model to examine how different motives impact users' processing modes. We find that the need to be accurate in making decisions (accuracy), the desire to defend preferred positions (defense), and social pressure from others (impression) influence how users process Android access notifications, and they do so in different ways.

AB  - Traumatic events have been considered significant risk factors for older adults' mental health, but the mediating mechanism and moderating effect of aging attitudes that underlie this relationship have yet been completely investigated. The attitudes of the elderly toward aging can be divided into two closely related but conceptually different dimensions, including positive and negative. Positive aging attitudes refer to optimistic feelings and experiences about aging, whereas negative attitudes toward aging are related to detrimental thoughts and sensations experienced about the increasing age. The purpose of this study is to explore the mediating and moderating roles of these two dimensions of aging attitudes between traumatic events and depression of the elderly in China. Data for this research come from the China Longitudinal Aging Social Survey (CLASS) of 2014. A nationally representative sample consisting of 11,511 Chinese older adults aged 60 and above was obtained through a stratified, multi-stage probability sampling method. The results revealed that the association between traumatic events and depression was mediated and moderated by positive and negative aging attitudes, controlling for gender, age, spouse, educational level, and ethnicity. Significance, implications, and limitations were discussed.

AB  - The progress and stereochemistry of Boyer's reaction were analyzed using several simple, chiral, alcoholic substrates, a variable amount of BiBr3 and different solvents. Basic solvents inhibit the reaction, while cyclohexane works very well; thus, it was our choice for the present study. In contrast to previous works, BiBr3 behaves as a true catalyst, being not consumed during the reaction. Although poisoning of the catalyst occurs to some extent, it does not prejudice the reaction yields (>90%). Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) monitoring of the reaction revealed that, for example, in the presence of alcohol rac-1, isomeric ethers 4 transetherificate to 3. We propose a unifying mechanistic model for both Boyer's and transetherification reactions, in which the electronic properties of n-adducts intermediates, formed by combination of bismuth(III) of BiBr3 and oxygen atoms of alcohols and ethers, play the key role for both the reactivity and the stereochemical outcome of the reaction.

AB  - Social cynicism, defined as negative beliefs about people and social institutions, shows negative impact on people's affective reactions. We extended this line of work by testing the moderating effects of social cynicism on the relationships between relationship conflict and its affective consequences.
   The data were collected using a computer-assisted random telephone survey method (N = 572).
   As expected, social cynicism and relationship conflict were related negatively to job satisfaction and life satisfaction, but positively to intention to quit. More importantly, the negative relationships between relationship conflict and job satisfaction and life satisfaction, and the positive relationship between relationship conflict and intention to quit were not significant when social cynicism was high.
   Our findings suggest that social cynicism is like a two-edged sword. Social cynicism is not only correlated with a range of negative attitudes and reactions, but also able to cushion people from the negative effects of relationship conflict on affective reactions.
   This study is among the first to examine the moderating role of social cynicism. Interestingly, social cynicism played a mitigating role on the relationships between relationship conflict and negative affective reactions.

AB  - Background: There is increasing awareness of diversity and inclusion needs within health and education systems to help address access and equity issues for minority groups. Although these calls are well known, there is little guidance for those working within these systems to create meaningful change. The purpose of this study was to critically review case-based teaching material within the authors' programmes through the lens of equity, diversity, and inclusion. Methods: A document analysis of clinical workshop cases extracted from all integrated therapeutics courses administered in 2020 was conducted. Results: Sex, age, and employment status were most commonly presented in cases (84.0%, 97.1%, 49.0% respectively). The majority (90.0%) of cases did not have ethnicity defined. The overwhelming majority of cases did not have living situation (68.3%) or sexual orientation (78.0%) defined. Conclusion: Case-based teaching material within a pharmacy programme was largely undefined according to patient demographics and diversity markers. Findings support the notion that teaching material may have a contributory role towards systemic racism, prejudice, and implicit bias.

AB  - Research has demonstrated that narratives can be effective in eliciting attitude change, especially when recipients become transported into the narrative. In three studies, we addressed whether some people are predisposed to be influenced by narratives and whether narrative and rhetorical appeals are differentially effective for different people. In Study 1, participants read an experimental or a control narrative, and completed measures of attitudes, need for affect (NFA), need for cognition (NFC), transportation, and transportability. The results revealed that NFA and NFC were positively correlated with transportation and transportability. In Study 2, participants read either a narrative appeal or a rhetorical appeal about cervical cancer and completed a measure of attitudes and the individual difference constructs. Study 3 was a replication of Study 2 using a different topic (organ donation). In both studies, the results revealed a consistent pattern of correlations among the individual difference measures. Further, we found that although the narrative and rhetorical appeals were judged to be of equal efficacy, the persuasiveness of the narrative appeal differed as function of individual differences in NFA and NFC. The implications for narrative persuasion are discussed. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - To fight the stigma attached to wild animals, we designed an environmental education lesson for urban pupils to enhance their understanding of and to transform their perceptions of wild animals. To assess the outcomes of our lesson, we designed pre- and post-lesson drawing assessments based on qualitative research methods. We recruited 27 urban pupils from a public elementary school in Taipei city as participants. From the pre-lesson drawing assessment, we identified four types of stigma. We compared the participants' drawings before and after the lesson and constructed four types of destigmatized perceptions of wild animals. The reflection on stigma attached to wild animals and our subsequent practice of eliminating stigma may serve as a means of improving the human-wild animal relationship and enhance our conservation efforts in a posthuman perspective.

AB  - This paper studies how public attitudes towards reduced immigration, the signature policy of the far right Sweden Democrats, respond once the party increases their political representation at the local level. To identify causal effects, we use panel data from 290 municipal election districts and compare otherwise similar elections where the Sweden Democrats either barely win or lose an additional seat. We estimate that a one seat increase for this far-right, anti-immigration party decreases negative attitudes towards immigration by 1.8 or 4.1 percentage points (depending on which national survey we use), contrary to the party's policy position. Consistent with these attitudinal changes, we find suggestive evidence the Sweden Democrats lose the incumbency advantage experienced by other small parties in Sweden. Exploring possible mechanisms, we find evidence for higher politician turnover and a rise in negative newspaper coverage. These findings demonstrate that political representation can cause an attitudinal backlash as a fringe party and their ideas are placed under closer scrutiny. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background
   Although general practitioners (GPs) play a central role in responding to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in Australia, the social history of their contribution in the early years has remained largely untold.
   Methods
   In-depth interviews were conducted with 21 GPs who provided HIV care between 1982 and 1996. De-identified transcripts were broadly coded in NVivo, then analysed for themes regarding GP experiences during the early years.
   Results
   Participants recalled a time of death, fear and prejudice, with large numbers of patients diagnosed with and dying from a highly stigmatised disease. An enduring emotional legacy resulted, with GPs developing survival strategies such as better managing relationships with patients, seeking mental health support and reducing working hours.
   Discussion
   These GPs represent the first generation of GPs in Australia caring for people with HIV. Understanding their experiences can inform and inspire the next generation, who inherit a much brighter future for HIV care.

AB  - Examinations of the relationship between attitudes about police and news media have regularly been undertaken since the Rodney King incident in 1991. Although cultivation theory, which argues greater news consumption will result in adoption of views of policing provided in the news, offers an appropriate theoretical framework for media studies of this kind, this body of research has largely lacked theoretical grounding. This study tests underlying premises of cultivation regarding the roles of overall news consumption, consumption of different types of news mediums, and exposure to negative news coverage in determining public perceptions of common policing outcomes. It also tests the mostly neglected area of how audiences perceive news they are consuming by considering how fair they deem the news portrayal of police to be. Using a sample of residents from a mid-sized city in California, results indicate consumption of Internet news is related to negative attitudes about police and exposure to negative news about police impacts perceptions, but only if the coverage is seen as fair. Implications for future research and advancement of cultivation as a theoretical framework in this area are discussed.

AB  - Accent bias, namely, an unwarranted prejudice toward interlocutors based on the sound of their speech, is a subtle yet powerful feature in the political life of language. This is especially so in democratic polities characterized by a diverse soundscape. The powerful and often covert nature of accent bias, and its capacity to generate significant epistemic injustice, poses a critical challenge to democratic theory and praxis, by challenging its commitment to liberty, equality, inclusivity, and reciprocity, and the very process of democratic reasoning. This article offers a comprehensive and empirically supported analysis of the political life of accent and advocates the cultivation of a sense of metalinguistic awareness among political actors, professional and otherwise, in order to counter the considerable risk of accent bias in democratic life. This cultivation draws on a conception of language that is socially embedded and dialogic and that can contribute to a more informed democratic theory of language.

AB  - The Sheep and Trees initiative was introduced by the Scottish Government in 2017 as part of wider efforts to support farm diversification and the promotion of tree planting aligned with meeting sustainable development objectives. Designed to promote integrated forestry in upland farming across Scotland, the initiative has, to date, had a very low uptake. This study explores attitudes within the Scottish upland farming community towards integrated forestry in general and the Sheep and Trees initiative specifically in an attempt to understand why uptake has been low. We found that although upland farmers had positive attitudes towards certain types of integration, reinforcing the findings of previous studies, negative attitudes were also widespread which could act as a deterrent towards participation in the Sheep and Trees initiative. The species of trees and styles of planting supported by the Sheep and Trees initiative appear to be misaligned with the preferences of farmers wishing to adopt an integrated forestry system. The paper concludes with some recommendations for refining the Sheep and Trees initiative which could enhance its attractiveness to large scale, commercial concerns and to other upland farmers interested in planting trees for amenity and environmental benefits.

AB  - In this paper, we studied the surface morphology of silver (Ag) thin flims deposited on glass substrate by using the DC magnetron sputtering with various power conditions at room temperature. The surface morphology, the optical and electrical properties were measured by AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy), UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Lambda 950), and the four-probe method (RTS-9, Four Probes Technology). The erect of the sputtering power on the root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of Ag thin flims was analyzed. The experiment results showed that the RMS value was lowest in the range from 60W to 80 W. At the same time, the erect of the thickness on optical transmittance and sheet resistance was also investigated. We found the rough surface was prejudiced to inducing sheet resistance and enhancing the optical transmittance when the thickness of Ag thin flims was thin. In addition, the excitation of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) was due to Ag nanoparticles (NPs) based on the analysis of the FDTD (finite-difference time-domain) simulation.

AB  - Numerous individual barriers, including negative attitudes toward opioid agonist therapies (OAT), have undermined HIV prevention efforts in Ukraine where the epidemic is concentrated in people who inject drugs (PWID). The recent availability of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX), an opioid antagonist, provides new opportunities for treatment and prevention, but little is known about patient preferences. We conducted qualitative analysis using focus groups (FG) of PWID recruited based on OAT experience: currently, previously, and never on OAT in five Ukrainian cities. FG included 199 PWID in 25 focus groups. Focus group transcripts were coded and analyzed using a modified grounded theory approach to identify common themes and domains related to attitudes about and preferences for XR-NTX, relative to other treatments. Interest in XR-NTX was supported if supervised opioid withdrawal and psychological support were assured. Other factors supporting XR-NTX included a focus on younger PWID early in their injection career and motivated for recovery. Perceptions of recovery included not receiving psychoactive medications like methadone or buprenorphine. With more information, XR-NTX could be a viable option for PWID in Ukraine, especially if concerns regarding withdrawal and psychological support are adequately addressed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose The authors' interest in the discharge of patients with no fixed abode (NFA) arose through repeatedly seeing patients discharged back to the streets. In 2017, the Royal United Hospital (RUH) treated 155 separate individuals with NFA, making up 194 admissions. Given these numbers, the best practice according to Inclusion Health's tiered approach to secondary care services suggests that the hospital should be providing a dedicated housing officer and a coordinated discharge pathway. As this is currently lacking, the purpose of this paper is to establish a Homeless Healthcare Team (HHT) and design a hospital protocol for the discharge of NFA patients with strong links into community support. Design/methodology/approach The literature review identified six elements that make up a successful HHT, which has provided the structure for the implementation of the authors' model at the RUH. Findings Along the way, the authors have faced a number of challenges whilst attempting to transform the model into a reality, including: securing funding; allocating responsibility; balancing conflicting priorities; coordinating schedules; developing staff knowledge and challenging prejudice. The authors are now working collaboratively with invested parties from the third sector, specialist primary and secondary care health services and local government to overcome these barriers and work towards the long-term goals. Originality/value Scarce literature exists on the practicalities of attempting to set up an HHT in a District General Hospital. The authors hope that the documentation of the authors' experience will encourage others to broaden their horizons and persist through the challenges that arise.

AB  - Infants universally elicit in adults a set of solicitous behaviors that are evolutionarily important for the survival of the species. However, exposure, experience, and prejudice appear to govern adults' social choice and ingroup attitudes towards other adults. In the current study, physiological arousal and behavioral judgments were assessed while adults processed unfamiliar infant and adult faces of ingroup vs. outgroup members in two contrasting cultures, Japan and Italy. Physiological arousal was investigated using the novel technique of infrared thermography and behavioral judgments using ratings. We uncovered a dissociation between physiological and behavioral responses. At the physiological level, both Japanese and Italian adults showed significant activation (increase of facial temperature) for both ingroup and outgroup infant faces. At the behavioral level, both Japanese and Italian adults showed significant preferences for ingroup adults. Arousal responses to infants appear to be mediated by the autonomic nervous system and are not dependent on direct caregiving exposure, but behavioral responses appear to be mediated by higher-order cognitive processing based on social acceptance and cultural exposure.

AB  - Despite the increasing policy focus on integrated dementia care in the UK, little is known about the opportunities and challenges encountered by practitioners charged with implementing these policies on the ground. We undertook an extensive, mixed-methods analysis of how a contemporary multidisciplinary dementia pathway in the UK was experienced and negotiated by service providers. Our pragmatic mixed methods design incorporated three types of research interaction with practitioners: (a) Semi-structured interviews (n = 31) and focus group discussions (n = 4), (b) Practitioner 'shadowing' observations (n = 19), and (c) Service attendance and performance metrics reviews (n = 8). Through an abductive analysis of practitioner narratives and practice observations, we evidenced how inter-practitioner prejudices, restrictive and competitive commissioning frameworks, barriers to effective data sharing and other resource constraints, all challenged integrative dementia care and led to unintended consequences such as practice overlap and failure to identify and respond to people's needs. In order to more successfully realise integrated dementia pathways, we propose innovative commissioning frameworks which purposefully seek to diffuse power imbalances, encourage inter-provider respect and understanding, and determine clear lines of responsibility.

AB  - Ethno-religious tolerance is crucial for establishing sustainable democracy, which is scarce in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). This study provides an empirically grounded and nuanced critique of Orientalist studies simply pointing at Islam. It presents a systematic analysis of the impact of religious belonging, belief, and behavior on social tolerance in the MENA, based on 32 uniquely synchronized Arab Barometer and World Values surveys. This study's major contributions are that it (a) provides unique empirical insights into the multifaceted impact of religiosity on social tolerance in the region, (b) develops the 3-Bs approach to a context-sensitive framework, and (c) shows that and explains why Islam has both negative and positive influences. The analyses show (i) that the degree to which people identify with their religion has no negative impact on social tolerance, with exception of the few cases in which Islamist forces hold power; (ii) that under "normal" circumstances orthodox-literalist believers are more tolerant towards others, but less so if they feel repressed or threatened in society (which only holds for a few cases); and (iii) that mosque attendance has a negative impact on ethno-religious social tolerance, and this effect is particularly strong if conservative Islamist states coercively regulate religion and its content, such as communication via sermons. All things considered the multifaceted 3-B approach is found to hold well once the MENA-specific aspects and its diverse society-state-religion relations are incorporated as sources of both possible threats and socialization.

AB  - Undergraduate psychology students have been largely excluded from interprofessional education (IPE) initiatives. In contrast to many health professions, undergraduate psychology students do not engage in work placements as part of their degree, and many enter careers outside the health care context. However, the collaborative skills gained through an IPE experience may well be beneficial to students who work in this wider context. This research examines whether undergraduate psychology students' views of IPE vary according to their planned career directions, and if so, whether the perceived relevance of IPE mediates the relationships. A sample of 188 Australian university undergraduate psychology students completed an online questionnaire following completion of a first-year IPE health sciences program. Path analysis indicated that psychology students' attitudes towards IPE are associated with both professional identification and practitioner orientation, fully mediated through the perceived relevance of IPE to future career and study plans. Stronger professional identification and practitioner orientation were associated with greater perceived relevance and more positive and less negative attitudes towards IPE. Placing a stronger emphasis on the generalizability of IP skills taught may increase students' awareness of the relevance outside of the health context, reducing disengagement of students planning alternative careers.

AB  - In the present study we investigated the evaluation of body shapes in patients with restrictive anorexia nervosa (AN) on both automatic and controlled levels. The first aim of the study was to examine whether an ultra-thin ideal or negative attitudes toward overweight might be the motivation behind pathological restriction. The second aim was to investigate the relationship between body figure evaluations, eating disorder symptoms and mood. A Modified Affective Priming Test was used to measure implicit evaluations of body silhouettes, while a Likert scale was used to assess explicit evaluations. The study involved 35 women with restrictive anorexia nervosa and 35 age- and education-level-matched controls with normal body weight. In contrast to the control group, the patients did not show a positive attitude toward the ultra-thin body shape on the automatic level. The AN group both on the automatic and the self-reported levels evaluated the overweight body as negative. Depression and anxiety did not influence body evaluation. Strong negative evaluation of overweight appears to be a key issue in AN rather than positive evaluation of ultrathin role models. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examine the exigencies and impact of examination cheating, focusing specifically on the prevalence and risk of cheating taking place in examination venues. We document the problem with global coverage and note the consistency of the scourge and highlight the different approaches of institutions to dealing with the risk. Stressing the prejudice arising from examination cheating to both universities specifically and society generally, one of the root causes of the risk, namely the moral compass and ethical norms of university students and the societies in which they function, is discussed. The innovation of students when working out cheating practices and the facilitating effects of technology are considered as a backdrop to exemplars of good practices that have been implemented to mitigate the reality and risk of examination fraud. Recognising examination cheating as a fraud on society and a critical risk to university reputation, we question whether university leadership recognises the risk and gives it adequate (and responsible) emphasis in strategic and operational organisational risk identification and management.
   Significance:
   Cheating in examinations, and especially in the examination venue, is a global scourge. A comparison of global good practices is presented which provides a framework for institutional discussion to begin to address and transparently deal with the issues and impact of examination cheating.
   Acknowledging technology as one of the significant enablers of examination fraud and noting the constraints confronting universities, there is nevertheless a critical need for institutions to mitigate the risk. In not doing so, universities, which are fundamentally supported by the fiscus and public taxpayers, are committing a fraud on society.
   The attitude of some students and academic staff, as well as public perceptions to examination cheating raise the lid on a moral decay that is beginning to manifest in society globally.
   Universities are challenged to address the issue of examination cheating proactively, openly and honestly. The repercussions of failing to do so are highlighted and exemplars are provided of what can and has already been tried and tested to mitigate the risks.

AB  - Aim Breast cancer is the most frequent malignant tumor among Chinese women. Breast self-examination (BSE) is a simple, effective method for early detection of screening and it is essential for the prevention and control of breast cancer. The aim of this study was to create a hypothetical model to determine the factors influencing women's BSE behavior in Eastern China.
   Methods A survey was conducted using an online questionnaire and targeting 1200 women aged 18-70 years in Eastern China. Collected data were analyzed using ibm spss 25.0 and amos 24.0 software.
   Results The final model showed a desirable fitness to sample data. A direct positive relationship exists between knowledge on risk factors and BSE. A direct positive association was found between positive attitudes and BSE, while negative attitudes have a direct negative impact on BSE. Objective factors not only had a significant direct impact on BSE, but also directly affected the positive attitudes. Positive attitudes play an intermediary role between objective factors and BSE.
   Conclusion Knowledge on risk factors about breast cancer, attitudes toward BSE and objective factors are new predictors which may influence BSE by using the structural equation modeling method.

AB  - Educational travel, a neglected area of study in sustainable tourism, has grown substantially over the last 20 years in part as a response to institutional missions to promote international education, but also as a result of the USA's national security concerns to nurture a global citizenry. Considerable future growth is predicted following the bipartisan Lincoln Commission report and under the pending new legislation in the USA. Our pre-test/post-test study of almost 5% (n = 651 US students) of the entire short-term, US educational travel market to Australia and New Zealand between 2008 and 2009 revealed significant differences between the cohorts of the two programs, both of which focused on sustainable development. The Australia program not only produced significant increases in global citizenship (as measured by scores on consumer behaviors, support for environmental policies, and environmental citizenship) beyond that of the New Zealand program, but any initial differences between the programs were erased following participation. Reasons for the differences in attitude change are discussed. Analysis also noted key differences between students with different political orientations, but no gender differences. Implications for managing educational travel, marketing Australia's and New Zealand's tourism, sustainable tourism planning, and theory advancements are discussed.

AB  - Islam is the federal religion of Malaysia and prohibits homosexuality. However, homosexual people undeniably exist in the community. Because all healthcare professionals are required to abide by the code of professional conduct that demands fair deliverance of care to patients, it is important that they are able to draw a line between professionalism and personal judgment when dealing with homosexual patients so that the standard of care for these individuals is not jeopardized. This study examined Malaysian nursing students' attitudes toward homosexuality. Four hundred and ninety-five nursing students from University Malaya Medical Centre were recruited to participate in this study. Attitudes toward homosexuality and degree of religiosity were measured using the Homosexuality Attitude Scale (HAS) and the Duke University Religion Index (DUREL), respectively. The results showed that nursing students in Malaysia have negative attitudes toward homosexuality, and there is a significant correlation between homosexuality and intrinsic religiosity. These findings provide important baseline information for future research studies, and indicate the need for educational awareness interventions to increase tolerance toward homosexuals among nursing students in Malaysia.

AB  - Accusations of wrongdoing, baseless or justified, can severely tarnish a company's reputation. Once disseminated, even baseless accusations can persist and cause considerable damage for a company. This study examines the proactive crisis communication strategy of inoculating individuals against invalid accusations before they go viral. An experiment was conducted in a real world consumer context among members of an online consumer panel using an electronics discounter as the research stimulus. Expanding previous inoculation research on the role of value-relevant involvement for inoculation and the effectiveness of inoculation in the case of different preexisting attitudes, we find that consumers' identification with a company moderates inoculation effectiveness. Consumers strongly opposing or disidentifying with the company under attack reported fewer negative beliefs and attitude change as well as fewer intentions to spread the accusation after being exposed to an inoculation message refuting the claim against the company. Consumers strongly identifying with the company, on the other hand, did not profit from such an inoculation. Their level of identification alone was sufficient to prevent attitude slippage. Implications for public relations research and practice are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Genome editing technologies represent a potential revolution in plant breeding methods. However, there is a limitation in understanding the consumers' attitudes toward foods derived from this novel technology. Especially, the lack of knowledge and confusion in differentiating with genetically modified (GM) products could potentially restrict further development of genome-edited (GE) foods. Therefore, a survey of 407 Vietnamese consumers was conducted to analyze the implicit and explicit attitudes toward GE foods compared to GM foods under different information treatments. The implicit association test (IAT) was used for implicit evaluation, and semantic differential scales were used for explicit evaluation. As our important results, under the context of condensed information, the implicit measure shows a high correlation between attitudes toward GE and GM foods. This result is one of the initial pieces of evidence that has been shown about the relationship among consumers' attitudes toward GE and GM foods. And as our result has been pointed out that providing in-depth information help to reduce the correlation between attitudes toward GE and GM foods. This evidence is important to suggest effective risk-benefits communication to help reduce negative attitudes toward GE food and increase consumers' acceptance.

AB  - Anomalous experiences (AE) (uncommon experiences or one that is believed to deviate from the usually accepted explanations of reality: hallucinations, synesthesia, experiences interpreted as telepathic...) and altered states of consciousness (ASC) have been described in all societies of all ages. Even so, scientists have long neglected the studies on this theme. To study AE and ASC is not necessary to share the beliefs we explore, they can be investigated as subjective experiences and correlated with other data, like any other human experience. This article presents some methodological guidelines to investigate these experiences, among them: to avoid dogmatic prejudice and to 'pathologize' the unusual; the value of a theory and a comprehensive literature review; to utilize a variety of criteria for pathology and normality; the investigation of clinical and non-clinical populations; development of new appropriate research instruments; to be careful to choose the wording to describe the AE; to distinguished the lived experience from its interpretations; to take into account the role of culture; to evaluate the validity and reliability of reports and, last but not least, creativity and diversity in choosing methods.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is often seen as primarily caused by weight, and its amelioration associated with individual behaviour change, which has the potential for negative consequences for people living with the disease. The aims of this study were to explore how weight was framed by diabetes resource nurses and to determine the implications of that framing for nurse practice in a primary care setting in Australia. The research was a qualitative empirical case study using semistructured interviews with nurses focusing on meanings and interpretations. The findings were interpreted using a constructivist epistemology of both inductive and deductive inference. The study found that nurses viewed overweight and obesity as unhealthy and the primary causes of T2D, and that weight was frequently discussed in the health care encounter. Nurses emphasised individual responsibility through behaviour change to manage T2D, downplaying other known causes such as age and family history and important social inequalities. Studies show that nurses have negative attitudes towards overweight and obese patients. The implications of this research are that the nurses' views could potentially negatively affect clients' management of T2D, which has the potential for poor health outcomes.

AB  - Various factors have been implicated in vaccine hesitancy and loss of vaccine confidence, but the specific ways and particular moments in which immunisation programmes and vaccine scares are politicised, exacerbating negative attitudes about vaccines and leading to retrogressive policies, have been relatively under-examined. This paper applies the concept of ?medical populism? [Lasco, G., & Curato, N. (2019). Medical populism. Social Science & Medicine, 221(1), 1?8. doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2018.12.006] to examine these under-studied dynamics, looking at political actors and how they ?construct antagonistic relations between ?the people? whose lives have been put at risk by ?the establishment?? in the performance of vaccine-related crises. Four illustrative cases ? from Nigeria, Italy, Ukraine, and the Philippines ? are presented to demonstrate the descriptive and analytic value of medical populism beyond the framing and characterisation of the politics of health. The study underscores the need to understand people's perceptions and ?explanatory models? of vaccines and vaccine failures, to look at the political milieux that underpin immunisation programmes, and to anticipate and address knowledge claims made by political actors.

AB  - The traditional prevailing perspectives on attitudes assume that attitudes, once formed, are relatively stable over time. However, research has revealed that attitudes may be influenced by different factors that may change them. The present pre-post-test study aims to understand if the police recruits' attitudes towards offenders change after police training and analyse the impact of sociodemographic and personality variables on recruits' attitudes towards offenders. The Attitude Scale towards Offenders (ATO) and the NEO-FFI Personality Inventory were used in a sample of 74 recruits of a Portuguese Police Force at the beginning and the end of the police training program. Results revealed that, at the end of the training, recruits hold more negative attitudes towards offenders. Those who had previous professional experience in the army hold more positive attitudes, but only at the beginning of the training. Only attitudes towards offenders at the beginning of the police training program predict recruits' attitudes towards offenders at the end of the training. These results emphasize the importance of initial and continuous training of recruits and police officers.

AB  - What is the attitude of the general public towards hunting? As a recreational activity, hunting stands apart from other forms of outdoor recreation like birdwatching in that it involves the pursuit and killing of wild animals. Today, it is in a tight spot. It has been criticized from animal ethics points of view, but it has also been commended as an activity which allows us to take responsibility for procuring our own food. The paper reports a national survey of the general public using an Internet-based questionnaire sent to a representative sample of the Danish public in 2012 (n=1001). Attitudes towards recreational hunting among the adult general public were examined in relation to gender, age, education, income and residence, association with hunters, hunting conditions, and wildlife value orientations. 43% of the general public had a positive attitude, 31% were indifferent, and 26% had a negative attitude to recreational hunting. Older respondents and rural residents had more positive attitudes towards hunting than younger and urban residents. Some of the conditions under which hunting occurs affected attitudes negatively, especially the hunting of farm-reared and released game birds, hunting organized as a group hunt, and single day leases of hunting grounds. Respondents with a "mutualist" wildlife value orientation had the most negative attitude towards hunting (39%), "distanced" respondents were the most indifferent (44%), and "utilitarians" were the most positive (61%). Assessing levels of public support for recreational hunting is important if we are to gauge whether hunting as a recreational and socio-cultural activity can be sustained. A rethink of hunting as part of the leisure industry should be considered, because the least positive attitudes were found in relation to the commercial aspect of hunting and this could result in tighter regulation with further effects on management practices.
   Management Implications: The public opinions and public preferences concerning recreational hunting are complex. However, this study revealed some factors relevant for regulatory and managerial development in relation to outdoor recreation: age (younger respondents were least supportive of hunting), urbanisation (living in an urban environment enhanced negative attitudes), compatibility of recreational hunting with other outdoor leisure activities.

AB  - Estimating the parameters of sinusoidal signals is a fundamental problem in signal processing and in time-series analysis. Although various genetic algorithms and their hybrids have been introduced to the field, the problems pertaining to complex implementation, premature convergence, and accuracy are still unsolved. To overcome these drawbacks, an enhanced genetic algorithm (EGA) based on biological evolutionary and mathematical ecological theory is originally proposed in this study; wherein a prejudice-free selection mechanism, a two-step crossover (TSC), and an adaptive mutation strategy are designed to preserve population diversity and to maintain a synergy between convergence and search ability. In order to validate the performance, benchmark function-based studies are conducted, and the results are compared with that of the standard genetic algorithm (SGA), the particle swarm optimization (PSO), the cuckoo search (CS), and the cloud model-based genetic algorithm (CMGA). The results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the others in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness against noise. Finally, parameter estimations of real-life sinusoidal signals are performed, validating the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - It has been studied that there are many young immigrants who are at risk of being marginalized in Finnish Lapland. There are less opportunities for participating in activities in northern Finland, access to the local labor market is difficult, and there are few activities that support the youth immigrant's own culture. These dilemmas may have regional differences, but the economic prospects for living a meaningful life are seen to be weaker in the northern Finland than in southern Finland, and the local attitude towards immigrants is also not so positive. In this research, an intergroup theoretical framework is used to support an understanding of the personal identity of immigrant and Finnish youth, which is transformable by increasing contact between "self" and "context." A proactive orientation (self-esteem and efficacy empathy, responsibility) is an effective way to adapt to a new circumstance. Improving the self-determination of both native and immigrant youth in an intercultural context may integrate both groups into a diverse society, and so reduce prejudice and stereotyping attitudes. This article discusses how a proactive orientation could influence adolescents in their interrelationship development and help to balance their self- esteem, and culminate in feelings of happiness and satisfaction. As a conclusion, well-being or optimism along with the happiness of youth could rely on possessing a positive personal trait that contributes to the positive psychology of autonomy, interaction (or relatedness) and competences (problem solving skills).

AB  - Psychological flexibility refers to attending to the present moment and accepting internal experiences in order to effectively adapt behavior in the pursuit of valued goals. Previous research has linked mental health stigma to lower levels of psychological flexibility (i.e., psychological inflexibility or experiential avoidance), resulting in negative attitudes toward those affected by mental health problems. In the current study, 570 individuals participated in an online survey in which they completed measures of depressive symptom severity, psychological inflexibility, and different types of public mental health stigma. Results showed that psychological inflexibility statistically mediated the relationship between depression symptomatology and public stigma toward others with depression, but not the relationship between depression symptomatology and stigma about others receiving treatment for depression. In other words, one's own depressive symptoms increased the likelihood of holding stigmatizing attitudes toward others with depression, and this process worked through increased levels of psychological inflexibility. In contrast, the relationship between people's increased depressive symptoms and stigmatizing attitudes about others receiving mental health treatment was not dependent on their psychological inflexibility level. The findings are discussed within an emerging contextual behavioral science model of stigma.

AB  - Do infants develop meaningful social preferences among novel individuals based on their social group membership? If so, do these social preferences depend on familiarity on any dimension, or on a more specific focus on particular kinds of categorical information? The present experiments use methods that have previously demonstrated infants' social preferences based on language and accent, and test for infants' and young children's social preferences based on race. In Experiment 1, 10-month-old infants took toys equally from own- and other-race individuals. In Experiment 2, 2.5-year-old children gave toys equally to own- and other-race individuals. When shown the same stimuli in Experiment 3, 5-year-old children, in contrast, expressed explicit social preferences for own-race individuals. Social preferences based on race therefore emerge between 2.5 and 5 years of age and do not affect social choices in infancy. These data will be discussed in relation to prior research finding that infants' social preferences do, however, rely on language: a useful predictor of group or coalition membership in both modern times and humans' evolutionary past.

AB  - Recent advances in cancer therapy have resulted in an increased number of long-term cancer survivors. However, because of their treatment, women might be confronted with impaired fertility. The options of fertility preservation (FP) techniques are increasing. The goal of this study was to assess knowledge about, and attitudes towards, fertility preservation in young female cancer patients. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted including 155 former female cancer patients from English and German speaking countries. The survey consists of questions about attitude towards, and knowledge about, fertility preservation. Results show that knowledge about fertility preservation was limited among participants. Positive attitudes towards fertility preservation significantly outweighed negative attitudes. Knowledge and attitude did not differ according to language or different healthcare systems. Confidence of knowledge was significantly higher in women who underwent any FP procedure compared to those who did not. Greater emphasis should be placed on counselling opportunities, the provision of adequate information and supporting material. A better understanding of these issues will hopefully enhance patients' decision-making about FP options and assist the development of strategies to improve quality of care.

AB  - Health care providers (HCPs)' stigma perception can determine their behaviors and attitudes toward providing mental health services. This study aimed to assess stigma components of knowledge, attitude, and behavior among HCPs in Jordan. A cross sectional descriptive study using a convenience sample of 541 HCPs utilized. The Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS), the Mental Illness: Clinicians' Attitudes Scale (MICA) and the Reported and Intended Behavior Scale (RIBS) were used to evaluate HCPs' perceived stigma. Mean scores on RIBS were lowest and at mid-point for MAKS and MICA. Results revealed significantly that HCPs perceived stigma demonstrated in greater negative attitudes correlated with less knowledge (r = .18, .17; p = .01, .009) for both physicians and nurses. And between attitudes and reported intended behavior (r = .13, p = .025) among nurses. This make them less likely to deal with mental health problems in primary healthcare centers. The reported stigma in this context is possibly due to lack of training, inadequate experience, and cultural dynamics. Indeed, awareness programs are important to prepare those HCPs to provide mental health care in these settings shall they are asked to.

AB  - As the overdose crisis in North America continues to deepen, public health leaders find themselves responding to sensational media stories, many of which carry forms and themes that mark them as urban legends.
   This article analyzes one set of media accounts - stories of misuse of naloxone, an opioid overdose antidote distributed to people who use drugs - through the lens of social science scholarship on urban legends. We suggest that these stories have met a public need to feel a sense of safety in uncertain times, but function to reinforce societal views of people who use drugs as undeserving of support and resources.
   Our field has a duty to speak out in favour of evidence-based programs that support the health of people who use drugs, but the optimal communication strategies are not always clear. Drawing attention to the functions and consequences of urban legends can help frame public health communication in a way that responds to needs without reinforcing prejudices, with application beyond naloxone to the other urban legends that continue to emerge in response to this crisis.

AB  - Biological essentialism, the belief that human attributes are determined by biology, is a core component of essentialist thinking. Previous studies have shown that individual differences in essentialist thinking are associated with heuristic thinking, cognitive ability and style, conservative values, and prejudice. None, however, have examined whether biological essentialism is itself heritable, or the extent to which familial aggregation explains associations with core correlates. In order to do this, we analyzed data from a genetically informative sample of families with twins in Australia (N = 2,103), as well as general population samples from the UK (N = 501) and the US (N = 500). Genetic factors had little influence in individual differences in biological essentialism or in its relationship with heuristic thinking. Conservative values were genetically correlated with cognitive styles (i.e., need for closure and heuristic thinking). These findings support a bigger role of genes in explaining the relationship between cognitive processes and moral reasoning and ideology than they do the association between cognitive processes and essentialist thinking.

AB  - Social robots have been and are currently being used in many projects, research initiatives and experiments, but we know relatively little about them compared to humans when performing a social task such as teaching. Using an experiment in which a robot and a human teacher were used for teaching computational concepts to a group of K-12 students, the main goal of this paper is not to analyze the scores obtained in the post-test performed, but to focus on the students' attitudes towards robots. In order to do this, a version of the NARS and RAS questionnaires, adapted for children, was used. The analysis of the results of these questionnaires considers differences between age groups and students lectured by a robot vs. a human teacher. We conclude that age is the main factor that affects students' attitudes towards robots, although we also found other differences between the robot and the human teacher group. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: In some countries of the world, peanut allergy represents an important source of anaphylactic reactions. Traditionally treated with the avoidance of responsible allergens, this condition can also be targeted by oral peanut immunotherapy.
   Methods: In this study, we review the beneficial and side effects of currently available forms of peanut oral immunotherapy (POIT). We report the discussions resulting from the publication of a meta-analysis that brought to light the downsides of oral immunotherapy for peanuts.
   Results: In some clinical situations, the risk-benefit ratio can favor peanut oral immunotherapy over avoidance. In many other situations, this is not the case. The decision must be based on the values and preferences of clinicians and patients. Those not ready to accept serious adverse effects from POIT are likely to continue the elimination diet; those motivated to achieving desensitization, and prepared to accept serious adverse effects, may choose to undergo POIT.
   Conclusions: Without being prejudiced against peanut oral immunotherapy, we indicate the possible evolution of treatment for this condition is in a rapidly evolving broader scenario. Among the future options, sublingual immunotherapy, parenteral immunotherapy with modified allergens, transcutaneous immunotherapy, and the use of biologics will become important options.

AB  - Stigma is a common problem among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). However, little is known about HIV/AIDS-related stigma in older PLWHA over the age of 50. This study described the stigma of HIV/AIDS and its factors based on 120 PLWHA aged 50 or older in an area of high HIV prevalence in south rural China. Each participant completed a face-to-face questionnaire that collected information on demographic characteristics, AIDS-related events and experience of HIV/AIDS-related stigma. Finally, only 18.1% reported experiencing external stigma compared with 64.3% feeling internal stigma. Regression analysis indicated that social support and health status were the two variables that were significantly predictive of both external and internal stigma. Whatever, the more support were received from family members by PLWHA, the less external stigma was perceived. Negative marital situation was also related to external stigma. Reducing HIV/AIDS stigma requires a supportive environment, positive attitude and correct knowledge of AIDS. Health workers and policy makers should take practical approaches to reduce prejudice.

AB  - People with mental illnesses have higher prevalence and mortality rates with regard to common somatic diseases and causes of death, such as cardio-vascular conditions or cancer. One factor contributing to this excess morbidity and mortality is the sub-standard level of physical healthcare offered to the mentally ill. In particular, they are often subject to diagnostic overshadowing: a tendency to attribute physical symptoms to a pre-existing diagnosis of mental illness. This might be seen as an unfortunate instance of epistemic bad luck, where particular features of a group of patients make a timely and correct diagnosis unlikely. While this can explain some cases of diagnostic overshadowing, I argue that in other cases, epistemic injustice is involved. Analyzing the case of diagnostic overshadowing, I distinguish two kinds of testimonial injustice. For one, there are classic cases of transactional testimonial injustice resulting from prejudices against the mentally ill. In addition, there are cases of structural testimonial injustice resulting from features of health care systems. To overcome diagnostic overshadowing, remedies on the individual as well as structural level are thus needed.

AB  - When graduates of Australian social work courses embark on a career in mental health, the systems they enter are complex, fragmented and evolving. Emerging practitioners will commonly be confronted by the loneliness, social exclusion, poverty and prejudice experienced by people living with mental distress; however, social work practice may not be focused on these factors. Instead, in accordance with the dominant biomedical perspective, symptom and risk management may predominate. Frustration with the limitations evident in this approach has seen the United Nations call for the transformation of mental health service delivery. Recognising paradigmatic influences on mental health social work may lead to a more considered enactment of person centred, recovery and rights-based approaches. This paper compares and contrasts influences of neo-liberalism, critical theory, human rights and post-structuralism on mental health social work practice. In preparing social work practitioners to recognise the influence of, and work more creatively with, intersecting paradigms, social work educators strive to foster a transformative approach to mental health practice that straddles discourses.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to increase understanding of the subjective experience of 13 white, female occupational therapists in Louisiana as they participated in a 6-hour workshop on cultural competency. The study employed a mixed method design using qualitative data, obtained from structured reflection questions, and quantitative data, obtained from two objective outcome measures. Three themes emerged from the qualitative data regarding the participants' conflicting attitudes towards African American clients. Therapists believed that: (1) healthcare disparities are not due to racial discrimination; (2) therapists should listen to and educate African American clients; and (3) racial bias and stress contribute to health issues in African American clients. Results from the two outcome measures, the Racial Argument Scale and the Racial Attitude Implicit Association Test, indicate that overall, the study participants held significantly negative attitudes towards African Americans which was not ameliorated by the intervention.
   The small convenience sample in this study precludes generalization to a broader population, and further investigation into the attitudes of healthcare professionals in Louisiana is needed. Future instructional interventions should take into account the participants' developmental stage of cultural competence. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Public Significance Statement The study examined men's conformity to specific masculinity norms to predict their adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for combatting COVID-19 and their attitudes toward mask wearing. The findings can aid in public health efforts to improve men's participation in combatting the pandemic and future public health crises.
   The study examined men's conformity to masculine norms as related to adherence to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 as well as men's attitudes toward mask wearing. Five hundred eighty nine participant men, predominantly White and heterosexual, completed the 10-15 min anonymous online survey through Prolific. After controlling for demographics, results indicated that the masculine norms of emotional control and power over women were related to less adherence to CDC recommendations; and that self-reliance, power over women, and heterosexual self-presentation were related to more negative attitudes toward mask wearing. Limitations and future research such as improving men's participation in combatting COVID-19, and other public health crises, by addressing men's specific salient masculine norms when developing and implementing public health outreach and prevention are discussed.

AB  - Debates over official languages are often intrinsically linked to questions of national identity, prejudice, and intergroup relations. However, official language legislation also has consequences for the day-to-day affairs of many citizens. As such, it also brings to the forefront considerations of costs and benefits, or the ways in which the material interests of individual citizens and their linguistic groups might be affected by these laws. In this study, we explore the possibility of a principle-implementation gap when it comes to official language(s) legislation. While citizens may well support the recognition of a minority language as an "official language," they might oppose specific measures enacted to implement this general principle. Drawing on a survey conducted in Canada, we determine first that such a gap does exist. Second, our analysis shows that symbolic predispositions primarily drive support for the principle of Official Bilingualism, while opposition to its implementation is highest among those whose interests might clash with the imposition of bilingualism requirements for senior federal public servants.

AB  - Public attitudes regarding privatization are important for both political and normative reasons. Past studies of public opinion on privatization have shown how socio-economic variables and ideology shape public views. In this study, we focus on a relatively under-researched factor: identity as it relates to actor preference formation. We explore attitudes toward different privatization types in a society, in which the main political fault lines are not economic, but identity-based: primarily predicated on ethnic group membership and religiosity. Based on a random sample of 1142 Israeli adults, we find that unlike most other countries, identity variables matter more than Socio-Economic Status (SES) in this type of society despite the fact that privatization is primarily perceived as an economic policy. While high levels of religiosity are associated with support for privatization, membership in an ethnic minority, in contrast, is related to negative attitudes. The contrast between the relatively favourable views of ultra-orthodox Jews to the negative ones of Arabs suggests that identity group attitudes toward neoliberal policies cannot simply be explained by SES. Moreover, not only does identity matter for shaping views on public policy, but also the particular specifics of a given identity.

AB  - According to the extended contact hypothesis, knowing that in-group members have cross-group friends improves attitudes toward this out-group. This meta-analysis covers the 20 years of research that currently exists on the extended contact hypothesis, and consists of 248 effect sizes from 115 studies. The aggregate relationship between extended contact and intergroup attitudes was r = .25, 95% confidence interval (CI) = [.22, .27], which reduced to r = .17, 95% CI = [.14, .19] after removing direct friendship's contribution; these results suggest that extended contact's hypothesized relationship to intergroup attitudes is small-to-medium and exists independently of direct friendship. This relationship was larger when extended contact was perceived versus actual, highlighting the importance of perception in extended contact. Current results on extended contact mostly resembled their direct friendship counterparts, suggesting similarity between these contact types. These unique insights about extended contact and its relationship with direct friendship should enrich and spur growth within this literature.

AB  - Accessible summaryWhat is known on the subject? Stress can impact students on mental health nurse training. This can have implications at the individual level (e.g. their own mental health) and at the level of the organization (e.g. sickness absence and attrition).
   What this paper adds to existing knowledge? We interviewed 12 mental health nursing students regarding the stress they experienced during training. Participants described how the academic demands can at times be unbearable during clinical placements. There were also issues with being a student' on some placements, with participants describing negative attitudes towards them from staff. The younger participants reported feeling overwhelmed on their initial placements and described some of the main challenges of mental health work for them. Raising concerns about the quality of care on wards was also described as particularly challenging for the students.
   What are the implications for practice? This paper can be useful to help training providers support mental health nursing students. Recommendations include reducing academic demands during clinical placements and extending and promoting existing support services beyond normal 9am-5pm working hours, even if these services are limited. Younger students could be better supported by being allocated to the more well-resourced placements in the early stages of their training. Raising awareness among staff of the tasks students can and cannot perform can help improve staff/student relations. Finally, students should be educated about the issues around raising concerns on placements to help the governments drive for a more open and transparent National Health Service (NHS).
   AbstractIntroduction Previous studies investigating stress in nursing students focus on general nursing students or adopt quantitative measures. Purpose of study A qualitative study focusing specifically on mental health nursing students is required. Method One-to-one interviews were carried out with mental health nursing students (n = 12). Data were thematically analysed. Results Participants reported unreasonable demands during clinical blocks, and described how control/support is lowest on placements with staff shortages. Negative attitudes towards students from staff and related issues were also discussed. Younger participants described struggling with mental health work during the early stages of training. Discussion Training providers should strive to provide adequate support to students to help them manage stress during training. Implications for practice Academic demands should be reasonable during clinical blocks and support services outside normal working hours should be available for students, even if these are limited in scope. Greater consideration to the allocation of placements for younger students in the mental health branch could be helpful. Furthermore, staff on placements should be aware of the tasks students can and cannot perform, to help improve staff/student relations. Educating students on the issues of raising concerns can help the governments drive for a more open and transparent National Health Service (NHS).

AB  - The hegemonic framing of the 'Greek crisis', launched by leading liberal and conservative politicians in the European Union (EU) and elsewhere and followed by mass media, reflected deep Western racial prejudices towards the periphery, and stressed typical bourgeois values affirming hard work, while publicly asserting regimes of entitlement to citizenship, welfare and consumption. The article presents a class-oriented analysis of the 'Greek crisis' discursive construction in North-Western European media, by studying articles published between 2010 and 2015 in four newspapers from Germany and Denmark. The analysis shows that, along with cultural ones, upper/middle-class biases are publicly expressed through articulations of ridicule, contempt and resentment, three interrelated 'affective modalities' connected to essentialist binary constructions of the (Western/European) self and the (non-Western/European) Other. Thus, the bourgeois ideology is crucial in reproducing depoliticized frames of economic crisis, to pursue neoliberal crisis-reforms (such as various regimes of austerity and labour deregulation). The production and affirmation of middle-class subjectivities, is crucial for the organic advance of neoliberal reforms in society, while denying the advancing of working - class identifications and solidarities in the highly uncertain times of today.

AB  - Fernbach et al. (2019) found that extreme opposition to genetically modified (GM) food was associated with low levels of objective knowledge and high levels of self-assessed knowledge in the US. They also found that the pattern that extreme opponents knew the least but felt they knew the most applied to opponents of a medical application of genetic engineering technology (gene therapy). In the past few years, genetic engineering technology become one of the most polarized scientific and social issues in China. Following Fernbach et al. (2019), we conducted a conceptual replication study using a nationally representative sample of Chinese internet users. In addition to studying extreme opponents of GM food and other applications of genetic engineering technology, we examined the extreme supporters in terms of their knowledge as well. Our findings show that Chinese people in general hold negative attitudes toward GM food and positive attitudes toward other applications of genetic engineering technology. Consistent with the original study, we found a similar pattern for extreme opponents of GM food in China. In addition, our data show the same pattern for extreme proponents of other applications of genetic engineering technology.

AB  - Objectives: To close the epilepsy treatment gap and reduce related stigma, eradication of misconceptions is importantIn 2014, Community Health Workers (CHWs) from Musanze (Northern Rwanda) were trained on different aspects of epilepsy. This study compared knowledge, attitude and practices (KAPs) towards epilepsy of trained CHWs 3 years after training, to untrained CHWs from Rwamagana (Eastern Rwanda).Methods: An epilepsy KAP questionnaire was administered to 96 trained and 103 untrained CHWs. Demographic and intergroup KAP differences were analysed by response frequencies. A multivariate analyses was performed based on desired and undesired response categories.Results: Epilepsy awareness was high in both groups, with better knowledge levels in trained CHWs. Negative attitudes were lowest in trained CHWs, yet 17% still reported misconceptions. Multivariate analysis demonstrated the impact of the training, irrespective of age, gender and educational level. Knowing someone with epilepsy significantly induced more desired attitudes.Conclusion: Despite demographic differences between trained and untrained CHWs, a single epilepsy training resulted in significant improvement of desired KAPs after 3 years. Nation-wide CHW training programs with focus on training-resistant items, e.g., attitudes, are recommended.

AB  - IntroductionUndergraduate dental curricula increasingly aim to address student attitudes towards people with disabilities. This study reports the effectiveness of a comprehensive, blended learning Special Care Dentistry undergraduate programme to change attitudes towards people with disabilities.
   MethodsA validated psychometric instrument (ATDP-Form 0) was given as a course evaluation to third-year dental students in the Dublin Dental University Hospital over 3years from 2010 to 2013, immediately before and after the delivery of a brief comprehensive curriculum in Special Care Dentistry.
   ResultsFrom a population of 109 students, 100 (91.7%) pre-test and 83 (76.1%) retest responses were analysed. Mean score before the course, for all years, was 74.8 (SD=14.7), compared with 76.8 (SD=14.0) for all years after the course.
   ConclusionsDental students in our study had neither particularly positive, or negative attitudes towards people with disabilities. There was no statistically significant difference in student attitudes before and after the educational intervention. This study, therefore, shows that a comprehensive undergraduate blended learning module, which aimed to improve attitudes towards people with disabilities, did not do so, using the described measures within the selected timeframe.

AB  - With the planned expansion of high speed rail (HSR) in the UK, demand for longer-distance travel is expected to increase significantly over the coming decades. This paper presents a study into attitudes and perceptions of long distance travel in the UK, particularly in relation to HSR. A questionnaire was developed to investigate attitudes to travelling long distances and to HSR, importance of journey characteristics and current travel behaviours. A factor analysis of 46 attitude items yielded six factors: travel security, improvement to road and air, prestige of HSR, comfort, negative aspects of HSR and the usefulness of travel time. Analyses showed significant demographic and travel characteristic differences across the factors. There was also evidence of a more negative impact and lower prestige for people living closer to proposed HSR routes. Willingness to pay for travel time saved was related to a number of journey characteristics but the utility of time was also important. The findings are considered in light of theories of attitude change, attitudes to travel and sustainability and the implications for the future development of HSR policy, particularly in terms of balancing increased fares with utility of travel time.

AB  - This piece offers a critique of what is commonly the structure of introductory philosophy textbooks, syllabi, and courses. The basic criticism is that this structure perpetuates the systematic devaluing of the views of historically marginalized and exploited people. The form my critique takes is that of a referee report on a hypothetical manuscript for an introductory philosophy textbook, authored by "Dr. Unspecified." I examine what the manuscript chooses to focus on and what it chooses to omit from discussion. I thereby outline much of the content typically used to introduce newcomers to philosophy, while illustrating that presenting exclusively that content supports a prejudiced view of philosophy. I try to show how this representation of philosophy marginalizes the concerns and insights of many and reinforces the disproportionate extent to which those who can do philosophy for a living are white, straight, men with typical body morphology. My report also identifies various ways that the content of an introductory philosophy textbook or course could be modified or supplemented in light of the sort of critique my report makes.

AB  - Research has shown that athletes' attitudes towards the use of banned performance-enhancing substances are reliable predictors of their intentions to use these substances, which in turn can be relevant predictors of their actual doping behaviours. Despite the important role played by attitudes and intentions in doping, research analysing how to change those attitudes and intentions is relatively scarce. The present study examined how individual differences in Need for Cognition (NC, Cacioppo & Petty, 1982) influenced doping-related attitude change and subsequent behavioural intentions. Participants were randomly assigned to read a persuasive message either against or in favour of legalising the use of several banned substances, including anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS) and Erythropoietin (EPO). In addition, participants completed the NC scale, and finally reported their attitudes and behavioural intentions regarding the legalisation proposal. As hypothesised, results showed that participants who received an anti-legalisation message had significantly more unfavourable attitudes towards the proposal than participants who received a pro-legalisation message, regardless of NC. However, as predicted, NC moderated the relationship between individuals' attitudes and their intentions. That is, high-NC participants showed greater attitude-intention correspondence than low-NC participants.

AB  - Purpose: Prejudice and discrimination have been associated with mental and physical health disparities among people with disabilities (Emerson, 2010) and sexual minorities (American Psychological Association [APA], 2012b). Subtle everyday communications of prejudice, known as microaggressions, are one form of oppressive experience that contribute to minority stress among these groups. As sexual minority people with disabilities (SMPWDs) embody at least two marginalized statuses, they may face unique levels of risk. While social support has been posited to buffer against the negative effects of minority stress (Meyer, 2003), the relationship between microaggressions and perceived social support is currently unknown. This study is among the first to explore the relationship between microaggressions and social support in a multiply marginalized community. Research Method: One-hundred and 92 sexual minority (i.e., bisexual, gay, lesbian, pansexual, queer, questioning, same-sex/gender attracted) participants with physical disabilities completed measures related to microaggressions, social support, and mental health via an online survey. Results: Results suggest that for SMPWDs, greater ableist microaggressions within sexual minority communities were associated with lower satisfaction with LGBTQ social supports. In addition, ableist and homonegative microaggressions within sexual minority and disability communities, respectively, were related to greater depressive symptoms. Social support was not found to moderate the relationship between microaggressions and mental health. Implications: Implications for practice, training, advocacy, and future research are discussed, such as raising critical consciousness about microaggressions and mental health, using an intersectional framework when working with SMPWDs, engaging in inclusive advocacy toward policy change, and future studies on microaggressions and social support using diverse samples.
   Impact and Implications
   This study is among the first to examine the relationship between microaggressions and social support. The results of this study highlight interpersonal barriers to supportive relationships for SMPWDs within sexual minority communities, and emphasize the need for increased advocacy toward full inclusion of SMPWDs within sexual minority and disability communities. Providers are encouraged to take a nonpathologizing stance with SMPWDs by focusing on raising critical consciousness about microaggressions and their relationship with mental health. Within-group differences, such as based on disability severity, should also be considered in treatment. Use of an intersectional framework is important when working with SMPWDs, and providers should explore experiences within various communities when assessing social support. Providers should use their expertise to intervene at a broader level to influence how SMPWDs are perceived and treated. Providers are encouraged to increase awareness of their own biases, take risks to address microaggressions, and advocate at the institutional level. As some microaggressions occur on the societal level, these policy changes may directly impact SMPWD mental health.

AB  - Reports of medical students experiencing burnout-related symptoms (e.g., cynicism) have increased in recent years. Little is known about the developmental process of this phenomenon and its relations with signature character strengths and well-being. The aim of this longitudinal analysis was to explore changes in the level of cynicism of medical students while in preclinical education. We further examined how the applicability of signature character strengths and well-being are related to this developmental process. Medical students (N = 99) participated in three online surveys over 3 years during medical school. Latent growth modeling, latent class growth modeling, general mixed modeling was conducted, and post hoc mixed ANOVA, Friedman test and Welch test analyses were examined. The results showed an increase in cynicism among medical students from first to last measurement. Two groups with distinct developmental trajectory patterns of cynicism were identified. Students with high levels of cynicism (high-level group) and students with changing levels of cynicism (increasing group) perceived higher applicability of signature character strengths in private life compared to the study context. Moreover, the high-level group experienced significantly lower psychological well-being (in particular mastery, optimism, and relationship) in their first year of medical education. This explorative study offers a comprehensive understanding of cynicism development in medical students during medical school and its relations to the applicability of signature character strengths and well-being. Prospective replication studies are needed to replicate the results obtained in this study.

AB  - This article explores the positive contribution that community development (CD) can make to mental well-being by providing close but critical support to individuals and community-led initiatives. The emphasis on self-determination, collective action and empowerment within the CD approach inspires hope and recovery from mental distress. Drawing on a recent study of CD practice across varied UK settings, we demonstrate how practitioners use their skills to break down barriers, build relationships, manage group dynamics and tackle prejudice. They oconnect and include' people experiencing mental health difficulties with community activities and mainstream services, increasing opportunity and choice. We note that a skilfully balanced, empathetic but bold CD approach requires professional capabilities, flexible management and participative forms of evaluation. It fits the current UK policy emphasis on empowerment and engagement and responds to the growing evidence that personal networks and social equality correlate with health and well-being. However, its impact tends to be limited by workplace context, insufficient resources and a failure by health providers and others to recognize its potential.

AB  - This article examines which individual-level factors are related to people's likelihood of discriminating against ethnic minority job applicants. It moves beyond describing to what extent discrimination occurs by examining the role of individuals' interethnic contacts, education and religion in shaping their behavior towards ethnic minority job applicants. We derive expectations from theories from the interethnic attitudes literature. Data are collected via (1) a laboratory experiment in which student participants (n = 272) reviewed r,sum,s of fictitious applicants who varied regarding ethnicity, gender, education and work experience and (2) a survey amongst the same participants. During the experiment, participants assess applicants' suitability for a job and select applicants for an interview. Additionally, participants complete a questionnaire including questions on several personal and background features. Results show that individuals who have more positive interethnic contacts, higher educational levels and higher educated parents are less likely to discriminate against ethnic minority applicants. Individuals whose parents are church members are more likely to discriminate, as are males. We find interesting differences regarding the role of decision makers' features between different stages of the recruitment process. First assessments of applicants' suitability for a job are predominantly affected by applicants' features. Differences between decision makers here are relatively small. Eventual choices about which applicants to invite for a job interview, however, are affected by both applicants' and decision makers' features; here differences between decision makers are more pronounced. Theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - How does exposure to rebel rule affect citizens' political attitudes after armed conflicts end? We combine original survey data from Cote d'Ivoire with a natural experiment based on the arbitrary location of a ceasefire boundary to estimate the effects of exposure to rebel rule by the Forces Nouvelles (FN) on Ivorians' sense of democratic citizenship. Our findings show that individuals in communities ruled by the FN held more negative attitudes about local government institutions 7 years after the reunification of the country, held weaker commitments to civic obligations, and were more likely to condone extralegal actions. The effects of rebel rule are larger than the effects of extreme lived poverty and appear among both rebel coethnics and non-coethnics. Using qualitative and survey evidence, we propose three theoretical mechanisms to explain why exposure to rebel rule weakened citizen-state relations: disrupted norms of compliance with state-like authorities, the formation of local self-help institutions leading to negative assessments of the redeployed state, and resentment due to unmet expectations of economic recovery. Our study informs debates about the links between war, citizenship, and statebuilding.

AB  - The authors, within the context of the first author Eric's experiences, explore the politics of a hostile, academically violent pretenure environment as a poststructuralist scholar within a framework of cultural humility. Within this essay, we illuminate issues Eric experienced only after the idea of early tenure was presented by his dean. Most faculty were supportive of Eric and his research; a few were not. We examine issues of prejudice in scholarly works traditionally left unexplored. We wonder what is lost when one way of knowing is privileged over others and advocate for methodological humility. We question the depth of others' approaches to research when their philosophical stances are unclear and uninterrogated. We challenge researchers to understand and accommodate research approaches which differ from more "received" approaches. We challenge ourselves and qualitative colleagues to assist in the process of respecting and advocating for aesthetic qualitative representations by including them in comprehensive literature reviews. We encourage all scholars to be thoughtful, reflexive, and respectful with colleagues and themselves in their research pursuits.

AB  - A growing body of literature suggests that positive cross-group contact between members of advantaged and disadvantaged groups can undermine disadvantaged group members' collective action engagement. It has also been proposed that supportive contact (i.e., positive contact with advantaged group members who express explicit support for social change) may be a special form of contact that might increase, rather than reduce collective action engagement among disadvantaged group members. In the present research, we tested this proposition by asking Gay (N = 96) and Lesbian (N = 100) Australians to recall a previous positive interaction with a heterosexual friend who was either very supportive or somewhat supportive of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered (LGBT) rights (i.e., equal marriage, adoption, and surrogacy rights). Results revealed that the effect of supportive contact on collective action intentions depended on the participants' specific disadvantaged group membership. For Gay men, those who recalled supportive contact reported greater collective action intentions. The opposite pattern emerged for Lesbian women. These findings suggest that supportive contact has the power to enhance or undermine collective action intentions among the disadvantaged. Which of these occurs appears to depend on the specific disadvantaged group to which one belongs. The psychological underpinnings of these effects, the theoretical implications, and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - Existing studies have found that restaurant servers sometimes deliver service that is informed by their customers' race. However, we know considerably less about the causes underlying such discriminatory behaviors within the restaurant context. In this study, we advance this literature by analyzing data derived from a survey of restaurant servers (N = 195) to assess the effects of working in a racialized workplace environment, characterized by racist and stereotypical discourse, on servers' reports of providing race-based service. Our findings reveal a strong statistically significant positive relationship between observing racialized workplace discourse and servers' self-professed discriminatory behaviors. Furthermore, we find that these effects are not mediated or moderated by servers' willingness to participate in the discursive spreading of racial stereotypes by discussing their customers' race with peers. We conclude by identifying suggestions that restaurant leaders might consider to reduce racial discrimination within the restaurant industry.

AB  - The serum MALDI-TOF MS spectrum includes signals for serum proteins and peptides between 1000 and 12,000 Da in size, presenting a fingerprint-like pattern. However, whole serum MALDI-TOF MS signals are complex and prejudiced for data analysis. Pre-treatment with specific nanomaterials can simplify the mass spectrum while retaining the characteristics of the fingerprint pattern. In the present study, we used hydrophilic interaction chromatography nanoparticles (HICNPs) to enrich proteins and peptides in serum from a large number prostate cancer samples and controls. After pre-treatment with HICNPs, the serum MALDI-TOF MS signals for samples were simpler, with more analysable fingerprint-like patterns. Principal component analysis and partial least squares discriminant analysis of the samples demonstrated a significant difference in the MALDI-TOF signals between prostate cancer and controls, with an analytical accuracy of 77%, approaching that of methods based on prostate-specific antigen. Due to the low cost and high flux, MALDI-TOF MS fingerprinting can be used in largescale evaluation of various cancers, including prostate cancer.

TI  - Descriptive study of stress and satisfaction at work in the Saragossa university services and administration staff
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS
LA  - English
AB  - Background: The notion of stress in connection with the work environment became an important topic during the 1970's, when the first studies on the subject were published and the term of work stress was first coined. In 1974, Freudenberger proposed the term burnout to refer to the condition of physical and emotional exhaustion, as well as the associated negative attitudes, resulting from the intense interaction in working with people. The aim of our study is to examine burnout and job satisfaction in Saragossa University Services and Administration Staff (SAS) and detect the main factors which could contribute to too much stress, because job stress has emerged as a major psychosocial influence on mental health, associated with burnout.
   Methods: 24 people from the Services and Administration Staff in the University of Saragossa participated in the study. The research was carried out during the implementation of a module on Stress Management organised by the University of Saragossa and commissioned to the Unit for Research in Physical Therapy (University School of Health Sciences) from that University. This research is an exploratory research to improve the stress management program. A personal interview was carried out and additionally, participants were given the Maslach Burnout Inventory and the Scale of Satisfaction at Work of Warr, Cook & Wall.
   Results: However using small sample this is worth to state that participants present most of them low burnout levels in the burnout scale. Only in one person high exhaustion level was reflected, even though other seven showed mean levels; in the professional self-esteem section, most of them showed high self-esteem, with two cases of low self-esteem and five with mean level.
   With regard to satisfaction people participating in the study show mean levels in intrinsic as much as in extrinsic factors and general satisfaction.
   Conclusions: Services and Administration Staff from the University of Saragossa shows low burnout levels linked with high professional self-esteem and low emotional exhaustion and depersonalization.
   It has been found also medium levels in work satisfaction probably related with the continuous quality improvement efforts in the academics environment to create protective factors in decreasing levels of job stress.
   These results show that not only personality or temperament have an influence on burnout and stress, also the job conditions are related with these diseases. These aspects should be taken into account in the design of stress prevention programme at work.

AB  - The average weight of employees in the United States workforce is increasing. Importantly, relatively heavier employees are often subject to stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination based solely on their weight. These biases may be further influenced by factors such as employee gender and the specific nature of the job. Thus, we employ the stereotype content model (SCM) to examine the multiplicative effects of weight and gender and argue that perceptions of employee warmth are more salient than perceptions of employee competence in customer service contexts. In support of our hypotheses, we found that weight and gender interacted to influence warmth, such that heavy women were perceived to be higher in warmth relative to less heavy women (with no effect for men). Furthermore, perceptions of warmth predicted service satisfaction, whereas perceptions of competence did not. Finally, perceptions of warmth (but not competence) explained the relations between weight and gender and service satisfaction for female (but not male) customer service agents. We end with a discussion of the theoretical implications related to the SCM along with practical implications for service industry organizations and employees.

AB  - The current study aimed to examine whether Israeli gay men reported higher interpersonal vulnerability in comparison with matched Israeli heterosexual men and to further assess the association between interpersonal vulnerability and depressive symptoms as a function of sexual orientation. Israeli gay men (N = 474) were individually matched with Israeli heterosexual men (N = 474) who completed measures of hostile-world scenario (HWS) in the interpersonal domain and depressive symptoms. Results indicated that gay men reported higher interpersonal vulnerability and higher depressive symptoms in comparison with heterosexual men. Also, a stronger positive association was found between interpersonal vulnerability and depressive symptoms among gay, in comparison with heterosexual, men. The findings may be explained in terms of minority stress, stigma, family and peer rejection, as well as discriminatory local policies regarding sexual minority rights, which serve as potential contributors to more interpersonal concerns and more depressive symptoms among gay, in comparison with heterosexual, men.

AB  - Nurses, like other healthcare professionals, such as physicians, pharmacists, and therapists, are susceptible to unanticipated patient harm, in which they suffer as second victims due to the immense personal and professional impact from the adverse event. The aim of the present study was to explore the psychological responses, coping strategies, and support needs of Singapore nurses as second victims of adverse events. A descriptive qualitative study was adopted. Eight participants (6 women and 2 men) who had been involved in an adverse event were interviewed and audio-recorded. Thematic analysis was performed to analyze the data. Seven themes emerged from the thematic analysis: responding psychologically after the event, feeling others' prejudice, having intrusive thoughts, drawing valuable lessons from the event, coping to recover after the event, taking responsibility for the mistakes made, and finding self-identity. The harmful effects of adverse events on nurses are long lasting. Second-victim nurses adopted various coping strategies to recover. The findings from the present study will guide the development of effective second-victim support programs.

AB  - This qualitative research explored the reproductive health care experiences of people with physical disabilities in Vietnam. Data from 20 participants (10 males and 10 females) was collected from in-depth interviews with the use of drawing and photo elicitation methods. The findings revealed that people with physical disabilities in Vietnam experienced difficulties with their reproductive health care that included: physically inaccessible hospitals; negative attitudes from health care providers; discouraging experiences with reproductive healthcare including assistance with fertility control; and limitations with public health insurance. Almost all the participants only saw a doctor if they became ill, but often bought over-the-counter medication from pharmacies. Some participants chose private rather than public hospitals where environments were inaccessibility, and health care providers were perceived as insensitive. In terms of contraception, study participants mostly used condoms, although some did not use any contraceptive methods resulting in unplanned pregnancies or abortion. People with disabilities in Vietnam have access to public health insurance but its limitations can affect the experiences of people with physical disabilities attempting to access reproductive health care. In Vietnam, people with physical disabilities work hard to overcome discrimination to achieve full and satisfying lives.

AB  - The aim of the authors is to respond to the growing demands on the intercultural competence of university teachers due to intensified internationalization pressures on higher education, especially due to the growing number of students and teachers' international exchanges. They report on an intercultural course design responding to this need, presenting a case study from Slovakia. First, they define the need of intercultural competence of university teachers, especially those teaching in English-medium study programmes. Then they share a) findings from a needs analysis preceding the design of a new curriculum for an intercultural competence course (ICC) at Matej Bel University (MBU) with three aims (development of linguistic, cultural and pedagogic competences); and b) results from action research during piloting the ICC course. A comparison of 2011 and 2018 surveys pointed to the growing dominance of the English language, including an increasing command of English by MBU teachers. The ICC curriculum, tailored to the pre-identified teachers' needs, proved to be a feasible way of facilitating their intercultural competence. Its implementation revealed persistent prejudices and difficulties associated with overcoming them.

AB  - Individual academic achievement is highly valued in Chinese society, with vocational education students positioned at the bottom of the educational hierarchy and suffering considerable societal prejudice. In this paper we present new findings from the choice-making experiences of students in two vocational education colleges in China, how they are perceived by their teachers, and how, in the context of their negatively-stereotyped status, they perceive themselves. Drawing on the Marxist notion of false consciousness to help understand the agency of these students, we found that almost all perceived themselves as being agentic and having control over their destiny. They felt they only had themselves to blame for the stereotyping to which they were subjected. One student had not adopted this mindset and was critical of the exam system. We argue that the perceived agency of the majority of the students resonates strongly with the neoliberal values which are associated with responsibilisation, and which have been encouraged in China since the 1970s with the beginning of the Reform Era. The evidence from our study also suggests, however, that it is possible for young people , by their own efforts, to move away from the state of false consciousness.

AB  - Aim The aim of this study was to explore the effect of health-care providers' attitudes towards the medical use of cannabis, subjective norms and perceived stigma towards medicinal cannabis users on health-care providers' intention to recommend medicinal cannabis for patients with qualifying conditions.
   Methods A cross-sectional correlational study included 221 health-care providers (mean age, 42.2 +/- 11.2; 74.2% women and 76.5% nurses) who completed a questionnaire examining theory-based variables and stigma towards medicinal cannabis users.
   Results More positive attitudes towards the medical use of cannabis were associated with lower stigma towards medicinal cannabis users, which, in turn, was associated with a higher intention of recommending medicinal cannabis for patients with qualifying conditions. The relationship between attitudes towards the medical use of cannabis and the intention to recommend medicinal cannabis varies according to subjective norms.
   Conclusions Among nurses and physicians, stigma towards medicinal cannabis users mediated the relationship between attitudes towards the medical use of cannabis and the intention to recommend medicinal cannabis for patients with qualifying conditions, whereas subjective norms moderated this relationship. Effective treatment with medicinal cannabis might be compromised by health-care providers' negative attitudes, stigma and subjective norms.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the outreach effort and impact of a joint federal-state campaign, Own Your Future, promoting awareness and planning for long-term care (LTC) in the state of Washington. The study applied survey methodology to evaluate the extent of campaign dissemination, evidence of its impact on LTC planning behaviors, and barriers to purchasing private LTC insurance. A total of 3,198 survey responses from a randomly selected community sample and a Washington State employee sample (ages 51 to 71) were analyzed. Results indicated that the impact of the campaign was limited, both with respect to awareness of the campaign itself and to initiation of LTC planning behaviors. Quantitative data revealed a high prevalence of health-related problems (e.g., obesity, diabetes), inadequate knowledge of basic LTC-related information (e.g., cost, payers), and negative attitudes toward purchasing LTC insurance among respondents. Qualitative analyses suggested that respondents perceived significant problems related to affordability and accountability within the current LTC insurance industry. These possible barriers to the purchase of LTC insurance suggest targets to be addressed by policy makers seeking to find ways to offset the public costs of LTC.

AB  - Sexual minorities (SMs) in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) experience a number of unique risks related to their religious/spiritual and SM experience that may increase their likelihood of experiencing suicidal ideation (SI) and ultimately dying by suicide. However, it is unclear which aspects of these experiences are responsible for elevated SI. It is further unclear whether religiousness/spirituality and minority stress relate to SI similarly for active and nonactive/former LDS SMs. To address this gap, we examined data from 602 active and nonactive/former LDS SMs. Active and nonactive LDS SMs reported similar degrees of SI and minority stress but differing degrees of religiousness/spirituality with active LDS SMs reporting more religiousness/spirituality than nonactive/former LDS SMs. Several variables were associated with increased SI in both groups including positive religious coping, interpersonal religious struggles, internalized homonegativity, and concealment. Other variables were associated with decreased SI in both groups including resolving conflict between sexual and religious identities, family support, and friend support. Our results suggest that whether LDS SMs are active in their faith is an important factor to consider when understanding how religiousness/spirituality and minority stress relate to SI.

AB  - Background: Coverage with opioid agonist treatments (OAT) that include methadone and buprenorphine is low (N=8400, 2.7%) for the 310,000 people who inject drugs (PWID) in Ukraine. In the context of widespread negative attitudes toward OAT in the region, patient-level interventions targeting the barriers and willingness to initiate OAT are urgently needed.
   Methods: A sample of 1179 PWID with opioid use disorder not currently on OAT from five regions in Ukraine was assessed using multivariable logistic regression for independent factors related to willingness to initiate OAT, stratified by their past OAT experience.
   Results: Overall, 421 (36%) PWID were willing to initiate OAT. Significant adjusted odds ratios (aOR) for covariates associated with the willingness to initiate OAT common for both groups included: higher injection frequency (previously on OAT: aOR = 2.7; never on OAT: aOR = 1.8), social and family support (previously on OAT: aOR = 2.0; never on OAT: aOR = 2.0), and positive attitude towards OAT (previously on OAT: aOR = 1.3; never on OAT: aOR = 1.4). Among participants previously on OAT, significant correlates also included: HIV-negative status (aOR = 2.6) and depression (aOR = 2.7). Among participants never on OAT, however, living in Kyiv (aOR = 4.8) or Lviv (aOR = 2.7), previous imprisonment (aOR = 1.5), registration at a Narcology service (aOR = 1.5) and recent overdose (aOR = 2.6) were significantly correlated with willingness to initiate OAT.
   Conclusions: These findings emphasize the need for developing interventions aimed to eliminate existing negative preconceptions regarding OAT among PWID with opioid use disorder in Ukraine, which should be tailored to meet the needs of specific characteristics of PWID in geographically distinct setting based upon injection frequency, prior incarceration, and psychiatric and HIV status.

AB  - Background: High-quality medical resources are in high demand worldwide, and the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical care may help alleviate the crisis related to this shortage. The development of the medical AI industry depends to a certain extent on whether industry experts have a comprehensive understanding of the public's views on medical AI. Currently, the opinions of the general public on this matter remain unclear.
   Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore the public perception of AI in medical care through a content analysis of social media data, including specific topics that the public is concerned about; public attitudes toward AI in medical care and the reasons for them; and public opinion on whether AI can replace human doctors.
   Methods: Through an application programming interface, we collected a data set from the Sina Weibo platform comprising more than 16 million users throughout China by crawling all public posts from January to December 2017. Based on this data set, we identified 2315 posts related to AI in medical care and classified them through content analysis.
   Results: Among the 2315 identified posts, we found three types of AI topics discussed on the platform: (1) technology and application (n=987, 42.63%), (2) industry development (n=706, 30.50%), and (3) impact on society (n=622, 26.87%). Out of 956 posts where public attitudes were expressed, 59.4% (n=568), 34.4% (n=329), and 6.2% (n=59) of the posts expressed positive, neutral, and negative attitudes, respectively. The immaturity of AI technology (27/59, 46%) and a distrust of related companies (n=15, 25%) were the two main reasons for the negative attitudes. Across 200 posts that mentioned public attitudes toward replacing human doctors with AI, 47.5% (n=95) and 32.5% (n=65) of the posts expressed that AI would completely or partially replace human doctors, respectively. In comparison, 20.0% (n=40) of the posts expressed that AI would not replace human doctors.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that people are most concerned about AI technology and applications. Generally, the majority of people held positive attitudes and believed that AI doctors would completely or partially replace human ones. Compared with previous studies on medical doctors, the general public has a more positive attitude toward medical AI. Lack of trust in AI and the absence of the humanistic care factor are essential reasons why some people still have a negative attitude toward medical AI. We suggest that practitioners may need to pay more attention to promoting the credibility of technology companies and meeting patients' emotional needs instead of focusing merely on technical issues.

AB  - Societal attitudes and behaviours of suicide and euthanasia often cannot be compared leaving policy makers without informative understanding of how social indicators such as social norms, attitudes, behaviours, identity and culture shape the relationships held to socio-demographic indicators of pro end-of-life attitudes. Applying social indicator principals from behavioural economic theory, we assess attitudes to suicide and euthanasia using the Netherlands as a quasi-experiment. We analysed data extracted from the European Values Study (EVS) from 1981 to 2008 in the Netherlands. This timeframe encompasses the Supreme Court ruling: 'The Right to Die-1984' and the 'Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide (Review Procedures) Act of 2002'. Adopting a pooled ordered logit cross-sectional analysis, we assessed indicators of attitude change towards suicide and euthanasia as a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences estimation across socio-demographic indicators through 1981-1990 and 1999-2008. We find through these periods, only employment status and religiosity remain consistent and significant indicators for suicide. Whereas age, employment status, marital status and having a religious denomination remain consistent and significant indicators for euthanasia throughout both periods. Our findings provide a revised socio-demographic indicator model and extend psycho-social indicator factors from behavioural economics to approach research of end-of-life attitudes of suicide and euthanasia.

AB  - Thirty three healthy, New Zealand rabbits, underwent a total gastrectomy via laparotomy and subsequent evaluation of gastric dimensions. Were measured the lengths of the lesser and greater gastric curvature, in addition to the largest diameters of the organ. They presented average overall length of the lesser and greater curvature, respectively 6.7 cm and 27.3 cm. In addition, open surgical specimen presented a total area of 172.6 cm(2). The sample was divided into two groups by age to perform comparisons between weight and stomach measures. Group 1 consisted of animals with age equal or less than 138 days and group 2 those with more than 138 days. No significant differences were found between the groups. This may suggest the use of younger animals to perform experiments related to surgical training involving the stomach, without dimensional prejudice of organ or generation of technical difficulties. Finally, it was noted also the predominance of the left gastric artery in the irrigation of the gastric wall and the presence of a transparent film between the liver and stomach in all animals.

TI  - Breaking the Stereotype: Interventions Aimed at Changing Medical Student Misperceptions of Radiology and Increasing the Female Match Rate
T2  - ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - SPECIALTY
AB  - Background: Although nearly half of medical students are female there is still a significant discrepancy in the number of women specializing in radiology. In 2013, 26.9% of US diagnostic radiology residents were female, a 1% increase in 20 years from 25.5% in 1990.
   Purpose: The purpose of this project is to determine the effectiveness of the interventions implemented at a single medical school at decreasing negative attitudes about radiology held by medical students of all genders and whether those same interventions will increase the number of female medical students matching into radiology.
   Methods: The interventions were implemented between 2012 and 2016 and included incorporation of radiology into preclinical curriculum, electives in radiology for 3rd year students, a "Women in Radiology Panel," and increase in female radiology faculty visibility. First year medical student participants of all genders used a free text box to write their attitudes about radiology, which were categorized into the "six most common attitudes about radiology." Fourth year medical student participants used a free text box to write the reasons why they did not choose radiology as a specialty, and those answers were then placed into the same six categories. We then analyzed the data using Fisher's Exact Test to determine whether there was a decrease in the negative misperceptions after exposure to the interventions. We also then determined whether there was an increase in the number of women matching into radiology using Chi-Square analysis.
   Results: There was a decrease in the negative misperceptions between 1st and 4th years, with the most notable decrease from 51% of 1st years to 0% of 4th years listing radiologists as being antisocial (p < 0.01). There was also a significant increase in the number of female medical students matching into radiology in the years in which students were exposed to 4 years of intervention when compared to three and fewer (0.76%-4.2%, p = 0.01).
   Conclusion: Exposure to 4 years of the interventions demonstrated a significant increase in the female match rate into the specialty when compared to female medical students who experienced three or fewer years of intervention. Additionally, it appears that these same interventions decreased the number of students of all genders having some of the common negative misperceptions about the field of radiology.

AB  - BackgroundDuring pregnancy, nutritional requirements increase and if not met, pregnancy-related complications may manifest. To prevent these undesirable outcomes, the World Health Organization recommends daily oral iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation as part of antenatal care. Despite this recommendation, the use of IFA supplements is still very low in several developing countries. Additionally, no prior information exists regarding the level of consumption of IFA in Eswatini. Thus, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of consumption of IFA supplements and to identify factors associated with the consumption of IFA supplements among pregnant women in Eswatini.MethodsA cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted among 330 pregnant women aged >= 18 years in their third trimester in Eswatini. Participants were recruited from eight purposively selected healthcare facilities from July 2019 to October 2019. Good consumption was defined as consuming all or almost all IFA supplements throughout pregnancy.ResultsDuring the first trimester, 10.3% of the participants consumed all or almost all IFA supplements. In the second and third trimesters, those who consumed all or almost all supplements were 37 and 39.7%, respectively, for iron and 37.6 and 40.9%, respectively, for folic acid. Barriers, including side effects, forgetfulness, safe previous pregnancies without IFA, others' advice against consumption, IFA stock-outs, inability to meet transport costs, and inadequate supply of IFA tablets, contribute to low consumption of IFA. Multivariate logistic regression models showed that the barriers were inversely associated with good consumption of IFA supplements. Better knowledge and attitude toward IFA and older maternal age were positively associated with good consumption of IFA supplements.ConclusionsLow consumption of IFA supplements in overall pregnancy is mainly owing to the late antenatal care attendance. Strategies such as establishing a preconception care unit and school-based provision of IFA may be helpful. It is evident that most women still lack knowledge, and some have negative attitudes about IFA supplements. Health education to raise awareness and emphasize the importance of starting antenatal care early as well as consuming supplements on time should be revisited and intensified. Multiple strategies such as including community health care workers for distributing IFA supplements, discussing with clients about the measures to reduce forgetfulness, advising ways to prevent and manage the side effects, providing subsidies to cover transport costs, and ensuring adequate supply of IFA supplements in facilities may need to be employed to reduce the identified barriers.

AB  - The good jumping stability of a robot prevents the robot from turning over in the jumping process and is the basis for achieving good jumping performance. This study investigates stability assurance for a locust-inspired jumping robot from the perspective of mechanism design. A mechanism design method for a locust-inspired robot with one-degree-of-freedom jumping leg is proposed based on the jumping stability mechanism of locusts. Jumping stability includes kinematic and dynamic stability. Kinematic stability focuses on the attitude change of a robot in the take-off process and determines the dimension of each link. The smaller the changes in attitude are, the better the kinematic stability is. Dynamic stability focuses on the relationship between the center of mass position and the total inertia moment. The smaller the changes in the total inertia moment are, the better the dynamic stability is; that is, the robot has a low tendency to turn over in the flight phase. Simulation results show that the examined robot demonstrates good jumping stability when the developed mechanism design method is used. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - VERIFICATION
AB  - Most international sports organisations work on the premise that human beings come in one of two genders: male or female. Consequently, all athletes, including intersex and transgender individuals, must be assigned to compete in one or other category. Since the 1930s (not, as is popularly suggested, the 1960s) these organisations have relied on scientific and medical professionals to provide an 'objective' judgement of an athlete's eligibility to compete in women's national and international sporting events. The changing nature of these judgements reflects a great deal about our cultural, social and national prejudices, while the matter of testing itself has become a site of conflict for feminists and human rights activists. Because of the sensitive nature of this subject, histories of sex testing are difficult to write and research; this has lead to the repetition of inaccurate information and false assertions about gender fraud, particularly in relation to the 'classic' cases of Stella Walsh and Heinrich/Hermann/Dora Ratjen. As historians, we need to be extremely careful to differentiate between mythologies and histories.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research has shown that employers' negative attitudes about hiring people with mental illness is due to stigma. While social contact has been proved to be effective for improving prejudicial attitudes, the influence of knowledge about mental illness on attitudes has been unclear.
   OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between employers' mental health literacy and their experience or intention of hiring people with mental illness.
   METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted with Japanese employers. The survey included questions regarding participants' knowledge about mental illness and whether they had hired those with mental illness.
   RESULTS: Seven hundred employers participated in the survey. Among participants, while depression was widely recognized and understood according to medical criteria, schizophrenia was not well known. Thirty-five per cent of participants had hired people with mental illness. Those having experience of employing them were more knowledgeable about mental illness. Participants wanting to employ people with mental illness also possessed greater mental health literacy than those who did not want to do so.
   CONCLUSIONS: Employers' better mental health literacy could lead to hiring people with mental illness. However, as the relationships between the literacy and employment attitudes are complex, further research is needed.

AB  - Phosphate coating is a commonly used anti-corrosion coating for NdFeB magnets, but its application is hindered by the intrinsic porosity and adverse impact on magnetic performance during the conventional chemical conversion process. Here, a compact magnesium phosphate coating with high protective efficiency has been successfully fabricated on the surface of NdFeB magnets. The surface properties, corrosion resistance and magnetic performance were investigated in detail. It is found that the quality of magnesium phosphate coating significantly depends on the deposition temperature. The coated sample deposited at 60 degrees C possesses the highest impedance value and protective efficiency (94.25%), because this temperature is appropriate for sufficient deposition of magnesium phosphate crystals (MgHPO4 center dot 3H(2)O) and can avoid defects induced by the excess growth of (021) plane. In addition, the magnesium phosphate coatings fabricated by electrochemical cathodic method exhibits no prejudice to the magnetic performance of NdFeB magnets. The superiority in corrosion resistance and magnetic performance of electrodeposited magnesium phosphate coating provides tremendous application prospect for developing protective coating of sintered NdFeB magnets.

AB  - Opioids such as morphine are effective analgesics and have been recognized worldwide for many years; yet, they are underutilized. The study explores the attitudes and experiences relating to opioids, in general, and morphine, in particular, among Jordanian surgical nurses. The Opioids Attitudes Scale was used. A total of 123 questionnaires were distributed, and 120 were returned, achieving a response rate of 96%. Focus group discussions (n = 4) were conducted with surgical nurses (n = 34). The majority of nurses believe that the addiction is the most serious side effects of opioids. Qualitative analysis revealed 2 major themes. The first theme was referred to as "not being in the same boat," highlighting a lack of teamwork, and comprised 2 subthemes: blame culture and physicians versus nurses. The second "morphine as the last on the list" was also made up of 2 subthemes: the lack of confidence and the fear of legal persecution. Nurses showed negative attitudes and misconceptions about opioids and morphine use within a fragmented surgical unit culture. Therefore, serious efforts must be made to create and sustain an effective unit culture reform and communications path from patient to nurse and doctor.

AB  - In this study, an image registration algorithm was applied to calculate the rotation angle of objects when matching images. Some commonly used image feature detection algorithms such as features from accelerated segment test (FAST), speeded up robust features (SURF) and maximally stable extremal regions (MSER) algorithms were chosen as feature extraction components. Comparing the running time and accuracy, the image registration algorithm based on SURF has better performance than the other algorithms. Accurately obtaining the roll angle is one of the key technologies to improve the positioning accuracy and operation quality of agricultural equipment. To acquire the roll angle of agriculture machinery, a roll angle acquisition model based on the image registration algorithm was built. Then, the performance of the model with a monocular camera was tested in the field. The field test showed that the average error of the rolling angle was 0.61 degrees, while the minimum error was 0.08 degrees. The field test indicated that the model could accurately obtain the attitude change trend of agricultural machinery when it was working in irregular farmlands. The model described in this paper could provide a foundation for agricultural equipment navigation and autonomous driving.

AB  - This paper claims that palliative care (PC) is a suitable approach for offering comprehensive support to patients with life-threatening illness and unavoidable asthenia, to enhance their quality of life in aging and chronic illness. There are however some conceptual barriers to accessing that care on the Chinese Mainland: (1) Death-denying culture and society; (2) Misguidance and malpractice derived from the biomedical model; (3) Prejudice against PC and certain deviant understandings of filial piety culture. To counter these obstacles, the study introduces the philosophy of Chinese Taoist Chuang-tze to enlighten the public from ignorance and remove some illusions about death and dying; inspire people to face and accept illness and death calmly, and keep harmony and inner peace of mind to alleviate suffering, with the aim of providing wisdom and a shift of attitude toward life and death. Chuang-tze's thoughts are consistent with the provision of palliative care, and to a certain degree, can promote its acceptability and delivery, and the conception of good death in practice.

AB  - Purpose In accounting, several studied Arab countries are keen to acquire the dominant Western thinking categories that justify and normalize the exerted domination, especially when it comes to globalized practices. This paper aims to challenge this assumption by examining the dynamics of globalization and its effects through new theoretical perspectives and through new empirical terrain. Design/methodology/approach It builds on the concept of "globalization from below", which emerges from the network of individual development of daily routines, systems and practices, far from international institutions pressure. It uses social representation theory to inform the centrality of a particular social group. The study uses a survey, which was on a sample group of 214 Tunisian public accountants and uses the hierarchical evocation method and an attitudinal scale. Findings The results are twofold: first, Tunisian public accounts lack a stable and common understanding to globalization; second, there are ambivalent positive/negative attitudes towards globalization among accounting professionals. Originality/value The dynamic Tunisian context, along with the absence of a stable collective meaning to the concept of globalization among accountants, shows the complexity of such cases, vacillating between international institutions' domination and the emergence of emancipatory accounting practices inspired by and developed for local socioeconomic entities, if supported by specific factors.

AB  - Objective This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of fear of childbirth and affecting factors in pregnant women in Turkey. Materials and methods This was a cross-sectional study and included a total of 2025. Pregnant Women Assessment, some variables related to previous and current perinatal processes and Wijma Delivery Expectancy/Experience Questionnaire (version A) were used for data collection. Findings In this sample, 42.4% of the women reported fear of childbirth. What the women were afraid of most was the development of unwanted conditions at childbirth, obscurity/uncertainty, and negative attitudes of health professionals. The factors causing fear of childbirth were the low education level, unemployment status, low financial status, stillbirth, unplanned pregnancy, indecisiveness about the type of delivery, not attending prenatal education programs, negative effects of other people, insufficient social support, confiding in the healthcare centre and health professional, negative, and indecisive birth perceptions, prior negative birth experiences and not feeling ready for childbirth (p < 0.001). Conclusions The prevalence of fear of childbirth in this Turkish sample, especially in the multipara is higher than in Western countries. Causes of fear of childbirth can vary with countries and even with each region of a country.

AB  - Background: Transgender individuals belong to one of the most stigmatized groups in society. Although the social stigma of transgender individuals has been examined many times, post transition stigma experiences among transgender individuals have received limited research attention. The aim of this study was to examine experiences with stigmatization among Dutch transgender individuals after their transition.Method: Ten trans women (age: M=58.50, SD=9.49) and 10 trans men (age: M=42.90, SD=13.62) participated in face-to-face semistructured interviews. Grounded theory was used to conceptualize and analyze the data. We examined the positive and negative reactions that transgender individuals experienced in the period after their transition. Furthermore, we explored differences between experiences of trans men and trans women. Finally, we examined differences between cisgender men and women regarding their reactions toward transgender individuals.Results: Participants reported improved psychological well-being since transition. However, they still experienced different forms of stigmatization. Trans women appeared to experience stronger social stigma than trans men. Trans women also experienced lower social status after their transition. They mainly experienced negative responses from cisgender men. Participants emphasized the importance of social and peer support.Conclusion: The current study findings demonstrate the presence of stigmatization after transition and argue for psychological aftercare. Social and peer support appeared to be important for coping with stigmatization, and improving the social network of transgender individuals is beneficial. Health providers and researchers are recommended to promote the development of constructive coping skills for transgender individuals with interventions especially targeting trans women.

AB  - Two survey studies, one with a college sample (Study 1, n = 245) and one with a national U.S. adult sample (Study 2, n = 590) examined how media messages can influence attitudes toward Black people in the U.S. A novel contribution is the role of Bounded Generalized Reciprocity, or the belief that members of an outgroup are likely to return a favor (positive), or enact retribution for a wrong (negative) as a factor in the relationship between television use and attitudes. Study 1 (college student sample) found support for a relationship between lifetime television exposure and negative attitudes, mediated by negative reciprocity beliefs. Study 2 (U.S. adult sample) found support for an ambivalence effect, where lifetime television exposure was associated with increases in both positive and negative reciprocity beliefs. This indicates that reciprocity beliefs can be cultivated similarly to other kinds of beliefs (e.g., crime frequency, mean world), and that these beliefs have downstream relationships with racial attitudes. The direction in which they are influenced by television use remains an open question, and likely depends on TV content patterns over time.

AB  - We report research implicating nostalgia as an intrapersonal means of warding off the stigmatization of persons with mental illness. We hypothesized and found that nostalgia about an encounter with a person with mental illness improves attitudes toward the mentally ill. In Experiment 1, undergraduates who recalled an encounter with a mentally ill person while focusing on central (vs. peripheral) features of the nostalgia prototype reported a more positive outgroup attitude. This beneficial effect of nostalgia was mediated by greater inclusion of the outgroup in the self (IOGS). In Experiment 2, undergraduates who recalled a nostalgic (vs. ordinary) interaction with a mentally ill person subsequently showed a more positive outgroup attitude. Results supported a serial mediation model whereby nostalgia increased social connectedness, which predicted greater IOGS and outgroup trust. IOGS and outgroup trust, in turn, predicted more positive outgroup attitudes. We ruled out alternative explanations for the results (i.e., mood, perceived positivity, and typicality of the recalled outgroup member). The findings speak to the intricate psychological processes underlying the prejudice-reduction function of nostalgia and their interventional potential. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - FREE AND FAIR: JUDICIAL INTERVENTION IN ELECTIONS BEYOND THE PURCELL PRINCIPLE AND ANDERSON-BURDICK BALANCING
T2  - FORDHAM LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
KW  - COURTS
AB  - The United States's politically charged 2020 federal election, conducted in the midst of a global pandemic, seismically shook the fault lines of state and local elections administration nationwide. Voters, candidates, parties, states, and political campaigns brought hundreds of claims to the courts, seeking judicial intervention to protect equity in their voting rights. The 2020 pandemic election cases demonstrated that Equal Protection claims relying on the Anderson-Burdick balancing test are both overly reliant on judicial discretion and highly vulnerable to invalidation under the Purcell principle.
   This Note examines the equal protection challenges raised in courts throughout the country in 2020 to demonstrate the need for a voter equity-based approach to equal protection claims that goes beyond the Purcell principle's weak threshold protections. This Note proposes the Carolene test, a novel threshold test for equal protection claims in voting rights cases that determines the appropriateness of judicial intervention based on: (1) whether an election process or procedure change relates to voters' ability to participate in the political process, (2) whether the change prejudices discrete and insular minorities, and (3) whether the change would expand or diminish the franchise.

AB  - The Design of the flight simulator mechanism is an essential link in the development of aviation technology. The six-degree-of-freedom Stewart parallel mechanism is used as the mechanical body of most traditional flight simulators. They can simulate the six-degree-of-freedom motion of the aircraft. However, the reachable attitude of the moving platform of the Stewart parallel mechanism is relatively small, and its range of motion is +/- 35 degrees, which can only achieve a small range of yaw, roll and pitch. It can only satisfy the simulation of the attitude change of a civil aviation aircraft. A 4PUS-PPPS redundant parallel mechanism equipped with visual function is proposed to simulate the high motion performance of fighter aircraft, which can realize the movement of angles (- 90 degrees,178 degrees) around the horizontal axis of the aircraft. The flight attitude data of the aircraft were acquired and processed by filtering algorithms in the software of Unity 3D environment. Then, the three steering gears that simulate the action of the moving platform are controlled by the processed data, which realizes the simulation control of the combination of virtual and honest and provides a new idea for the research of redundant parallel mechanisms.

AB  - In this article we explore the relationship between education and levels of trust and tolerance in Europe. More specifically we assess whether the relationship between years of schooling and the extent to which individuals trust others in their communities and are tolerant towards immigrants varies across European countries and attempt to identify possible sources of these variations. Findings based on data from the first three rounds of the European Social Survey indicate that the association between education and levels of trust and tolerance varies significantly across countries and that a major source of this variation lies in the way in which individuals react to the level of diversity in the country where they live.

AB  - Background: Monitoring and surveillance are a fundamental part of the workplace environment, with employee performance and productivity as the main objects of scrutiny. However, many questions surround the ethical nature of managements' ability to employ advanced digital technologies to monitor employee behaviour and performance while in the workplace. If unaddressed, these concerns have the potential to significantly impact the relationship between the employee and the employer, impacting trust in management resulting in negative attitudes and counterproductive behaviours. Objectives: The goal of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of workplace surveillance whilst outlining some of the emerging issues relating to the use of employee monitoring technologies in the workplace. Methods/Approach: A detailed review of the literature was conducted in order to identify the major issues relating to workplace surveillance. In addition, a number of practitioner-based studies were examined to extract and identify emerging trends and concerns at an industry level. Results: Workplace surveillance is on the rise; however, empirical studies are in short supply. Conclusions: The issue of workplace surveillance is an under-researched area, which requires much attention. There is a distinct need for clear measures and structures that govern the effective and fair use of communication technologies in the workplace.

AB  - A large portion of research in the social sciences is devoted to using interventions to combat societal and social problems, such as prejudice, discrimination, and intergroup conflict. However, these interventions are often developed using the theories and/or intuitions of the individuals who developed them and evaluated in isolation without comparing their efficacy with other interventions. Here, we make the case for an experimental design that addresses such issues: an intervention tournament-that is, a study that compares several different interventions against a single control and uses the same standardized outcome measures during assessment and participants drawn from the same population. We begin by highlighting the utility of intervention tournaments as an approach that complements other, more commonly used approaches to addressing societal issues. We then describe various approaches to intervention tournaments, which include crowdsourced, curated, and in-house-developed intervention tournaments, and their unique characteristics. Finally, we discuss practical recommendations and key design insights for conducting such research, given the existing literature. These include considerations of intervention-tournament deployment, characteristics of included interventions, statistical analysis and reporting, study design, longitudinal and underlying psychological mechanism assessment, and theoretical ramifications.

TI  - Tragedy and Resentment
T2  - MIND
LA  - English
AB  - According to Kantian ethics, immoral actions convey disrespect. This negative attitude makes injuries inflicted by other persons worse than injuries caused by nature, ceteris paribus. As Strawson would later put it, the perpetrator's attitude of disregard prompts in the victim the reactive attitude of resentment. But, I point out, we harbour and display plenty of other negative attitudes toward people aside from disrespect. What, if any, reactive attitudes are natural and appropriate in response to these? In unrequited love, for example, the beloved denies the lover a certain kind of recognition that she desires. I claim that this often prompts resentment in the lover, despite the fact that she has suffered no moral wrongdoing-that her injury is, as I term it, 'tragic'. If this is so, we must reconceive the meaning of resentment, distinguishing it sharply from indignation. After offering such a reinterpretation of resentment and indignation, I show how 'tragic resentment' might be warranted despite lacking a moral claim. If the beloved bears a deep responsibility for not reciprocating the love, then he is subject to negative reactive attitudes for it, despite the fact that he cannot choose whom to love and has no obligation to love.

AB  - To theatricalize law is to ask lawyers to be aware and responsive to the world that creates them and to be conscious of worlds beyond words. For the theatrical reminds us that law has to see as well as to interpret, and that seeing occurs through the body, even more so than the intellect. Reviewing the work of some of the key scholars whose work engages with the concept of theatricalizing law, this article challenges the presumption of dramatic verities and certainties as the mark of an effective critical form in law. Instead, to think law theatrically challenges knowledge, expectations, beliefs, certainties, assumptions, and prejudices, and this article concludes with an example of the challenge wrought by a simple theatricalization in which a set of images that could and did mean anything were played, allowing the audience to make their choices because they were unguided. And then the most exceptional and meaningless of the images were explained, and the horror imbricated in them revealed. This theatricalization did its job, and the text revealed in ways that law as drama could not, as this article reveals, as a theatricalization of its own.

AB  - Epilepsy remains misunderstood, particularly in resource poor countries (RPC). We developed and validated a tool to assess beliefs and attitudes about epilepsy among people with epilepsy (PWE) in Kilifi, Kenya. The 50-item scale was developed through a literature review and qualitative study findings, and its reliability and validity were assessed with 673 PWE. A final scale of 34 items had Cronbach's alpha scores for the five subscales: causes of epilepsy (alpha = 0.71); biomedical treatment of epilepsy (alpha = 0.70); cultural treatment of epilepsy (alpha = 0.75); risk and safety concerns about epilepsy (alpha = 0.56); and negative attitudes about epilepsy (alpha = 0.76) and entire scale (alpha = 0.70). Test-retest reliability was acceptable for all the subscales.
   The Kilifi Epilepsy Beliefs and Attitude Scale is a reliable and valid tool that measures beliefs and attitudes about epilepsy. It may be useful in other RPC or as a tool to assess the effectiveness of interventions to improve knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about epilepsy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study established the internal consistency of the SDO6 scale as a measure of Social Dominance Orientation in South Africa. The reliability was determined for its original English version and for newly developed Afrikaans and isiXhosa forms. Reliabilities were determined for various demographic sub-groups. The English and Afrikaans forms showed high internal consistencies throughout, which were comparable to those found in other societies. The isiXhosa version of the scale had low internal consistencies, except for participants who had completed their schooling. Deleting three items from the isiXhosa scale improved its reliability for high school students to an adequate level. It is suggested that future research establishes the scales' validity in the South African context.

AB  - A novel method (the 'gyro method') was developed to monitor the attitude and dynamic acceleration of free-moving aquatic animals with high precision and temporal resolution (100 Hz) using a new type of animal-attached data logger with a 3-axis gyroscope, a 3-axis accelerometer, and a 3-axis magnetometer. The gyro method was applied to green sea turtles Chelonia mydas in both tank and open-sea experiments, and the data for 2 types of activity (steady swimming and breathing) were compared to those obtained by a conventional method with only an accelerometer and a magnetometer, using low-pass filtering or running mean smoothing to determine gravity-based acceleration. Significant differences (mean +/- SD: 0.034 +/- 0.012 g and 1.964 +/- 1.090 degrees for steady swimming) were found in the reconstructed gravity-based acceleration and attitude between the gyro method and the conventional method. The gyro method reconstructed the fluctuation in attitude associated with the power stroke of the sea turtles, which was not documented by the conventional method. Additionally, the dynamic acceleration determined by the conventional method differed from the true dynamic acceleration, whereas the gyro method was able to reconstruct any attitude change (and therefore dynamic acceleration) without using the vague criteria involved with low-pass filtering or running mean smoothing in the conventional method. Hence, our new method will be useful for accurately measuring kinematics and movement performance involving complicated changes in motion, such as foraging for prey and escaping from predators, or the interactions of endangered species with fishing gear.

AB  - Purpose - This paper seeks to explore the relationships between organization-based self-esteem and narcissism, and their correlates. It aims to distinguish the two constructs, as well as to examine the degree to which organization-based self-esteem is contaminated by "false self-esteem" (namely, narcissism).
   Design/methodology/approach - Participants completed questionnaires containing measures of organization-based self-esteem, narcissism, and a variety of motivational, attitudinal, and behavioral consequences. Co-workers rated the participants' extra-role and in-role performance behaviors.
   Findings - Organization-based self-esteem and narcissism appear to be quite distinct constructs. The organization-based self-esteem scale is unbiased by variance associated with narcissism. Organization-based self-esteem is associated with a variety of positive outcomes. In particular, organization-based self-esteem correlates negatively with hostility, while narcissism correlates positively with hostility.
   Practical implications - The hypothesized negative attitudes and behaviors of narcissists were not found. However, organizations need to be cautious when delivering negative feedback-to employees high in narcissism. Supervisors need to provide concrete evidence about deficiencies in narcissists' performance when providing feedback.
   Originality/value - This is the first study to examine the relationships between organization-based self-esteem and narcissism in an organizational context.

AB  - This paper aims to submit a research results whose objective is to interpret social representations considered by young inmate males from the Centro de Educacion El Oasis, in relation with sexual an reproductive rights and their incidence in adolescent pregnancy, in order to lead them to a resignification process evident in their own life project. It is a qualitative study developed from a participatory methodology in Colombia, 2015. The sample consisted of a total of 60 young adults, including 46 teens and managers. The techniques used were a social survey given to 46 adolescents, an unstructured interview to 30, focus groups and resignification workshops. The representations by teenagers and young people about the subject came from female figures, inculcated early, when still in their homes, according to the socio-cultural contexts in which they were inserted. Thus, their beliefs do not favor the development of practices aimed at preventing diseases and teenage pregnancy, in addition to reinforcing stereotyped ideals of masculinity and femininity and prejudices in relation to sex, prioritizing sexist and homophobic notions regarding gender roles.

AB  - Background: The growing trend of women infected with HIV through sexual transmission is alarming. Factors influencing condom use have not yet been fully identified, especially in countries with conservative cultures and backgrounds. The present study aimed to explore the barriers of condom use in Iranian women at risk of HIV.
   Methods: Using the grounded theory methodology, participants' experiences and their perceptions regarding condom were collected during semi structured in depth interviews. Participants were 22 women, aged 21-49 years, considered to be at risk for HIV, due to their own or their partner's sexual behaviors. Qualitative analysis of the data was conducted manually and was guided by constant comparative analysis.
   Results: Two main barriers, personal and socio-environmental emerged from data analysis. Lack of perceived threat, absence of protective motivation, inadequate knowledge, perceived lack of control, negative attitudes towards condom and misperception were the major personal barriers, while unsupportive environments and cultural norms were the common socio-environmental barriers to condom use among these at risk women.
   Conclusions: These critical barriers have to be addressed for implementing effective prevention programs against HIV among populations at risk for HIV.

AB  - This study examined whether attitudinal and emotional responses to broadcasts of images of terrorist events differ according to ethnic group (Jewish and Arab Israelis) and outgroup affiliation during an intense wave of terrorism that occurred in Israel during 2015. Participants were 118 Jewish and 110 Arab-Israelis adults randomly allocated to a terrorism or criminal violence television broadcast. State anxiety, state anger, stereotypes, and negative attitudes toward an adversary were examined prior and subsequent to the media exposure. Findings showed significant increases in anxiety, anger, stereotypes, and negative adversary perceptions in the terrorism exposure group compared to only anxiety increases in the criminal violence exposure. In the terrorism exposure group, Jewish participants showed greater increases in negative adversary perceptions of the Palestinians than Arab Israeli participants, but both groups showed similar significant increases in levels of anxiety and anger. Exposure to broadcasts of terrorism increased willingness to negotiate with the adversary among the Arab participants, but not among the Jewish participants. In the terrorism exposure group, both Jewish and Arab Israelis with high affiliation with the Palestinian cause showed less increases in stereotypes than those with low affiliation. Findings emphasize the role of ethnicity and outgroup affiliation in responses to media exposure to terrorism images.

AB  - Objective
   Stigmatizing attitudes towards eating disorders negatively impacts treatment seeking. To determine the effect of interventions to reduce stigma, a measure of stigma that is simple to implement is required. This study aimed to develop a measure of stigmatizing attitudes and beliefs towards bulimia nervosa (SAB-BN) and evaluate the distribution of beliefs across gender, age, education, and income groups.
   Method
   Participants were 1828 community adults (890 men; 938 women) aged 18-65 sampled from the Australian Electoral Roll responded to a mailed questionnaire. Participants provided demographic information and completed the SAB-BN questionnaire.
   Results
   Five components of stigmatizing attitudes and beliefs were identified; advantages of BN, minimization/low seriousness, unreliability, social distance, and personal responsibility. Stigma was low except on social distance and personal responsibility sub-scales, which indicated negative attitudes toward people with bulimia. Men compared with women and lower compared with higher education and income groups held significantly higher stigmatizing attitudes and beliefs. There were few differences between age groups in stigma. Differences between demographic groups provides evidence for known-groups validity.
   Discussion
   The SAB-BN questionnaire provides a potentially useful tool for evaluating stigma in relation to BN.
   Results provide insight into components of stigma and the demographic groups to whom interventions should be targeted. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Background: Since the illegalization of involuntary sterilization of persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities, there has been an increase in childbearing in this population. However, women with intellectual and developmental disabilities continue to experience prejudicial attitudes toward their pregnancies.
   Objective: To analyze the experiences of women with intellectual and developmental disabilities regarding their perceptions of support persons' attitudes toward their pregnancies.
   Methods: Three case studies derived from grounded theory research exploring perinatal social support received by women with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Using inductive content analysis, we further analyzed the perceptions of women with intellectual and developmental disabilities regarding support persons' attitudes toward their pregnancies.
   Findings: The nature of interactions with support persons and women's characteristics, such as help-seeking behaviors, disability, mental illness, and age, influenced support persons' attitudes toward childbearing. Women preferred support from caregivers perceived as nonjudgmental and tended to restrict contact with persons perceived as prejudicial. However, some attitudes improved following positive interactions with the women. The relationship between support persons' attitudes and the women's help-seeking behaviors is thus complex.
   Conclusions: Education of families and medical and social services practitioners and opportunities for positive contact should be further explored. Caseworkers of women with intellectual and developmental disabilities may have invaluable roles in facilitating positive interactions between women with intellectual and developmental disabilities and caregivers.

AB  - Background: Obesity is common in many industrialized nations and often accompanied by related health issues. Furthermore, individuals living with overweight or obesity are often confronted with stigmatization in their daily lives. These problems may be aggravated if the objectivity of health care professionals is compromised due to (unconscious) prejudices. If pharmaceutical companies, regulatory agencies, and health insurers are also susceptible to these biases, decisions related to the development, approval, and reimbursement of obesity-related therapies may be negatively impacted. Materials and Methods: The 'Implicit Association Test' (IAT) is a psychometric test allowing to measure these attitudes and could therefore assist to reveal unconscious preferences. A self-developed mobile version, in the form of a ResearchKit-based IAT app was employed in the presented study. The objective was to determine (potential) weight bias and its characteristics for professionals attending a national obesity-related conference in Germany (G1), compared to a control group (without stated interest in the topic, G2) - both using the mobile app - and a historical control (G3) based on data provided by Project Implicit acquired by a web app. Results: Explicit evaluations of G1 were neutral at a higher percentage compared with G2 and G3, while implicit preference toward lean individuals did not differ significantly between G2 and G3, and G1. Conclusion: The greater discrepancy between the (more neutral) explicit attitude and the unconscious preference pointing in the anti-obesity direction could indicate an underestimated bias for the professional participants in G1. Implicit preference is often ingrained from childhood on, and difficult to overcome. Thus, even for professionals, it may unconsciously influence decisions made in the care they provide. Professionals in any given health care sector directed at obesity care should thus be made aware of this inconsistency to enable them to consciously counteract this potential effect.

AB  - Australia is at the forefront of tobacco control, yet 17% of Australian women smoke during pregnancy. Negative attitudes to smoking are intensified when the smoker is pregnant, consistent with a discourse that encourages surveillance of pregnant women. Such overt anti-smoking attitudes create a context which may make it difficult for pregnant smokers to seek assistance to stop. However, there is little evidence on the extent to which pregnant smokers are stigmatised by community members. We used vignettes to examine the degree of smoking-related stigma expressed by 595 Australian university students who rated a woman, described as a mother who was smoking or not, and pregnant or not. Further, we examined whether provision of individuating information reduced the degree of stigma. Mothers described as smokers were rated more negatively than those not, particularly if they were pregnant: smokers were perceived as unhealthy, and also as bad mothers. Provision of individuating information slightly reduced these effects. These findings support the view that smokers - particularly if pregnant - are subject to negative moral judgement. Our findings contribute to the ethical debate about stigma-inducing tobacco control efforts, and suggest that anti-smoking campaigns that contextualise smoking in pregnancy might reduce stigma and assist cessation.

AB  - African Americans who use substances experience a particular risk for HIV. Negative attitudes towards condoms are a strong predictor of risk and can serve as barriers to safe sex. They also vary by gender. In a secondary analysis of data from two National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network trials collecting data from 2004 to 2006, the relationship between gender, unprotected sex, and condom barriers among 203 African Americans in substance use treatment was examined. Results indicated that no gender differences were present in unprotected sex. Men reported more motivational barriers to condom use and were more likely to believe that condoms would impede sexual experience (the latter not statistically significant). For both genders, the perception that condoms might negatively impact sexual experience was associated with unprotected sex. Gender did not moderate the relationship between condom barriers and unprotected sex. These findings suggest the need for gender and race-specific prevention strategies that focus on motivation and address pleasure-based concerns regarding condoms. Substance use treatment facilities are well-positioned to support interventions to target these issues.

AB  - Simple Summary Certain facial characteristics in companion animals are perceived by humans as being 'cute'. This includes having large eyes, a round head and a small nose and mouth. These characteristics, which are shared with human infants, trigger care-giving responses in humans. Despite this, however, companion animal abuse occurs. The aim of this research was to better understand cognitive processes of people with pro-social personality traits and positive attitudes towards animals compared to those with anti-social personality traits and negative attitudes towards animals. This was done by assessing participants' ability to detect cues of cuteness in animal and human infant faces (study 1) and by assessing attention to cuteness cues via an eye-tracking task (study 2). Findings indicate that the ability to detect cuteness cues is widespread, regardless of personality or attitudes. However, individuals with anti-social personality traits and negative attitudes towards animals chose to pay less attention to 'cute' stimuli in the eye-tracking task. This proof of concept study is an initial step in determining how individuals 'at risk' of committing animal abuse process information on infant features in animals.
   Abstract Infant features are physical traits that are characteristic of human infants and include facial features such as large and low-lying eyes, and a small nose and mouth. Animals possessing high levels of infant features elicit care-giving responses in humans. Despite this, animal cruelty is a common occurrence. The aim of this research was to determine whether the ability to recognise and/or attend to infant features is linked to subclinical psychopathic traits and attitudes towards animals. Using a community sample, participants (n = 387) completed a cuteness forced-choice task. Self-reported psychopathy and attitude towards animals were not related to the participants' ability to detect cues of cuteness in human infants and animals. In a second study, participants (n = 142) were screened for low versus high primary psychopathy and low versus high animal attitude scores. A Psychopathy-Attitude Composite score was created and a subset of participants (n = 50) from the upper and lower quartiles completed a free-viewing eye-tracking task where 'Cute', 'Neutral, 'Monetary' and 'Control' images were presented in pairs. Higher levels of psychopathic traits and an anti-animal welfare attitude were associated with decreased attention to 'Cute' images in terms of decreased dwell time, mean fixation duration and mean fixation count, measures of voluntary attention. There were a number of interactions between Psychopathy-Attitude Composite classification and attention to each image category in terms of dwell time, first fixation duration, mean fixation duration and fixation count. These findings support the theory that individuals with psychopathic traits recognise facial cues of vulnerability but choose to give them reduced attentional priority. This may have implications for animal welfare.

AB  - Background: In Western countries, caring for older people was viewed as an unattractive area by nursing students. The literature reported a number of barriers, including ageism that contributed to this undesirable situation.
   Aim: The purpose of this study was to explore factors affecting nursing students' intention to work with older people in a university in China.
   Method: A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 622 nursing students enrolled in a 4-year Bachelor of Nursing programme at the university. Data analysis methods mainly included Chi-Square test, Mann-Whitney test, factor analysis and logistical regression.
   Results: Working with older people was ranked as the second to least preferred area by nursing students. Ageist attitudes described as Prejudice was negatively associated with intention to work with older people; while students aged under-20 were more positively associated with an intention to work with older people.
   Conclusion: Nursing curriculum should be designed to target ageist attitude, by promoting socialisation with older people and creating more supportive learning environments in the care setting of older people. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Four studies examined children's (ages 3-10, Total N = 235) naive theories of social groups, in particular, their expectations about how group memberships constrain social interactions. After introduction to novel groups of people, preschoolers (ages 3-5) reliably expected agents from one group to harm members of the other group (rather than members of their own) but expected agents to help members of both groups equally often. Preschoolers expected between-group harm across multiple ways of defining social groups. Older children (ages 6-10) reliably expected agents to harm members of the other group and to help members of their own. Implications for the development of social cognition are discussed.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this research is to investigate: how many journal titles are both in LOCKSS and in Portico?: what is the relationship of small publishers to LOCKSS/CLOCKSS and Portico?: and what is the relationship of large publishers to LOCKSS/CLOCKSS and Portico?
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper describes how data from Portico, LOCKSS, and CLOCKSS were cleaned and analyzed using Perl programs to discover duplications.
   Findings - The findings show a significant overlap among the archiving systems. They also show that Portico has no prejudice against small publishers and that large publishers are as willing to choose the LOCKSS software as to choose Portico. LOCKSS does, however, archive many more small and arguably endangered publishers and may be the only economically viable choice for them.
   Originality/value - The push for greater transparency has made more and more data available. Both LOCKSS and Portico deserve commendation for providing the detailed lists of titles and publishers on which this paper was based. Such data give the library community an opportunity to build decisions about the long-term digital future on firm and verifiable ground.

AB  - Culture has become increasingly important concepts in nursing in the era of globalization. Nurses' cultural biases and prejudices are huge obstacles to their caring for patients from diverse cultural backgrounds. Therefore, this study examined sexism among nursing students from two patriarchal societies: Turkey influenced by Islam, and South Korea influenced by Confucianism. For this comparative study, we used the survey data from the sample of 560 nursing students, 309 from Turkey and 251 from South Korea. The findings showed that both samples showed high levels of sexism, both hostile and benevolent. When comparing the two samples, Turkish nursing students showed significantly higher sexism than did Korean students. Additionally, in both countries, male participants showed higher scores on sexism, especially hostile sexism. In terms of age, older students in Turkey showed lower levels of benevolent sexism. We hope the findings of this study can provide evidence to develop customized transcultural nursing education content in the context of different ethnicities and to help nurses and nursing students from specific cultural backgrounds in becoming aware of their own cultures.

AB  - There has recently been a call for the use of more diverse images by the media to promote body satisfaction. This experimental study evaluated the impact of body diversity images and whether these could act as a buffer against thin-ideal norms. Female participants (n = 106, aged 16-30 years) completed measures of body compassion, body and face satisfaction before and after random allocation to images reflecting one of three interventions: control, body diversity and thin-ideal. Attitudes towards thin-ideal images were also assessed. The results showed significant differences between groups for overall body compassion, the body compassion subtype of body kindness, body satisfaction and face satisfaction with those viewing the body diversity images reporting higher scores after exposure compared to the other two groups. Those in the body diversity group also displayed more negative attitudes towards thin-ideal images compared to controls. No between groups differences were found for body compassion subtypes relating to common humanity, motivated action and body criticism or positive attitudes to the thin-ideal images. In sum, exposure to body diversity images had a positive impact on body kindness and overall body compassion and body satisfaction providing experimental support for the use of diversity images as a buffer against thin-deals.

AB  - During the long career of French painter Georges Rouault (1871-1958), the artist is known to have created around 170 paintings featuring images of popular entertainers, most often circus performers and clowns. Painted in the artist's signature 'messy' style, the clowns depicted often appear out of their performative context and in an unhappy state that seems incongruous with their character. This article makes a case that such an approach falls under the category of (un)popular art, which occurs when artists appropriate and then dismantle popular images in order to construct works of high art. The author argues that while the artist's aesthetic clearly oversees a shift in the cultural status of the clown from popular to elite art, the effects of Rouault's expressionism are strongly dependent upon acknowledging the popular dimensions of the work. Reconceptualising the exchanges between certain cultural forms, such as those between popular culture forms and the avant-garde, as (un)popular offers a productive way of foregrounding the essential contribution popular culture has made to elite culture, and helps redress the historical prejudices which have established the popular as antithetical to works of high art.

AB  - Objective To examine the perceived effectiveness of text and pictorial smokeless tobacco health warnings in India and Bangladesh, including different types of message content.
   Methods An experimental study was conducted in Navi Mumbai, India (n = 1002), and Dhaka, Bangladesh (n = 1081). Face-to-face interviews were conducted on tablets with adult (>= 19 years) smokeless tobacco users and youth (16-18 years) users and non-users. Respondents viewed warnings depicting five health effects, within one of the four randomly assigned warning label conditions (or message themes): (1) text-only, (2) symbolic pictorial, (3) graphic pictorial or (4) personal testimonial pictorial messages.
   Results Text-only warnings were perceived as less effective than all of the pictorial styles (p<0.001 for all). Graphic warnings were given higher effectiveness ratings than symbolic or testimonial warnings (p<0.001). No differences were observed in levels of agreement with negative attitudes and beliefs across message themes, after respondents had viewed warnings.
   Conclusions Pictorial warnings are more effective than text-only messages. Pictorial warnings depicting graphic health effects may have the greatest impact, consistent with research from high-income countries on cigarette warnings.

AB  - When the Australian Association of Adult Education (AAAE) was established in 1960, Australia was locked into a global conflict between capitalism and communism, known as the Cold War. With anti-communism at fever pitch, AAAE's founders who were fighting to retain some influence with Australian universities and with government funding authorities needed an origin story which would appeal to these prejudices. Not surprisingly, therefore, histories of 'the profession' produced in the first decades largely dismissed the role of the many radical adult educators and left-wing organisations which had been instrumental in extending adult education to the working class in the first half of the twentieth century. One of the main sources for these early histories was a memoir of David Stewart, founder of the Workers Education Association, written in 1957 by a university adult educator, Esmonde McDonald Higgins. In this paper, I tell a different story, through a close examination of Higgins' own role in this early history, to show how 1960s 'official' adult education lost touch with its own roots in radical working class politics, roots which are only now re-emerging, through the study of popular education and social movement learning.

AB  - New technologies like large-scale social media sites (e.g., Facebook and Twitter) and crowdsourcing services (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk, Crowdflower, Clickworker) are impacting social science research and providing many new and interesting avenues for research. The use of these new technologies for research has not been without challenges, and a recently published psychological study on Facebook has led to a widespread discussion of the ethics of conducting large-scale experiments online. Surprisingly little has been said about the ethics of conducting research using commercial crowdsourcing marketplaces. In this article, I focus on the question of which ethical questions are raised by data collection with crowdsourcing tools. I briefly draw on the implications of Internet research more generally, and then focus on the specific challenges that research with crowdsourcing tools faces. I identify fair pay and the related issue of respect for autonomy, as well as problems with the power dynamic between researcher and participant, which has implications for withdrawal without prejudice, as the major ethical challenges of crowdsourced data. Furthermore, I wish to draw attention to how we can develop a "best practice" for researchers using crowdsourcing tools.

AB  - It is argued that food addiction explanations of obesity may reduce the significant stigma levelled at obese and overweight individuals. We surveyed 479 adults to determine the prevalence of food addiction in the U.S. (n = 215) and, for the first time, in Australia (n = 264) using the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS). We also assessed the level of weight-based stigma in this population. The prevalence of food addiction in our Australian sample was 11%, similar to U.S. participants and consistent with previous studies. Those who met criteria for diagnosis had a larger mean BMI (33.8 kg/m(2)) than those who did not (26.5 kg/m(2)). Overall, the level of stigma towards others was low and differed significantly based on BMI, predominately among normal weight and obese participants (p = 0.0036). Obese individuals scored higher on certain measures of stigma, possibly reflecting individual experiences of stigma rather than negative attitudes towards other obese individuals (p = 0.0091). Despite significant support for a "food addiction" explanation of obesity, participants still valued personal responsibility in overcoming obesity and did not support coercive approaches to treat their "addiction".

AB  - Interprofessional collaboration (IPC) is important for the delivery of effective integrated health and social care systems. Interprofessional practice learning (IPPL) enables students to learn to work together within a relevant context and prepare for future IPC. While there is some evidence that negative attitudes impact on IPC and interprofessional education, there is a dearth of research on health and social work professionals' attitudes and perspectives of IPC and IPPL opportunities for students. A mixed-methods case study was used to investigate practice educators' attitudes and perspectives of IPC and IPPL for their students. Results showed that attitudes were positive and that mainly meso- and macro-level factors, as opposed to the micro level, impacted on the implementation of IPC and IPPL for students' learning in practice settings. IPC was perceived to be best enabled by effective communication, established teams, IPPL for staff, and shared processes and policies. Close working proximity to other professionals encouraged informal communication and positive interprofessional relationships. Motivation and resources were perceived as enablers of IPPL, but there were often missed opportunities for IPPL. These findings suggest that further work is required to identify systems for improving IPC and to enhance IPPL opportunities for students learning within practice settings.

AB  - This interview was conducted on 8 October 2011 at the Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven. It was held during a symposium that reflected on the work of Ranciere and was a part of a broader engagement with the concept of autonomy and its relation to art organized by an umbrella group of universities and arts organizations under the name of The Autonomy Project'. A number of the symposium's participants - Peter Osborne, Gerald Raunig, Isabell Lorey, Ruth Sondregger, Kim Mereiene and Adrian Martin - contributed questions that formed the basis of this interview. The interview took place at a time when the longer-term possibilities of the Arab Spring and Occupy/Indignados movements were under general scrutiny. It was also a moment when the Van Abbemuseum itself was compelled to reflect on its own position of political autonomy in relation to neoliberal state directives, political populism at the local level and its own critique of aesthetic autonomy. Ranciere's work on aesthetics and politics has been as much appreciated as a clearance strategy against prevailing visual prejudices as it has served as a platform for rethinking the emancipatory potential of creative practice.

AB  - Political parody, which is entitled to free speech protection under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, aims at criticizing politicians' policies and ideas with humor. As such, political parodies represent a serious threat to a politician's brand image and reputation. Despite their prevalence in political life and debates, the relative persuasive effects of political parodies based on their communication source (user-generated parody [UGP] vs. media-generated parody [MGP]) have been underexplored. To fill this gap, we developed two studies. The first study involved content analysis of more than 330 parody videos posted on YouTube between 2012 and April 2019 in France. Our findings, in Study 1, showed that MGP led to fewer likes and a more negative attitude toward the parody than UGP. The second study, based on controlled experiment, provided evidence through mediation; compared to UGP, MGP led to more negative attitudes toward the parody and less perceived influence of the parody because of a higher perception of the source's intention to manipulate. This mediating effect was significant only when individuals were highly skeptical of traditional media. These findings add to current theories of political parody, free speech and user-generated content and offer actionable insights to practitioners.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to explore perceptions of the Digital Twin (a three-dimensional digital representation of an anatomical body) on a mobile health application, and the potential mechanisms that are important for behaviour change, with a focus on health and weight management. An explorative and participant-led approach was taken using semi-structured online interviews to explore the experiences of people, in this case non-users and users wanting to independently manage their health. An opportunity sample of forty participants from the United Kingdom (20 who had not used digitally assistive technology and 20 who had) were recruited from social media platforms (22 females and 18 males; mean age was 30). The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Thematic Analysis. Two main themes were elicited: Initiators of behaviour change (i.e., autonomous choices, social influences, and personalisation) and Barriers to behaviour change (i.e., adverse reactions, weight management norms and negative attitudes). Overall, it was suggested that the Digital Twin should be representative of a user's personalised health information and BMI. These results can inform an intervention designed to use the Digital Twin to initiate and maintain lifestyle behaviour change. It can also develop our understanding of how such technology can be applied as a tool for health management.

AB  - The temporal and eternal often cross paths in economic and financial transactions, with the blending of religion and commerce producing divergent views. Nevertheless, churches increasingly use commercial methods such as marketing and retailing for, inter alia, fundraising, connecting with congregations and keeping abreast of social, technological and economic changes. As with most businesses, churches may investigate their target consumers in order to align their efforts to meet the needs of consumers. The peculiar nature of religious consumption has both short-term, product-based needs and long-term spiritual influences. This study investigated the attitudes of church members toward church retailing and various types of church retail products. A series of 26 in-depth interviews were conducted for this study, resulting in antithetical attitudes toward the broad concept of church retailing, and with more distinct positive and negative attitudes toward particular product types. Generally, attitudes were more positive toward products perceived to be more authentic with regard to the religious mission of the church, and more negative toward products perceived as straying from it. Furthermore, attitudes in relation to church retailing were influenced by who the ultimate beneficiaries would be.

AB  - Overweight patients report weight discrimination in health care settings and subsequent avoidance of routine preventive health care. The purpose of this study was to examine implicit and explicit attitudes about weight among a large group of medical doctors (MDs) to determine the pervasiveness of negative attitudes about weight among MDs. Test-takers voluntarily accessed a public Web site, known as Project Implicit (R), and opted to complete the Weight Implicit Association Test (IAT) (N = 359,261). A sub-sample identified their highest level of education as MD (N = 2,284). Among the MDs, 55% were female, 78% reported their race as white, and 62% had a normal range BMI. This large sample of test-takers showed strong implicit anti-fat bias (Cohen's d=1.0). MDs, on average, also showed strong implicit anti-fat bias (Cohen's d=0.93). All test-takers and the MD sub-sample reported a strong preference for thin people rather than fat people or a strong explicit anti-fat bias. We conclude that strong implicit and explicit anti-fat bias is as pervasive among MDs as it is among the general public. An important area for future research is to investigate the association between providers' implicit and explicit attitudes about weight, patient reports of weight discrimination in health care, and quality of care delivered to overweight patients.

AB  - Background: In addition to administering vaccinations, healthcare professionals (HCPs) also play a crucial role in providing education and advocacy to the public regarding immunizations. Yet, many current and future HCPs are unprepared or reluctant to address the vaccine conversation with hesitant patients. Doctors, pharmacists, and nurses are all recognized as the most trusted sources of vaccine information. By comparing future HCPs in these three distinct programs, we can better understand where potential gaps may lie in their training and education. With insight from students, potential changes to curriculum can improve future HCPs ability to address vaccine hesitancy in their respective careers. The objective of this study was to assess and compare the knowledge, attitudes, and opinions of HCP students on the topic of immunization.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2017 to assess students in nursing, medical, and pharmacy programs at two universities in the state of North Dakota in the United States. The survey assessed six key themes: 1) demographic information; 2) basic vaccine knowledge; 3) vaccine hesitancy; 4) likelihood to recommend vaccines; 5) confidence in addressing vaccine-related topics with patients; 6) an appraisal of the education they have received on vaccinations.
   Results: The survey was completed by 223 participants (overall response rate=23.7%). Results indicated that vaccine-related knowledge varied greatly by program; high knowledge scores were achieved by 74.3% of medical students, 62.7% of pharmacy students, 57.1% of doctor of nursing practice (DNP) students, and 24.7% of bachelor of science in nursing (BSN) students. Over a third (34.2%) of BSN students believed that the current recommended immunization schedule places undue burden on a child's immune system, versus only 4.3% of medical students. Additionally, 54.2% of participants believed that spreading out recommended vaccines over several visits was an appropriate means of reducing parental stress about vaccinating.
   Conclusions: Participant responses suggest that negative attitudes, lack of knowledge, and general discomfort exist across all programs, but especially among nursing students, regarding vaccination. Our findings indicate potential areas where targeted interventions could be implemented to better equip future HCPs in their ability to discuss and educate the public regarding vaccination.

AB  - There are a growing number of prisoners who self-harm in prisons in England and Wales despite adopting a safer custody ethos. An in-depth study of staff views of self-harm from various agencies within the prison and the integration of their different forms of expertise and perspectives to address this problem is lacking. Negative attitudes to self-harm have been identified as an additional risk factor to this problematic behavior.
   Aim: This study identified and compared relevant attitudinal dimensions of custodial and healthcare staff on prisoners who self-harm in an Adult Male "Local'' Category B prisons (referred to as the study prison) where self-harm was twice the national average (14%).
   Method: Semistructured interviews were conducted with 37 prison staff (14 nurses and 23 prison officers) as part of a mixed methods research study where documentary evidence and a self-harm questionnaire were also used. This paper discusses and presents the findings for the thematic analysis of the semistructured interviews.
   Findings: The key themes identified were understanding self-harm, building relationships, organizational issues, occupational issues, and care management of self-harm. The findings suggest that most prison staff felt unsupported and inadequately equipped to manage self-harm, and reported interdisciplinary conflict on its collective management.

AB  - According to recent statistics from the DGMM (Directorate General of Migration Management of Turkey), more than 3,5 million Syrian refugee people are living in Turkey. This number, however, reflects only registered Syrians, not the many unregistered Syrian refugees and asylum-seekers also living in Turkey. In order to cope with the refugee crisis, various projects are being conducted through the support of national and international funds. Social cohesion has been identified as a key to integrating host and refugee communities. Socio-cultural activities hve been designed to include participants from both communities. In this context, this study aims to discover the attitudes of Turks toward social cohesion which is promoted to be built between them and refugees. This limited research relied on a semi-structured in-depth interview technique as research methodology for a random sample of 45 residents of Ankara living in neighborhoods that contain a high number of refugees. The main reason of limiting the number of participants with 45 was related to reputation. According to findings, the members of the host community are in favor of developing social contact with refugees; however, misinformation and rumors, language barriers, and a lack of social connection were considered as the main factors affecting the negative attitudes of the host community members towards refugees.

AB  - Background: Despite evidence-based national guidelines for ADHD in the United Kingdom (UK), ADHD is under-identified, under-diagnosed, and under-treated. Many seeking help for ADHD face prejudice, long waiting lists, and patchy or unavailable services, and are turning to service-user support groups and/or private healthcare for help.
   Methods: A group of UK experts representing clinical and healthcare providers from public and private healthcare, academia, ADHD patient groups, educational, and occupational specialists, met to discuss shortfalls in ADHD service provision in the UK. Discussions explored causes of under-diagnosis, examined biases operating across referral, diagnosis and treatment, together with recommendations for resolving these matters.
   Results: Cultural and structural barriers operate at all levels of the healthcare system, resulting in a de-prioritization of ADHD. Services for ADHD are insufficient in many regions, and problems with service provision have intensified as a result of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Research has established a range of adverse outcomes of untreated ADHD, and associated long-term personal, social, health and economic costs are high. The consensus group called for training of professionals who come into contact with people with ADHD, increased funding, commissioning and monitoring to improve service provision, and streamlined communication between health services to support better outcomes for people with ADHD.
   Conclusions: Evidence-based national clinical guidelines for ADHD are not being met. People with ADHD should have access to healthcare free from discrimination, and in line with their legal rights. UK Governments and clinical and regulatory bodies must act urgently on this important public health issue.

AB  - Public stigma associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) commonly stems from judgments surrounding sensory overload symptoms. As individuals try and make sense of observed disordered behaviors of those with ASD, they are quick to develop dispositional attributions instead of acknowledging situational instigators. Interventions aimed at educating the lay public that disordered actions are a result of a biological causes have been successful in lessening perceptions of responsibility, yet foster an out-group perspective allowing prejudice attitudes and discriminatory behaviors to persist. The present study examines the short-term effectiveness of engagement with a virtual simulation, Auti-Sim, to combat stigma by giving lay people a first-person experience of sensory overload. To assess Auti-Sim, a between-subject, in-laboratory experimental design was employed. A total of 123 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 interventions (virtual simulation engagement, observation of simulation engagement, or reading text vignettes). Participants completed a brief pretest questionnaire, encountered the intervention, and then completed a post-test questionnaire. Engagement with the virtual simulation resulted in heightened perspective taking, which subsequently increased emotional concern, helping intentions, and willingness to volunteer compared with the observation only or text vignette intervention. Positive attitudes toward those with ASD did not differ across interventions. Fostering a different understanding of disordered action through a virtual simulation has the potential to elicit perspective taking and subsequent empathetic outcomes. Perspective taking seems to encourage perceptions of in-group belonging rather than out-group categorization and thus might be a desired outcome for stigma-reducing efforts.

AB  - 1. We aimed to investigate the effects of high-fat and high-energy (HFHE) diets on the hepatic expression of cytochrome P-450 3A (CYP3A) in developing female rats.
   2. The pups of the dams fed with the standard diet were defined as the NN group and those fed the HFHE diet were defined as the NH group. The mRNA and protein expression, the protein localization and activity was determined.
   3. The mRNA expression of CYP3A1 on day 3 in the NH group were higher versus NN groups (p < 0.05) and the expression of the NH group on days 28 and 56 were lower versus the NN group (p < 0.01). CYP3A1 immunolabeling had a zonal-restricted expressions pattern on day 28 and after in the NN groups, while the obvious zonal expression pattern was observed in the NH group on day 84. The mean activity for the NH groups on days 3, 7, 14 and 28 was higher versus the NN groups (p < 0.05). On day 84, the activity was lower for the NH group versus the NN group (p < 0.05).
   4. Our findings provide a basis for further studies on appropriate medication regimen in obese children.

AB  - Research on 'concept creep' argues that harm-related concepts such as abuse, bullying, prejudice, and trauma have expanded their meanings in recent decades. Theorists have suggested that this semantic expansion may have mixed implications. Broadened concepts might problematize harmful behavior that was previously tolerated but might also make people over-sensitive and fragile. Two studies using American MTurk samples (Ns = 276, 309) examined individual differences in the breadth of people's concepts of harm and explored their correlates. Study 1 found reliable variations in concept breadth that were consistent across four disparate harm-related concepts. As predicted, people with broader concepts tended to endorse harm-based morality, liberal political attitudes, and high empathic concern. Contrary to prediction, younger people did not have broader concepts. Study 2 replicated the association between concept breadth and liberalism and extended the empathy finding by showing that concept breadth was associated with sensitivity to injustice toward others but not the self. In this study, people holding broader concepts were younger and tended to feel more vulnerable and entitled. These findings indicate that holding broader concepts of harm may have mixed implications.

AB  - Objective: This study sought to identify factors associated with patient treatment referral for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) by psychiatrists practicing in Virginia.
   Methods: Psychiatrists (N = 116) were surveyed regarding their knowledge about and attitudes toward ECT. We also inquired into other potential factors that might be associated with referral, such as distance from an ECT provider or availability of transportation.
   Results: Most psychiatrists had a basic understanding of ECT, and most had a favorable opinion of ECT. However, a lesser degree of knowledge about ECT by psychiatrists correlated with both a less favorable view of ECT and with fewer referrals for treatment with ECT. In addition, physicians who viewed ECT as a "treatment of last resort" referred patients only sparingly. Factors that prevented even those physicians with favorable attitudes toward ECT from referring appropriate patients for ECT included patients' negative attitudes toward ECT, the logistics of arranging support and transportation, and financial constraints.
   Conclusions: Patient referral for ECT was associated with the treating physicians' and patients' knowledge and attitudes about ECT and with the presence of specific logistical barriers. Attention to these factors by treating physicians might enhance access to ECT treatment.

AB  - In the Reform Era, the Chinese Government has placed great emphasis on the role of education in ensuring the economic success of individuals and of the country as a whole. While vocational and academic post-secondary qualifications are officially set at the same level, vocational education is positioned at the bottom of the educational hierarchy and suffers considerable societal prejudice. Drawing on the most recent nationwide-representative data, we investigate the labour market positioning of graduates from the two types of education in terms of their income, occupation, and level of employment precariousness. The results suggest that: (1) vocational graduates earn less than academic graduates; (2) the type of post-secondary education is significantly correlated with the likelihood of obtaining white-collar high-skilled positions; and (3) vocational graduates face greater precariousness in their jobs than academic graduates do. This study also reveals that the hierarchically stratified post-secondary system may be a source of economic inequality in the Chinese Reform Era. Moreover, it demonstrates that the visible hand of the state seems to further facilitate the reproduction of current forms of inequality that leave an increasing number of graduates in marginalised labour market positions.

AB  - Background Several of the many emergency department (ED) interventions intended to address the complex problem of (over)crowding are based on the principle of streaming: directing different groups of patients to different processes of care. Although the theoretical basis of streaming is robust, evidence on the effectiveness of these interventions remains inconclusive.
   Methods This qualitative research, grounded in the population-capacity-process model, sought to determine how, why and under what conditions streaming interventions may be effective. Data came from a broader study exploring patient flow strategies across Western Canada through in-depth interviews with managers at all levels. We undertook realist analysis of interview data from the 98 participants who discussed relevant interventions (fast-track/minor treatment areas, rapid assessment zones, diverse short-stay units), focusing on their explanations of initiatives' perceived outcomes.
   Results Essential features of streaming interventions included separation of designated populations (population), provision of dedicated space and resources (capacity) and rapid cycle time (process). These features supported key mechanisms of impact: patients wait only for services they need; patient variability is reduced; lag time between steps is eliminated; and provider attitude change promotes prompt discharge. Conversely, reported failures usually involved neglect of one of these dimensions during intervention design and/or implementation. Participants also identified important contextual barriers to success, notably lack of outflow sites and demand outstripping capacity. Nonetheless, failure was more commonly attributed to intervention flaws than to context factors.
   Conclusions While streaming interventions have the potential to reduce crowding, a theory-based intervention relies on its implementers' adherence to the theory. Streaming interventions cannot be expected to yield the desired results if operationalised in a manner incongruent with the theory on which they are supposedly based.

AB  - Background: Various plant odours have been shown to decrease heart rate and increase parasympathetic nervous activity. However, 'innate' autonomic responses without the influences of experience, assumptions and prejudices of odours remains unclear. Aim: To clarify changes in heart rate and heart rate variability in infants while presenting different components of plant odours. Subjects and methods: The study participants included 17 infants aged 1-3.5 months. Each infant was exposed to the odours of alpha-pinene, D-limonene and air (as a control) for 2 minutes after a 2-minute resting period without any odours. The intervals of heartbeat (R-R intervals) were recorded during this process. Results: Heart rate significantly decreased in response to the odour of limonene. Frequency analysis of heart rate variability revealed that the power value at 0.2 Hz was significantly higher during the odour presentation of limonene compared to the baseline and that at 0.1 Hz and 0.4 Hz was significantly lower during alpha-pinene presentation. Conclusion: Autonomic responses to specific natural odours may be partly shaped innately, while underlying physiological mechanisms may be different between infants and adults.

AB  - We present two studies examining the role of the British press in promoting heuristic-based decision-making about sexual crime. In Study 1, 1014 press articles were used in order to examine the role of the availability heuristic. That is, we used the recent high-profile Jimmy Savile sexual offending scandal to investigate how this case impacted upon press reporting of sexual crime. We found a 295% increase in the frequency of sexual crime coverage after this case, in addition to a 22:1 over-representation of sexual crime prevalence. Linguistically, tabloid stories about sexual crime did not significantly differ in the 12 months following the Jimmy Savile scandal, though broadsheets were less negative in their coverage after the scandal broke. Tabloid headline descriptors of sexual offenders were also substantially more offensive than those used by broadsheets. In Study 2, tabloid readership was associated with more negative attitudes and preferences for harsher punishments for sexual offenders, which we propose may be attributable to the affect heuristic. We discuss our findings within the context of dual-process cognition, and argue that the national press promote heuristic-based thinking about the issue of sexual offending. Future research avenues, and potential implications for press engagement, are also identified.

We utilized social identity theory in showing how Congolese use religious practices at the mentioned church to assert and reaffirm their identity and use it as a form of resilience to any external threat to the existence of their 'culture'. Our findings reveal that there exists a complex relationship between religion and Congolese refugees in Durban that is an identity maker that acts as a form of mobilization and resilience to any form of external threats to the identity of the Congolese community in Durban. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the negotiation and construction of Congolese identity through religious practices at Christ Assemblies Church of Africa can play an important role in determining how prejudices and behaviour that reject, exclude and often vilify persons based on the perception that they are outsiders or foreigners to the community are constructed.

AB  - Professionals' perceptions of patients' health conditions are significant factors which influence the quality of treatment they provide. This study aimed to assess medical social workers' perceptions of their patients' obesity (obesity representations), as well as the relationship between these representations and knowledge about obesity, attitudes toward obesity, and personal exposure to obesity. A convenience sample of 105 medical social workers completed illness representations (dimensions included cause, timeline, consequences, control, coherence, timeline cycle, emotional representation) questionnaires, as well as attitudes toward obese patients, obesity risk knowledge, personal exposure to obesity, and sociodemographic questionnaires.
   Findings Medical social workers perceived obesity as being associated with severe consequences and as being controlled by one's own behavior and through treatment. The medical social workers also expressed high negative emotional representations and significantly high percentage of them held negative attitudes toward obese patients. Multiple regression analyses revealed that personal exposure to obesity and attitudes toward obese patients emerged as significant predictors of timeline, emotional representations, and treatment control.
   Applications The study findings encourage the development of training and support programs, which will deal with the feelings of fear and anger that may accompany the care of obese patients. In addition, the findings can also aid in assessing and evaluating medical social workers' obesity representations.

AB  - Fisher attitudes and the factors that shape them are still poorly understood, especially in recreational fisheries, despite their potential influence on compliance behaviour. In addition to the standard size and daily limits common in recreational fisheries, recreational fishers of the blue cod fishery in New Zealand's Marlborough Sounds are presented with two other unique restrictions. Blue cod must not be filleted while at sea and any fish caught elsewhere must still meet the Marlborough Sounds' size and daily limits if transported through this area. An intercept survey explored fishers' knowledge of and attitudes towards these two regulations in addition to potential influences on their satisfaction with the regulations. Results showed that while overall fishers are dissatisfied with the current regulations, both knowledge and attitudes differed between the specific rules examined. Furthermore, the most experienced and locally resident fishers displayed higher levels of knowledge but more negative attitudes towards regulations. Regulation influence on fishing habits and satisfaction with the fishing also differed between groups. A greater identification of these factors could assist fisheries management in increasing fisher satisfaction with regulations but also poses challenges in implementing rules that the majority of fishers will accept.

AB  - In order to discover a better way of communicating with the public about carbon capture and storage (CCS), we surveyed 300 college students and 200 company employees via two different versions of a questionnaire to compare the persuasiveness and differential impact of narrative evidence versus statistical evidence on public perception towards CCS. Results showed narrative and statistical evidence were equally effective in gaining public acceptance of CCS, but the "Not In My Back Yard" (NIMBY) phenomenon was more evident in responses to the statistical version than to the narrative version of the questionnaire. In the student group, participants were significantly more opposed to CO2 pipelines and storage sites being located nearby when they were exposed to statistical presentation. In the employee group, statistical evidence elicited more negative attitudes towards CO2 storage projects being sited nearby. Nine different concerns emerged from the responses to an open-ended question inviting participants to specify "any concern or worry about utilizing CCS". The themes revealed that those presented with statistical evidence were mainly concerned about health and safety, while those presented with narrative evidence were concerned about safety and cost alike.

KW  - REFLECTIONS
KW  - IMPERIALISM
AB  - The citation of the parallels between ancient Rome and the modern U. S. enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in American journalism, political commentary, and popular current affairs literature during the first decade of the twenty-first century. These discussions, however, are riddled with errors about Roman history and mired in contemporary political partisanship, and the specific parallels cited are often irrelevant or too superficial to be meaningful, while other, more salient parallels are simply overlooked. Underlying such problems are American prejudices concerning Republics and Empires, an unsophisticated popular understanding of the terms "empire" and "imperialism," as well as the predominance in modern American consciousness of a caricatured image of Rome that originates in Hollywood films. Recent discussions of the Rome-America parallel have been informed by all of these distortions, and by " projection"-the simultaneous identification and distancing impulses Self experiences when encountering the Other. Projection theory suggests that discussions of Roman power on both ends of the American political spectrum in the early 2000s tended towards the same end: the articulation of a desire for the preservation and perpetuation of American power and pre-eminence in an increasingly uncertain and dangerous world.

AB  - As mental health services have become more accessible to diverse peoples and communities, psychologists' role in addressing the social, political, historical, and economic contexts on individuals' behavior has also increased in complexity. The American Psychological Association's (2003) Guidelines on Multicultural Education, Training, Research, Practice and Organizational Change for Psychologists indicate that the multiculturally competent psychologist provide leadership as agents of prosocial change, advocacy, and social justice. Psychologists therefore are called to promote societal understanding, affirmation, and appreciation of multiculturalism against the damaging effects of individual, institutional, and societal racism, prejudice, and all forms of oppression based on stereotyping and discrimination. Multicultural competencies hold psychologists to a high standard to ally with, advocate for, and, at times, become activists in using psychological science to improve the condition of individuals, organizations, and society. The purpose of this article is to present a practical application of advocacy, in all its forms, as a foundational and functional competency for practitioners of psychology to strengthen psychology's leadership in advocating for psychological health and well-being for all people.

AB  - Background: Despite numerous studies exploring medical students' attitudes to communication skills learning (CSL), there are apparently no studies comparing different experiential learning methods and their influence on students' attitudes.
   Aims: We compared medical students' attitudes to learning communication skills before and after a communication course in the data as a whole, by gender and when divided into three groups using different methods.
   Method: Second-year medical students (n = 129) were randomly assigned to three groups. In group A (n = 42) the theatre in education method, in group B (n = 44) simulated patients and in group C (n = 43) role-play were used. The data were gathered before and after the course using Communication Skills Attitude Scale.
   Results: Students' positive attitudes to learning communication skills (PAS; positive attitude scale) increased significantly and their negative attitudes (NAS; negative attitude scale) decreased significantly between the beginning and end of the course. Female students had more positive attitudes than the male students. There were no significant differences in the three groups in the mean scores for PAS or NAS measured before or after the course.
   Conclusions: The use of experiential methods and integrating communication skills training with visits to health centres may help medical students to appreciate the importance of CSL.

AB  - Background Stigma against those who suffer from mental illness is a major issue in many nations. Stigma, which is comprised of prejudice, ignorance, and discrimination, serves as a barrier to seeking help and staying in contact with mental health services. It is thus imperative that concerted efforts are taken against stigma. Methods Eight young psychiatrists from eight Asian nations offer a narrative review of the state of stigma in their respective nations, the sociocultural reasons behind this stigma, recent anti-stigma efforts and the effects, if any, of such efforts. Results Despite these eight nations lying varying significantly in terms of economic developmental levels, there are sociocultural commonalities that undergird stigma across these nations. It is also evident that there have been more recent concerted efforts to combat this stigma, and in some countries, there has been a change in the perceptions of mental illness. Conclusion The causes of stigma tend to be similar across various nations, and this perhaps suggests that international collaboration and a concerted global effort to combat this problem might thus be a possibility.

AB  - The Austrian Denkmalschutzgesetz (heritage protection law) aims to give total protection to all archaeological heritage. To achieve this, it takes a 'finds-centred' approach: chance finds are protected by some provisions in the law, searching for archaeology is restricted severely, and exclusively to archaeology graduates, by others. Yet, what has been completely forgotten is that most archaeology, and particularly the most threatened archaeology, is the one that has neither been found yet nor is being searched for. The reasons for why this approach was taken are both historical and rooted in archaeological prejudices and self-interest. The law was first passed in 1923 and has since only been revised in ways that served to give archaeologists greater legal control (or in other words, ownership) over what is archaeology and what should happen to it. Yet, significant changes to the way farming, forestry and development works in the contemporary world were completely missed, and no serious attempts made to identify where archaeology might be actually threatened. In this paper, I examine how the Austrian archaeological heritage hell came to be and what lessons can be learnt from it.

AB  - In recent years, as part of the broader policies of economic liberalization, the sale of agricultural land to foreign citizens has attracted considerable political, social and media attention in transition societies. The regime of land ownership in Georgia has evolved from the complete restriction of foreign acquisition in the beginning of the 1990s, to the unrestricted sale of land to foreign citizens from 2010 onwards. An analysis of newly-available data from International Social Survey Programme's (ISSP) National Identity module suggests that respondents in Georgia, along with Russia, hold the most negative attitudes toward selling land to foreigners compared to other countries. I hypothesize that this is the result of a confluence of factors such as the communist legacy, historical memory, rural nationalism, agricultural underdevelopment and inequality. The quantitative part of this article tests socio-demographic, geographic, ideological, and identity-based explanations of within-country variation in attitudes toward the purchase of land by foreigners. The results suggest that socio-demographic and geographic variables such as respondents' age and regional belonging explain some variance in the dependent variable, but that the major effects stem from individuals' perceptions of economic protectionism, xenophobia, and ethnic national identity.

AB  - Background: Yemen has witnessed several dengue fever outbreaks coincident with the social unrest and war in the country. The aim of the present study was to describe the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) of at-risk urban populations residing in Taiz, southwest of Yemen. In addition, factors possibly associated with poor preventive practices were investigated.
   Methods: A household-based, cross-sectional survey was conducted in three urban districts encompassing 383 households. Data on the socio-demographic characteristics and KAPs of the participating household heads were collected using a pre-designed, structured questionnaire. The association of socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge and attitudes of the population with poor preventive practices against dengue fever was then analyzed using logistic regression.
   Results: More than 90.0 % of respondent household heads had correct knowledge about fever, headache and joint pain as common signs and symptoms of dengue fever. Moreover, muscular pain and bleeding were perceived by more than 80.0 % of the respondents as being associated with dengue fever; however, only 65.0 % of the respondents reported skin rash as a sign of dengue fever. More than 95.0 % of respondents agreed about the seriousness and possible transmission of dengue fever; however, negative attitudes regarding the facts of being at risk of the disease and that the infection is preventable were expressed by 15.0 % of respondents. Despite the good level of knowledge and attitudes of the respondent population, poor preventive practices were common. Bivariate analysis identified poor knowledge of dengue signs and symptoms (OR = 2.1, 95 % CI = 1.24-3.68; P= 0.005) and its vector (OR = 2.1, 95 % CI = 1.14-3.84; P = 0.016) as factors significantly associated with poor preventive practices. However, multivariable analysis showed that poor knowledge of the vector is an independent predictor of poor preventive practices of the population (adjusted OR = 2.1, 95 % CI = 1.14-3.84; P= 0.018).
   Conclusion: The majority of people in urban communities of Taiz have a clear understanding of most signs/symptoms of dengue fever as well as positive attitudes towards the seriousness and possible transmissibility of dengue fever. However, negative attitudes regarding their perception of the risk and possible prevention of the infection are prevailing among a small proportion of the population and need to be targeted by educational campaigns. It appears that the good level of the population knowledge of the signs/symptoms of dengue fever and the factors contributing to the spread and control of its vectors did not translate into good practices.

AB  - Health care providers play an important role in the management of obesity; however, they often hold negative attitudes about people with overweight and obesity and this may affect the treatment that they provide. The current studies assessed how doctor communication style around discussions of weight (supportive vs. stigmatizing) impacted participants' health motivation and willingness to comply with the doctor's advice. We conducted 2 online studies in which we presented participants who self-identified as either overweight or obese with a written scenario describing a doctor-patient interaction. Study 1 (N = 334) revealed that participants who read a supportive interaction reported more positive affect and greater health motivation than did participants who read a nonweight control interaction. In contrast, participants who read a stigmatizing conversation about weight reported less positive affect and more negative affect and reported lower willingness to comply with the doctor's recommendations than did control participants. Study 2 (N = 332) revealed that a weight stigmatizing interaction had harmful consequences for compliance and health motivation regardless of how extreme the doctor's health behavior recommendations were. Together these findings suggest that a stigmatizing discussion about weight can negatively impact health motivation and compliance, but that conversations about weight can also be productive if they are conducted in a supportive and empathetic manner.

AB  - Tarr analyses the representation of Islam in five feature films made since 2006 that centre on the changing identities of Muslims in contemporary France. She locates the films within the context of the rise in Islamophobia in France following 9/11 and anxieties about immigration and terrorism, but also in relation to France's troubled postcolonial history and French republican ideology. In particular, the French notion of laicite (secularism) has given rise to active hostility to any public expression of religious or cultural difference, particularly on the part of Muslims. Cinematic representations of Muslims, and particularly of the children of migrants from the Maghreb, have, therefore, since the mid-1980s, been treated with caution in order not to alienate mainstream Franco-French audiences and to facilitate the second generation's integration into French society. However, the five feature films addressed here-two mainstream popular comedies, Mauvaise foi/Bad Faith (2006) and L'Italien/The Italian (2010), and three independent, low budget, auteur-led, realist films, Dans la vie/Two Ladies (2008), Dernier maquis (2008) and La Desintegration/Disintegration (2012)-offer new narratives that challenge fears of Islam by foregrounding the protagonists' negotiation of their Muslim identities in a French context and, by implication, argue for the integration of Islam as a legitimate referent of French identity. However, their construction of Islam does not extend to positive representations of young veiled women, and they thus still risk confirming the oppressive majority view that certain practices associated with Islam, such as the wearing of the veil, are incompatible with the secularism of the French Republic.

AB  - The enlargement of the European Union (EU) and the subsequent global economic recession has drawn attention to individual-level attitudes towards immigrants across Europe. In this context, using the European Social Survey (ESS), we compared Irish attitudes towards immigrants with those in 12 other European countries at 3 critical moments in time - prior to large immigration flows in 2002; at the height of the economic boom in 2006; and after the global financial crash in 2008. Our descriptive analysis examines whether significant changes in attitudes towards immigrants has occurred in the EU as a whole and within individual countries over time. We predicted that fluctuations in economic condition such as the rise in unemployment would affect attitudes towards immigrants. This relationship receives some support from our findings. In Ireland, positive attitudes to immigrants between 2006 and 2010 decreased and negative attitudes increased, on all attitudinal measures, more sharply than in any of the other European countries. Taking the 12 countries as a whole, attitudes have tended to polarise particularly with regard to allowing access to immigrants and their impact on the economy. This research reveals worrying trends in attitudes to immigrants in European countries, particularly in light of the importance of immigrants to the European labour market, both currently and in the future.

KW  - GEOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE
AB  - This paper addresses the works of Henri Coudreau, a little-known French explorer of Guiana and Amazonia who was later forgotten by the heroic' histories of exploration because of his unruliness and nonconformist attitudes. Drawing on the literature of postcolonialism and tropicality as well as on recent studies of anti-colonialist geographies, I address for the first time Coudreau's geography from the perspective of anarchist and critical thinking. My main argument is that Coudreau's work is a further example of the complexity and heterogeneity of the European intellectual field during the imperial age. Despite having come of age intellectually among all the European racist and ethnocentric prejudices of his day, Coudreau developed a different outlook thanks to two factors, viz., his personal experience in living for years with the indigenous communities of Amazonia, and his exposure to anarchist anti-colonialist ideas through his collaboration with Elisee Reclus. Coudreau's tropical utopia of an independent Amazonia, and his endorsement of the stateless nature of local communities, ran counter to French imperial politics, occasioning Coudreau's dismissal from the French administration and his professional exile in Brazil at the time of the Franco-Brazilian border dispute (1897-1900).

AB  - Objective: Injuries caused by motor vehicle crashes in Middle Eastern countries are among the highest in the world. In Iran, road traffic crashes are the second most common cause of mortality. Particularly, motorcycle-related injuries among men are the second most common type of traffic-related crash in this country. This study used qualitative research methods to elicit and explore the personal experiences of Iranian motorcyclists in respect to factors that facilitate their engagement in risk-taking behaviors within the PRECEDE (predisposing, reinforcing, and enabling constructs in educational diagnosis, and evaluation) framework. Methods: Focus groups, in-depth interviews, and field observation were conducted among motorcyclists, pillion passengers, and police officers. Results: Our data show that being young and single, living in lower socioeconomic conditions, and suffering from poor physical health and daily stress influence risk-taking behaviors. Additionally, lack of defined traffic rules and regulations, the availability and accessibility of motorcycles among unlicensed underaged persons, the cost-effectiveness of motorcycle transportation, unsafe roads and a lack of special pathways for motorcycles, and aggressive car and van/truck drivers are among the enabling factors that provoke risk-taking behavior. Finally, the participants verified that the enjoyment of motorcycling reinforced their decision to continue engaging in risky behaviors, and being penalized for disobeying traffic laws prevented them from further risk-taking behaviors. Conclusion: Enabling and reinforcing factors to reduce risk-taking behaviors among motorcyclist could include (1) promoting smart driving practices among motorcyclists; (2) training pediatricians and emergency physicians to deliver brief motivational interventions to their young patients to avoid risky behaviors while riding; (3) training traffic enforcement officers to appreciate the value of providing consistent law enforcement services; (4) enhancing local efforts to increase the number of pathways for motorcyclists and improve the condition of deteriorated roads; (5) revising legislation and policies in association with motorcycle ownership among underaged and unlicensed individuals; (6) limiting an excessive number of passengers (particularly children) and cargo on motorcycles; and (7) identifying solutions to reduce the negative attitudes of car drivers toward motorcyclists and increase systematic compliance of traffic laws by motorcyclists and car drivers.

AB  - A households' production behavior directly influences the quality of the environment and determines the successful development of nature reserves. Meanwhile, the households' production behaviors are complicated by interrelated factors, such as protection attitudes, resource endowment, and family wealth. This research evaluated households near the Crested Ibis National Nature Reserve in Shaanxi Province, acquiring data from 436 households around Yang County and Ningshan County in the south slope of Qinling Mountains, China. Based on the collected data, we developed a structural equation model to evaluate the coupling relationships among households' protection attitudes, production behaviors, resource endowment, and family wealth. The results showed that: 1) households with great resource endowment had more negative attitudes, probably due to their greater protection costs; 2) the households with higher education levels had worse protection attitudes; 3) the households with more family wealth were likely to use fewer fertilizers, pesticides, and firewood; 4) the households with more resource endowment showed less production and management behaviors; 5) the enhancement of households' attitudes improved production behaviors to protection the environment, but the effects were not statistically significant. Our results provide a basis for the government's protection policy making, exploring the effective management measures that are beneficial for both nature reserve management and community development.

AB  - Introduction: Critical care deaths represent most hospital deaths. The difficulties felt by intensive care unit (ICU) nurses providing end-of-life care may cause nurses to experience negative attitudes toward caring for dying patients. This study was conducted to examine the difficulties felt by ICU nurses providing end-of-life care in Southeast Iran. Method: The study used a cross-sectional descriptive design and was conducted in 3 hospitals supervised by Kerman Medical University. Using DFINE (difficulties felt by ICU nurses providing end-of-life care), difficulties felt by critical care nurses providing end-of-life care were assessed. Results: The results indicated that the difficulties that were felt by critical care nurses were moderate (2.64 +/- 0.65). Among the categories and items, the most difficulties felt by critical care nurses belonged to the category of converting from curative care to end-of-life care (3.12 +/- 0.93) and the item life-sustaining treatment is often given excessively (3.49 +/- 1.14). Conclusions: The study suggests that health care managers should organize systematic and dynamic policies and procedures in dealing with end-of-life care to assist ICU nurses.

AB  - Professional placement experiences have been considered as an approach to improving nursing attitudes towards mental health nursing and selection of mental health nursing as a camc. Mental-health nursing placements are now occuring in less traditional settings; however, published research of these placements remains scarce. The aim of this non-experimental comparative study was to investigate the impact of nursing student participation in a non-traditional placement, compared to participation in traditional placement. Particular focus was on the attitudes of nursing students toward mental health nursing and career preferences. Participants of the intervention group attended the non-traditional placement, (n = 23). Participants of the comparison group attended traditional placement settings (n = 27), including placements in inpatient and community mental health. The study utilised The Preplacement Survey. Results showed significant differences in scores of the non-traditional placement Recovery Camp cohort related to reduced anxiety, reduced negative attitudes, and increased preparedness for mental health. These correlated with a comparatively increased desire to pursue a future career in mental health; albeit not a statistically significant increase. Considering mental health care, in any setting, is highly dependent on the training and ability of nurses to deliver effective service, the findings of the current study are important.

AB  - Different from the regular migration some migrants want the opportunity to move further to a new country rather than settle down. However, this peculiar "transit migration" is only studied based on small-scale surveys, which is regional and always controversial. To reconcile the contradiction of the fact that systematic issues such as immigration analysis need global large-scale data, this paper constructs a multilateral migration network and studies its statistical characteristics to get the probability of being transit countries and routes. It is quantified by irregular triangle relationships in the global migration network, and shows some popular springboards mentioned in prior research studies, such as Canada and Australia acting as the global hubs, and some typical transit countries directing to Europe, as Russia, Turkey, France and Germany. Besides, it also reveals and quantifies several hidden possible transit stations that were seldom noticed before, like South Africa, Israel and some hubs of local refugee flows in Africa. Exploring these possible routes and key notes might shed light on policy development, and from the viewpoint of physics, these results provide an objective view to transit migrants and countries that is free of prejudice and political attitudes.

AB  - Obesity continues to be a public health issue in the United States. Obesity is a major risk factor for other medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders, and some cancers. Healthcare providers play a key role in assisting and providing support to patients who are obese or have obesity-related health problems. They can educate patients who are trying to lose weight and maintain weight loss. However, barriers exist in quality of care. For example, nurses and other healthcare providers may at times have negative attitudes toward and beliefs about patients who are obese. Additionally, healthcare providers may rely on family or self-report of a patient's height and weight, and those estimates are often inaccurate. To improve the care of patients struggling with weight, the clinical nurse leader (CNL), for example, can play an important role in educating nurses regarding issues that affect the patient with obesity. The CNLs can provide educational opportunities that potentially improve nursing attitudes. The nurse must first identify and understand any bias against the obese patient he or she might have. The CNL can be at the forefront, removing barriers, creating change, and ultimately improving the overall health of the obese patient.

AB  - BackgroundOur transition to an "information society" means that Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has become integral to our lives. ICT has also become an essential aspect of medical institutions and healthcare settings. Healthcare professionals, especially nurses are required to use ICT in their daily work. In Lebanon, however, due to political factors, many universities have not introduced technology or any form of ICT in their curricula. Institutions of higher education do use technology in various ways, however, successful incorporation of ICT in education requires acceptance by instructors who are expected to use ICT in teaching practices. Although international findings reveal that ICT should be used in nursing education, some faculty members experience difficulty integrating it.MethodA mixed methodological research approach was used to investigate the attitudes of nursing teaching staff toward the use of ICT in nursing education.ResultsOur findings revealed three categories of faculty with differing attitudes to the use of ICT in teaching and learning: pioneers, faculty members who have developed positive attitudes toward ICT usage; followers, faculty members with neutral attitudes; and resisters, faculty members with negative attitudes.ConclusionsIdentification of the nursing faculty members' attitude toward ICT and the challenges faced by them contributes to the integration of ICT into nursing curricula and further development of educational practices.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL HISTORY
LA  - English
AB  - Sitting down to read a work of fiction was a well-established is activity within. British society by the early-twentieth century but one duct was mainly enjoyed by the country's more leisured classes. After the First World War, however, changes to the publishing industry's working practices, coupled with the growth of the "open access" system in public libraries in the 1920s and the spread of twopenny libraries in the 1930s, created a new type of reader, drawn principally from the country's working-class communities. This article reveals that the spread of the working-class hook-reading habit prompted a series of discussions among the country's cultural elites, publishers, and public and commercial librarians regarding how that social group engaged with the written word. Many of these commentators were highly disparaging of the working classes' reading and book-borrowing habits and, based on a prejudiced understanding of that social group's cultural capital, sought to influence the types of reading material available to them, particularly with regard to what was accessible in the country's public libraries. The article argues that while the outbreak of the Second World War may have tempered these discussions somewhat, class distinctions surrounding the reading habit continued to shape people's participation in it, thus revealing that even during a period when class divisions were supposedly blurring, attitudes toward social class and leisure remained essentially unchanged.

AB  - This paper analyzes the ethics of social science research (SSR) employing big data. We begin by highlighting the research gap found on the intersection between big data ethics, SSR and research ethics. We then discuss three aspects of big data SSR which make it warrant special attention from a research ethics angle: (1) the interpretative character of both SSR and big data, (2) complexities of anticipating and managing risks in publication and reuse of big data SSR, and (3) the paucity of regulatory oversight and ethical recommendations on protecting individual subjects as well as societies when conducting big data SSR. Against this backdrop, we propose using David Resnik's research ethics framework to analyze some of the most pressing ethical issues of big data SSR. Focusing on the principles of honesty, carefulness, openness, efficiency, respect for subjects, and social responsibility, we discuss three clusters of ethical issues: those related to methodological biases and personal prejudices, those connected to risks arising from data availability and reuse, and those leading to individual and social harms. Finally, we advance considerations to observe in developing future ethical guidelines about big data SSR.

AB  - Most of the parallel mechanisms (PM) with low coupling degree cannot directly obtain the analytical expression of the positive position solution of the PM, which makes it difficult to carry out the follow-up research on the kinematic accuracy analysis and trajectory planning of the PM. Based on the topological structure theory, this paper analyzes the position and orientation characteristic(POC), DOF and coupling degree of 2PPa-PSS PM. Afterward, the kinematic mathematical model of 2PPa-PSS PM is established based on the order single open chain of kinematic modeling principle. The moving platform of the mechanism is set as an equilateral triangle, and the intermediate variables are solved by combining the constraints of the two chains. The positive position solution of the PM in analytical form is obtained. The correctness of the kinematic model of the mechanism is verified by numerical calculation. Then, according to the positive position solution analytical expression, we can work out the complete workspace of the PM, and the significant influence of the driving increment on the attitude change of the moving platform is analyzed by using the analysis method based on the orthogonal test. According to the results of orthogonal experiment, the best driving range of the mechanism is obtained. (C) 2021 Jordan Journal of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering. All rights reserved

AB  - As a conduit of knowledge for the general public, news media inform the development and maintenance of attitudes and beliefs about a range of topics, including mental health and related behaviors. News media portrayals of such topics can, therefore, contribute to stigma-the culmination of harmful stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. A topic of increasing media and research interest is self-harm, a behavior that is still poorly understood and highly stigmatized. Despite the potential for news media to be a source of self-harm stigma, few investigations of such portrayals have been conducted. To understand how news media portrays self-harm, a qualitative media framing analysis was conducted on 545 news articles published in Australia during 2019. Six frames were identified: Inevitably Suicidal, A Tragic Outcome, Mentally Unwell, An Epidemic, Threatening and Dangerous, and A Manipulative Tactic, each drawing on a broader narrative of pathology, instability, and damage. Use of problematic language and a lack of definitional clarity reinforced these frames. While the analyzed articles are limited to an Australian context, findings demonstrate continued misrepresentations of self-harm, which arguably contribute to ongoing self-harm stigma. Greater education and support for journalists reporting about self-harm is needed.

AB  - The paper describes the construction of a new religious motivation questionnaire. The construction was preceeded by an analysis which revealed that the existing instruments for assessing religious motivation have deficiencies and, most importantly, may not be suitable for use with persons in adolescence or younger. In the first phase of the questionnaire construction, a semi-structured interview was used on a sample of 111 respondents aged 10-25 from Belgrade. The interview findings suggested the presence of religious motivation dimensions which are not contained in the existing instruments. In the second phase, an initial pool of items, formulated based on interview answers, was administered to a sample of 354 secondary school and university students from Belgrade. Principal component analysis revealed five dimensions of religious motivation measured by the constructed questionnaire: religion as ultimate value; religion as a means of wish-fulfillment; religion as a source of emotional well-being; ideals and morality; religion as a part of tradition; and tendency to meet social expectations regarding religion. The questionnaire scales show excellent reliability.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the association between self-reported racial discrimination and prenatal depressive symptoms among black women.
   Methods: Our study population consisted of two cohorts of pregnant women: the Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment, and Social Stress project (ACCESS) and Project Viva. We measured self-reported racial discrimination among black women using a modified Experiences of Discrimination scale (score 0-8). We assessed elevated depressive symptoms (EDS) with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (>= 13 on a 0-30 scale).
   Results: Fifty-four percent of ACCESS and 78% of Viva participants reported experiencing racial discrimination. After adjusting for age, marital status, income, education, and nativity, a 1-U increment in Experiences of Discrimination score was associated with 48% increased odds of EDS (odds ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-1.76) for ACCESS participants but was not significantly associated among Viva participants (odds ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.92-1.37). In both cohorts, responding to unfair treatment by talking to others was associated with the lowest odds of EDS.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that higher levels of perceived racial discrimination may increase depressive symptoms during pregnancy among U.S. black women. Interventions involving talking to others may aid in reducing the risk of depressive symptoms among black women experiencing higher levels of racial discrimination. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Young bisexual women experience worse mental and sexual health outcomes in comparison to their heterosexual and lesbian peers. These disparities are associated with stigma and devaluation of bisexual identities. The current paper addresses a community-based focus group project in which participants discussed bisexual stigma in regard to bisexual erasure and other stereotypes. Specifically, participants detailed experiences of feeling pressured to provide evidence of their bisexual identity, modifying their relationship or sexual behavior to conform to these expectations, as well as feeling excluded from queer community. Further, participants discussed how these experiences were related to decreased mental and sexual health. Future research should further investigate the relationship between bisexual stigma, pressure to provide evidence of bisexual identity, and negative mental and sexual health outcomes.

AB  - P>This systematic review aims to address the question of whether health professionals' weight status is associated with attitudes towards weight management. Twelve eligible studies were identified from a search of the Cochrane Library, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and three Chinese databases, which included 14 independent samples comprising a total of 10 043 respondents. Attitudes towards weight management were classified under eight attitude indicators. Quantitative synthesis of the findings of included studies showed that health professionals of normal weight were more likely to be more confident in their weight management practice, perceive fewer barriers to weight management and have more positive outcome expectations, have stronger role identity and more negative attitudes towards obese individuals than health professionals who were overweight or obese. However, there was no difference between overweight and non-overweight health professionals in their perceptions of the causes and outcomes of obesity. In addition, being female and having relevant knowledge and clinical experience of weight management appeared to predict positive attitudes towards obesity/obese patients and high self-efficacy in weight management, respectively. Future research should focus on prospectively theory-driven studies, and employ appropriately validated instruments and multivariate analyses to identify the relative contribution of weight status to attitudes towards weight management.

AB  - Ageist attitudes ingrained within societies lead to negative health outcomes for older generations. Face-to-face storytelling is one method that is effective in combating negative attitudes but may be limited in its reach. This pilot study aimed to explore if empathy evoked through digital storytelling influenced the attitudes about older adults held by younger people. The Listening Lounge exhibition displayed ten digital stories containing narratives from older adults. Surveys captured 85 young adult participants' responses following viewing a digital story. A mixed-methods approach explored participant attitudes of older adults and their experience of empathy. The results showed a statistically significant positive change in participants' attitudes post-viewing compared to pre-viewing the digital stories; regardless of initial positive attitudes toward older adults. Participants reported that attitudinal change occurred when the digital stories challenged their generalizations about older adults, and when they felt empathy toward the storyteller. Empathy was fostered by the digital story components, particularly tone of voice and story content, which enabled a deeper understanding of the older adult's experience. This pilot study provides foundational research into the use of digital storytelling and its ability to evoke empathy and positively influence attitudes. The findings from this study may inform replication of this research on a larger scale.

AB  - Doctors who fled from Nazi-occupied and dominated Europe sought to pursue their profession wherever they could. Those who arrived in Australia confronted substantial impediments to doing so. In New South Wales (WSW), doctors who represented, registered and educated the medical profession and Members of Parliament attempted to prevent 'refugee doctors as they were described, from practising medicine. Due largely to protectionism and prejudice, many refugee doctors were denied registration to practise medicine irrespective of their qualifications, skills and experience, and despite the low number of refugee doctors who settled in NSW. This article focuses on the law and politics of registering the medical profession. It analyses the treatment of refugee doctors who sought to practise medicine in NSW between 1937 and 1942, and then reflects on the contemporary relevance of this episode in Australia's history of medical regulation. The article discusses cautionary lessons we might learn from the past so that capable overseas-trained doctors to whom Australia grants refuge are permitted to practise their profession and provide valuable medical services to the community. This article also considers whether changes to the law since that time might constitute some safeguard against repetition of past discrimination.

AB  - Taking the development plans of an offshore oilfield as an example, a new comprehensive evaluation method, the improved Grey Clustering Analysis based on the cloud model (GCAC), is presented in this paper, which takes the ambiguity, randomness, and uncertainty of data into account and overcomes the limits of the general methods, such as subjective prejudice and objective randomness. GCAC converts the data of the oilfield development plans into a cloud, which considers the data of fuzziness, randomness, and the relationship between them. The greymembership degree of each development plan is calculated by this cloud model and an improved grey whitened function is presented in this paper. Then the plans are reordered by their grey membership degrees. In order to make more reasonable consideration of the artificial or unartificial uncertainties, GCAC combines the Grey Entropy Weighting method, Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and Expert Assessment method to determine the weights of each level of indexes, which makes the weights more reasonable and reduces the randomness and the fuzziness of data. GCAC can help obtain a better comparison between the development plans. The reliability of this method is verified by the calculation results.

AB  - Interprofessional Education (IPE) is one approach to improving communication and collaborative practice between professions, which are essential for the optimal delivery of healthcare. Common barriers include negative attitudes, professional stereotypes, professional cultures and power differentials between professional groups. The aim of this qualitative study was to explore how professional hierarchies and power differentials shape interprofessional interactions between preregistration pharmacy and medicine students. Data were gathered via semi-structured interviews and subject to thematic analysis. Four main themes were identified: Reproducing traditional hierarchies; Social norms around respect; Hierarchies in care values and goals; and Challenging the narrative is possible. Students' interactions with and views of the other profession largely reflected traditional stereotypes and power differentials. Hierarchy was evident in how respect was accorded and in how care values and goals were managed. Despite this, students overwhelmingly perceived and reported a sense of agency in changing the status quo. Emerging professional identity and conceptualisation of future roles is heavily influenced by the hierarchical relationship between the professions and can pose a significant barrier to collaborative practice. Greater support for collaborative interprofessional practice is needed at the level of policy and accreditation in health education and healthcare to ensure greater commitment to change.

LA  - English
AB  - The point of origin of the 'Irish historiographical revolution' initiated by T. W. Moody and R. D. Edwards in the 1930s, which issued, among other things, in the foundation of Irish Historical Studies, is customarily located in their experiences together as research students in London University's Institute of Historical Research. Hitherto, we have known little or nothing of those experiences beyond the recollections of the two principals themselves. This article uses the Institute's own archive, and other contemporary documentary evidence, including surviving letters from Moody to Edwards, to elucidate the precise influence of the Institute and its staff in moulding their outlook. Rather than asserting some form of ideological indoctrination - for example in propagating an ethos of 'value-free' history writing - it argues that what was important was the example of the Institute's institutional structures (including its Bulletin), which Moody and Edwards determined to replicate in Ireland; and that these structures, emphasising collaboration between historical researchers in pursuit of a common purpose, were themselves of the first importance in influencing the aspiration to create an Irish history free from confessional bias and overt expressions of political prejudice.

AB  - Due to unprecedented economic growth after the EU accession, four post-communist economies: Czechia, Hungary, Poland, and Slovak Republic (Visegrad Group, V4) have suffered from unsaturated demand in their labour markets. However, while undergoing the transition from net emigration into net immigration countries, the V4 governments unleashed anti-immigrant propaganda, which seems to have fallen on fertile ground with their societies. The paper addresses the question of potential readiness of the Visegrad Group countries to accept increased immigration. To this end an analysis of post-war migration flows and immigrant populations was performed for each of the countries. To reveal correlations between migration flows and selected macroeconomic indicators, a time series analysis with time series regression model has been performed. No universal trends for the entire V4 group were revealed regarding correlation of macroeconomic indicators and migration flows. However, statistically significant correlations were found for Poland (where higher GDP growth and lower unemployment translated into increased immigration) and Slovak Republic (where higher FDI dynamics resulted in decreased emigration). It is also claimed that negative attitudes of V4 populations towards increased immigration are deteriorating with time, which might be challenging for their governments, especially in the light of growing demand on their labour markets.

AB  - Background Well-designed objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) are reliable and valid, but expensive. The sequential OSCE (sOSCE) aims to balance robustness with affordability. In a sOSCE all students undertake a screening test (Day 1), with 'failing' or 'borderline' candidates sitting a second examination (Day 2). Current research has focused on psychometric properties of the sOSCE. Our aim was to examine the acceptability of the sOSCE, by identifying students' views.
   Methods Final-year students at one Scottish university completed a questionnaire after Day 1 of a sOSCE. Analysis included descriptive statistics and thematic analysis.
   Results A total of 107 out of 154 students (69.5%) responded. Most respondents strongly agreed/agreed that they: felt stressed about the sOSCE (98.1%); would feel like a failure if taking Day 2 (89.7%); and that Day 2 seems the same as a re-sit (78.5%). However, 61.7% agreed that fewer exams days was a positive aspect of the sOSCE. Open comments indicated feelings of increased stress, anxiety and frustration associated with the sOSCE.
   Conclusions Novelty or 'fear of the unknown' regarding the sOSCE seemed to be associated with negative attitudes. Further studies are required to explore student views of the sOSCE at less pressured times in the curriculum.

AB  - Hull-waterjet interaction is a key point in the research of waterjet-propelled crafts. The previous researches on hull-waterjet interaction mainly aim at displacement ships and planing monohulls, and mostly focus on speeds of Fr-L < 1.5, which has not included maximum speed of waterjet-propelled crafts in current engineering practice. Based on numerical and experimental research, this paper studies the hull-waterjet interaction of a high speed planing trimaran in the speed range of 0.68 < Fr-del<6.16 (0.32<Fr-L < 2.87), including analysis of thrust deduction and interaction efficiency. The numerical simulation is based on the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation with the SST k-omega turbulence model. As for semi-planing and planing state of this planing trimaran, the local effect of waterjet suction and jet is helpful to reduce the resistance while the global hull-attitude change will cause the increment on resistance of self-propelled hull. Compared with monohulls, the negative resistance increment fraction of this trimaran occurs at higher speed. The jet system thrust deduction fraction is always negative at high speeds and increases almost linearly with speed growth. The interaction efficiency is larger than 1.0 when Fr-del>2.0, indicating that the hull-waterjet interaction of this trimaran has positive effects on propulsion performance at semi-planing and planing state.

AB  - Violence against women (VAW) is rampant in India, and rising every year. However, Indian laws are geared towards punishing individual instances of such violence, instead of attempting to eradicate the problem itself. This is owed in part to the incomplete understanding of the causes and effects of such violence. Here, I advance a feminist understanding of VAW, wherein it is seen as a result of gendered prejudices designed to keep women in subordination. I show that international human rights law now endorses this feminist understanding, and trace the evolving understanding of equality in Indian courts to argue that given its current understanding as substantive equality, VAW can and should be seen as a form of sex discrimination due the cycle of disadvantage it creates for women. I critically analyse several decisions by Indian courts that show a move towards acceptance of VAW as a form of sex discrimination, and point to the limitations of these decisions. Finally, I propose various ways in which envisaging VAW as a form of sex discrimination would lead to a better framework of laws for not only countering such violence, but also eradicating it.

AB  - Background Hostility toward others is related to negative emotions, which is hypothesized to have negative health consequences. In this article, we sought to test the relationship between individuals' attitudes toward immigrants and their self-rated health (SRH) across time in large dataset of 15 European countries. Methods We used the 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016 waves of the European Social Survey, which include information about attitudes toward immigrants and individuals' SRH. Results Combining all countries and survey years, we found an association between negative attitudes toward immigrants and fair/poor SRH. However, when analyzing the relationship within each country, we found variations (depending on the year of the survey) in some countries, such as Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Sweden and Slovenia. Additionally, we found that there are more middle class individuals who hold unfavorable attitudes toward immigrants over time. Conclusions In general, poor attitudes toward immigrants are associated with higher odds of reporting fair/poor health, although the 'health advantage' of those with favorable attitudes is diminishing over time. However, in some countries, this relationship is contingent on when the survey was conducted, possibly reflecting the changing composition of individuals who hold unfavorable attitudes toward immigrants.

AB  - This qualitative study captures the experiences of young women in an interfaith marriage, in a social context where ethnic/religious identity is not contested or threatened. In-depth interviews were conducted with ten women to understand through narrative the conflicts and challenges they experience and how they cope with them. Narratives explored not only the present difficulties in the lives of women in interfaith marriages, but also the past experiences. It is under this framework that the cultural/religious transition of these women were studied. The collective experiences of these women were organised under six main themes: role of religion, views on being associated with another religion, initiation of interfaith relationships, problems and conflicts experienced, reactions of in-laws, peers and society and coping and adaptation. Results suggest that although these women experience challenges, such as rejections, threats to identity and discrimination, the multicultural context of Mauritius facilitates integration of conflicting religious identities.

AB  - Unemployment and the corollary of poverty among persons with disabilities have been well explored in the literature. As part of its global efforts to eradicate poverty, the United Nations, through its sustainable development goals, has urged countries to create economic opportunities for all persons to participate in income-generating activities. In Ghana, agriculture has been described as the backbone of the economy and the main source of employment and livelihood for many. However, it appears that policymakers are yet to explore how agriculture could create sustainable employment opportunities for persons with disabilities. This study makes a major contribution to research on the eradication of poverty among persons with disabilities by exploring their participation and experiences in agriculture-related activities. One-on-one interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with 19 persons with disabilities from three communities in a district in Ghana. A recurrent theme was that agriculture was a way through which the Ghanaian government could create employment for persons with disabilities. However, the participants recounted formidable barriers that affect their participation in agriculture: lack of land, funds and farming tools, and negative attitudes. These findings highlight the need for policymakers to engage with persons with disabilities to identify possible ways to assist their participation in agriculture.

AB  - Research on attitudes towards asexual people is a relatively new focus within the discipline of psychology, and to date has not been a topic of focus in the Australian context. This study focused on Australian undergraduate psychology students, and their attitudes towards asexual people. The study recruited 231 participants from undergraduate psychology programmes to complete an online survey assessing their attitudes towards asexual people, bias against single people, and gender ideologies. In addition, participants rated how comfortable and confident they felt about working with asexual people within mental health settings in the future. Participants who reported greater endorsement of traditional gender role ideology, and negative bias against singles, also reported greater levels of anti-asexual bias. Participants who hoped to pursue a career in psychology reported lower levels of anti-asexual bias and less negative attitudes towards single people, and reported moderate levels of both comfort in working with asexual people in the future, and capacity to provide safe care to asexual people in the future. Drawing on these findings, the paper concludes by discussing areas that require ongoing attention in the study of anti-asexual bias, and makes recommendations for the training of psychology students and clinicians.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to explore the socio-cultural factors that emerge in the implementation of integrated financial management information systems (IFMIS) in Ghana, a developing country. Design/methodology/approach A qualitative research approach was used with a case study design. The data were collected from archival documents and semi-structured face-to-face interviews with participants who played a significant role in the implementation of IFMIS in the Ghanaian public sector. Findings The findings show that although IFMIS was considered by the World Bank, Department for International Development (DFID), European Union and Danish International Development Agency to be rational, technical, universal and unproblematic, the use of the system in the Ghanaian public institutions was constrained by socio-cultural factors. These factors included power struggles between various technocrats; and negative attitudes such as opportunism and rent-seeking interest towards the IFMIS. Research limitations/implications The research is grounded in a single case study, but the findings can be theoretically generalised to information technology (IT)-based financial management system exhibiting the same characteristics. Practical implications This study offers a practical implication for governments, consultants and donor agencies. Originality/value This study provides additional insight through the application of the sociology and duality of information technology theory to study a particular IT-based public financial management initiative.

AB  - Some negative stereotypes regarding solar energy and positive stereotypes regarding coal are incorrect and could easily result in misunderstandings and prejudice that would hamper sustainable energy development. However, residents' stereotypes regarding solar energy and coal, and the factors influencing them, particularly in China, remain an area that needs more academic research. This study indicated that solar energy was commonly positively stereotyped as being clean, abundant, and sustainable, and negatively stereotyped as being unreliable and regionally restricted. Furthermore, 50% of the participants slightly or strongly agreed that solar energy was costly and difficult to store. The two most common negative stereotypes of coal as a source of energy were, it being unsustainable and a major source of pollution. Some positive stereotypes regarding coal included low price and mature technology. The survey results also indicated that television and the internet were the top two knowledge sources regarding solar energy and coal. The correlation analysis results indicated that the knowledge sources of the participants could influence stereotypes. Some policies have been proposed to undo the negative effects of the existing stereotypes, such as comparative thinking, providing appropriate information, and governmental promotion.

AB  - Civil wars produce immense humanitarian crises, causing millions of individuals to seek refuge in other countries. The rate of disease prevalence has inclined among the refugees, increasing the cost of healthcare. Complex medical conditions and high numbers of patients at healthcare centers overwhelm the healthcare system and delay diagnosis and treatment. Point-of-care (PoC) testing can provide efficient solutions to high equipment cost, late diagnosis, and low accessibility of healthcare services. However, the development of PoC devices in developing countries is challenged by several barriers. Such PoC devices may not be adopted due to prejudices about new technologies and the need for special training to use some of these devices. Here, we investigated the concerns of end users regarding PoC devices by surveying healthcare workers and doctors. The tendency to adopt PoC device changes is based on demographic factors such as work sector, education, and technology experience. The most apparent concern about PoC devices was issues regarding low accuracy, according to the surveyed clinicians.

AB  - There is a growing recognition that in an increasingly differentiated social environment it is important for social workers to be prepared to intervene in multi-diversified and multicultural contexts, so as to promote inclusion, respect and empowerment. On this account, mobility and full immersion programmes appear to contribute the most promising professional learning opportunities. However, full immersion programmes are emotionally and cognitively very demanding, sometimes even exacerbating prejudice and racism; this has led to ongoing debates as to which strategies can safeguard the effectiveness of such programmes. This paper draws on the theory of acculturation to enable a deeper understanding of how full immersion programmes can educate to diversity in social work, and of the learning processes that can occur when confronting diversity. The reflection focuses on written feedback from, and focus groups with, students who participated in a short mobility project. Findings show how self-reflective practice, which acknowledges emotional journeys including what are usually considered negative reactions, is a necessary pre-condition for successfully transferring experiences of relating to cultural differences - as in the mobility programme - to professional skills.

AB  - Objective Method In the Australian context, literature searches did not identify any empirical research of Australian psychologists exploring their knowledge of, and attitudes towards, evidence-based practice in psychology (EBPP). This study aimed to investigate whether psychologists in Australia understood the EBPP model, their attitudes towards EBPP, and the individual differences that affect attitudes towards EBPP. A cross-sectional design study using an online survey was completed by 113 psychologists, aged between 23 and 78 years. The participants completed a set of questionnaires assessing their understanding of the EBPP model and their attitudes towards implementing the model in practice. Results Conclusions Descriptive analysis showed that 60% of the psychologists were able to define EBPP, with women showing a greater positive attitude towards EBPP. Psychologists with 4 years or less of academic training endorsed stronger positive attitudes than those psychologists' with more than 5 years academic training. Psychologists with more years of professional experience were found to be associated with more negative attitudes towards EBPP. This is the first Australian study exploring psychologist's understanding of and attitudes towards the model. The findings suggest that further research is required to examine the impact of training, years of practice, and individual differences towards attitudes.

AB  - Background: There is rising evidence that relationships that bridge between immigrants and long-time residents are critical to immigrant integration and to the overall heath of communities. The processes by which this bridging social capital is built are not well understood. Schools in new immigrant destinations, as spaces in which diverse youth come together, provide a unique opportunity to examine how immigrant and long-time resident youth connect to each other and build relationships.
   Purpose: This article examines the processes of building relationships between immigrant and long-time resident youth and explores the meaning and consequences of these processes for the individuals involved. The article further suggests ways in which schools might adopt strategies to promote personal interaction, cooperative action, and collective identification to aid in the development of these relationships.
   Setting: Lewiston, Maine is the setting of this study. Between February 2001 and May 2003, 1,200 Somalis arrived in Lewiston, a town of 35,690 people, 97.3% of whom were White at the time of the 2000 Census.
   Research Design: Using the methodology of portraiture, this study examines, as an exemplary case, one relationship between two students: a Somali immigrant, and a White longtime resident. Portraiture is a methodology built on relationships, which mirrors the theoretical issues under investigation.
   Findings/Results: This study provides new insights into how bridging relationships are built. The participants capitalized on the common space of their new immigrant destination school to transform casual personal interactions into a bridging relationship based on collective identification. Through dialogue, particularly about race, they challenged each other and themselves, and each came to understand the other in new ways; they also became invested in each other and dependent on each other to grow and to understand themselves and their places in a changing town.
   Conclusions/Recommendations: The research identifies processes of personal interaction, cooperative action, and collective identification as central to the building of bridging relationships. It also reveals the necessity of a focus on race when researching, analyzing, or cultivating these relationships. Lessons for educators and schools seeking to foster relationships between immigrant and long-time resident youth include engaging students in direct dialogue about race and cultivating skills in empathetic storytelling and listening in order to "double-think," or receive a counter-story.

AB  - Mental illness is known to occur frequently in the general population and is more common within the general health care system. High-quality health care requires nurses to have the skills, knowledge and attitudes to provide care for people experiencing mental illness or mental distress. Research suggests health professionals, including nurses, tend to share similar negative attitudes to mental illness as the general population, and consequently, mental health nursing is not a popular career path. These two factors signify a need to influence more positive attitudes toward mental illness and mental health nursing among nursing students. A qualitative exploratory research study was undertaken to examine the experiences, opinions and attitudes of an academic and research team to the introduction of a consumer academic within an undergraduate mental health nursing subject. In-depth interviews were conducted with teaching and research team members. The importance of mental health skills emerged as a major theme and included sub-themes: mental health across the health care system; contribution of consumer academic to nursing skills; addressing fear and stigma, and inspiring passion in mental health nursing. Findings suggest academic input from people with lived experience of recovery from mental illness can influence the development of mental health nursing skills and enhance the popularity of mental health nursing as a career.

AB  - Background: Internalized stigma, another aspect of stigma, is the adoption of negative attitudes and stereotypes of the society regarding people's illness. Aims and Objectives: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the internalized stigma state of acne vulgaris (AV), vitiligo, and alopecia areata (AA) patients and to identify the factors influencing internalized stigma. Materials and Methods: A total of 150 patients (50 AV, 50 vitiligo, and 50 AA) who applied to the outpatient clinic were consecutively enrolled in this study. The sociodemographic characteristics of the patients were recorded. In addition, patients answered the Internalized Stigma Scale (ISS), the Dermatology Life Quality Index, the Perceived Health Status, the General Health Questionnaire, and the Acne Quality of Life Scale. Results: In this study, the Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the whole ISS scale was calculated as 0.91 for AV, 0.91 for vitiligo, and 0.93 for AA. Conclusion: The present study indicates that patients with AV, AA, and vitiligo internalize the negative stereotype judgment of the society for themselves. High levels of internalized stigma in the studied patients presented a parallel trend to the negative quality of life (QoL). Therefore, internalized stigma may be one of the major factors affecting the QoL in these diseases.

AB  - Same-sex marriage (SSM) has been a contentious topic in recent times. Despite current trends indicating that support for same-sex marriage is on the rise in Australia, attempts to introduce marriage equality legislation have failed. This study examined influential factors affecting attitudes towards same-sex marriage in Australia. A sample of heterosexual Australians completed a survey regarding their attitudes to marriage equality, homophobia, beliefs about a nature or nurture basis for same-sex attraction, common assumptions and beliefs about the etiology of same-sex attraction and social desirability. Believing that the etiology of same-sex attraction is nature-based predicted positive attitudes towards same-sex marriage whereas thinking sexual orientation is nurture-based predicted negative attitudes. Mediation analysis was used to assess the relationship between etiology beliefs and attitudes towards same-sex marriage. Homophobia fully explained the effect of nature beliefs and partially explained the effect of nurture beliefs on attitudes to same-sex marriage. Given that attitudes towards same-sex marriage are not created in a vacuum, the study also explored what people felt were their most influential sources of beliefs about the origins of same-sex attraction. The implications of the research findings for those lobbying for marriage equality in Australia are discussed.

AB  - Despite increasing scholarship on sexual minority youth (SMY), little is known about the experiences and outcomes of those who identify as asexual. This study investigates how internal and external stressors, mental health and health risk behaviours differ between asexual youth and other SMY. The study uses a sub-group analysis (n= 5,314) of an online survey of self-identified sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY). Descriptive and inferential statistics compare asexual (n= 669) to non-asexual (n= 4,645) respondents across two developmental phases - adolescence (age 14-19) and young adulthood (age 20-25) - while accounting for gender minority (e.g., transgender) self-identification. Results indicate that asexual youth had significantly higher internalised LGBTQ-phobia and tended to have poorer mental health (e.g., higher rates of depression), while having experienced less interpersonal discrimination/prejudice and having engaged in fewer health risk behaviours (e.g., substance use). Findings have implications for clinical practice. Future research should continue to investigate the impact of risk and protective factors on outcomes for asexual young people.

AB  - Given that racial stereotypes often influence leader appraisals, many businesses assume consumers will respond unfavorably to Black leaders. Recent research, however, suggests observers may suppress negative stereotypes of Black leaders when they head high-performing organizations. We integrate theory on implicit leadership and motivated social cognition to better understand how leader stereotype application and suppression influence consumer purchasing behavior. Across archival studies, a classroom exercise, and an experiment, we found that customers (real and prospective) appraised Black leaders less favorably than White leaders, resulting in lower patronage only when motivated to view leaders stereo-typically. Namely, significant consumer bias against companies with Black leaders emerged only when organizational failure was accompanied by (a) unfamiliarity with the leader(s) in question, (b) greater societal acceptance of racist behavior (i.e., in the past), or (c) high consumer desire to bask-in-reflected-glory of an organization.

AB  - Purpose: Due to improved survival rates of childhood cancer, there has been growing attention to survivors. In addition, experiences of illness in youth, during growth and development, affect the lives of these individuals in numerous ways. With a sample of long-term survivors of childhood cancer, this study investigated their difficult experiences after treatment completion and provided fundamental data for intervention programs that can assist growth.
   Methods: Data from 15 survivors aged 15-28 years old were collected through face-to-face interviews; analysis used Giorgi's phenomenological method.
   Results: The long-term survivors' lives involved a process of struggle to overcome the difficulties. Survivors had physical vestiges of cancer treatments, such as physical strength limitations, appearance changes, and sexual problems. Additionally, they experienced social withdrawal and awkwardness due to adaptation difficulties caused by social life interruption, family issues, social prejudice, and discrimination. These physical and social struggles led to experiences of mental stress and psychological withdrawal, but were followed by rebound.
   Conclusions: Long-term survivors of childhood cancer experienced physical, social, and emotional struggles following treatment completion. These results can yield improved understanding of this population, facilitate attention to their challenges, and contribute to their more effective integration into society, helping them live healthy and positive lives.

AB  - To improve women's access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in family planning (FP) clinics, we examined readiness to provide PrEP, and barriers and facilitators at the clinic level to integrate PrEP services into Title X-funded FP clinics across the Southern US. Title X-funded FP clinics across DHHS regions III (Mid-Atlantic), IV (Southeast), and VI (Southwest), comprising the Southern US. From February to June, 2018, we conducted a web-based, geographically targeted survey of medical staff, providers and administrators of Title X-funded FP clinics in DHHS regions III (Mid-Atlantic), IV (Southeast), and VI (Southwest). Survey items were developed using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to assess constructs relevant to PrEP implementation. One-fifth of 283 unique Title X clinics across the South provided PrEP. Readiness for PrEP implementation was positively associated with a climate supportive of HIV prevention, leadership engagement, and availability of resources, and negatively associated with providers holding negative attitudes about PrEP's suitability for FP. The Title X FP network is a vital source of sexual health care for millions of individuals across the US. Clinic-level barriers to providing PrEP must be addressed to expand onsite PrEP delivery in Title X FP clinics in the Southern US.

AB  - Reintegration of ex-combatants involves multiple challenges. In addition to the trauma-related psychological sequelae, social obstacles in the community can aggravate psychopathological aggressive tendencies and lead to the continuation of violence in civilian life. However, the association between others' negative attitudes and ex-combatants' ongoing perpetration of violence remains largely unexplored. Between September 2018 and May 2019, we assessed a representative community sample of adults in Eastern DR Congo (N = 1,058) and measured trauma exposure, perpetration, mental health problems (PTSD, depression, and appetitive aggression), perceived stigma (shame, perceived lack of social acknowledgement), experienced stigma, and skepticism toward reintegration with ex-combatants. Male ex-combatants (12%, n = 129) had more past trauma and violence perpetration than other community members and a greater number of recent conflicts (including both victimization and perpetration) within the community and with strangers/organized violence. They reported more experienced stigma, more severe PTSD symptoms but were less skeptical about reintegration. Ex-combatants' ongoing violence was predicted by an interplay of the community's skepticism toward reintegration and ex-combatants' perceived and recently experienced stigma (often attributed to the armed group history) and mental health problems, in addition to lifetime traumatization. These findings promote the need for combined interventions that address individual mental health problems including aggression and collective discriminatory attitudes and behaviors.

AB  - The authors propose that behavioral mimicry is guided by schemas that enable efficient social coordination. If mimicry is schema driven, then the operation of these schemas should be disrupted if partners behave in counternormative ways, such as mimicking people they generally would not or vice versa, rendering social interaction inefficient and demanding more executive and self-regulatory resources. To test this hypothesis, Experiments 1-3 used a resource-depletion paradigm in which participants performed a resource-demanding task after interacting with a confederate who mimicked them or did not mimic them. Experiment 1 demonstrated impaired task performance among participants who were not mimicked by a peer. Experiments 2 and 3 replicated this effect and also demonstrated a significant reversal in social contexts where mimicry is counternormative, suggesting that inefficiency emerges from schema inconsistency, not from the absence of mimicry per se. Experiment 4 used a divided attention paradigm and found that resources are taxed throughout schema-inconsistent interactions. These findings suggest that much-needed resources are preserved when the amount of mimicry displayed by interacting individuals adheres to norms, whereas resources are depleted when mimicry norms are violated.

AB  - Based on eighth-grade writing assessment data from the 1998 (N = 20,586) and 2007 (N = 139,900) National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), this study examines the relationships among students' writing attitudes, learning-related behaviors, and gender in relation to writing performance. Overall, the effects of attitudes were slightly larger than the effects of learning behaviors on writing performance, and gender differences were more prominent in attitudes than learning behaviors related to writing. Perhaps the most surprising finding from the 2007 NAEP data was that females with the most negative attitudes toward writing outperformed males with the most positive attitudes (i.e., writing scores based on two measures of attitudes: females, 157 and 161; males, 151 and 149). Overall, a similar pattern was observed with learning behaviors and gender differences in writing scores. Furthermore, medium effect sizes of gender difference in writing scores (females scoring substantially higher than males) were present even though the students reported to be at the same level in terms of writing attitudes and learning behaviors. The present study demonstrates that gender disparity in students' writing performance is persistent and strong; it cannot be explained by gender differences in attitudes or behavior alone or in attitudes and behavior combined.

AB  - In contrast to the continued decline of liberal arts education in the US, there has been a revived interest in liberal arts education in Asian countries in recent years. Grounded in a comprehensive understanding of the central tenets of liberal arts education in the West, this paper looks into the struggles Asian countries face in their exploration of liberal arts education and provides a direction for Asian countries in their efforts to practice liberal arts education. This paper establishes the deep connections between humanistic approaches of the Confucian tradition and liberal arts education by pointing to a common ground for the education of humanity. Ultimately, the purpose of liberal arts education, in the East as well as in the West, should be the liberation of human beings from the constraints of ignorance, prejudice and traditional customs and through the cultivation of a cosmopolitan morality that emphasizes unity, solidarity and the fusion of humankind. Chinese universities should contemplate the purpose and value of higher education in the 21st century and tap into the rich resources of Confucianism in order to give its liberal arts education a "soul."

AB  - The theory of planned behaviour (TPB) has been found to predict many health-related behaviours. The aim of this study was to further investigate the factors that predict binge drinking in university students using the TPB, and to further investigate social facilitation and self-efficacy in relation to binge drinking. One hundred and sixty-one university students completed a questionnaire (time 1), measuring attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control (PBC) and binge-drinking intentions, and 2 weeks later (time 2) 142 participants reported their binge-drinking behaviour. Ninety-one participants completed both questionnaires. Multiple regression analyses found partial support for the application of the TPB to binge drinking among university students accounting for 50% of variance in intentions to binge drink and 73% of variance in predicting future binge-drinking behaviour. However, PBC was found to be a non-significant predictor, thus supporting the simpler model of behaviour which excludes this control variable, the theory of reasoned action. Self-efficacy and social facilitation were also significant predictors of binge drinking. These findings indicate that to reduce binge drinking in university students, interventions targeting attitude change, perception of social norms and social facilitation would be most effective. Future research should explore the role of PBC in the TPB to determine its relevance in binge drinking.

AB  - Inequity can be framed in terms of disadvantage or advantage, with different consequences for how people understand the inequity. Here we ask, how do scholars conceptualize race and gender inequity in organizations? Using the perspective of inequity frames theory, our review reveals a chronic disadvantage lens in existing scholarship: race and gender inequity are overwhelmingly described as being caused by disadvantage. In turn, we find that scholars of such demographic inequity in organizations often focus solely on disadvantaging mechanisms, such as prejudice and stereotypes, belonging threats, and structural barriers. Nevertheless, our review of disparate literatures on attractiveness, nepotism, and social class (which use an advantage lens) demonstrates how specific and distinct advantaging mechanisms - including helping behaviors, permissiveness, and structural advantages - also create inequity. Such advantage mechanisms are largely missing in race and gender inequity literatures, despite the likelihood that such mechanisms contribute to, and ultimately allow the persistence of, race and gender inequity in organizations. Finally, we highlight steps scholars can take to expand the lenses they use to examine demographic inequity, and as such, expand the range of mechanisms identified and leveraged to reduce such inequity.

AB  - There is growing emphasis on disability-inclusive disaster management within key international guidance on disaster management. Yet, people with disability (PWD) are routinely excluded from the disaster management cycle and ignored or forgotten during all phases. This study explored barriers to inclusive disaster management through in-depth interviews with nine PWD and two carers of PWD from the Solomon Islands in 2015. Findings indicate PWD in the Solomon Islands are invisible in disasters. Failure to involve PWD can be linked to stigma, discrimination and the hidden nature of some disabilities. Government and aid organisations had a poor understanding of disability-specific needs in disasters and PWD had received no information on how to manage during or post disasters. Negative societal views of PWD perpetuated exclusion; based on notions that they are unable to actively contribute. Unequal access to resources, failure to adapt the built environment, and poor housing are problems PWD heightened the vulnerability of PWD in disasters. Raising awareness, combatting negative attitudes, and addressing discrimination would reduce vulnerability and result in better outcomes during disasters for all people in the Solomon Islands, inclusive of PWD. Findings of the research are relevant for PWD, not only in the Global South, but also in the Global North.

AB  - Background:Interactive voice response (IVR) systems are computer programs that interact with people to provide a number of services from business to healthcare. The healthcare applications are particularly relevant to older adults because they are important consumers of medical services. However, research has found that older adults can experience significant difficulties with IVR and have more negative attitudes toward the technology.Subjects and Methods:Seniors' attitudes appear to be related to their most recent experiences with IVR systems. The objective of this study was to examine attitudes toward four commercial or governmental IVR systems and how these attitudes relate to participants' ability to interact with the technology in a sample of 185 community-dwelling older (>65-year-old) adults. We also examined the effects of several demographic factors on both success and attitudes toward automated systems.Results:We found a significant positive correlation between IVR success and attitudes toward IVR. However, a large subset of our sample gave high ratings despite experiencing significant difficulties with the systems. These participants tended to have lower full scale IQ. No gender differences emerged in terms of attitudes and ability to interact with IVR systems.Conclusions:Results also indicated that older adults in our sample viewed the IVR interaction as particularly demanding on attention and concentration abilities.

AB  - Mental health policy in Australia is committed to the development of recovery-focused services and facilitating consumer participation in all aspects of mental health service delivery. Negative attitudes of mental health professionals have been identified as a major barrier to achieving these goals. Although the education of health professionals has been identified as a major strategy, there is limited evidence to suggest that consumers are actively involved in this education process. The aim of this qualitative study was to evaluate students' views and opinions at having been taught recovery in mental health nursing' by a person with a lived experience of significant mental health challenges. In-depth interviews were held with 12 students. Two main themes were identified: (i) looking through fresh eyes' what it means to have a mental illness; and (ii) it's all about the teaching'. The experience was perceived positively; students referred to the impact made on their attitudes and self-awareness, and their ability to appreciate the impact of mental illness on the individual person. Being taught by a person with lived experience was considered integral to the process. This innovative approach could enhance consumer participation and recovery-focused care.

AB  - Adapting the goal orientation framework from the achievement motivation literature, the present research tests whether learning orientation, as compared to performance orientation, predicts greater comfort and interest in intergroup contact. These links are examined in a cross-sectional survey of European American and African American middle school students (Study 1), and in a longitudinal survey with European American high school students (Study 2). Both studies yielded converging evidence that while performance orientation generally had a negative association with comfort and interest, a stronger orientation toward learning predicted greater comfort and interest in intergroup contact. The links between the learning orientation and comfort and interest in intergroup contact were consistent across both racial groups in Study 1, and in longitudinal analyses in Study 2. Together, these findings point to learning orientation as a potentially important means for promoting positive intergroup contact.

AB  - Background: Labor pain is distressing and produces undue side effects to both woman and fetus. In low-income countries like Ethiopia, addressing pain relief is often neglected. Professionals attending labor may not have awareness of obstetric analgesia. Besides this, there is a lack of published research on perceptions of obstetric analgesia among health professionals in Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to explore perceptions of obstetric analgesia among midwives attending normal vaginal deliveries in Durame Hospital.
   Methods: The study adopted an exploratory descriptive qualitative approach in Durame General Hospital, Kembata Tembaro Zone, Southern Ethiopia from March 1 to April 2, 2017. Fifteen midwives were purposely selected and participated in in-depth interviews. Data from interviews were transcribed, translated to English, coded, and categorized into themes. Data analysis was initiated alongside data collection using a thematic approach. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants.
   Results: Scarcity of knowledge, negative attitudes, lack of trained personnel, and absence of protocols were impediments to using labor analgesia for midwives to relieve labor pain.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that perceptions and practices of midwives with regard to labor analgesia needs special attention to address labor pain by scaling up forms and practice of labor analgesia in such a way that internationally accepted standards are met.

AB  - Incidents of discrimination due to implicit bias, or an unconscious prejudice in favor of or against certain groups, are extremely difficult to challenge in court because plaintiffs alleging discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause must prove that the discrimination was purposeful. Since our legal system often fails to provide relief where implicit bias has caused systemic discrimination, advocates for equity and inclusion should explore preventative measures that guard against the harms of this kind of systemic discrimination. This Comment argues that a new term "social pollution" should be used to properly classify systemic discrimination caused by implicit bias as a problem that should be regulated. First, this Comment discusses the pervasiveness of implicit bias. Then it discusses the Intent Doctrine in equal protection cases and explores reform proposals that ineffectively attempt to address the difficulty of proving implicit discrimination in Title VII disparate-treatment cases. Finally, this Comment uses environmental pollution to introduce the concept of social pollution and explores prospects for using environmental statutes as models for regulatory reform proposals that address the social pollution of systemic-discrimination caused by implicit bias.

AB  - Twenty years ago Mark Burke's pioneering research into homosexuality and policing evidenced widespread prejudice and hostility toward lesbian, gay and bisexual police officers in nine forces across England and Wales. These serving officers were felt to represent the most serious kind of contamination and threat to the integrity of the British Police Service by their heterosexual colleagues. Twenty years on this research, which represents one of the largest ever surveys of LGB police officers in England and Wales (N=836), evidences that just under one-fifth reported experiencing discrimination, with those in small and large forces, those in senior ranks and non-uniformed positions, and those who identify as gay male and Black, Minority Ethnic experiencing the highest levels of victimisation in training, deployment and promotion. Like Brown and Woolfenden, the authors conclude that a central aim of the diversity reform agenda must be a renegotiation of the psychological contract between staff and the organisation. A relational setup must be sought where mutual expectations of exchange are established and efforts are made to create a rich working environment that draws upon and invests in the subjective and intersubjective identity characteristics of LGB police officers.

AB  - Recent research (e. g. Barnes, Auburn & Lee, 2004) suggests that citizenship opportunities and resources may be afforded or denied to individuals according to their group memberships. We consider how the generic processes of intergroup differentiation by which groups are socially devalued and excluded can reflect divergent conceptualizations of citizenship among different groups. As part of a wider investigation of social exclusion, a combination of methods was used to investigate the relative intergroup perceptions of residents from more and less affluent areas in Limerick city, Ireland. Participants (n=214) completed the implicit association test and rated a fictional character on a series of citizenship-relevant dimensions. All participants displayed negative implicit associations with designated disadvantaged areas in Limerick. The results of the explicit prejudice assessment illustrated that these negative associations are matched by a lower overall attribution of positive characteristics to residents from these areas relative to residents from a more affluent area. On examination of each group's relative rating of traits, residents from less affluent areas appear doubly disadvantaged as they are devalued in terms of both outgroup and ingroup understandings of citizenship attributes.

AB  - Forests and grassy vegetation (savannas and grasslands) are alternative ecosystem states in many tropical landscapes. Relative to forests the grassy ecosystems are poorly known and poorly conserved, partly because they were thought to be products of forest clearance. However many grasslands have proved to be ancient. Commensurate with their antiquity, grassy biomes have distinct suites of plant and animal species that contribute a large fraction of the diversity of forest-grassland mosaics. Grasslands differ strikingly from forests in their ecology and in the nature of threats to their future. Here we highlight the high biodiversity value of grassy biomes and, in contrast to tropical forests, we illustrate the importance of fire in maintaining these systems. We discuss the major threats to, and consequences for, biodiversity in these regions including land clearance and elevated CO2-driven forest expansion. Finally we focus on the difficulties of grassland restoration. A new approach to understanding and conserving grassy ecosystems, free from cultural prejudices of the past, is long overdue.

AB  - Despite evidence of widespread belief in conspiracy theories, there remains a dearth of research on the individual difference correlates of conspiracist ideation. In two studies, we sought to overcome this limitation by examining correlations between conspiracist ideation and a range of individual psychological factors. In Study 1, 817 Britons indicated their agreement with conspiracist ideation concerning the July 7, 2005 (7/7), London bombings, and completed a battery of individual difference scales. Results showed that stronger belief in 7/7 conspiracy theories was predicted by stronger belief in other real-world conspiracy theories, greater exposure to conspiracist ideation, higher political cynicism, greater support for democratic principles, more negative attitudes to authority, lower self-esteem, and lower Agreeableness. In Study 2, 281 Austrians indicated their agreement with an entirely fictitious conspiracy theory and completed a battery of individual difference measures not examined in Study I. Results showed that belief in the entirely fictitious conspiracy theory was significantly associated with stronger belief in other real-world conspiracy theories, stronger paranormal beliefs, and lower crystallized intelligence. These results are discussed in terms of the potential of identifying individual difference constellations among conspiracy theorists.

AB  - The benefits and the disadvantages of patient reporting have been much debated in the last years. In spite of being considered 'anecdotal', patient reporting had overcome at last the prejudices among regulators and it is now allowed in many Western countries. Moreover, studies have demonstrated that patient reporting is a useful tool for collecting experiences and information about what is a 'tolerable' adverse effect, but also about the daily use of medicines.
   The current study aims to develop a systematic method that enables patients to report experienced adverse events that they think are due to their medication, using questionnaires returned in prepaid envelopes. Antidepressant agents were the drugs chosen for this pilot study. We also wanted to determine the feasibility of a community pharmacy-based system to inform the patients about the possibility to report adverse events.
   Patients in our study were willing to report adverse events. The patients proved to be capable of identifying and providing a clear description of their experiences that were due to antidepressant use. Antidepressant adverse effects represent a burden for the patients, being probably underestimated by the healthcare professionals.

AB  - The European Commission envisages smart home technology (SHT) as reducing energy costs and simplifying consumer engagement in a low-carbon-energy retail market without inconveniencing them. With consumers' consent, SHT allows continuous seamless interaction between the home and the smart grid, offering the grid ongoing demand flexibility resources for reshaping the demand curve. This study assesses perceptions of a nontechnophobic segment of the Israeli public (N = 554) regarding demand flexibility and energy management through SHT. Sociodemographic variables, personality traits, and attitudes toward smart homes and demand flexibility through SHT were examined as predictors of consumers' interest in adopting a smart home and in demand flexibility through SHT. In a hierarchical linear regression model, gender, income, openness to experience, and positive and negative attitudes toward SHT explained 64.4% of the variance in interest in smart homes. Age, openness to experience, a positive attitude toward smart homes, and perceived benefits of demand flexibility explained 31.4% of the variance in interest in demand flexibility through SHT. Regarding respondents' willingness to allow SHT to manage appliances, dishwashers scored the highest and refrigerators, the lowest. Findings indicate that prospective adopters value the perceived benefits of comfort and convenience over risks associated with smart home technology.

AB  - In Ghana, people with mental disorders commonly experience negative attitudes and discrimination because of deep-rooted public stigma. The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness of a mental health literacy programme in improving community leaders' attitudes toward people with mental disorders. A cluster randomised controlled trial, comprising an intervention and control group, participated in a 3-hour problem-solving, Story-bridge mental health literacy programme. Data were collected at baseline and 12-week follow-up. The intervention group performed better in most outcome measures at follow-up compared to the control group. There were statistically significant differences between the two groups, in perceived stigma, community mental health ideology (CMHI), and benevolence outcome measures over the two time-points. Overall, the findings suggest that the programme was somewhat effective in improving community leaders' attitudes and who might, subsequently, foster supportive, non-judgemental and empathetic attitudes toward individuals with mental disorders in their communities. There is scope for community psychiatric nurses and other primary health care workers to work with community leaders to increase public awareness of, and favourable attitudes toward, people with mental health problems in the community.

AB  - Minority stress is a cause of health challenges for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) youth experiencing homelessness. However, in over-focusing on family rejection, the research on LGBTQ youth homelessness often misses how minority stress itself can shape the youth's perceived pathways into and experiences of homelessness. A main objective of this study, then, foregrounds minority stress in understanding LGBTQ youth homelessness. To achieve this objective, the author conducted ethnographic fieldwork in central Texas and interviewed 40 LGBTQ youth experiencing homelessness. The author shows how experiencing intersecting minority stressors, especially within families and youth-serving institutions, is part of the perceived pathways into homelessness. The author also documents how experiencing homelessness in conjunction with experiencing anti-LGBTQ perceived discrimination, violence, and other minority stressors such as racism impact the youth's mental health challenges while living on the streets. A second objective of this study, then, shows how anti-LGBTQ discrimination intersects with other forms of prejudice and discrimination to shape the youth's stressors and pathways into and experiences of homelessness. The author concludes that intersecting minority stressors shape perceived pathways into homelessness and compound with the socially stressful experiences of homelessness, but social support, especially LGBTQ-specific support, can help ameliorate these challenges.

AB  - Background: An important way of reducing tobacco use is to train the health professional (HP) students to assist in tobacco cessation by educating patients and public. In order to shape their thoughts for the desired role, it is vital to understand their existing perceptions regarding HP's role in tobacco control. Thus, the aim of our study was to find out the perceptions of Pakistani HP students regarding their future role in tobacco control, and examine factors associated with negative perceptions.
   Methods: Secondary data analysis of the Global Health Professional Students Survey, Pakistan, 2011 was performed. Study population included 3445 health professional students in third year of graduate level programs. The dependent variable (perceptions of HP students), was developed using four questions from the survey. Students who did not regard HP's role in tobacco control were labeled as having negative perceptions. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to analyze association between HP students' perceptions and various socio-demographic, attitudinal and knowledge related factors; and were reported as adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence interval.
   Results: We found that 44.8% (n = 1542) of students do not regard HPs as role model for their patients and public, and perceive that HPs do not play an important part in patient's quitting tobacco use. These negative perceptions were associated with male sex (OR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.02 - 1.53, p value 0.028), and poor knowledge about tobacco cessation techniques (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.12 - 1.55, p value < 0.001). Negative perceptions were also associated with their attitudes towards ban on: tobacco advertisements (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.13 - 2.48, p value 0.010); and tobacco use at public places (OR = 1.60, 95% CI 1.26 - 2.03, p value < 0.001).
   Conclusion: The role of HPs for tobacco control is fairly under-perceived by HP students, and the undesired negative perceptions are associated with male sex, poor knowledge about tobacco use cessation techniques and negative attitudes towards legislative control. A comprehensive approach, focusing on these aspects should be adopted to train HPs, in order to utilize them as an effective manpower for tobacco control.

AB  - Introduction As the benefits of workplace inclusion become progressively recognized, employers are making greater efforts to cultivate inclusive organizational environments where employees from diverse backgrounds can thrive. Yet academic research has often neglected issues of sexual orientation and gender diversity. We contribute to redressing this knowledge gap by examining processes of workplace inclusion for employees with diverse genders and sexualities, focusing on an under-researched area-the role of language.
   Methods Using a regression framework, we empirically examine how different individual and workplace factors are associated with employees' inclusive language use toward their trans- and gender-diverse colleagues. To accomplish this, we undertook the first-ever analyses of unique survey data from the 2020 Australian Workplace Equality Index Employee Survey (n similar to 27,000 employees and similar to 150 employers).
   Results Our results highlight the role of employees' socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., their gender and sexual orientation, age, education, and religiosity) as well as the role of features of the workplace environment (e.g., employer's size, location, and inclusion culture).
   Conclusions While use of appropriate language toward individuals with diverse genders and sexualities constitutes an important stepping stone to their workplace inclusion, this study has demonstrated that its adoption remains incomplete and highly segmented.
   Social Policy Implications These findings bear important implications for the design, targeting, and implementation of programs aimed at fostering trans-affirming language and the workplace inclusion of individuals from sexual and gender minorities.

AB  - Intolerance of ambiguity among medical students is associated with negative attitudes towards psychosocially complex patients. In this paper, the authors evaluated the feasibility of a 3.5-hour workshop aimed at fostering tolerance for ambiguity in medical students through semi-structured interactions with horses that functioned as experiential surrogates for ambiguity. Among 26 first-year medical students who participated in the feasibility assessment, an overwhelming majority rated the workshop as academically valuable and recommended that it be offered again in the future. After feasibility was established, an additional group of 7 first-year medical students and 5 fourth-year students completed Budner's Tolerance of Ambiguity scale before and after the workshop to provide preliminary data on its effectiveness. The post-workshop mean scores on the Budner scale were lower than pre-workshop mean scores, suggesting that students developed greater tolerance for ambiguity following the workshop. This difference was statistically significant among the first-year students, but not among the fourth-year students. Our findings demonstrate that the equine-facilitated workshop is feasible and can potentially help medical students develop greater tolerance for ambiguity.

AB  - Gender bias in leadership is an egregious yet common reality in the societal mores of male-dominant cultures. Contentious ecclesial debates about gender bias pit prejudices against female leadership roles when girded by biblical tropes engaged to disparage female character and leadership behavior. Sexualized imagery in the textual narrative is misappropriated to libel females who are leading change with ethical and behavioral competencies lauded in their male counterparts. In the politically charged context of recent national elections, the newly installed Vice President of the United States was publicly labeled a "Jezebel" to connote a racially and sexually derisive trope calling into question a woman's scruples in private spheres as well as disparaging her agency. As I refer to Tamura Lomax's extensive analysis of this trope, I examine in this article the hermeneutical misappropriation of Bathsheba imagery, wherein the behavior of biblical figure King David is normalized as the beloved of God while Bathsheba is villainized. The presumptive insinuation is that women use sexual guiles to advance careers, social station, or positional power. Judgmental inequities in contemporary and biblical examples raise an urgency to counter negative gender/power tropes from the Bible to the boardroom.

AB  - Since Jenner, vaccines and vaccinations have stirred a hot, highly polarized debate, leading to contrasting positions and feelings, ranging from acritical enthusiasm to blind denial. On the one hand, we find anti vaccination movements which divulge and disseminate misleading information, myths, prejudices, and even frauds, with the main aim of denying that vaccination practices represent a major public health measure, being effective in controlling infectious diseases and safeguarding the wellbeing of entire communities. Recently, the authors of many vaccine safety investigations are being personally criticized rather than the actual science being methodologically assessed and critiqued. Unfortunately, this could result in making vaccine safety science a "hazardous occupation". Critiques should focus on the science and not on the authors and on the scientists that publish reasonably high-quality science suggesting a problem with a given vaccine. These scientists require adequate professional protection so there are not disincentives to publish and to carry out researches in the field. The issues for vaccine safety are not dissimilar to other areas such as medical errors and drug safety. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The planning practice of focusing most rural development within larger settlements has failed to achieve goals of rural activity colocation. In a society where quality of opportunity has become dominant in location decisions, a broader imaginative perspective than the physical proximity of functions is required if meaningful activity colocation is to occur. The extent to which residents and employees can be encouraged to localise their activity is explored through case studies of three very different small towns within the English county of Norfolk. Although not of universal appeal, small towns provide an important niche for many rural actors. Rather than abandoning policy endeavours, there is potential to improve their effectiveness by ensuring that the possible benefits arising from the colocation of activity are realised. By adopting a more flexible approach to policy application, utilising complementary conceptions which are attentive to the specific characteristics of individual places, potential exceptions to policies of development concentration can be identified. However, in the UK context ongoing cutbacks in local authority budgets are likely to prejudice the conduct of the type of fine-grained local policy development required to achieve these objectives.

AB  - The influx of immigrants into Malaysia is becoming a subject of controversy. Some local groups claim that since immigrants are demanded in certain industries namely plantation, agriculture, mining, manufacturing and construction sectors, their benefits and impact in the rural sectors needs to be studied. This study identifies the implications of migration on the rural community. The objective of this study is to explore local people's perceptions on the socio-economic impacts of Indonesian immigrants in their rural areas. The data is collected using both qualitative and quantitative techniques. Surveys were carried out to 671 local people in six villages through a purposive sampling technique. Results showed locals acknowledge the importance of immigrant labour in rural sectors and contribute to the positive impact on rural development. Generally, Indonesian workers play a significant role and have a huge impact on the economic development in rural areas. Indonesian immigrants are well known as labour replacements or seasonal immigrants and have the positive attitude as hardworking and obedient workers. Thus, policy on immigrants in Malaysia needs to be further revised due to a xenophobic reaction by the locals that create prejudices towards immigrants.

AB  - Background: Public attitudes towards a given medical procedure can have a significant influence on the employment of that method. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a medical procedure that has received an exceptionally ambiguous public reception since its inception.
   Aim: To survey the level of information about and attitudes towards ECT in a general population sample of the Chuvash Republic of the Russian Federation.
   Methods: A randomly selected cohort of 5,373 people was contacted by telephone. The respondents were asked three closed and three open questions.
   Results: The response rate was 74.7%. Only 35.2% of those interviewed said they knew anything about ECT. Health professionals and younger respondents were better informed. The two main sources of information about ECT were foreign films and the mass media. The main indication of ECT was thought to be schizophrenia. The majority (63.3%) of the respondents had negative opinions and emotions about ECT.
   Conclusion: Limited information about and generally negative attitudes towards ECT were found in the general population of the Chuvash Republic. Gender, age, education level, employment in the health industry, and information source were found to be the determining factors in the knowledge of and attitudes towards ECT.

AB  - There is a growing social work literature about lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) older people. However, research and guidance are predominantly based on the experiences of older gay men and, to a lesser extent, older lesbians. There is little to help practitioners work with older bisexual people. The Looking Both Ways study aimed to contribute to this gap in knowledge. We undertook in-depth purposely sampled qualitative interviews with 12 people aged over 50, all of whom have bisexual relationship histories and half of whom also currently identify as bisexual. There were three main findings. First, biphobia (prejudice against bisexual people) impacts on older people with bisexual histories in ways that may affect their well-being in later life. Second, concerns around receiving care are similar in some ways and different in others from the concerns of lesbians and gay men. Third, people with bisexual relationship histories may have developed strong support networks and resilience, factors that may be very beneficial in later life. Three recommendations for social work professionals were identified: 1) understand biphobia, 2) recognize the legitimacy of concerns about receiving care, and 3) ask about support networks rather than assuming family support.

AB  - Like the Tigris-Euphrates rivers in the Middle East, Yellow-Yangtze rivers in China, and Mississippi-Colorado rivers in the United States, our brain has two neural pathways (or rivers) where we perceive two distinct values in marketing exchange processes. We identify two neural pathways of reward and information value (RIV) perceptions in the consumer brain leading to engagement, recommendation, and sharing (ERS) behavior in social media marketing. Using fMRI, we show that the first river in the brain (i.e., reward value area of the nucleus accumbens) is activated when consumers are shown visually aesthetic and appealing (versus unappealing) ob-jects in social media advertisements. The second river in the brain (i.e., information value area of the prefrontal cortex) is activated when consumers are shown new (versus outdated) products in social media advertisements. This paper is the first attempt in marketing to provide an integrative brain map for customer value perception in SNS marketing. The conceptual model presented in this paper can be traced back to the traditional consumer attitude change theory as dual processing models of persuasion, yet it can explain the underlying mechanisms of consumer value in the social media context. Using this two rivers brain map, marketers can better identify how their offerings can satisfy the diverse and unique needs of consumers based on RIV.

AB  - The rise of social media, and specifically Facebook, as a dominant force in the flow of news in the United States has led to concern that people incur greater isolation from diverse perspectives through filter bubbles (from algorithmic filtering) and echo chambers (from an information environment populated by social recommendations coming from overwhelmingly like-minded others). This evolution in news diffusion comes at a time when Americans report increased affective partisan polarization. In particular, evidence shows increasingly negative attitudes about out-party members. Based on selective exposure and reinforcing spirals model perspectives, we examined the reciprocal relationship between Facebook news use and polarization using national 3-wave panel data collected during the 2016 US Presidential Election. Over the course of the campaign, we found media use and attitudes remained relatively stable. Our results also showed that Facebook news use was related to a modest over-time spiral of depolarization. Furthermore, we found that people who use Facebook for news were more likely to view both pro- and counter-attitudinal news in each wave. Our results indicated that counter-attitudinal news exposure increased over time, which resulted in depolarization. We found no evidence of a parallel model, where pro-attitudinal exposure stemming from Facebook news use resulted in greater affective polarization.

AB  - College campuses are among the most racially diverse settings in our segregated society. For many students, especially non-Hispanic whites, college represents the first time they have come into significant contact with members of other groups. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen, this paper explores the effects of campus diversity and various types of interracial contact on the racial and ethnic attitudes of white students over the course of four years in college. The findings are largely consistent with the contact hypothesis, particularly with respect to changes in attitudes towards blacks. White students who report having a close friend who is black and those who have dated or had a romantic partner who is black express less social distance towards blacks in their senior year, as do white students who were involved in extracurricular activities in which blacks are the majority. Participating in extracurricular activities dominated by blacks is also associated with more positive views of the impact of affirmative action on academic standards expressed as students were leaving college. Although there is evidence that both stereotypes and social distance towards groups are mitigated by intergroup contact, stereotypes appeared to be somewhat more resistant to change. The findings suggest that institutions should continue efforts to diversify their student populations, and also promote involvement in extracurricular activities for students from all groups.

AB  - The promotion of new energy vehicles is a grand plan across countries to achieve carbon neutrality and air purification. The sale volume of new energy vehicles is affected by many factors, yet it is the attitude of consumers themselves that has the final decisive role. We use four representative Baidu search indexes as the variables representing the attention of consumers and take variables of economic, population, and income as control variables for regression analysis from the national and sub-economic regional perspectives respectively. Results show that search indexes of "new energy vehiclek." "new energy vehicles battery", and 'charging pile' all have significant positive impacts on the sales of new energy vehicles to varying degrees while the index of 'automobile spontaneous combustion' has a significant negative impact on the sale volume. This study, therefore, verifies that the consumer attention represented by search indexes is an important yet uncovered factor affecting the sale volume of new energy vehicles. Besides, due to people's prejudice against spontaneous combustion accidents of new energy vehicles, consumers have a cognitive bias about the spontaneous combustion rate of new energy vehicles especially in less developed areas of China.

KW  - INTENTION
AB  - Background. Township hospitals in China provide rural communities with basic but much needed critical health care services. The doctors working in these hospitals often feel unsatisfied when considering their work schedules and financial rewards. Method. To explore job satisfaction of health workers in a township hospital, a qualitative study was conducted of 39 doctors from five township hospitals in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The goal was to understand the level of job satisfaction of doctors and to make recommendations for improvements. Results. About 75% (28/39) of the doctors expressed negative attitudes related to their work conditions. Slightly more than half (22/39) mentioned they should receive greater compensation for their work and more than one were seriously considering other options. Many participants (35/39) showed their satisfaction about the achievement of serving as a doctor. Conclusion. Their main concerns related to job satisfaction included working conditions, financial rewards, and the doctor's relationships with patients. Increasing the incomes and fringe benefits of healthcare workers, improving their work conditions, and providing training and continuing education opportunities would help rural clinics retain doctors and eliminate the current unsatisfactory conditions. The findings also highlight the need for the government to increase financial support of township hospitals.

AB  - Aim: Highly structured simulation-based training (SBT) on managing emergency situations can have a significant effect on immediate satisfaction and learning. However, there are some indications of problems when applying learned skills to practice. The aim of this study was to identify long-term intended and unintended learner reactions, experiences and reflections after attending a simulation based Advanced Life Support (ALS) course.
   Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted by telephone with a purposive sample of prior ALS-course participants. A constructivist grounded theory approach was used to analyze the data.
   Results: Seventeen former participants were interviewed. The main themes related to context adaptation, communities of practice and to transfer of skills. Interviewees described challenges in adapting to the structured simulation setting and going back to the uncertain and unstructured clinical world. In part, a result of the several conflicting communities of practice - one being the ALS-community and the others relating to professional roles. Despite reporting transferring a more systematic approach to managing patients in emergency situations and during ward rounds, surgery, and in their teaching, participants also reported poor transfer in emergency situations where not all team members had the same ALS-structured approach.
   Conclusion: The result from this study indicates that the efficiency dimension of ALS competence is taught well in ALS courses, but that the form and content of these highly structured/model courses are insufficient in training the innovative dimension of competence that is needed for transfer of skills in unstructured, emergency situations.

AB  - Solar-driven desalination, which concentrates solar thermal energy at the water surface for evaporating, is a promising solution to water scarcity. During solar desalination, the light absorber produces a high temperature surface under sunlight irradiation, while bottom water below the absorbers always keeps a low temperature. Consequently, a temperature difference (TD) is formed between absorber surface and bottom water. According to Seebeck effect, the voltage difference will be generated once the TD presents between the two ends of semiconductors. Herein, we demonstrate a light-to-heat-to-electricity conversion device with bilayer MXene-based monoliths combining with n-/p-type semiconductors that can efficiently extract freshwater (5-8 L.m(-2).d(-1)) from seawater while simultaneously having a derived extra voltage of similar to 0.3 V under outdoor natural sunlight (0.91 kW.m(-2)). Notably, TD-induced electricity can be enlarged and utilized on-site by connecting devices in series without prejudice to freshwater output. By taking advantage of renewable solar energy and seawater (or contaminated), abundant resources on Earth, this device can provide the freshwater and electricity for basic needs in various off-grid and/or resource constrained areas simultaneously.

AB  - Significant others of people with dementia suffer high levels of burden and distress, creating the conditions for the negative attitudes and unhelpful responses described within the construct of Expressed Emotion (EE). It is not known however, whether EE then further enhances significant other burden and distress, and whether these processes operate early after symptoms of dementia have started. The current study used a longitudinal design to examine the potential influence of EE on burden and distress in significant others of people with a recent diagnosis of dementia. Sixty-one significant others of people with dementia were recruited. Significant other EE was coded from the Camberwell Family Interview. Significant other burden and distress, and relationship quality were collected through questionnaires at baseline and at 6-month follow-up. Significant other high-EE was associated with higher levels of burden and greater distress at both baseline and 6-month follow-up, when existing relationship quality was controlled for. High-EE significant others showed increases in burden and distress from baseline to follow-up not seen in low-EE significant others. Interventions aiming to modify significant other response styles and to reduce high-EE may potentially benefit significant others by reducing their levels of burden and distress.

AB  - Purpose: To understand the characteristics of risk perception of influenza pandemic in college students with prominent frequency and the differences between these risk perceptions and professionals. Then, offering a proposal for the government to improve the efficiency of risk communication and health education.
   Methods: According to the mental model theory, researchers first draw a framework of key risk factors, and then they ask these students about the understanding of the framework with questionnaire and then making concept statistics and content analysis on the respondents' answers.
   Results: Researchers find some students' misunderstanding of pandemic including excessive optimism to the consequences of a pandemic, a lack of detailed understanding of mitigation measures, and negative attitudes towards health education and vaccination. Most students showed incomplete and incorrect views about concepts related to the development and exposure factors, impact and mitigation measures. Once threatened, it may lead to the failure of decision-making The majority of students we interviewed had positive attitudes towards personal emergency preparedness for a pandemic influenza and specialized health education in the future.
   Conclusion: Researchers suggest that the government should make a specific pandemic guidance plan by referring to the risk cognitive characteristics of college students shown in the research results, and update the methods of health education to college students.

AB  - Political crises, which have a known impact on the choice of tourism destination, can also negatively affect the choice of second-home destination and purchase. The purpose of this study is to investigate why some Swedish-Iranian second-home buyers prefer Spain to Turkey for political reasons. More than 30 short dialogues were conducted with Swedish-Iranian buyers at the exhibition "Buying Properties Abroad" in Kista, September 2015, following the start of a series of political crises in Turkey. A simple question was asked: Why are you choosing Spain rather than Turkey? The most important category of reasons were political factors, followed by cultural masons. Political anxiety, instability, and insecurity in Turkey, the risk of civil war, a police society, lack of democratic order, the fact that Turkey is not a member of the European Union, the government's negative attitudes towards Kurds, and the emergence of Islamic State were the political reasons most mentioned. One conclusion that can be drawn is that political crises affect second-home tourism/tourists in the same way that they do ordinary tourism/tourists. The research has some important implications for Turkish policymakers, tourism stakeholders at a macrolevel, their competitors, especially in Spain, and potential buyers. Based on this research, some suggestions for future studies are also given.

AB  - Both acceptability and behaviour change data provide important information about the likelihood of success of an intervention when disseminated outside the research context. Despite this, few studies have combined such data for use in ongoing intervention development.
   To assess the acceptability and feasibility of an online intervention to improve gluten-free diet (GFD) adherence in coeliac disease, and to examine the relationships with participant characteristics, attrition, and effectiveness to inform ongoing intervention developments to ultimately reduce attrition and improve the reach and effectiveness of the programme.
   All participants completed measures of GFD adherence, theory of planned behaviour variables, psychological symptoms, and demographic and disease characteristics. Acceptability and feasibility ratings were obtained at the conclusion of each of the six intervention modules. Chi-square analyses were used to examine differences between completers and non-completers, and Spearman's correlations were used to determine the relationships between participant characteristics, effectiveness, and acceptability and feasibility.
   Participants who rated the early modules less favourably were more likely to drop-out of the intervention. Acceptability and feasibility ratings were also associated with the presence of psychological symptoms, use of adaptive coping strategies, GFD duration, and attitude change.
   The findings suggest that changes to the structure and implementation of the intervention may be useful in minimising attrition and maximising effectiveness for future dissemination in a wider coeliac disease population.

AB  - Young people who are placed in out-of-home care are amongst the most vulnerable in our community. Removed from or rejected by their families, they must learn to live with carers who may be strangers. They may have experienced the trauma of abuse or neglect. Post care, they may experience further social isolation and marginalisation due to limited social capital. These challenges are compounded for queer young people placed in out-of-home care. This study adopted a case study approach to explore the lived experience of two young adults growing up queer in and out of out-of-home care in Australia. Our investigation was framed by two complementary theoretical frameworks. The first, a model of minority stress, is informed by queer perspectives and enabled an exploration into the adverse impact of enduring stigma and prejudice associated with homophobia and transphobia on young people's capacity to thrive. The model of social capital was then employed to inform an analysis of relationships between queer young people in out-of-home care and trustworthy adults. The findings suggest that queer young people growing up in out-of-home care experience minoritised stress, with lasting negative implications. The presence however, of trustworthy adults who challenge dominant heteronormative assumptions and work to support queer young people can be experienced as stabilising and restorative.

AB  - A smoke-free home is defined as one where people are not allowed to smoke anywhere inside the home. Smoking inside the home leads to second-hand smoke for all household members, a health hazard that needs to be addressed. This study explored the perspectives of community members toward a smoke-free home in a suburb of Bangkok metropolitan area, Thailand. This paper describes the qualitative descriptive phase of a sequential mixed method study which employed four focus groups interviews with 29 key informants, including community committee members, smokers' family members, and current smokers. Focus group guidelines centred on understanding second-hand smoke and its effects on family health, how to ban smoking inside homes, and how communities get involved in promoting smoke-free homes.
   Content analysis was applied for data analysis and the findings on community perspectives on smoke-free home had three categories: 1) negative attitudes toward second-hand smoke inside homes; 2) effect of second-hand smoke on health problems; and 3) feasibility of smoke-free homes. Participants believed it was possible to develop a smoke-free home by setting a community agenda that required participation and coordination among community members, family members, and current smokers. This should entail strengthening family negotiations, setting smoking ban rules, and providing smoking areas outside homes, as well as supporting current smokers to quit. Public health nurses have a role to play in promoting smoke-free homes by their advocating, encouraging, and empowering smokers in reducing or quitting their smoking, as well as providing guidance to their families. In turn this helps to strengthen community action to prevent second-hand smoking and smoking reduction.

AB  - Along with the rapid growth in construction industry, quantity of construction and demolition (C&D) waste has increased significantly in recent decades. Demolition waste (DW) is identified as one significant stream of C&D waste and it is vital to obtain reliable information of the waste quantity. However, the data of C&D waste generation in China is still insufficient. In this study, an agent-based model is developed to estimate the total volume of DW and the amount of DW generated at each stage of waste disposal in Shenzhen, China. The findings present the greater capacity of deconstruction method in reduction of DW generation than conventional demolition method. In addition, the change from conventional demolition to deconstruction method could bring about a dramatic difference in the amount of construction material saving. However, the results present that change of attitude towards the demolition method is a slow process, which explains the unsatisfactory performance of demolition waste management (DWM) in Shenzhen. Relying on the attitude change of demolition companies is not enough to improve the performance of DWM. Related stakeholders should pay additional attention on DWM. Furthermore, an optimized management framework with involvement of related stakeholders is developed in this study. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research on myths about male rape victims and offenders indicates that men and heterosexual individuals tend to believe myths about male rape (MRMs), as do individuals with negative attitudes toward gay men. Many who support male rape myths assume that both male victims of rape and offenders are usually gay, or that straight men cannot be raped. Studies on MRM have portrayed male rape in an 'everyday life' context, but myths about male rape are likely shaped by its portrayal in film, television and popular culture. For example, respondents may attribute more blame to victims who are incarcerated as opposed to a victim raped by a stranger near their home. In this study, we assess support for myths about male rape victims and whether the context of the situation and various indicators of intolerance play a role in their beliefs. Specifically, we present four fictional scenarios of male rape to respondents: prison, in the military, during a conflict situation, and on a college campus. We find that respondents are less likely to support MRMs in the context of the military, and that race and gender also explain support for MRMs. Measures of intolerance are positively related to support for MRMs, with sexism having the strongest relationship with support.

AB  - In mainland China, HIV prevalence among men who have sex with men (MSM) has risen sharply in the past decade. However, few HIV studies have directly addressed the female spouses' (tongqi) experiences, a population estimated at 14 million [Cheng, F. K. (2016).1 want to come forward: Voices from Chinese tongqi. Cogent Social Sciences, 2(1), 1158343. doi:10.1080/23311886.2016.1158343; Zhu, J. (2018). "Unqueer" kinship? Critical reflections on "marriage fraud" in mainland China. Sexualities, 21(7), 1075-1091. doi: 10.1177/1363460717719240]. We conducted this exploratory qualitative study to understand tongqi's attitudes toward same-sex sexuality and HIV risk as well as their sexual history. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 24 tongqi between October 2015 and September 2016. Data were coded and analyzed using thematic analysis. We identified four primary themes: (a) surprise, initial disbelief, and negative attitudes toward their husbands' same-sex sexuality; (b) maintenance of regular sexual contact, particularly before pregnancy; (c) unprotected sex with marital and extramarital partners; and (d) low perception of HIV risk. Strategies to increase HIV knowledge and testing uptake are urgently needed among these vulnerable women but must be implemented with caution to avoid exacerbating high levels of homophobia.

AB  - This research uniquely contributes to the marketing policy literature by illuminating the widespread yet seldom studied problem of online inaccessibility of retail websites affecting approximately 30 million disabled Americans. When a website is not designed to be navigated easily or is not compatible with assistive technology such as a screen-reader, these potential customers are not able to independently search for information and conduct transactions. Blind and low vision participants in an empirical study provide their opinions regarding accessibility policy issues and reveal that their frustrations with inaccessible retail websites may result, not only in avoidance of the retailer in its different sales channels but also in antifirm behaviors driven by negative attitudes toward perceived retailer accessibility/disability policy that spur feelings of online marketplace discrimination. Using two different evaluation tools, the top 100 retailers in the United States were evaluated on the accessibility of their websites over the past 4 years (2015-2018). Results show that most websites contain many design errors making navigation very difficult or even impossible for vision impaired consumers. The argument is made that online retailers who proactively address these inaccessibility issues on their websites may significantly increase their customer base and profitability.

AB  - Teachers' implicit biases about ethnic differences in student achievement and teachers' mindsets have been associated with significant differences in their students' achievement. In two studies (N = 313; N = 57) with preservice teachers undertaking a three-year teacher education programme aimed at promoting social justice, we found that third-year students showed significantly less implicit ethnic achievement bias and reduced fixed mindsets compared to the first-year preservice teachers. Students from the ethnic minority were found to have the least bias, but still associated student achievement more with the ethnic majority group. It is concluded that more is needed to reduce implicit biases and develop a growth mindset among our preservice teachers.

AB  - Although there is evidence of stigmatization of patients with Alzheimer's disease, few studies have evaluated stigma among family caregivers. This study was aimed at understanding the experiences of family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease within Iran. We conducted a qualitative study using hermeneutic phenomenology. Semistructured in-depth interviews with 10 Iranian family caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's were audiotaped and transcribed. The transcriptions were then analyzed using Van Manen's method. Family stigma emerged as one of the most important themes in this study. It consisted of two subthemes of feeling of shame due to the unusual behaviors and speech of the patients and fear of judgments made by others. An understanding of the experience of family stigma may lead to the development of supportive strategies to manage this problem among the caregivers. Educating families of patients about the disease plays a critical role in facilitating the process of caregiving. In addition, promoting public awareness about Alzheimer's disease can diminish stigma and prejudice toward patients and their caregivers. Educating caregivers on stigma management may also be an important factor in alleviating their stress.

AB  - In this paper, we use new data on military expenditure (milex) compiled by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) to investigate the relationship between military spending and economic growth. We focus on selected countries in Indo-Pacific Asia - an economically diverse but increasingly prosperous region with pockets of strategic competition and growing milex. We confirm the robustness of SIPRI's milex data by corroborating it with defence budget data published by Australia's Defence Intelligence Organisation (ADIO). We find no conclusive evidence of an arms race in the region. It is the growing economic prosperity that accounts for most of the growth in Indo-Pacific Asia's milex. But we also find wide variations in the economic burden imposed by milex at the national level and that milex' high level of aggregation masks important changes in national military capabilities. We argue that such capabilities can increase despite a constant or even declining milex burden and, hence, prejudice the peaceful resolution of international conflicts and, thus, undermine the fragile regional stability. We propose limited disaggregation of milex to highlight national spending on military force structure and preparedness so as to facilitate better understanding of military capability formation.

AB  - Objectives: Individuals with disabilities experience significant health care disparities due to a multitude of barriers to effective care, which include a lack of adequate physician training on this topic and negative attitudes of physicians. This results in disparities through inadequate physical examination and diagnostic testing, withholding or inferior treatment, and neglecting preventative care. While much has been published about disability education in undergraduate medical education, little is known about the current state of disability education in emergency medicine (EM) residency programs.
   Methods: In 2019, a total of 237 EM residency program directors (PDs) in the United States were surveyed about the actual and desired number of hours of disability health instruction, perceived barriers to disability health education, prevalence of residents and faculty with disabilities, and confidence in providing accommodations to residents with disabilities.
   Results: A total of 104 surveys were completed (104/237, 43.9% response rate); 43% of respondents included disability-specific content in their residency curricula for an average of 1.5 total hours annually, in contrast to average desired hours of 4.16 hours. Reported barriers to disability health education included lack of time and lack of faculty expertise. A minority of residency programs have faculty members (13.5%) or residents (26%) with disabilities. The prevalence of EM residents with disabilities was 4.02%. Programs with residents with disabilities reported more hours devoted to disability curricula (5 hours vs 1.54 hours, p = 0.017) and increased confidence in providing workplace accommodations for certain disabilities including mobility disability (p = 0.002), chronic health conditions (p = 0.022), and psychological disabilities (p = 0.018).
   Conclusions: A minority of EM PDs in our study included disability health content in their residency curricula. The presence of faculty and residents with disabilities is associated with positive effects on training programs, including a greater number of hours devoted to disability health education and greater confidence in accommodating learners with disabilities. To reduce health care disparities for patients with disabilities, we recommend that a dedicated disability health curriculum be integrated into all aspects of the EM residency curriculum, including lectures, journal clubs, and simulations and include direct interaction with individuals with disabilities. We further recommend that disability be recognized as an aspect of diversity when hiring faculty and recruiting residents to EM programs, to address this training gap and to promote a diverse and inclusive learning environment.

AB  - Background Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is among the most stigmatized health conditions and is frequently comorbid with mood, anxiety, and drug use disorders. Theoretical frameworks have conceptualized stigma-related stress as a predictor of psychiatric disorders. We described profiles of psychiatric comorbidity among people with AUD and compared levels of perceived alcohol stigma across profiles. Methods Cross-sectional data were analyzed from a general population sample of U.S. adults with past-year DSM-5 AUD (n=3,368) from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, which was collected from 2001 to 2005. Empirically derived psychiatric comorbidity profiles were established with latent class analysis, and mean levels of perceived alcohol stigma were compared across the latent classes while adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and AUD severity. Results Four classes of psychiatric comorbidity emerged within this AUD sample, including those with: (i) high comorbidity, reflecting internalizing (i.e., mood and anxiety disorders) and externalizing (i.e., antisocial personality and drug use disorders) disorders; (ii) externalizing comorbidity; (iii) internalizing comorbidity; and (iv) no comorbidity. Perceived alcohol stigma was significantly higher in those with internalizing comorbidity (but not those with high comorbidity) as compared to those with no comorbidity or externalizing comorbidity. Conclusions Perceived stigma, as manifested by anticipations of social rejection and discrimination, may increase risk of internalizing psychiatric comorbidity. Alternatively, internalizing psychiatric comorbidity could sensitize affected individuals to perceive more negative attitudes toward them. Future research is needed to understand causal and bidirectional associations between alcohol stigma and psychiatric comorbidity.

AB  - Bias among faculty search committees has been considered a significant barrier to diversifying the professoriate. Given the traditional faculty hierarchy in academia, junior faculty search chairs may not have the positional power to challenge authority when confronted with bias or prejudice. Yet, search chairs are expected to ensure equitable practices and outcomes in their searches. In response to this quandary, through the lens of role theory, this study examined how faculty roles, within the hierarchical structure of tenure, affected equity during the hiring process. Findings revealed that the faculty hierarchy often superseded decision-making power given to search chairs if they were junior faculty, often leading to implicit support of biased hiring practices and the perpetuation of a culture of Whiteness. The study also indicated that search chairs' identities, values, and perceptions influenced how they operationalized diversity and equity in the search process, contributing to either diversity advocacy or support of the status quo. This qualitative inquiry makes an important contribution to the literature by exploring the ways in which faculty search chairs' status and social identities impact interpersonal committee dynamics and decisions about hiring diverse candidates.

AB  - This article is the first to report the nationwide public support rate for the death penalty in China. Using a national representative sample with 31,664 respondents, it shows that 68 per cent of China's citizens are for the death penalty, while 31 per cent are opposed to it. These numbers suggest that support for capital punishment in China, although strong, is much weaker than in some other East Asian jurisdictions and less than first assumed by commentators. However, contrary to previous notions that public support for the death penalty derives from uninformed popular prejudice, it is the elites in China - i.e. those who receive higher education - who are more in favour of the death penalty. Further empirical analyses suggest that this is not because of political ideology or fear of crime. Rather, the reason is likely that the elites know fewer, and sympathize less with, criminal offenders, who generally come from underprivileged groups. These findings challenge a range of prevailing perceptions of public attitudes to the death penalty in China, especially the culture explanation for the Chinese public's punitiveness, and have important policy implications.

AB  - Objective: Users of publicly funded voluntary HIV Counseling and Testing Centers (VCT C) in the Portuguese National Service have been found to have higher rates of HIV risk behavior than the general population, but data concerning the relationship between socio-demographic, behavioral, and cognitive variables, and Sexually Transmitted Infections (ST Is) in this specific population are limited. This study tests the impact of socio-demographic, behavioral and cognitive variables on ST Is in a sample of 168 users of VCT C. Methods: A cross-sectional study using structured questionnaires was conducted. Results: Being older, being gay or bisexual, and having more barriers towards safer sex (e.g., negative attitudes toward safer sex behavior) were associated with increased odds of having had a ST I diagnosis. We found significant differences between heterosexual and gay men for number of sexual partners, frequency of anal sex, exchanging sex for money or drugs, history of ST Is, AIDS knowledge, and risk beliefs about the partner, with gay men showing higher rates. Conclusions: ST Is education should target older, gay or bisexual individuals, and focus on information as well as on changing barriers towards safer sex and associated health beliefs.

AB  - The rise of cyberbullying has been of great concern for the general public. This study aims to explore public attitudes towards cyberbullying on Chinese social media. Cognition and emotion are important components of attitude, and this study innovatively used text analysis to extract the cognition and emotion of the posts. We used a web crawler to collect 53,526 posts related to cyberbullying in Chinese on Sina Weibo in a month, where emotions were detected using the software "Text Mind", a Chinese linguistic psychological text analysis system, and the content analysis was performed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model. Sentiment analysis showed the frequency of negative emotion words was the highest in the posts; the frequency of anger, anxiety, and sadness words decreased in turn. The topic model analysis identified three common topics about cyberbullying: critiques on cyberbullying and support for its victims, rational expressions of anger and celebrity worship, and calls for further control. In summary, this study quantitatively reveals the negative attitudes of the Chinese public toward cyberbullying and conveys specific public concerns via three common topics. This will help us to better understand the demands of the Chinese public so that targeted support can be proposed to curb cyberbullying.

AB  - Fear of crime (FoC) has dominated the political landscape over the last 20 years, with many crime policy developments during this period linked not to actual experiences of violence but to the fear of victimization. Fear of crime studies, in most cases, are conducted with populations that have only a passing, mediated knowledge of crime victimization. The research discussed in this article, in contrast, considers the impact of FoC with a highly victimized community, and establishes psychometric testing to validate an instrument to measure the impact of that fear (Fear of Heterosexism Scale [FoHS]). If FoC is related to experiences of crime as the existing research suggests, then victims of heterosexist prejudice, discrimination, and/or violence would be more likely to fear such incidents in the future. It was also predicted that participants who concealed their sexual and/or gender identity and had lower levels of social connectedness would experience higher levels of fear. The findings highlight the importance of contextual factors in FoH, and identify the critical roles that disclosure and social connectedness play in ameliorating the damaging effects of heterosexist victimization.

AB  - Aim: This study aimed to examine if participation in a required clinical course or elective fellowship pertaining to care of people with disabilities (PWD) had an impact on attitudes, knowledge and skills of nursing when compared with those with no clinical exposure to PWD. Background: Worldwide, over 1 billion people live with a disability, 93 million are children and an estimated 1-3% have an intellectual disability; 6.9 billion live with 'impairment producing health condition'. (WHO, 2011; Maulik et al., 2011; Roscigno, 2013 p.21). Barriers that contribute to health disparities in PWD are numerous; repeated themes of inadequate education of nursing students and faculty, deficient communication skills and negative attitudes are pervasive in the literature (Alshammari et al., 2018; Anyinam et al., 2019; Cervasio et al., 2010; Ilkhani et al., 2015; Lyon & Houser, 2018; Polikandrioti et al., 2020; Temple & Murdoch, 2012; Werner & Grayzman, 2011; WHO, 2011). Study design: A singular institution descriptive quantitative design using a purposive sample of student volunteers explored differences among pre-licensure senior nursing students which examined perceptions prior to and following a clinical experience specific to the care of PWD. Methods: Analyses of the change in scale scores by student type and experience working with PWD were evaluated using one-way ANOVA. Spearman correlations were used to test for an association between the change in scale scores and birth year. Results: There was no statistical evidence of differences between the elective fellowship (n = 9), clinical (n = 13), or control (n = 24) groups for change in attitudes (p = 0.1383), scenario 1 (p = 0.1996), or knowledge scores (p = 0.2854) (Table 3). Mean pre-and post-test scores for attitudes within the fellowship (69.78, 75.11) and clinical (67.62, 74) group increased more than the control (66.92, 68.29). There was evidence of a difference detected in the attitude questions, scenario 2 scores, with the fellowship and clinical groups showing a larger increase in scores compared with the control group (p < 0.0001) (Table 3). Also, the clinical group experienced a larger increase in skill scores compared with the control group (p = 0.0154). Conclusions: Results from pre-post surveys exemplify the need for disability specific undergraduate education. Students will experience confidence and competence in their transition to practice because at anytime, any-where, they will encounter someone with a disability. Further research is needed to determine the amount and type of education that translates to quality care of PWD.

AB  - Aim Today, humanity is living through the third serious coronavirus outbreak in less than 20 years, following SARS in 2002-2003 and MERS in 2012. While the final cost on human lives and world economy remains unpredictable, the timely identification of a suitable treatment and the development of an effective vaccine remain a significant challenge and will still require time. The aim of this study is to show that the global collective effort to control the coronavirus pandemic (Covid 19) should also consider alternative therapeutic methods, and national health systems should quickly endorse the validity of proven homeopathic treatments in this war against coronavirus disease. Subject and methods With the help of mathematics, we will show that the fundamental therapeutic law on which homeopathy is founded can be proved. Results The mathematical proof of the law of similarity justifies perfectly the use of ultra - high diluted succussed solution products as major tools in the daily practices of homeopathy. Conclusion It is now time to end prejudice and adopt in this fight against Covid-19 alternative therapeutic techniques and practices that historically have proven effective in corresponding situations.

AB  - From 1974 to 1984, Democrat Lilly Fong (1925-2002) served on the Nevada Board of Regents, the first Chinese American woman to win an election in Nevada and to hold that position. Fong laid the foundation for Republican Cheryl Lau (b. 1944) to be elected as Nevada's secretary of state (19911994), the first Asian American to hold a major statewide office in Nevada. This study focuses on how and why these women emerged from the shadows into Nevada politics and suggests why they failed in later attempts to win an office. As second- and later-generation Chinese American women, they shared the strong Chinese cultural traditions, beliefs, and prejudices and were products of the changing role of education for women and the emergence of women in Chinese and Chinese American public life. They also were affected by the women's movement in the United States and the Chinese emphasis on education, which led them both to advanced degrees and teaching. Gender and racial discrimination, anti-Chinese legislation and attitudes, and history and cultural traditions, especially the belief that women should be confined to domestic activities, were among the many barriers they had to overcome. They became active at a time when Chinese American political organizations became more influential and widespread, especially in cities with large Chinatowns. They, like many of their generation, had historical role models and contemporary ones, including Democrats Patsy Mink (1927-2002) of Hawaii and March Fong Eu (1922-2017) of California (to name just two). They shared similar backgrounds, including parents who were active in the community, the financial support of their husbands, a concern for U.S.-China relations, and, from time to time, their appeal to the mainstream community. They both believed in the Confucian adage that "education is the equalizer of mankind." What they both lacked in their later campaign efforts were mentoring on tactics and the ability to quickly challenge negative media publicized by their opponents. They needed strong pan-Asian support, but, until 2000, Nevada had a small Asian American Pacific Islander (AAPI) population. They also needed broader support among voters of other races and ethnicities. Both women, who had female challengers at one point or another, lost to EuroAmerican women, which suggests that gender was not the major factor in those reelection failures. They had responded to the call for AAPI involvement in politics and, by their efforts, laid the foundations for recent successes of other AAPI women in Nevada and the West.

AB  - This study set out to examine native Dutch adolescents' tolerance (N = 1,139) of Muslim immigrants in relation to the endorsement of assimilation, national identification, and contact with ethnic minority peers. The focus was on two dimensions of tolerance: the acceptance of practices by Muslim actors, and Muslims persuading co-believers to engage in the same practices. Tolerance was found to be higher for the practices than for persuading others. Higher endorsement of assimilation was related to lower levels of tolerance, and this relation was stronger for higher compared to lower national identifiers. Assimilation mediated the positive relationship between intergroup contact and tolerance. These effects did not differ for the two dimensions of tolerance. The implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Many people practiced COVID-19-related safety measures in the first year of the pandemic, but Republicans were less likely to engage in behaviors such as wearing masks or face coverings than Democrats, suggesting radical disparities in health practices split along political fault lines. We developed an "intervention tournament" which aimed to identify the framings that would promote mask wearing among a representative sample of Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. from Oct 14, 2020, to Jan 14, 2021 (N = 4931). Seven different conditions reflecting different moral values and factors specific to COVID-19-including protection from harm (self), protection from harm (community), patriotic duty, purity, reviving the economy, threat, and scientific evidence-were implemented to identify which framings would "win" in terms of promoting mask wearing compared to a baseline condition. We found that Republicans had significantly more negative attitudes toward masks, lower intentions to wear them, and were less likely to sign or share pledges on social media than Democrats, which was partially mediated by Republicans, compared to Democrats, perceiving that the threat of COVID-19 was lower. None of our framing conditions significantly affected Republicans' or Democrats' attitudes, intentions, or behaviors compared to the baseline condition, illustrating the difficulty in overcoming the strength of political polarization during COVID-19.

AB  - How can we explain the strange behavior of quantum and relativistic entities? Why do they behave in ways that defy our intuition about how physical entities should behave, considering our ordinary experience of the world around us? In this article, we address these questions by showing that the comportment of quantum and relativistic entities is not that strange after all, if we only consider what their nature might possibly be: not an objectual one, but a conceptual one. This not in the sense that quantum and relativistic entities would be human concepts, but in the sense that they would share with the latter a same conceptual nature, similarly to how electromagnetic and sound waves, although very different entities, can share a same undulatory nature. When this hypothesis is adopted, i.e., when a conceptuality interpretation about the deep nature of physical entities is taken seriously, many of the interpretational difficulties disappear and our physical world is back making sense, though our view of it becomes radically different from what our classical prejudice made us believe in the first place.

AB  - Objective To assess awareness and attitudes towards engaging in advance care planning (ACP) and their relationship with demographic, socioeconomic and religiosity factors among Lebanese middle-aged to older-aged adults in primary care. Design A cross-sectional survey study. Setting Tertiary referral hospital in Beirut, Lebanon. Participants A total of 215 middle-aged to older-aged adults. Results Out of 215 participants, 18.6% of participants knew about ACP; 94% favoured truth-telling; 87.4% favoured healthcare autonomy; 77.2% favoured documenting their own health values and preferences; and 29.3% were willing to undergo life-prolonging interventions. Among participants who were aware of ACP, 67.5% preferred ACP documentation and 85% had negative attitudes towards life-sustaining interventions. Women were more aware about ACP than men. Those who were willing to undergo life-prolonging interventions were found to be men and had higher religiosity scores. Conclusion Large deficit in ACP awareness was evident despite the high preference for healthcare autonomy. Medical and public health efforts should strive to enhance patients' ACP awareness and engagement in ACP while considering factors relevant to gender, culture and religiosity.

AB  - This paper describes a classroom demonstration that showcases how pre-existing beliefs (e.g., stereotypes) influence problem-solving. Across four studies, participants solved riddles with gender stereotype-consistent (e.g. doctor is male) or gender stereotype-inconsistent (e.g., doctor is female; barber is female) solutions. Solve time, perceived difficulty, and perceptions of the demonstration and how it influenced learning were measured. Studies 3 and 4 extended Studies 1 and 2 by measuring objective learning through a quiz on gender stereotypes and bias. Results indicate that students solved the stereotype-inconsistent riddles slower than stereotype-consistent riddles. Stereotype-inconsistent riddles were rated as more difficult to solve than stereotype-consistent riddles. Subjectively, participants perceived the demonstration to be an effective tool, enhancing their knowledge about gender stereotypes. Objectively, participants performed better on the quiz when they solved stereotype-inconsistent riddles than stereotype-consistent riddles. These findings suggest that using stereotype-inconsistent riddles in class can help understanding about gender stereotypes and bias.

AB  - Objectives: The study examined how clinicians described their patients in relation to their practices of contraceptive counseling. Study design: This qualitative study involved individual interviews with 15 clinicians working in obstetrics and gynecology in South Carolina about their approaches to contraceptive counseling. We analyzed the data using a combination of deductive and inductive approaches. Results: Clinicians attributed challenges of working with diverse patient populations to patients' race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and age. Clinicians often interpreted patient concerns about or refusal to use effective contraceptive methods as a problem with patients themselves. When clinicians described patients in disparaging ways, they often focused on adolescent patients. Conclusion: Bias informed by structural inequalities and power relations influences how clinicians perceive their patients and approach counseling them about contraception. Such practices may limit patients' informed decision-making and autonomy regarding initiating or continuing contraceptive use. Implications: Greater attention to redressing structural inequalities and power relations that inform provider bias in the context of contraceptive counseling is needed to ensure patients receive personcentered healthcare free from prejudice and discrimination. Fostering structural competency among clinicians may improve provider-patient interactions and support patients' reproductive autonomy. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study adopted a two (author: algorithm or journalist) by two (notification of author: real or inverse) between subject design to investigate how the public and journalists perceive the quality of algorithms written articles compared with human journalist's work. Findings showed that both the public and journalists' evaluations were varied by the manipulation of author notification. That is, the public gave higher scores to the algorithm's work when it was notified as the real author, but they gave lower scores to the algorithm's work when the author was notified as a journalist. It confirmed the public's negative attitude toward journalists' credibility and craving for new information and communication technology (ICT) products/services in Korea. Based on journalists' resistance to change and innovation and the theory of prejudice, it was expected that journalists would be favorable to another journalist's work and unfavorable to an algorithm's work. However, contrary to the hypothetical expectation, journalists also gave higher scores to an algorithm's work and lower scores to a journalist's work. Implications relating to the intrusion of algorithm-written articles into journalism were discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and objectives: The limitations caused by the process of aging and the prevalence of chronic diseases contribute to reduced performance in physical, psychological, and social areas of life in older people. The use of mobile phones as easily accessible portable tools with a high performance is associated with an increased health literacy, self-care, and independence in older people. The present study was conducted to determine older people's attitudes toward the use of mobile phones and the barriers to their use.
   Materials and methods: The present descriptive study was conducted on a sample population of 328 individuals older than 60 years presenting to health centers across cities in west Mazandaran, Iran. The data collection tools used included a mobile phone use checklist, a questionnaire on older people's attitude toward the use of mobile phones, and a questionnaire on the barriers to the use of mobile phones. The reliability and validity of these questionnaires were confirmed by the researchers. The data obtained were recorded and then analyzed using SPSS. The level of statistical significance was set at P<0.05.
   Results: According to the results, 80% of the older people had regular mobile phones and 20% had smartphones. In 95% of the male and 80% of the female participants, the greatest use of mobile phones pertained to making phone calls. A total of 5% of the male and 2% of the female participants used the Internet in their mobile phones. A total of 44% of the female and 42.80% of the male participants had poor attitudes (score from 0 to 40) toward mobile phone use. As for the different dimensions of the attitude toward mobile phone use, the highest score obtained by the female participants (71.66%) pertained to the psychoemotional dimension and the highest score in the male participants (72.85%) to the instrumental dimension. The results also revealed the lack of knowledge of English as the greatest barrier to mobile phone use in both sexes. There was a significant relationship between sex and the attitude toward mobile phone use in all the three dimensions examined, the sociocultural, psychoemotional, and instrumental.
   Discussion and conclusion: The results of the study revealed that the majority of older people have negative attitudes toward the use of mobile phones as a teaching aid, although they used them for performing daily tasks. Promoting this age group's knowledge about the different mobile phone applications available to help them and increasing their ability to learn the use of these applications through the mass media, family members, and peer groups can help improve older people's attitudes toward the use of mobile phones and thus increase their use of these devices.

AB  - A growing amount of research uses the Minority Stress Model [Meyer, Psychological Bulletin, 129(5), 674-697 (2003). 10.1037/0033-2909.129.5.674] to explore the effects of discrimination on the well-being of transgender people. Most of this research focuses on the effects of overt discrimination and the anticipation of discrimination, but few studies have explored the internal aspect of minority stress for transgender people. This may be because current measurement options are limited. To address this oversight, our study developed the Scale of Internalized Trans Oppression (SITO). The SITO moves beyond current measures of internalized prejudice to, instead, assess for the ubiquitous effects of internalized oppression. Results from our exploratory factor analysis provide preliminary evidence of a four-factor structure. Reliability analyses have established high internal consistency for both the Self-Doubt from Oppression subscale and Openness about Gender Identity subscale. Additionally, the Horizontal Hostility from Oppression subscale and the Fortitude subscale showed good internal consistency. Finally, research and clinical implications are discussed for this preliminary version of the SITO.

AB  - Greece has the highest smoking prevalence in the European Union, with adolescents having high levels of exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS). In July 2009, national smokefree legislation was implemented in Greece. This study explored Greek young people's attitudes to smoking, SHS and the impending legislation. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were undertaken with 11 groups of 14- to 16-year-old smokers and non-smokers in May and June 2009. Participants described social worlds in which smoking and exposure to SHS were viewed as normal and acceptable. There was little awareness of the health risks of SHS. Smoking was perceived to be both an inherent part of socializing and highly addictive. The 'right' to smoke in public places was thus viewed as greater than that of not being exposed to SHS. There was limited awareness of the impending smokefree legislation. Participants drew on their experience of previous legislation, the perceived rebellious Greek character, and their cynicism about the government in concluding that the legislation would be ineffective. The perceived social norms around smoking and SHS combined with a poor understanding of the health risks and negative attitudes about the impending legislation help to explain the subsequent limited impact of the Greek smokefree legislation.

AB  - The present study examined whether and to what degree empathy increased in adolescents who participated in a high-intensity writing program over the course of a year. Data for this study came from writing samples of a randomly selected group of middle-grade students (n = 61) collected at three different time points to answer whether: 1) it was possible to reliably and systematically measure empathy as a complex construct that included both affective and cognitive elements, and 2) empathy increased over one year in an intensive writing practice program. The findings showed statistically significant increases in various aspects of empathy such as reasoning, including multiple perspectives, expressing emotion, and proposals for action, and statistically significant increases in empathy as a latent construct. The high-intensity writing program, an essential component of the school's curriculum, served as an educational tool and provided a showcase for the role of deliberate practice in skill building.

AB  - Objective: To understand the process by which an obese woman decides to have bariatric surgery. Method: A qualitative survey with a social phenomenology approach, carried out in 2012, with 12 women, using the phenomenological interview. Results: A woman bases the decision to have the surgery on: the inappropriateness of her eating habits; a physical appearance that is incompatible with an appearance that is standardized by society; the social prejudice that she has to live with; the limitations imposed by obesity; and her lack of success with previous attempts to lose weight. Outcomes that she hopes for from the decision to have the surgery include: restoring her health; achieving social inclusion; and entering the labor market. Conclusion: This study allows one to reflect that prescriptive actions do not give a satisfactory response to a complexity of the subjective questions involved in the decision to have surgery for obesity. For this, what is called for is a program of work based on an interdisciplinary approach, and training that gives value to the bio-psycho-social aspects involved in a decision in favor of surgical treatment.

AB  - People living with mental illnesses and their families may conceal their conditions to avoid prejudice and discrimination. Stigma often prevents people from receiving adequate health care and other social support services which could exacerbate social and health consequences such as unemployment, homelessness, substance use, and compulsory hospitalization. In this paper, we discuss social contact as a promising anti-stigma strategy for enhancing social interactions among people with mental illnesses, their families, and those without mental illnesses. In particularly, we consider next steps for an approach that works to reduce the stigma-related burden of mental illness. For social contact to be effective in reducing mental illness stigma, it requires broad social buy-in as well as implementation within care systems. Engagement with this approach can be driven through diverse contact-based education using collaborative efforts of society, academic institutions, policy-makers, health professionals, media, and governments. Ultimately, this work aims to consider the next steps in enacting social contact as an anti-stigma strategy through direct interventions and contact-based education. The success of this approach requires pragmatic public policies to support its implementation.

TI  - Attitudes Toward Borderline Personality Disorder: A Survey of 706 Mental Health Clinicians
T2  - CNS SPECTRUMS
LA  - English
AB  - Objective: We sought to determine attitudes toward patients with borderline personality disorder (BPD) among mental health clinicians at nine academic centers in the United States.
   Methods: A self-report questionnaire was distributed to 706 mental health clinicians, including psychiatrists, psychiatry residents, social workers, nurses, and psychologists.
   Results: The study showed that most clinicians consider BPD a valid diagnosis, although nearly half reported that they preferred to avoid these patients. The clinician's occupational subgroup was significantly related to attitude. Staff nurses had the lowest self-ratings on overall caring attitudes, while social workers had the highest. Social workers and psychiatrists had the highest ratings on treatment optimism. Social workers and psychologists were most optimistic about psychotherapy effectiveness, while psychiatrists were most optimistic about medication effectiveness. Staff nurses had the lowest self-ratings on empathy toward patients with BPD and treatment optimism.
   Discussion: Negative attitudes persist among clinicians toward BPD, but differ among occupational subgroups. Overall, caring attitudes, empathy, and treatment optimism were all higher among care providers who had cared for a greater number of BPD patients in the past 12 months.
   Conclusion: These findings hold important implications for clinician education and coordination of care for patients with BPD.

AB  - This paper introduces the concept of tonal gravity through a multimodal analysis of a YouTube video to demonstrate how multimodality is key to the construction of Rule Britannia as a sectarian song. The analysis focuses upon the multimodal semiotics of social distance which has been a key concept in sociological and anthropological traditions in recent times. This concept offers a means to understand the social semiotic relationship between Self and Other in multimodal discourse. Following previous work in social semiotics and music studies which examine how visual composition, music and the voice have constructed social distance or expressions of intimacy, I introduce the concept of tonal gravity which extends the metaphors of semiotic space in previous work in the musical mode, to account for a fuller understanding of how music helps narrate the multimodal Self and Other. This is introduced via a close multimodal analysis of Rule Britannia as a Rangers Football fan video which is only transformed into a sectarian text through multimodal collocation where different semiotic resources in various modes act in combination to produce a dominant Self actively prejudiced against a low Other.

AB  - Views of specific older adults may differ substantially from views of older adults in general, and such views may influence preconceived notions of aging that students bring into the classroom. Using an in-class activity, the authors tested the hypothesis that grandparents, about whom we know more individuated information, would be characterized by different, and more positive, descriptors than older adults. Following verbal prompts, undergraduates (N = 98) listed terms describing older adults and grandparents. Conventional and directed content analysis with a multistage coding scheme was employed. Results revealed that descriptors were primarily negative (e.g., sick) and emphasized physical characteristics (e.g., wrinkly) for older adults but were more positive (e.g., sweet) and highlighted personality characteristics (e.g., kind) for grandparents. Although mentioned less often for grandparents, health-related and physical characteristics were predominantly negative for both groups. This word-listing exercise highlighted heterogeneity in views of older adults and underscored the value of studying gerontology.

AB  - To investigate children's understanding of intergroup transgressions, children (3-8years, N=84) evaluated moral and conventional transgressions that occurred among members of the same gender group (ingroup) or members of different gender groups (outgroup). All participants judged moral transgressions to be more wrong than conventional transgressions. However, when asked to make a judgment after being told an authority figure did not see the transgression, younger participants still judged that moral violations were less acceptable than conventional transgressions, but judged both moral and conventional transgressions with an outgroup victim as more acceptable than the corresponding transgressions with an ingroup victim. Older children did not demonstrate the same ingroup bias; rather they focused only on the domain of the transgressions. The results demonstrate the impact intergroup information has on children's evaluations about both moral and conventional transgressions.

AB  - Purpose: To compare adults who stutter with and without support group experience on measures of self-esteem, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, self-stigma, perceived stuttering severity, perceived origin and future course of stuttering, and importance of fluency.
   Method: Participants were 279 adults who stutter recruited from the National Stuttering Association and Board Recognized Specialists in Fluency Disorders. Participants completed a Web-based survey comprised of various measures of well-being including the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, a measure of perceived stuttering severity, the Self-Stigma of Stuttering Scale, and other stuttering-related questions.
   Results: Participants with support group experience as a whole demonstrated lower internalized stigma, were more likely to believe that they would stutter for the rest of their lives, and less likely to perceive production of fluent speech as being highly or moderately important when talking to other people, compared to participants with no support group experience. Individuals who joined support groups to help others feel better about themselves reported higher self-esteem, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, and lower internalized stigma and perceived stuttering severity, compared to participants with no support group experience. Participants who stutter as an overall group demonstrated similar levels of self-esteem, higher self-efficacy, and lower life satisfaction compared to averages from normative data for adults who do not stutter.
   Conclusions: Findings support the notion that self-help support groups limit internalization of negative attitudes about the self, and that focusing on helping others feel better in a support group context is linked to higher levels of psychological well-being.
   Educational objectives: At the end of this activity the reader will be able to: (a) describe the potential psychological benefits of stuttering self-help support groups for people who stutter, (b) contrast between important aspects of well-being including self-esteem self-efficacy, and life satisfaction, (c) summarize differences in self-esteem, self-efficacy, life satisfaction, self-stigma, perceived stuttering severity, and perceptions of stuttering between adults who stutter with and without support group experience, (d) summarize differences in self-esteem, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction between adults who stutter and normative data for adults who do not stutter.

AB  - Posting countermessages is commonly used as a strategy to combat false rumors spreading online. The effectiveness of countermessage exposure has been investigated in past studies, but little is known about its repercussions. The aim of this study was to contribute to the understanding of rumor control by investigating the factors impacting the effectiveness of countermessage exposure. A total of 164 participants were asked to judge the believability of rumor and factual tweets before and after countermessage exposure in a web-based experiment. Two forms of countermessage were compared to examine the effects of countermessages on belief change in the target tweets. One was subjective countermessages based on personal experiences, and the other was objective countermessages based on evidence. The results showed that objective countermessages reduced belief in rumor tweets, whereas subjective countermessages strengthened false beliefs. In addition, the half of the participants who were exposed to objective countermessages randomly mixed with subjective countermessages formed negative attitudes not only toward the rumor tweets but also toward the factual tweets. The results also showed gender differences in response to countermessage exposure; women tended to be more susceptible to countermessages and changed their beliefs regarding the target tweets negatively after the exposure. We discuss the practical implications of the results associated with the adverse effects of countermessage exposure.

AB  - Internet-based platforms are competing fiercely in the Chinese market by fostering an omni-channel shopping ecosystem. Companies have grouped under two giants, Alibaba and Tencent, leading to one-to-many competition dynamics in the Chinese market. In the midst of this competition, the three-year-old Pinduoduo has gained attention with its fast growth, positioning itself as the third biggest e-commerce platform in China with 19.4% of the market share. Pinduoduo has targeted a niche market made up of cheap products, low-income workers, and small business owners in small cities. Recently, however, many Pinduoduo users have returned to their former platforms, due to the proliferation of fake and low-quality products on the platform. Our study aims to investigate the reasons that prompted users to return to other platforms after their Pinduoduo experience. We conducted in-depth interviews to understand this phenomenon and built a research model based on risk theory and the customer resistance to change (CRC) framework. Results suggest that switching costs and relative attractiveness influence CRC, while risk perceptions form negative attitudes toward CRC, which finally result in negative word of mouth. Finally, theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Alternative fuel vehicles, such as battery electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, support the imperative to decarbonise the transport sector, but are not yet at a stage in their development where they can successfully compete with conventional fuel vehicles. This paper examines the influence of knowledge and persuasion on the decision to adopt or reject alternative fuel vehicles, a novel and original application of Rogers' Theory of Diffusion of Innovations. A household questionnaire survey was undertaken with respondents in the Sutton Coldfield suburb of the United Kingdom city of Birmingham. This suburb was previously identified as having a strong spatial cluster of potential early adopters of alternative fuel vehicles. The survey results provide some useful empirical insights around the issues pertaining to the wider adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, even though the data is a bit dated as the survey was conducted in 2013. It is confirmed that respondents have limited knowledge of alternative fuel vehicles and perceptions have led to the development of negative attitudes towards them. The reasons largely relate to three problems: purchase price, limited range and poor infrastructure availability. Most respondents passively rejected alternative fuel vehicles, which confirms that a concerted effort is required to inform the general public about the benefits alternative fuel vehicles.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore the knowledge, attitudes and behaviours of people in mid-life towards cancer prevention. The study was undertaken in Northern Ireland between 2003 and 2007. This was a mixed methods study using a sequential exploratory design. The theoretical framework was the Theory of Planned Behaviour and the methodology was based on Sutton's framework. There were three methodological stages in the study using focus groups, a large cross-sectional survey and a volunteer sample survey. This paper focuses on the findings of the cross-sectional survey relating to the attitudes of people in mid-life towards cancer and cancer prevention. Findings are considered in relation to the respondents' level of knowledge, age, gender, level of educational attainment and socio-economic status. Evidence from this study shows that attitudes towards cancer and cancer prevention are associated significantly with level of knowledge about cancer, gender, socio-economic status and level of educational attainment. In conclusion, the evidence from this study shows that men, those with a lower level of education, those with a lower level of knowledge and those in a lower socio-economic group were more likely to hold negative attitudes about cancer and cancer prevention.

AB  - To better understand doping-related attitude change, it is important to consider not only the amount of thinking (i.e., elaboration) done by message recipients, but also the favorability of their thoughts in response to the proposal, as well as the perceived validity in their thoughts. The main goal of the present study was to analyze the effects of a meta-cognitive process (i.e., thought validation) on attitudes related to doping. Thus, we randomly assigned participants to read a message either against or in favor of legalising several doping behaviors. Participants listed their thoughts regarding the proposal and indicated the perceived validity in their thoughts, then reported their attitudes. As hypothesised, the message against legalisation elicited more unfavorable thoughts and attitudes than the message in favor of legalisation. Most relevantly, the effects of the message direction on attitudes were greater for participants with higher (vs. lower) levels of thought validity. Furthermore, consistent with the thought validation process, results revealed that thought favorability was a better predictor of attitudes for participants with higher (vs. lower) perceived thought validity, indicating that perceiving one's thoughts as valid plays an important role in persuasion. These findings provide novel insights for research and interventions regarding doping in sports.

TI  - The Operatic Voice of Leoni the Jew: Between the Synagogue and the Theater in Late Georgian Britain
T2  - JOURNAL OF BRITISH STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - Michael Leoni, a leading singer in late eighteenth-century London, became famous for his role in Richard Brinsley Sheridan's anti-Jewish opera The Duenna. He was discovered, however, at the Jewish synagogue, where his singing enthralled non-Jews in the early 1770s. Tracing Leoni's public reception, this article argues that the performative effect of his singing had a multifaceted relation to his audience's psychology of prejudice, serving to both reiterate and reconfigure a variety of preconceptions regarding the Jews. Leoni's intervention through operatic singing was particularly significant--a powerful, bodily manifestation that was capable of transforming listeners while exhibiting the deep acculturation of the singer himself. The ambivalence triggered by his performances would go on to define the public reception of other Jewish singers, particularly that of Leoni's protege, John Braham, Britain's leading tenor in the early nineteenth century. Ultimately, the experience of these Jews' performances could not be easily deconstructed, as the Jewish performers' voices were emanating from within written, sometimes canonical, musical works. This representational impasse gave rise to a public discourse intent on deciphering their Jewishness, raising questions of interpretation, intention, and confession.

AB  - Of late, China has made significant strides in wastewater management. However, there is substantial variation in wastewater management across different regions in China. This study focuses on public attention, which is seldom discussed as an influencing factor of wastewater treatment, although it has increased in recent years due to the rapid development of Internet technology. Herein we verify that not only public attention related to wastewater but also wastewater treatment performance among provinces has stable spatial correlations. A Spatial Durbin model is used to investigate the impact of public attention on wastewater treatment. The results show that, for the local province, public attention will help improve wastewater treatment by promoting government to enact laws and regulations. At the same time, public attention in the local province will improve the wastewater treatment of its surrounding provinces, even if there are no regulations or public attention there. Therefore, the public could be a very effective supervisor of environmental issues. In view of these results, policy recommendations are proposed, which can be applied to improve China's wastewater treatment. In the future research, exploring the different impacts of the public's positive and negative attitudes will be conductive to evaluate environmental management in great detail.

AB  - Sexual dysfunction is a common concern among individuals with physical disabilities but often unaddressed by health care professionals, with many reporting lack of sufficient training and perceived lack of competence. The present study sought to examine educational factors and how they relate to health professions students' attitudes around the sexual health needs of individuals with physical disabilities. This was part of a larger study of 479 health professions students from training programs in the Southeast who completed a survey of attitudes and beliefs about sexual health topics. Significant differences were found across student field on the main outcome measure (attitudes related to sexual health of patients with disability). Differences were also found in quantity and quality of sexual health education across student field, with psychology students reporting the lowest quantity and quality of education. Item analysis of the main outcome measure revealed significant differences across student field on most items, with dentistry students generally reporting the most negative attitudes. Implications for health care providers working with patients with physical disabilities are discussed, and suggestions for implementing sexual health curriculum in training programs are provided.

AB  - Transgender people experience systematic oppression due to societal endorsement of binary notions of gender. As a result, they are at risk for self-stigmatization via the internalization of negative attitudes about being transgender. Thus, researchers need instruments to assess the multilayered nature of transgender identity and its role in the experience of mental health and wellbeing. This study evaluated the psychometric characteristics of the Transgender Identity Survey (TIS) in an Italian sample of 149 transgender people. The TIS assesses levels of pride, shame, alienation, and passing in transgender populations, providing researchers and clinicians with an instrument that can evaluate both positive aspects of transgender identity and internalized transphobia. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that the original four-factor model had adequate fit to the data obtained from the Italian sample, with the exception of one item. Both convergent and predictive validity were assessed and partially confirmed, indicating that the TIS is significantly correlated with some of the enacted stigma and mental health outcome measures (perceived stress, depression, and anxiety). This study provides both clinicians and researchers with a tool to assess positive and negative aspects of identity in transgender populations.

AB  - Superordinate identities, such as identification with all humanity (IWAH), may be considered the result of situational activation or as individual differences that can be measured using psychometric scales. Our research originates from this second approach. Why do some people feel connected only to narrow social groups like family and friends, while the social identifications of others cross boundaries, extending to people all over the world? We examined the possible psychological characteristics underlying this phenomenon in two cross-sectional studies (N = 334, N = 311). A structural model of the effects of openness to experience, empathy (empathic concern and perspective taking), and universalism-tolerance, mediated by right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and ethnocentrism upon IWAH is presented and tested. Results showed that openness to experience, empathy, and universalism-tolerance directly enhanced identification with all humanity. RWA, SDO and ethnocentrism were their partial negative mediators. SDO and ethnocentrism also directly reduced IWAH. These studies offer possible reasons for individual differences in levels of global human identification, by considering its psychological background.

AB  - Brazilian Standard ABNT NBR7190:1997 for timber structures design, adopts a first degree equation to describe the influence of wood moisture content. Periodically, when necessary, the referred standard is revised in order to analyze inconsistencies and to adopt considerations according new realities verified. So, the present paper aims to examine the adequacy of its equation which corrects to 12% of moisture the values of rigidity properties obtained on experimental tests. To quantify the moisture influence on modulus of elasticity, it was applied tests of compression parallel to the grain for six specimens of different strength classes, considering nominal moisture of 12; 20; 25; 30%. As results, modulus of elasticity in the moisture range 25-30% showed statistically equivalents, and was obtained a first degree equation to correlate the studied variables which leads to statically equivalent estimations when compared with results by ABNT NBR7190:1997 equation. However, it was indicated to maintain the current expression for the next text of the referred document review, without prejudice to statistical significance of the estimates.

AB  - Underground workplaces (UWS) are increasingly being recognised as a sustainable solution to concerns regarding lack of space facing megacities. UWS can multiply available space by reducing urban sprawl thereby improving quality of life in cities. However, developing workplaces that respond to the needs and preferences of occupants will be a crucial factor in determining the success of this concept. We examine the experiences of existing full-time employees of a large underground facility in North America and analyse how these are related to company policies and other organisational factors. From in-depth interviews of 73 participants, three predominant themes emerged from the analyses: environmental effects (e.g. lack of sunlight), design (e.g. the unique working environment), and organisational factors and social dynamics (e.g. policies regarding breaks). We discuss these themes in relation with interventions that may improve employee comfort and retention and suggest that many factors are within organisational control. Practitioner Summary:Underground workplaces are a sustainable solution to lack of urban space. However, developing effective workplaces is crucial to their success. We examine the experiences of existing employees of an underground facility in North America. We suggest that most negative attitudes towards underground spaces can be mitigated through simple organisational interventions.

AB  - Adolescents' attitudes toward disadvantaged groups are surprisingly understudied. What we know from these few studies is that adolescents' attitudes tend to become more favorable over time and that adolescent girls display more favorable attitudes than do adolescent boys. However, researchers have not offered explanations for why these effects occur. We proposed that changes in social-cognitive abilities that accompany adolescent development increase perspective taking and that the increased perspective taking facilitates more favorable attitudes toward disadvantaged groups. Because girls develop social-cognitive abilities earlier than boys, girls should show greater perspective taking and thus more positive attitudes toward disadvantaged groups than should boys. Importantly, we propose that these more positive attitudes are explained better by perspective taking than by gender. Participants were late adolescents (n = 803, 53.3 % female, ages 15-19) from high schools in north-central Florida (United States) participating in an ongoing, multi-wave study. Participants completed a measure of perspective-taking and reported their attitudes toward three disadvantaged groups (Black, gay, and poor people) during their third year of high school and, again, 6 months later during their fourth year of high school. Our findings provided strong support for our theorizing. Girls generally reported warmer attitudes than did boys toward disadvantaged groups, with the gender differences in warmth tending to diminish across time. Similarly, girls were higher than boys in perspective-taking abilities at both time points, although boys increased over time whereas girls did not. Crucially, perspective taking mediated observed gender differences in attitudes, suggesting that perspective taking is a mechanism for improving attitudes toward disadvantaged groups during late adolescence.

AB  - When it comes to teacher attitudes towards teaching and learning, research relies heavily on explicit measures (e.g., questionnaires). These attitudes are generally conceptualized as constructivist and transmissive views on teaching and learning with constructivism often considered to be more desirable. In explicit measures, this can have drawbacks like socially desirable responding. It is for this reason that, in this study, we investigated implicit attitudes as well as explicit attitudes towards constructivism and transmission. N = 100 preservice teachers worked on a questionnaire and two Single-Target Implicit Association Tests (ST-IAT constructivism and ST-IAT transmission) before (T-1) and after (T-2) a single master's semester. One group (n = 50) did student teaching while a second group (n = 50) took master's courses. We evaluated preservice teachers' views on teaching at the end of their masters' studies. Participants agreed with transmission and constructivism (T-1) on both an explicit and implicit level. Implicit measures seem to exceed explicit measures in differentially assessing constructivist and transmissive views on teaching and learning. After student teaching (T-2), there was no overall effect of attitude development but changes in rank indicate that participants' implicit attitudes towards constructivism and transmission developed differently for each individual.

AB  - Objective. To examine how drug counselors with no prior training in pain management respond to their patients' reports of chronic pain.
   Design, Setting, Subjects, and Methods. We conducted individual interviews with 30 drug counselors in methadone maintenance treatment. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and systematically coded using the constant comparative method.
   Results. Participants identified counselor, patient, and logistical factors that serve as a barrier or facilitate their treatment of patients with chronic pain. Counselor barriers included lack of expertise in managing co-occurring chronic pain and opioid use disorder, complexity of patients' treatment needs, concerns about medication regimens, reliance on patient self-report, and absence of patient improvement. Counselor barriers facilitators included empathy, attending to small changes, and selfreflection. Counselors' perceptions of patientrelated barriers included prior negative interactions with medical providers, diminished social roles, attenuated motivation, and negative attitudes toward opioid use disorder. Logistical barriers included lack of appropriate pain management referrals, limited counselor time, and attenuated treatment adherence; a logistical facilitator was consulting with medical providers.
   Conclusions. Perceived barriers to treating patients with chronic noncancer pain are common among drug counselors. Addressing these barriers in drug counselor training and in methadone maintenance treatment programs may benefit both methadone-maintained patients with chronic pain and their providers.

AB  - Legal doctrine in common law jurisdictions reflects a concern that some types of evidence may lead to bias in jury decision making, and that prejudice can be driven by the emotional reactions of jurors to the evidence. The current study extends previous research by examining the synergistic influence of gruesome details and injury severity In a mock jury study, 240 first-year psychology students were assigned to one of two visual evidence conditions: neutral and gruesome photographs, and one of two injury severity conditions: moderate injury severity and high injury severity. Participants were further assigned to one of two information processing conditions in which they were instructed to process information in either the rational or experiential mode. The main findings were: (1) mock jurors who read about a more severely injured plaintiff were more sympathetic towards the plaintiff compared with mock jurors who read about a less severely injured plaintiff; (2) mock jurors exposed to gruesome photographs rated the defendant as significantly more negligent compared with mock jurors exposed to neutral photographs. Implications of these findings are that gruesome photographic evidence may bias jurors' perceptions of the responsibility of the plaintiff and defendant.

AB  - Aims: To determine factors associated with 'hypothetical willingness' to start insulin among people with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM).
   Methods: A quantitative cross-sectional study with insulin-naive T2DM patients at 23 primary care facilities in the Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality. Data collected included demographic and clinical data, willingness to start insulin, attitudes and barriers to insulin therapy. Factors associated with unwillingness to start insulin therapy were explored using a multivariable logistic regression model.
   Results: Of 468 T2DM study patients (mean age 57.2, SD = 11.3 years), more than half (51.9%) expressed unwillingness to starting insulin therapy. Unwillingness was associated with negative attitudes (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.12-1.55, p = 0.001) and reluctance (OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.27-1.57, p < 0.001) rather than age, sex, education or diabetes duration. The strongest reasons for patient unwillingness were injection anxieties, fear of needles, insufficient knowledge of insulin, feeling unable to cope with insulin and concerns about out-of-pocket costs.
   Conclusions: The prospect of insulin therapy disturbs patients' sense of self and their psychological wellbeing. The high prevalence of psychological insulin resistance among these T2DM patients needs to be addressed for effective diabetes management. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper explores the role of mediated intergroup contact in improving intergroup attitudes between Italian speakers and German speakers in South Tyrol, Italy. Specifically, we examine how German-language television consumption affects attitudes towards the German-speaking group among Italian-speaking youth. The data (N = 229) were collected among Italian-speaking secondary school students in 2011. As expected, the results indicated that more German TV use was associated with more positive attitudes toward German speakers. A cognitive mediator (intergroup understanding) had a greater influence than an affective one (intergroup anxiety) in mediating the effect of TV use on attitudes. The effect of TV use on attitudes was greater among those who had less personal intergroup contact, but there were no differences in the effects of television based on variations in the local ethnolinguistic vitality of the two groups. Findings and implications are discussed, and suggestions for future research are made.

AB  - Schizotypal personality traits (schizotypy) might be seen as on a continuum with schizophrenia. However, controversy remains with regard to whether this continuum is quasi-dimensional, applying only to people with schizophrenia and schizotypy, or fully dimensional, applying to all people. If the fully dimensional model is accurate, schizotypy could be described by the same personality theories as are applied to people in general. We examined the relationship between schizotypy and the five-factor model of personality (FFM), which is arguably the most established contemporary personality theory. When we assumed a hierarchic structure of schizotypy factors, we found that the FFM scales could explain schizotypy fairly well regardless of the questionnaires used, suggesting that schizotypy might represent a variation better understood by reference to typical dimensions of personality, though it might still indicate a predisposition to schizophrenia. This article discusses this conclusion in relation to each of the five personality factors. A perspective that situates schizophrenia on a continuum with general personality variations implies that this disorder constitutes a potential risk for everyone and, thus, helps to promote understanding and correct misunderstandings that contribute to prejudice.

KW  - Balkan region
KW  - COVID-19 pandemic
AB  - Background: Until recent times, healthcare specialists lagged behind other fields in terms of computer networks and software usage, partly because they were uncomfortable with information and communication technologies. The rapid development of personal wearables, their easier connections with smartphones and other similar devices, and the possibilities of online or cloud storage of personal medical data led to improvements of eHealth services in terms of ease of access and reduced costs of delivery.
   Subjects and methods: The current research aimed to fill a research gap regarding attitudes towards eHealth during the COVID-19 pandemic in three Balkan countries: Greece, Bulgaria, and Romania. A total number of 775 adult participants (healthcare professionals and students in the field) were contacted in the winter of 2020 and asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their eHealth attitudes.
   Results: The Greek participants had the most negative attitudes toward eHealth services. This may be due to forced use of eHealth applications during the pandemic crisis and the need for mastering the necessary technical skills to use them.
   Conclusions: It should be noted that in the scientific literature no research is found on this topic, therefore it is the first study aimed to assessing and comparing attitudes towards eHealth in these countries.

AB  - The current research examines how representations of a traumatic history influence contemporary intergroup attitudes. Specifically, we examine antisemitism in Hungary as a case example of how the need to defend the group's moral image motivates the assumption of a defensive representation of history a modification of the group's narrative with regards to its culpability in past atrocities committed against another group. Two studies examined the link between defensive representations of the Holocaust, nationalism, and antisemitism. In the first, correlational study (N =348), we found that Hungarian nationalism and antisemitism were associated, and that this association was significantly mediated by defensive representations of the Holocaust - high nationalism was associated with higher endorsement of defensive representations which in turn were associated with more antisemitism. Low nationalism was associated with greater acknowledgement of in-group responsibility for historical crimes which was associated with less antisemitism. These findingi were corroborated in an experimental study (N=165) which indicated that priming defensive representations of the Holocaust increased antisemitism, even when controlling for nationalism. Study 2 further showed, in a 2-step mediation model, that defensive representation primes increased secondary antisemitism, conspiratorial antisemitism, and negative attitudes towards Israel. We discuss the implications of defensive representations of history on contemporary intergroup relations. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article takes a comparative approach that looks at the rise of Japan and China during their ascendency and challenge to the hegemonic state within the international system, and the subsequent racial threat perception that both countries experienced. Engaging the English School of International Relations, it focuses particularly on the legacies of differentiation within international society. It contends that, given the English School's emphasis on the concept of international society that likens that relationship among states to a social one, it is fruitful to examine how social differentiation occurs within a domestic setting and to use that finding as analogous to international society. The article argues that racialised threat perception towards Japan and China heightened in tandem with their successive rises due to the challenges the two countries posed to the status and privileges of the dominant country-the USA-and which coincided with a US economic downturn and domestic crisis. This racially sensitive approach can provide at least one lens through which to understand the racial threat perception and contemporary relational dynamics between the two great powers: the USA versus the People's Republic of China.

AB  - Health disparities among sexual minority groups, particularly mental health disparities, are well-documented. Numerous studies have demonstrated heightened prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders among lesbian, gay, and bisexual groups as compared with heterosexuals. Some authors posit that these disparities are the result of the stress that prejudice and perceived discrimination can cause. The current study extends previous research by examining the associations between multiple types of discrimination, based on race or ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation, and past-year mental health disorders in a national sample of self-identified lesbian, gay, and bisexual women and men (n = 577). Findings suggest that different types of discrimination may be differentially associated with past-year mental health disorders. Notably, sexual orientation discrimination was associated with higher odds of a past-year disorder only in combination with other types of discrimination. These findings point to the complexity of the relationship between discrimination experiences and mental health, and suggest that further work is needed to better explicate the interplay among multiple marginalized identities, discrimination, and mental health.

AB  - Disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality among White, Black, and American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) men are attributable to differences in early detection screening. Determining how masculinity barriers influence CRC screening completion is critical for cancer prevention and control. To determine whether masculinity barriers to medical care are associated with lower rates of ever completing CRC screening, a survey-based study was employed from December 2020-January 2021 among 435 White, Black, and AIAN men (aged 45-75) who resided in the US. Logistic regression models were fit to four Masculinity Barriers to Medical Care subscales predicting ever completing CRC screening. For all men, being strong was associated with 54% decreased odds of CRC screening completion (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.94); each unit increase in negative attitudes toward medical professionals and exams decreased the odds of ever completing CRC screening by 57% (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.86). Black men who scored higher on negativity toward medical professionals and exams had decreased odds of ever screening. Consideration of masculinity in future population-based and intervention research is critical for increasing men's participation in CRC screening, with more salience for Black men.

AB  - The Roma constitute the largest ethnic minority in the European Region. The many policy initiatives designed over the past two decades to tackle their adverse social conditions in Central and South Eastern Europe, where the Roma population is concentrated, have had limited success. This paper reviews what is being done to improve the health and social situation of Roma communities in the Region and identifies factors that may limit the effectiveness of these policy initiatives. Strong political commitment, measures to overcome prejudices against Roma, inter-sectoral policy coordination, adequate budgets, evidence-based policies, and Roma involvement can be identified as key preconditions for improved health outcomes and well-being. However, developing a sound evidence-based approach to Roma inclusion requires removing obstacles to the collection of reliable data and improving analytical and evaluation capacity. Health policies seeking to reduce health inequalities for Roma people need to be aligned with education, economic, labour market, housing, environmental and territorial development policies and form part of comprehensive policy frameworks allowing for effective integration.

AB  - Despite its benefits for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), home-based care (HBC) may have negative effects on caregivers. Caregivers experience high levels of burden and may be targets of HIV-related prejudice and discrimination. In this cross-sectional survey of 358 caregivers from five hospices across KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, 49 (13.7%) caregivers personally experienced discrimination as a result of caring for PLWHA. One hundred and seventy (47.5%) marked one or more items on the HIV stigma scale. Eighty-eight percent had low to moderate levels of caregiver burden. People with higher level of burden and higher income were more likely to hold stigmatizing beliefs. Caregivers with the following characteristics: support from a nurse, support from community careworker, HIV stigmatizing beliefs, and personal experience of discrimination as result of caring for PLWHA and low caregiver burden, had more than twice the odds of wanting to care for another PLWA in the future. Overall, caregivers in HBC experience low level of severe caregiver burden. The support offered to caregivers from the hospice and relatively low levels of discrimination encourage expansion of HBC programs for PLWHA.

AB  - Introduction With the significant increase of women in dentistry, the profile of the dental professional has been altered. Aim To investigate the discourses of future dental surgeons, of both genders, from public and private universities of Curitiba, Parana, Brazil, to detect whether gender profile differences can influence training and intended future practice. Methods The problem is approached using a qualitative design, with the strategy of collective interviews in focus groups followed by a discourse analysis. Results Women choose dentistry mainly because they like working with people and want to have formal employment in the future. Male discourses show a desire for professional status, worthy business prospects, and the flexibility of being self-employed. The analysis of the university education process revealed that men desire learning that is more technical, besides knowledge on business management, whereas women still complain of current prejudices in the personal relationships that exist with teaching staff and colleagues. Conclusion The teaching process, based on the technique-driven biomedical model, has not reached an ideal standard for the female gender in terms of training, which would be a model based on empathy and good relationships with human beings.

AB  - Background
   Involuntary admission can be traumatic and is associated with negative attitudes that persist after the episode of illness has abated.
   Aims
   We aimed to prospectively assess satisfaction with care at the points of involuntary admission and symptomatic recovery, and identify their sociodemographic, clinical and service experience predictors.
   Method
   Levels of satisfaction with care, and clinical and sociodemographic variables were obtained from a representative cohort of 263 patients at the point of involuntary admission and from 155 of these patients 3 months after termination of the involuntary admission. Data were analysed with multiple linear regression modelling.
   Results
   Higher baseline awareness of illness (B = 0 .19 , P <0.001) and older age (B = 0.05, P = 0.001) were associated with more satisfaction with care at baseline and follow-up. Transition to greater satisfaction with care was associated with improvements in awareness of illness (B = 0 .13, P < 0.001) and in symptoms (B = 0.05, P= 0.02), as well as older age (B = 0.04, P = 0.01). Objective coercive experiences were not associated with variation in satisfaction with care.
   Conclusions
   There is wide variation in satisfaction with coercive care. Greater satisfaction with care is positively associated with clinical variables such as increased awareness of illness.

AB  - Despite global efforts to increase HIV test uptake among men who have sex with men (MSM), social stigma and negative attitudes toward homosexuality hinder the effectiveness of traditional test promotion campaigns. Increasing HIV test uptake requires greater understanding of the conditions that facilitate decisions to get tested. We conducted an online survey hosted by two of the most highly frequented MSM web portals in China. A generalised ordered logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine factors associated with HIV testing behaviour. Compared to men who had never tested for HIV, men who had tested in the past year were more likely to have never engaged in sex with women, have multiple male sex partners in the past 3 months and have disclosed their sexual orientation to others. MSM found testing at local Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (80.7%), gay men's community-based organisations (80.2%) and public hospitals (70.9%) to be acceptable, while saunas (50.5%) and gay bars (41.8%) were found to be unacceptable testing venues. Our study shows that MSM in China prefer to test at venues that guarantee confidentiality, quality and quick results. Our study also suggests that self-testing may be a feasible approach to increase test uptake.

AB  - The extension of welfare coverage to immigrants and their participation in welfare programmes has been a subject of concern in many countries. By applying the theory of social construction of target groups and a framework of stakeholder analysis, this article attempts to explain why migrants in the construction sector of China fail to participate despite the urban pension scheme aiming to expand its coverage. By analysing social construction and the interaction among the government, enterprises and migrants, this study suggests that migrants in the construction sector are considered a necessity for urban economic development but most migrants are low-skilled with limited education; thus, the policy is characterized by selectivity and inflexibility, which has feed-forward effects on both enterprises and individuals. On the one hand, enterprises select skilled technicians and management personnel to participate in urban pension schemes while compromising with most other construction workers to avoid contribution to the social insurance pool; on the other hand, most individual migrants also believe the unlikelihood of truly benefiting from the urban pension extension. This article suggests that local governments should change their stereotypes and negative attitudes toward construction workers to ensure that the objective of equity could be realized in policy design and implementation.

AB  - In a relatively short period of time, modern societies have been transformed by the ubiquitous uptake of advanced and portable mobile communication, computation, and sensors available on smartphones. Looking forward, it is anticipated that smartphones will have an increasingly important role in health management including the delivery of hearing healthcare and operation of hearing instruments. Objective: This paper provides a brief overview of the role of smartphones in audiologic rehabilitation and hearing research and reports on the findings of a survey assessing attitudes of audiologists towards smartphone integration in hearing healthcare. Design: A total of 258 audiologists working in the United States completed the 10-item survey. Results: The key finding from the survey is that practitioners generally expressed a high willingness to integrate smartphone technology in patient care. Counterintuitively, it was observed that clinicians with the least number of years of experience had relatively more negative attitudes toward smartphone integration in hearing healthcare than clinicians with comparatively more years of experience. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the attitudes of audiologists likely do not represent a barrier regarding smartphone integration in audiologic rehabilitation. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - People with Dementia (PwD) are frequently admitted in general hospitals. However, health care professionals have lack of dementia knowledge, negative attitudes toward dementia, and lack of confidence in caring those patients. The aim of this study is to develop, implement and evaluate a dementia staff training program in Greek general hospitals. It was a repeated-measures research design. Fourteen (14) two-day workshops were conducted, consisting of six targeted and interactive modules. Staff members (N = 242) attended the program and were assessed according to (1) individual performance: questionnaires about attitudes towards dementia, confidence in care, knowledge about dementia and anxiety before, immediately after the training and three months later, (2) an overall training evaluation immediately after the training and (3) an evaluation of training implementation three months later. Positive attitudes towards dementia, improvement of confidence in care and decrease of feeling of anxiety as a trait, were sustained over time. Knowledge about dementia also increased after the training and sustained, with, however, a slight decrease over time. A well applied training program seems to provide the basis of a better care in PwD during hospitalization. However, changes in the organizational level and a transformation of care culture are necessary for training sustainability over time.

AB  - Virtual microscopy is currently widely used for various purposes, such as teaching, archiving, collaborations and research. Although the cost of this technique has reduced, it continues to be expensive for the majority of laboratories in developing countries. The Graduate Program in Pathology at the Federal Fluminense University (Niteri, Brazil) has acquired equipment for virtual microscopy. However, this novel method faced prejudice, as students and technicians were skeptical about its reliability. Thus, the aim of the current study was to evaluate whether virtual microscopy is a reliable method of analysis for our research. Thus, a mouse gut inflammation model developed by our research group was used in the present study. Analysis was performed using optical microscopy and digital imaging using the APERIO scanning system and the ImageScope r software. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), intra epithelial leucocytes (IEL), and villi number and area were evaluated. No significant differences were observed in villi number, IEC and IEL; however, the villi area was significantly smaller when measured using the computer. Thus, the present study indicates that virtual microscopy is a trustworthy method for research purposes.

AB  - Objective Concussion education strategies that improve knowledge and attitudes long term are needed. This exploratory study piloted an interactive concussion education program, adopting concepts from the learning sciences and attitude change literature, for the underserved and high-risk population of motorsports. Method Forty UK motorsport drivers (ages 16-20 years) participated. The workshop group received a two-phased workshop-based program. The comparison group received a concussion leaflet. Participants completed an adapted version of the Rosenbaum Concussion Knowledge and Attitudes Survey (RoCKAS-ST) at pre-, post- and 2-month follow-up. Within-group analysis for the workshop group explored the differential effect of the individual difference variable, Need for Cognition (NfC), and effectiveness was explored through post-workshop questionnaires and interviews. Results Unlike the comparison group, the workshop group showed a significant improvement in knowledge over time (F(2,58) = 45.49, p < .001, (eta 2)p = .61). Qualitative data indicated workshop-program participants developed safer attitudes toward concussion following programming. Preliminary evidence suggested individuals' responses to concussion education aligned with differences in NfC. Conclusion This study piloted the first concussion education program for motorsport drivers and explored whether aligning educational provision with the NfC construct may help to improve program effectiveness. Findings are relevant to addressing the public health issue of concussion through educational approaches.

AB  - This research investigates situations in which frontline employees deliberately restrict customers' access to touch products on display (active interpersonal haptic blocking), and how this understudied form of sensory blocking may increase customers' downstream purchasing. While previous research examines the benefits of increased product touch, we temporarily block touch for specific products in display areas and then investigate the subsequent impact on customer behavior. Through four studies, including a retail field experiment, we find that when an employee asks a customer not to touch a product on display, this initiates a serial mediation process which: (1) engenders feelings of psychological reactance that result in (2) increased compensatory touching of subsequently encountered products to counterbalance a loss of sensory freedom, and (3) increased spending and purchasing once the customer leaves the reactance-inducing encounter. Effects are moderated by socioeconomic status (SES) and need for touch (NFT) whereby psychological reactance was significantly stronger for high SES customers with a moderate or high NFT when actively blocked. Results also demonstrate that active interpersonal haptic blocking does not result in more negative attitudes toward retailers, thus retailers might consider implementing this counterintuitive practice to encourage downstream sales.

AB  - This study conceptualizes how fire management authorities can empower nonexpert public to participate in fire risk communication processes and increase their own responsibilities for managing fire preventive, protective and recovery processes effectively. Drawing narratives from 10 disaster management experts working at government institutions and nine micro-entrepreneurs operating self-sustaining businesses in different merchandized lines in Ghana, we analyzed the data thematically and explored new insights on mental models to generate a two-way fire risk communication model. The findings suggest that fire management authorities planned fire disasters at the strategic level, collaborated with multiple stakeholders, disseminated information through many risk communication methods, and utilized their capabilities to manage fire at the various stages of fire risk communication, but the outcomes were poor. The micro-entrepreneurs sought to improve fire management outcomes through attitude change, law enforcement actions, strengthened security and better public trust building. The study has implications for policymakers, governments, and risk communication authorities of developing countries to strengthen their fire disaster policies to minimize commercial fire incidents and address the damaging effects of fire on people's livelihoods, businesses, properties, and environments. Our proposed two-way fire risk communication model is a new theoretical lens for experts and the nonexpert public to assess each other's beliefs about risk information and manage fire risk communication effectively at all stages.

AB  - There is growing recognition of the need to understand public attitudes to energy sources, such as shale gas, and to feed these into decision-making. This study represents the first detailed UK experimental survey of public perceptions of shale gas fracking, including analysis of the effects of different messages and the relative influence of different audience, message and contextual factors on support and risk perceptions in respect of shale gas fracking. Using an online survey (N = 1457) of the UK public, we find considerable ambivalence about shale gas, but also greater awareness of potential risks than benefits. Prior knowledge is associated with more favourable attitudes, although demographics, political affiliation and environmental values are strongest influences on perceptions. When provided with environmental or economic information about shale gas, participants became more positive irrespective of their prior values or whether information is framed in terms of losses or gains. As expected, prior attitudes predict how information is received, with more attitude change amongst the most ambivalent respondents. We conclude that additional information about shale gas is more likely to be effective changing attitudes if focussed on this 'undecided' group. Studies of this type are important for policy makers and industry alike. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, the author problematizes the distinction between experience near and experience distant by suggesting that this bifurcation has everything to do with whether we think in terms of Cushman's one complex world or split worlds. The ground between experience near and experience distant is the ground on which our histories, cultures, traumas, and differences exist. The author questions whether the cherished belief that the gold standard of hearing from the patient and staying close to the patient's experience and view of reality is enough anymore. Our therapeutic passive receptiveness-our willingness to be taught- could be felt by our patients as disinterest, prejudice against, superiority, or non-reflected upon privilege. We need to be ready and willing to communicate or signal our openness, respect, and curiosity about the lived experience, histories, and cultures of those different from ourselves. Ethical labor is made up of the empathic stretch to know and research those aspects of our patients lives and familial cultural and social histories that simply cannot yet be delivered in affectively accessible forms. We must try to understand that what may feel like experience distance is so very much more than that.

AB  - Self-perceived employability (SPE) is defined as the ability to attain sustainable employment appropriate to one's qualification level (Rothwell 2008) and perceived as a crucial factor in university graduates' career development. Meanwhile, University students are mainly assessed through the lens of academic achievement, which depend, inter alia, on the self-motivated strategies for learning (MSL). Firstly, we tested hypothesised sex differences in SPE's and MSL's factors in a group of the first-year university students (n = 600) in a Central European context. Our analyses revealed that female students, despite their higher results in MSL's factors (self-regulation, learning strategies, intrinsic values, self-efficacy) presented lower internal SPE than male students. Secondly, we explored how much general SPE can be predicted from general MSL, taking into account sex as a moderator, finding that sex factor was not significant as a moderator. We can consider general MSL as a good predictor of general SPE in both sex groups. The results will provide evidence to support HEI curricular development and strategies for workplace attitude change to address existing sex inequalities. In addition, our findings relating to MSL will provide evidence to support the development of approaches to enhancing student employability with additional long term benefits in mental health and well-being.

AB  - A 41-year-old man was admitted to the hepatobiliary surgery department of West China Hospital for right upper abdominal pain lasting for more than three months. The local hospital's abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed an unclear low density shadow in the right and lateral lobes of the liver and nodules on the abdominal wall. A histologic analysis of an ultrasound guided percutaneous hepatic biopsy revealed it was hepatic sarcomatoid carcinoma (HSC). This stage IV highly aggressive liver cancer patient received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and thermotherapy at the same time. An important result of this treatment was the rapid relief of pain and symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. His quality of life improved quite a lot. Clinicians and patients usually have negative attitudes when they face stage IV cancer, especially in cases like this one. Through multimodal anti-tumor treatment, the patient felt much better and became more cooperative, which gave both the clinicians and the patient more confidence in the treatment and produced a better than expected outcome. We summarize the treatment of this rare case in order to share the experience and affirm confidence in both patients and clinicians in treating this condition.

AB  - In this Internet age where computer classrooms, smart phones, and tablet devices are becoming the norm, it is timely that social and educational psychologists integrate such technologies within the field of intergroup relations to develop innovative, effective, and validated tools to promote intergroup harmony. This critical review article introduces a new online contact strategy-Electronic-or E-contact-that allows for physically segregated ingroup and outgroup members to synchronously interact online, in a prestructured format. The synchronous nature of the intergroup interaction allows for the engagement of self in the contact situation that in turn strengthens the effectiveness of E-contact in promoting intergroup harmony. Previous research investigating online contact is reviewed, and an evaluation of a best-practice E-contact framework is provided. This framework is based on the successful 9-week Dual Identity Electronic Contact (DIEC) program that has been shown to maintain reductions in intergroup bias between Muslim and Christian students at 3 time periods: 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months post-DIEC intervention. Limitations of the Internet with regard to potentially creating negative contact are also highlighted to offer a balanced critique. Finally, future research designs are proposed to further support and enhance the success of E-contact research to improve intergroup relations and promote peace.

AB  - This article investigates whether self-interest as compared with values or ideological dispositions shapes individual attitudes towards the welfare state. Causal interpretations of how self-interest, values, and welfare state attitudes are linked have been difficult to sustain so far, as the research mainly relies on static, cross-sectional analyses. We address this empirical challenge using data from the Dutch Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social Sciences panel (2008-2013) that covers the period of the international economic crisis. We investigate how individuals change their attitudes in times of economic hardship. Our findings confirm theoretical expectations that people change their support for unemployment benefits in reaction to changes in their individual material circumstances. Job loss leads to an increased support for public provision of unemployment benefits. The analysis also suggests that this attitude change is persistent. After the temporarily unemployed have found a new job, they do not return to their pre-unemployment attitude. In contrast, individual support for life course-related domains of the welfare state such as health care or pensions is not affected by changes in individual material circumstances. Our results show that individual material circumstances and thus self-interest have a sizable effect on how individuals change their welfare state attitudes.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this article is to examine knowledge and attitudes on electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) among the German population.
   Method: A web-based population survey based on a standardized questionnaire was used to examine knowledge and attitudes towards ECT as a treatment of severe depression among the general public (sample of 1000; representative in terms of age, gender and federal states of the German population).
   Results: ECT is not well known and negatively connoted among the German population. A higher level of awareness and knowledge about ECT correlates with higher agreement to treatment with it. The analysis of feedback from the open question underlines the complexity of ECT: on the one hand, negative attitudes, stereotypes, and associations, and on the other hand interest, willingness, and acceptance to deal with the method were shown.
   Conclusion: The results suggest an urgent need for more information about the basic facts, psychiatric applications, and effectiveness of ECT in order to increase the level of awareness and knowledge, and thus the method's acceptance. An increase in acceptance would expand the therapeutic spectrum for the mentally ill. Correspondingly, persons affected and their relatives as well as physicians and healthcare professionals should be involved in awareness-raising measures.

AB  - For over three decades, the need for closure (NFC) construct has played a pivotal role in research programs addressing the motivational underpinnings of knowledge formation, judgment and decision making, and social and group cognition. In recent years, NFC research has entered a new phase with notable developments in both fundamental and applied research. The substantial progress in the domain of basic NFC research pertains to investigators' renewed interest in NFC's essentials, including its motivational nature, its role in the mobilization of task investment, the interplay between closure needs and abilities with implications for the measurement of NFC, its relation to cognitive depletion, its effects on memory phenomena, and its genetic and neural correlates. The second major development pertains to efforts to expand NFC research from the lab environment to real-world settings, including work on NFC effects on groups and organizations, its influence on the development and counteraction of prejudice, and its role in violent extremism. In this chapter, both developmental trends are discussed, highlighting their contributions to an advanced understanding of the motivational underpinnings of human cognition and behavior.

AB  - Music festivals are often the highlight of summertime, but they are also spaces increasingly policed for drugs, pickpockets, sexual assault, and terrorist attacks. The pop-up nature of festival spaces creates a tension between organizers ensuring safe environments and festival-goers seeking community and fun. We conducted an online survey of festival-goers to determine their safety concerns and feelings about security measures. The biggest safety concern was authorities, including police, private security, and surveillance. We found significant differences between males and females. Females had more concerns about personal safety and males had negative attitudes about surveillance and security-perhaps reflecting a male privilege. The negative attitude towards surveillance and police was common across demographic groups but stronger in males. A striking finding is that 87% of our participants felt that the ethos of a festival best creates a feeling of safety, while surveillance changes the nature of these public spaces-56% of our respondents felt it creates a bad vibe and 44% said it causes anxiety. We speculate that this sentiment parallels the Defund the Police movement following the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States-community is key to a safe city and surveillance is viewed as creating negative spaces.

TI  - The personal is political: The feminist critique of liberalism and the challenge of right-wing populism
T2  - ICON-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW
LA  - English
AB  - The recent democratic backsliding and the decline of liberal hegemony have generated different explanations for the turn away from liberal democracy. This article offers an explanation based on the feminist critique of structural and theoretical flaws within liberalism and argues that these flaws are used effectively by right-wing populism to endanger liberal democracy. Using feminist critiques of political liberalism, including critiques of the public/private and political/non-political distinctions, the article claims that the liberal choice to allow the flourishing of bigotry and intolerance in the private sphere and to require respect for equality only in the public sphere has made liberalism vulnerable to the right-wing populist attack. Political liberalism has rejected the feminist call to recognize that the personal is political and has relied on political institutions and processes as barriers against illiberalism. Liberal states applying these principles are therefore ill equipped to fight right-wing populists who rally their supporters around the promise to do away with political institutions and to let the populist leaders turn their private prejudices into public policy. The article calls for a redrawing of the lines between the political and non-political, and between the public and the private, to meet the challenge of right-wing populism.

AB  - Background: FAIRness (Feedback, Activity, Individualisation, Relevance) teaching is a structured program, comprising series of classes in which student work is anonymised and reviewed by the whole class, as well as students receiving private feedback on their written work. The class work emphasises logic, structure and order in history and examination, with a diagnostic and management focus.
   Aim: The effect of FAIRness teaching methods on the adaptation of medical students entering their first clinical rotations was studied.
   Methods: 18 students in FAIRness placements and 72 students in conventional placements, all in medical/surgical units in the same University teaching hospital were studied. They completed questionnaires relating to effectiveness and quality of clinical teaching. Some students additionally attended focus groups, at the start of placement to discuss their expectations, and after 3 weeks, to discuss their adaptation to the clinical learning environment.
   Results: All students entering clinical placements had low expectations of their future teaching. Students in standard placements still expressed negative attitudes after 3 weeks, while students on FAIRness placements felt positive. Students in FAIRness placements scored significantly higher on questions related to feedback and review of student work.
   Conclusion: FAIRness teaching practices help students to adapt to their first clinical placements.

AB  - Sociocultural prejudices and pressures may impair the mental health of bisexual people. We aim to evaluate psychological status according to sexual orientation in a sample of Italian university students, with specific attention to bisexuality and its frequency. Among a recruited sample of 551 university students, we found the following percentages for sexual orientation: heterosexuals 96.9% (n = 534), homosexuals 1.1% (n = 6), bisexuals 2% (n = 11). The cross-sectional analysis for psychological symptoms, with the Symptoms Check List-90 Revised (SCL-90-R), revealed that bisexual subjects have statistically significant higher scores on some symptomatic scales compared to heterosexuals. In particular, obsession-compulsion, paranoid ideation, hostility were significantly higher in bisexuals. Therefore, if heterosexual or homosexual orientation are not specified by particular psychological symptoms, bisexuality is characterized by a strong link with some facets of psychological distress, which are likely caused by a peculiar double stigma. In conclusion, through a specific psychometric tool, we found an association between bisexuality and various forms of psychological suffering. This evidence should further encourage clinicians to accurately assess the psychological health in young bisexual people.

AB  - The human body plays a central role in nonverbal communication, conveying attitudes, personality, and values during social interactions. Three experiments in a large, open classroom setting investigated whether the visibility of torso-located cues affects nonverbal communication of similarity. In Experiments 1 and 2, half the participants wore a black plastic bag over their torso. Participants interacted with an unacquainted same-sex individual selected from a large class who was also wearing (or also not wearing) a bag. Experiment 3 added a clear bag condition, in which visual torso cues were not obscured. Across experiments, black bag-wearing participants selected partners who were less similar to them on attitudes, behaviors, and personality compared to the bag-less-and clear bag-participants. Nonverbal cues in the torso communicate information about similarity of attitudes, behavior, and personality; the center of the body plays a surprisingly central role in early-stage person perception and attraction.

TI  - Revolting Peasants: Southern Italy, Ireland, and Cartoons in Comparative Perspective, 1860-1882
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF SOCIAL HISTORY
LA  - English
KW  - SOCIETY
AB  - Peasants in general, and rural rebels in particular, were mercilessly ridiculed in the satirical cartoons that proliferated in European cities from the mid-nineteenth century. There was more to these images than the age-old hostility of the townspeople for the peasant, and this article comparatively explores how cartoons of southern Italian brigands and rural Irish agitators helped shape a liberal version of what was modern by identifying what was not: the revolting peasant who engaged in unmanly violence, lacked self-reliance, and was in thrall to Catholic clergymen. During periods of unrest, distinctions between brigands, rebels, and the rural populations as a whole were not always clear in cartoons. Comparison suggests that derogatory images of peasants from southern Italy and Ireland held local peculiarities, but they also drew from transnational stereotypes of rural poverty that circulated widely due to the rapidly expanding European publishing industry. While scholarly debates inspired by postcolonial perspectives have previously emphasized processes of othering between the West and East, between the metropole and colony, it is argued here that there is also an internal European context to these relationships based on ingrained class and gendered prejudices, and perceptions of what constituted the centre and the periphery.

AB  - Since Independence, Muslim politics in India has mainly been framed through the idiom of identity. While political engagements calling for democratization and increased participation in public life have occasionally occurred, scholarly interest in the ongoing shifts in Muslim political demands is recent and new. Simultaneously, the emerging literature on the politics of patronage and post-patronage networks in democracies of the Global South present anthropologists with new tools for studying the changing contours of the political mobilization of the urban poor. Using ethnographic narratives collected during fieldwork in Park Circus-one of Kolkata's many Muslim-dominated neighbourhoods-which remains stigmatized and socially and spatially set apart, this article highlights the emerging modes of political engagement among poor and lower middle-class Muslims. I carefully document their efforts to negotiate a perceived 'better' life within a fast-changing neoliberal urban landscape that is prejudiced against them. For many ordinary Muslims, this has involved a movement away from the traditional elite-led politics of identity towards more plebeian forms of assertion and activism aimed at eking out a respectable living by working through extant structures of the local administration and networks of power in the neighbourhood.

AB  - The aim of this research was to explore consumer perceptions of personalised nutrition and to compare these across three different levels of "medicalization": lifestyle assessment (no blood sampling); phenotypic assessment (blood sampling); genomic assessment (blood and buccal sampling). The protocol was developed from two pilot focus groups conducted in the UK. Two focus groups (one comprising only "older" individuals between 30 and 60 years old, the other of adults 18-65 yrs of age) were run in the UK, Spain, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Germany (N = 16). The analysis (guided using grounded theory) suggested that personalised nutrition was perceived in terms of benefit to health and fitness and that convenience was an important driver of uptake. Negative attitudes were associated with internet delivery but not with personalised nutrition per se. Barriers to uptake were linked to broader technological issues associated with data protection, trust in regulator and service providers. Services that required a fee were expected to be of better quality and more secure. An efficacious, transparent and trustworthy regulatory framework for personalised nutrition is required to alleviate consumer concern. In addition, developing trust in service providers is important if such services to be successful. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose The spread of fake news on social networking sites (SNS) poses a threat to the marketing landscape, yet little is known about how fake news affect consumers' perceptions, attitudes and behaviors. This study aims to explore when consumers believe fake news, whom they blame for it (e.g. negative attitudes toward brands or SNS) and when they choose to share it. Design/methodology/approach Data obtained from 80 open-ended, semistructured interviews, conducted with SNS consumers and experts, is analyzed following the principles of grounded theory and the Gioia methodology. Findings Factors affecting consumers' perceptions of fake news include skepticism, awareness, previous experience, appeal and message cues. Consumers' brand- and SNS-related attitudes are affected by consumers' blame, which is determined by consumers' perceptions of the vetting efforts, role and ethical obligation of SNS. Consumers' motives for sharing fake news include duty, retaliation, authentication and status-seeking. Theoretical and practical implications derived from the study's novel conceptual framework are discussed. Practical implications This study identifies communication strategies that marketing professionals can use to mitigate and counter the negative effects of fake news. Originality/value By simultaneously considering consumers' perceptions of the source, information and medium (i.e. SNS), this study presents a novel conceptual framework providing a marketing-centered, dynamic view on consumers' fake news experience and connecting consumers' perceptions, attitudes and behaviors in the context of fake news.

AB  - Based on the social-cognitive information processing model and the theory of normative beliefs, this study tests if garners normalise aggression in games, and whether these normative beliefs explain their aggressive behaviour in games. Experimental cross sectional, worldwide data was collected through an online survey of garners (N = 1646). Participants were randomly assigned to read a vignette describing an instance of verbal harassment occurring either online (within a multiplayer game) or offline (within a board game cafe) and were asked how acceptable and tolerable they found the harassment. There was a significant moderate main effect of context which indicated that harassment was perceived as more normal in the online gaming scenario. Normative beliefs about cyberaggression significantly predicted both general and prejudiced cyberaggression. Additionally, normative beliefs partially mediated the relationship between age and general cyberaggression (small effect) and gender and general cyberaggression (large effect). As normative beliefs are dynamic and modifiable, cyberaggression prevention and intervention efforts should include modification of beliefs which support the legitimacy and acceptability of cyberaggression in games. These findings provide insight into how gamer culture around acceptability of trash talk relates to toxicity in games and suggest directions for further research.

T2  - HEALTH CARE FOR WOMEN INTERNATIONAL
LA  - English
AB  - This research aimed to determine the effect of Covid-19 fears on attitudes of women of reproductive age toward Covid-19 vaccination. This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with 413 women aged 18-49. "Participant Identification Form," "Fear of Covid-19 Scale (FCV-19S)" and "Attitudes Towards Covid-19 Vaccine Scale (ATV-Covid-19)" were used to collect data. Kruskall Wallis test, Man Whitney U test and Spearman correlation test were used to evaluate the data. The mean FCV-19S total score of the women within the scope of the study was 18.70 +/- 5.34. The mean score of the positive attitude sub-dimension of ATV-Covid-19 of women was 14.09 +/- 3.80, the mean score of the negative attitude sub-dimension was 16.21 +/- 3.26. A positive, weak and statistically significant correlation was found between FCV-19S total score and ATV-Covid-19 positive attitude sub-dimension mean score (p < 0.05). It was determined that the women within the scope of the study had a moderate fear of Covid-19. However, more women had positive than negative attitudes toward Covid-19 vaccines. In addition, as the level of fear of Covid-19 increases, positive attitudes toward the Covid-19 vaccines increase.

AB  - Background: Some physicians lack knowledge and awareness about health issues specific to sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals. To help improve this, hospitals have implemented policies that mandate non-discrimination and training to promote sexual and gender minority health. There is limited evidence about how such policies relate to physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and gender and sexual minority affirmative practices.
   Method: A random sample of 1000 physicians was recruited from a complete list of physicians affiliated with one of two university Hospitals located in Tennessee and 180 physicians completed the survey concerning attitudes and knowledge about SGM individuals. Physicians were affiliated with either Hospital A that had not implemented policies for non-discrimination and training, or Hospital B that did.
   Results: Physicians held different attitudes about SGM patients than non-patients. Physicians affiliated with Hospital A held more negative attitudes about SGM individuals who were non-patients than physicians affiliated with Hospital B. There were no differences between the two hospitals in physicians' attitudes and knowledge about SGM patients.
   Conclusion: Policies that mandate non-discrimination and training as they currently exist may not improve physicians' attitudes and knowledge about SGM individuals. Additional research is needed to understand how these policies and trainings relate to physicians' SGM affirmative practices.

AB  - In clinical practice, identifying positive and negative attitudes toward older patients is very important to improve quality of care provided to them. The Older People in Acute Care Survey United States (OPACSUS) is an instrument measuring hospital nurses attitudes regarding older patients. However, psychometrics have never been assessed. Furthermore, knowledge being related to attitude and behavior should also be measured complementing the OPACS-US. The purpose of this study was to assess structural validity and reliability of the OPACS-US and assess whether the OPACS-US can be complemented with the Knowledge about Older Patients-Quiz (KOP-Q). A multicenter cross sectional design was conducted. Registered nurses (n = 130, mean age 39,9 years: working experience 14,6 years) working in four general hospitals were included in the study. Nurses completed the OPACS-US section A: practice experiences, B: general opinion and the KOP-Q online. Findings demonstrated that the OPACS-US is a valid and reliable survey instrument that measures practice experiences and general opinion. Furthermore, the OPACS-US can be combined with the KOP-Q adding a knowledge construct, and is ready for use within education and/or quality improvement programs in the USA. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In 2019, Dan Mallory, book editor turned author of the enormously successful thriller,The Woman in the Window, was exposed as a pathological dissembler. Faking cancer, an Oxford PhD, a prestigious career, and tragic family deaths, Mallory constructed a distressing history in order to gain authority and influence. Examining the complexities of the fraud in relation to other contemporary fakes, this paper contends that impostors expose the value systems of power, especially those situated within gatekeeping institutions that enable grifters to thrive. It asserts that despite humiliating exposure, or the excoriation of outraged readers, the impostor invariably succeeds, perpetuating an exclusive monoculture in which the same voices, both real and imagined, are heard and received. The Mallory controversy emerges within a succession of impostures fixated on crossing boundaries from privilege to disadvantage and trauma, revealing an identity politics located within the commodification of the marketable 'other'. The hunger for narratives of 'authentic' suffering comes to represent a form of literary virtue signalling which exploits 'otherness' to satisfy middle-class stereotypes and prejudices. Imbricated with issues of appropriation and theft, the fake treats suffering as an object to be possessed, yet also functions to uncover a sequence of literary and cultural fault-lines.

TI  - SEEKING FOR HARMONY AFTER CHAOS POLITICAL CEREMONIES IN THE FIRST "CEREMONIAL SECTION" OF THE GOLDEN BULL OF 1356
T2  - MICROLOGUS-NATURE SCIENCE AND MEDIEVAL SOCIETIES
LA  - English
AB  - This study concentrates on the first of three "ceremonial sections' within the text of the Golden Bull of Emperor Charles IV. This section ( now chapters III-VI), being the oldest part of the Bull, appeared as contamination of two originally independent edicts. Nevertheless, the main idea of ceremonies described in both of them is the same: establishing of a concordia, political harmony, within the small group of leading princes of the empire. To achieve this harmony, some changes of hierarchical relations were necessary. The authors of the Golden Bull imagined the reformed Empire visualised as a symmetric figure, built by the princes' seats and bodies as if seen from above, by drawing a plan of their collocation at ceremonial acts. At the same time, the authors strongly emphasized parity between the three archbishops, but secured two sorts of inequality via symbolical means. Firstly, the ecclesiastical electors appear to stand higher in the hierarchy than the secular ones. Secondly, the hierarchy within the group of secular electors was substantially transformed for the benefit of the King of Bohemia and to the prejudice of Count Palatine of the Rhine. It seems also that the authors were preparing for a possible 'ceremonial confrontation" with the French court in the near future.

AB  - Background: Opioid use is a severe problem in Iran. Despite methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) programs being one of the most important treatment strategies for reducing individual and public harms associated with opioid use, a large proportion of Iranian patients refuse to participate in such treatment programs.
   Methods: The present study aims to explore the beliefs and attitudes toward MMT programs of opioid-dependent patients who were participating or had participated in methadone therapy. In-depth interviews were conducted with 23 opioid users between 27 and 58 years of age from Kurdistan provinces.
   Results: Overall, six themes were discovered to be key barriers relating to methadone treatment, including financial barriers related to methadone treatment, lack of awareness about methadone treatment, negative attitudes regarding using methadone, worries about methadone's side effects, social stigma ascribed to methadone therapy, and systemic barriers to methadone treatment.
   Conclusion: Our study revealed that the cost of treatment is a major obstacle to attending and continuing at MMT programs and that addicts and their families are not always accurately informed about the duration of MMT programs and the side effects of methadone treatment.

AB  - Purpose This paper attempts to investigate the influence of psychological biases on saving decision-making of bank customers in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach It employs weighted least squares regression to test the effect of psychological biases on savings decisions of bank customers. Findings The findings show that all the nine psychological biases, namely mental accounting, availability, loss aversion, representativeness, anchoring, overconfidence, status quo, framing effect and disposition effect employed for the study have a significant influence on saving decision of bank customers. The results depict that psychological biases are entrenched in the saving pattern of bank customers in Ghana. Practical implications For policy purposes, the study recommends that bank customers need to enhance their knowledge of psychological biases in order to improve their gains from savings, and not to fall prey to these prejudices. The satisfied customer is a dependable source of bank viability and survival. Originality/value To the best of the knowledge of the author, this study provides the first empirical evidence of the influence of psychological biases on saving decisions of bank customers in Ghana. The findings of this study will enhance knowledge on the influence of psychological biases on individual decision-making and will accentuate the fact that the individual is not an entirely rational being.

AB  - The hypothesis of this article is that, for its adherents, QAnon is truthful, rather than true; that is, it captures their perception of the way things typically happen, rather than picturing what really has happened-and it does this in a way that seems more vivid and complete than actual experience. Why that is the case can be explained in terms of the peculiar nature of fictional representations, combined with the capacity of imaginary worlds, to symbolize real-world concerns in ways that resonate with prejudices and preconceptions but escape direct censure. After reviewing the literature on the conspiracy movement, we argue for QAnon as a conspiracy story, rather than a conspiracy theory, and interpret that story as "structured like a fantasy", giving imaginative expression to a set of social feelings and normative grievances that would otherwise not dare speak their own names. We conclude that QAnon is an authoritarian fiction centered on anti-Semitic conspiracy beliefs that disturbingly reprise key themes of fascism, but that it presents this within the symbolic disguise of a fantasy scenario that is calculated to attract alienated white, middle-class and working-class, individuals. This argument helps explicate adherents' resistance to the falsification of Q claims and predictions.

AB  - Previous studies mostly indicate that young adults travel less by car compared to their older counterparts, partly due to postponing driving license holding and car ownership. Furthermore, these young adults might also prefer living in urban, low-traffic neighborhoods, further reducing car use. In this study we analyze the residential location choice, travel behavior and travel attitudes of young versus older adults (respectively born after 1984 and before 1985), using 1376 recently relocated residents from the city of Ghent (Belgium). Results indicate that travel mode frequency does not considerably differ between young and older adults, although young adults - compared to older adults - live more often in urban-type neighborhoods. This might be partly explained by young adults' relatively positive attitudes towards car use and negative attitudes towards walking and low-traffic investments. These attitudes consequently seem to counter-balance the effects of the residential neighborhood on travel mode frequency. The fact that respondents' travel attitudes are often not in line with their chosen residential neighborhood suggests limited self-selection effects. Results from this study partly contradict earlier findings on young adults' travel behavior and indicate that further research is needed on the links between travel behavior, attitudes and residential location choice of different age groups.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
LA  - English
KW  - NATIONAL-SURVEY
KW  - DENTISTS
AB  - The processing of sensitive information in the health field is subject to rigorous standards that guarantee the protection of information confidentiality. Recently, the Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali) stated their formal opinion on a standard procedure in dental offices involving the submission of a questionnaire that includes the patient's health status. HIV infection status is included on the form. The Authority has stated that all health data collection must be in accordance with the current Italian normative framework for personal data protection and respect the patient's freedom. This freedom allows the patient to decide, in a conscious and responsible way, whether to share health information with health personnel without experiencing any prejudice in the provision of healthcare requested. Moreover, data collection must be relevant and cannot exceed the principles of treatment goals with reference to the specific care of the concerned person. However, the need for recording information regarding HIV infection at the first appointment, regardless of the clinical intervention or therapeutic plan that needs to be conducted, should not alter the standard protection measures of the healthcare staff. In fact, these measures are adopted for every patient.

AB  - Research suggests that context influences judgments and implicit evaluations (e.g., attitudes toward a person depend upon the context in which we encounter that person). Importantly, previous research presents contextual cues at encoding, such that participants learn about a target person in context. Here, we decouple the process of learning about targets from manipulations of context. Participants in our studies learned about the intelligence and athleticism of a novel male target in a neutral context. Subsequently, we implicitly measured participants' attitudes toward the target in an intelligence-related or neutral context (Study 1) and in intelligence-related and athletic-related contexts (Study 2). In both studies, contextual cues (which were absent during encoding) influenced attitudes at retrieval.

KW  - adaptation
KW  - fan studies
AB  - Fans seeking engagement with Jane Austen and her fictional creations seek out heritage locations linked both temporally and geographically to her life and works. This article adopts a multidisciplinary framework that triangulates fan studies, literary criticism, and heritage studies to analyse three Austen-linked fan spaces: Chawton Cottage (Austen's former home and now a museum), Lyme Park ('Pemberley' in B.B.C.'s 1995 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice), and two Austen-themed literary walks. I argue that the fan's desire for connection is by no means an organic or natural quality of the heritage site itself. Rather, creating connections between the revered object (Austen) and the physical spaces that purport to contain her necessitates imaginative work on the part of the literary tourist. That such performative work is necessary in both the 'real' (Chawton) and 'fictional' (Lyme Park) locations demonstrates the problematic nature of previous critical emphases on the authenticity - or lack thereof - of such spaces. The significance of the fan's pilgrimage to Austen-linked heritage sites lies not in the author to be 'found' there but in how the tourist actively constructs 'their' Jane by inscribing her presence - and those of her characters - onto these spaces.

AB  - Gambling disorder (GD) is often considered as a problem of trait-like risk preference. However, the symptoms of GD cannot be fully understood by this trait view. In the present study, we hypothesized that GD patients also had problem with a flexible control of risk attitude (state-dependent strategy optimization), and aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying abnormal risk-taking of GD. To address this issue, we tested GD patients without comorbidity (GD group: n = 21) and age-matched healthy control participants (HC group: n = 29) in a multi-step gambling task, in which participants needed to clear 'block quota' (required units to clear a block, 1000-7000 units) in 20 choices, and conducted a task-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. Behavioral analysis indeed revealed a less flexible risk-attitude change in the GD group; the GD group failed to avoid risky choice in a specific quota range (low-quota condition), in which risky strategy was not optimal to solve the quota. Accordingly, fMRI analysis highlighted diminished functioning of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), which has been heavily implicated in cognitive flexibility. To our knowledge, the present study provided the first empirical evidence of a deficit of state-dependent strategy optimization in GD. Focusing on flexible control of risk attitude under quota may contribute to a better understanding of the psychopathology of GDs.

AB  - Migration influx in Western countries resulting in increasingly diverse societies results in more complex situations for bureaucrats in their client interactions in welfare organizations. The role of discretion for services to clients has received much attention in the public administration research and therefore this study explores the relation among perceived workload, anti-immigration attitudes, perceived discretion, and perceived difficulty in working with migrants. The paper examines the function of perceived discretion as moderator or mediator variable in this constellation. The relations are examined by using structural equation modelling based on a survey among Swedish welfare bureaucrats (N = 1,319). The results show that heavier perceived workload increased the likelihood of experiencing work with migrants as difficult and that greater perceived discretion decreased the likelihood of experiencing work with migrants as difficult. The results suggest that perceived discretion functions as a mediator for the relation between perceived workload and difficulty in work with migrants: potentially functioning as a 'buffer' for organizational pressure. We also found that bureaucrats who hold negative attitudes towards migrants were more likely to express their work with migrants as more difficult. This paper contributes to the public administration literature by increasing our knowledge on how discretion has significance in relation to when bureaucrat's behaviour is determined by specific organizational and personal factors.

AB  - Research reports inconsistent results on reactions of women towards a discriminated peer. Two experiments examine the impact of the commonality of fate on supportive or derogative reactions towards a discriminated female target. Female participants observed an ambiguous (Experiment 1) or an unambiguous (Experiments 1 and 2) sexist act against a female target with whom they shared or not a common fate. The results showed that, when they shared a common fate, participants minimized more discrimination against the target regardless the ambiguity of discrimination, and derogate her more if she claimed discrimination. These unsupportive reactions from observers did not occur in a dissimilar fate context.

AB  - We introduce a new experimental paradigm to evaluate employer preferences, called incentivized resume rating (IRR). Employers evaluate resumes they know to be hypothetical in order to be matched with real job seekers, preserving incentives while avoiding the deception necessary in audit studies. We deploy IRR with employers recruiting college seniors from a prestigious school, randomizing human capital characteristics and demographics of hypothetical candidates. We measure both employer preferences for candidates and employer beliefs about the likelihood that candidates will accept job offers, avoiding a typical confound in audit studies. We discuss the costs, benefits, and future applications of this new methodology.

AB  - ObjectiveThere have been few studies investigating the risk factors for bulimia nervosa (BN), and most have been in Anglo-Saxon countries. This study aimed to (i) replicate the uncontested retrospective correlates for BN and clarify the role of factors with inconsistent findings and (ii) evaluate the strength of these factors in a different culture.
   MethodA case-control design was used to compare 60 women who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for BN to 60 healthy controls and 60 participants with other psychiatric disorders. Retrospective correlates were assessed by interviewing each person with the Oxford Risk Factor Interview.
   ResultsThe primary retrospective correlates identified from the comparison of BN participants to healthy controls were general high maternal expectations, negative attitudes about parental weight and obesity in childhood and adolescence. Compared with participants with other psychiatric disorders, those with BN also reported higher rates of childhood obesity, deliberate self-harm, family conflicts, general high maternal expectations and feeling fat in childhood.
   ConclusionsThe common findings across cultures suggest that, at least, individuals subjectively experience a number of similar factors that increase risk for developing BN. In addition, the difference regarding self-harm is notable. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.

TI  - Traversing the Muddy Waters-Legality, Tenability, and Reliability of Co-defendant's Confession under the Indian Evidence Act
T2  - STATUTE LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - This article critiques the Indian jurisprudence on section 30 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Under the present legal framework, a confession of a co-defendant in a joint criminal trial may be utilized by the Courts to corroborate other pieces of evidence, in order to determine the guilt of non-confessing defendants, also. However, this article argues that the 'original meaning' of section 30 makes the confession of a testifying defendant, admissible as against its maker-alone. And not against the other co-defendants. This position is supported by the drafting history behind section 30, and further, is the tradition and practice across common law jurisdictions. In this connection, the author argues that in the absence of any cross-examination or oath, admitting such a confession under section 30 prejudices the fair trial right of non-confessing co-defendants. Hence, it must be excluded altogether by the Courts-as a bright-line rule-while the guilt of those non-confessing co-defendants is determined. Conversely, the author argues that the interpretation of section 30 in light of its original meaning, which makes confession admissible against its maker alone, would automatically safeguard constitutional due process guarantees and the fair trial right of the non-confessing defendants.

AB  - Existing evidence suggests that skin tone is an important determinant of one's life chances. Although social science research has a strong tradition of elucidating the link between race and educational outcomes, the effect of skin color on educational attainment has not received adequate attention. The main objective of the present investigation was, using a national representative longitudinal data, to evaluate educational attainment of Asian American and Hispanic young adults in the United States as a function of skin tone and other co-variates. Separate analyses were carried out for Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, other Hispanics, East Asian, Filipino American and other Asians. Additional analyses were conducted on a subsample of sibling pairs of Asian and Hispanic origin. Control variables included family socio-economic background, parental involvement, family social support, average school SES and others. Although we observed a certain degree of cross-ethnic heterogeneity, the results consistently point to a strong association between educational attainment and the lightness of skin tone. The findings also suggest that the aforementioned relationship is the strongest among U.S. young adults of Filipino and Puerto Rican descent. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Little is known about the psychological mechanisms underlying judgments of perceived inflation as empirical evidence is sparse. In two studies, we investigated two factors that are expected to play a significant role in global judgments of perceived inflation: product accessibility and attitudes towards inflation. In Study 1 (N = 253), primed participants retrieved five products whose prices had increased (or decreased) in the past year before expressing a judgment of past inflation (versus non-primed participants with no retrieval task). In Study 2 (N = 101) participants were merely exposed to a series of products, and asked to estimate their frequency of purchase, before judging past inflation. In one condition, the prices of the majority of products had actually increased in the last year, while in another condition they had decreased. In both studies, attitudes towards inflation were also measured. Product priming consistently affected inflation judgments in the direction of an assimilation effect. Also, more negative attitudes towards inflation were associated with higher judgments of perceived inflation. Path analysis confirmed that both product accessibility and attitudes are potential bases for judgments of perceived inflation. These findings suggest that multiple psychological influences may underlie global judgments of perceived inflation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The intergroup lay theories of polyculturalism and multiculturalism have been hypothesized to play an important role in facilitating better intergroup relations. In two studies, we investigate the consequences of polyculturalism and multiculturalism on participants' cognitive empathy for actors in a hypothetical intercultural interaction. Study 1 involves a scenario with Korean student experiencing language difficulties in the classroom and a Filipino professor who willingly provided assistance. Study 2 involves the same scenario but with a Filipino professor who declines to extend help to the Korean student. Hierarchical regression analyses reveal that multiculturalism predicts cognitive empathy for the Korean student in Study 1 and polyculturalism predicts cognitive empathy for the professor in both studies. The findings provide support for the role of lay theories of culture and its impact on cognitions about groups, and more importantly, for the distinct relationships between the two lay theories that emphasize either cultural differences or cultural connections.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships among sexual orientation diversity, diversity strategy, and organizational performance. Data were gathered from 780 senior-level athletic administrators in 239 organizations. Moderated regression analysis indicated that, while main effects were not observed, there was a significant sexual orientation diversity x proactive diversity strategy interaction. Organizations with high sexual orientation diversity and that followed a strong proactive diversity strategy outperformed their peers in objective measures of performance. Results are discussed in terms of contributions, implications, and future directions. (C) 2010 Sport Management Association of Australia and New Zealand. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

KW  - LIBERALS
AB  - Three studies (Ns = 350, 301 & 341) examined the reliability, validity, and correlates of a new measure of harm inflation, the individual differences counterpart of 'concept creep'. The Harm Concept Breadth Scale (HCBS) assesses variability in the expansiveness of concepts of harm (i.e., bullying, mental disorder, prejudice, trauma), such that these concepts refer to a wider range of phenomena among people scoring high on the scale. Study 1 developed 66 vignettes representing potential instances of the four concepts, selected optimal subsets of 10 vignettes for each concept, and demonstrated satisfactory internal consistency of the subscales. Study 2 demonstrated that the HCBS had excellent internal consistency, and established construct validity through associations with measures of moral foundations, justice sensitivity, general category inclusiveness, and political orientation. Study 3 employed participants from a different national background and further clarified the correlates of the HCBS via measures of empathy, moral expansiveness, and the Big Five personality traits. The findings indicate that concept breadth is a reliably measurable individual difference variable with weak to moderate associations with harm-based morality, prosocial concern, political liberalism, female gender, and negative emotionality. The HCBS is a valid psychometric instrument for examining the causes and implications of harm inflation.

AB  - Conversations about race-specific issues with interracial conversation partners can be important to combat prejudice and foster mutual understanding. Using a national U.S. sample of 201 Black Democrats, 199 Black Republicans, 200 White Democrats, and 200 White Republicans, this study examined the role that race and partisanship play in individuals' desire to have political discussions about race-specific topics with racial outgroups. Findings indicate that Blacks in general expected more negative outcomes of race talk with racial outgroups, and Republicans were more likely to attempt to avoid interracial conversations about race. However, these findings were qualified by an interaction between race and partisanship such that White Democrats anticipated fewer negative outcomes from cross-race conversations about race than all other subgroups, and Black Democrats expected more negative outcomes than all other subgroups. Black and White Republicans did not differ from one another and fell roughly between the two Democratic subgroups. Nonetheless, it was White Republicans who were most likely to want to avoid race-specific conversations with cross-race discussion partners, rating significantly more avoidant than Black Republicans and White Democrats, but not Black Democrats.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the drilling speed on bone healing and the osseointegration of implants placed with a guided flapless surgical technique in rabbit tibias.
   Methods: For the evaluation of bone healing, a total of 30 perforations (defects) were made in both tibias of 15 rabbits using 2 different drilling speeds (1500 rpm-control group; 50 rpm-test group). The regeneration of bone tissue in the surgical sites was evaluated at 0, 7, and 14 days. For the evaluation of implant osseointegration, another 15 rabbits underwent drilling in both tibias for implant placement. Thirty implants (3.75 x 10 mm) were placed to evaluate osseointe-gration at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after surgery.
   Results: Both groups showed a progressive healing of the defect, which involved the complete closure of the perforation. The osseointegration occurred in all groups with no statistically significant differences in the assessment of the osseointegration between the groups.
   Conclusion: In the experimental models used, the drilling speed does not prejudice the pattern of bone healing and osseointegration of implants placed with guided flapless surgery.

AB  - Objective The purpose of this paper was to measure if people with greater "structural literacy," as indicated by greater awareness of racial and socioeconomic disparities in COVID-19 impact, would hold fewer negative attitudes against those perceived to be Asian in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods A survey was administered between April and August 2020 to participants from two longitudinal cohorts in New York State. The survey assessed anti-Asian attitudes relating to COVID-19, awareness of racial and socioeconomic disparities in COVID-19, residential location, socioeconomic status, and other demographic information. The sample included 233 Black, Latinx, and White midlife adults from urban, suburban, and rural New York neighborhoods. Multivariable regression modeling was used to assess associations between COVID-19 disparities awareness, an indicator of structural literacy, and anti-Asian attitudes, adjusting for gender, race/ethnicity, residential location, and socioeconomic disadvantage. Results Greater awareness of disparities in COVID-19 was associated with lower levels of anti-Asian attitudes after adjustment (adj-slope = - 0.358, p < 0.001). Conclusion Greater structural literacy, as measured by awareness of socioeconomic and racial disparities in COVID-19 impact, was associated with fewer anti-Asian attitudes among Black, Latinx, and White adults. Implications Increasing structural literacy may reduce anti-Asian attitudes that motivate harmful acts against oppressed groups.

AB  - Why would heterosexual men downplay their compassion for masculine (vs. feminine) gay victims of hate crime? Two social identity-inspired explanations provide contrasting answers to this question. The reactive distinctiveness thesis (RD) assumes that heterosexual men would downplay their compassion more, when cued to a gay victim's masculinity than to their femininity, provided evaluative concerns are strong. In contrast, the feminization-threat thesis (FT) assumes that compassion downplays would be more visible when heterosexual men are cued to a gay victim's femininity (not to the victim's masculinity), provided evaluative concerns are strong too. Consistent with RD, three experiments (N-total = 1,475) revealed that heterosexual men who read news about (gay) victims at a hate crime scene downplayed their compassion to a greater degree when cued to the masculinity rather than to the femininity of such targets (Studies 1-3). Meanwhile FT's prediction received partial support when considering feminine (vs. masculine) heterosexual victims, rather than homosexual victims (Study 3).

AB  - This study investigated the awareness of residents who had not yet begun long-stay tourism undertakings in rural area in Japan, to understand their basic intentions concerning agricultural and rural-experience exchange business, farm-stay business, and receiving foreign tourists. The factors that influence the intentions are defined based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). A survey questionnaire was employed to collect data from the residents in three communities in the Murakumo area of Tambasasayama City. A structural equation model (SEM) was used to analyze the level of the factors' influence on the residents' intentions. With regard to the residents' intentions toward the three types of business, a large proportion of residents tended to hold negative attitudes. Residents almost held more negative attitude to farm-stay business and receiving foreigners than to carry out agricultural and rural-experience exchange businesses. There existed significant differences in intentions according to gender, and the intentions of males were stronger than females. In the analysis of influence factors, the factor of attitude had a significant positive effect on residents' concerns about rural-exchange experience businesses, farm-stay businesses, and receiving foreign tourists. The factor of perceived behavioral control only had a significant positive effect on the concerns about receiving foreign tourists. The subjective norm had no significant relationship to residents' intentions.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by unwanted and upsetting thoughts, images, or urges (obsessions). Some individuals with OCD feel compelled to conceal the content and frequency of their obsessions, and theoretical accounts suggest that self-concealment may contribute to OCD symptoms. Yet, empirical investigation in this area is lacking. The present study investigated individual differences in dispositional self-concealment (the behavioral tendency to keep distressing and potentially embarrassing personal information from others) in relation to OCD symptoms. Individuals who self identified as having OCD (N=115) were compared to unscreened community controls (N=513) on a validated measure of self-concealment. The OCD group reported higher levels of self-concealment than the control group, and this difference remained significant after controlling for group differences in anxiety, depression, and stress symptoms. Among the OCD group, self-concealment was significantly related to OCD severity, though only for some symptom dimensions. Specifically, self-concealment was associated with symptoms pertaining to unacceptable thoughts, fears of being responsible for harm and symmetry/ordering, but not contamination symptoms. In addition, OCD participants with higher levels of self-concealment reported more negative attitudes about seeking professional help and lower levels of expected benefits of receiving cognitive behavioral therapy for their OCD. Clinical implications and future directions are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Much of what we tell ourselves about the Rules of Evidence-that they serve as an all-seeing gatekeeper, checking evidence for relevance and trustworthiness, screening it for unfair prejudice-is simply wrong. In courtrooms every day, fact finders rely on "evidence"-for example, a style of dress, the presence of family members in the gallery, and of course race-that rarely passes as evidence in the formal sense, and thus breezes past evidentiary gatekeepers unseen and unchecked. This Article calls much needed attention to this other evidence and demonstrates that such unregulated evidence matters. Jurors use this other evidence to decide whether to find for a plaintiff or defendant, whether a defendant should go free or be deprived of liberty, even whether a defendant is deserving of life or death. More broadly, the role of other evidence belies what we tell ourselves about the way justice works, that it is based on the "rule of law." The truth is less comforting. The determination of outcomes, notwithstanding the Rules of Evidence, is often ruleless. To address this state of affairs, this Article first offers a modest proposal-a simple jury instruction and directive. It then offers a solution that is anything but modest-a radical rethinking of the Rules of Evidence.

TI  - Forced Evictions: Racial Persecution and Social Exclusion of the Roma Minority in Romania
T2  - COLUMBIA JOURNAL OF TRANSNATIONAL LAW
LA  - English
AB  - The increase in forced evictions of Roma communities in the European Union is cause for alarm. In Romania, the Member State with the largest Roma population, they are part of a consistent practice of racial segregation and social exclusion. The discriminatory intent of forced evictions and the lack of domestic procedural safeguards constitute a violation of the country's international and regional treaty obligations. However, despite a recent influx of cases that reveal the influence of prejudice over the relevant state action, the European Court of Human Rights has failed to resolve the matter. Even where it found breaches of the right to respect for one's private and family life, it failed to recognize the discriminatory purpose of official policies. This Note proposes a new legal framework for the Court to adopt in its adjudication of cases concerning forced evictions of vulnerable minorities. It argues that due to the profound impact forced evictions have on the Roma community, the Court should view them as a violation of the prohibition of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment. By doing so, it would increase pressure on national governments and effectively compel them to comply with international standards governing forced evictions.

   Guided by the early findings of social scientists, practitioners have long advocated for greater contact between groups to reduce prejudice and increase social cohesion. Recent work, however, suggests that intergroup contact can undermine support for social change towards greater equality, especially among disadvantaged group members. Using a large and heterogeneous dataset (12,997 individuals from 69 countries), we demonstrate that intergroup contact and support for social change towards greater equality are positively associated among members of advantaged groups (ethnic majorities and cis-heterosexuals) but negatively associated among disadvantaged groups (ethnic minorities and sexual and gender minorities). Specification-curve analysis revealed important variation in the size-and at times, direction-of correlations, depending on how contact and support for social change were measured. This allowed us to identify one type of support for change-willingness to work in solidarity- that is positively associated with intergroup contact among both advantaged and disadvantaged group members.

AB  - Since the declaration of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic confirmed by World Health Organization, work on the development of vaccines has been stimulated. When vaccines are commonly available, a major problem is persistent vaccine hesitancy in many European countries. The main goal of our study was to understand the multidimensional factors inducing this phenomenon in Poland. Our study was carried out at the third wave's peak of the pandemic, with record rates of daily cases and deaths associated with COVID-19. The results indicate that vaccine hesitancy/acceptability should always be considered in an interdisciplinary manner and according to identified factors where most negative attitudes could be altered. Our analyses included the assessment of a representative quota sample of adult Poles (N = 1000). The vaccine hesitancy in the studied group reached 49.2%. We performed stepwise logistic regression modeling to analyze variables set into six trajectories (groups) predicting the willingness to vaccinate. Apart from typical, socio-demographic and economic determinants, we identified the fear of vaccines' side effects, beliefs in conspiracy theories and physical fitness. We were also able to establish the order of importance of factors used in a full model of all impact trajectories.

AB  - Intergroup bias is a ubiquitous socio-cognitive phenomenon that, while sustaining human dependence on group living, often leads to prejudice, inequity, and violence; yet, its neural underpinnings remain unclear. Framed within the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and targeting youth, this study utilized magnetoencephalography to describe intrinsic neural oscillatory processes that represent the intergroup bias and may link with engagement in peacemaking in order to shed further light on the neural mechanisms underpinning intergroup conflict. Across the oscillatory spectrum, from very low to very high frequency bands, the only rhythm found to underlie the intergroup bias was the alpha rhythm. Alpha rhythm was continuously activated across the task and integrated a rapid perceptual component in the occipital cortex with a top-down cognitive-control component in the medial cingulate cortex. These components were distinctly associated with the real-life intergroup dialogue style and expressed attitudes that promote active engagement in peacemaking. Our findings suggest that the cortical alpha rhythm plays a crucial role in sustaining intergroup bias and addresses its impact on concrete intergroup experiences. The results highlight the need to provide opportunities for active peace-building dialogue to youth reared amidst intractable conflicts.

TI  - The Incautious Media, Free Speech, and the Unfair Trial: Why Prosecutors Need More Realistic Guidance in Dealing with the Press
T2  - HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - JUSTICE
AB  - The ABA has proposed a new Standard for the Prosecution Function, Standard 3-1.7, which addresses how prosecutors should communicate with the media. The core portion of that proposal prohibits a prosecutor from making a statement raising a substantial risk of materially prejudicing a criminal proceeding or of unnecessarily heightening public condemnation of the accused. But this proposal is unrealistic. Recent findings in cognitive science suggest that media information overload and its fast pace result in media coverage of high-profile trials that heightens audience's negative emotions while compromising their critical faculties. Audience members thus are enraged at accused offenders and ill-equipped to judge the accuracy and completeness of media crime stories. All media in such cases therefore raise the substantial risks that the proposal prohibits. On the other hand, prosecutors' commentary to the press serves important free speech and political purposes, which this Article details. This Article weighs this balance to come up with an alternative series of guiding ethical principles, including, centrally, the principle that the prosecutor's statements shall not aggravate the unavoidable risks posed to trial fairness. The remaining principles detail how to give this nonaggravation rule greater specificity in channeling prosecutors' ethical decisionmaking in communicating with the media.

TI  - The Effect of Background Music in Shark Documentaries on Viewers' Perceptions of Sharks
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Despite the ongoing need for shark conservation and management, prevailing negative sentiments marginalize these animals and legitimize permissive exploitation. These negative attitudes arise from an instinctive, yet exaggerated fear, which is validated and reinforced by disproportionate and sensationalistic news coverage of shark 'attacks' and by highlighting shark-on-human violence in popular movies and documentaries. In this study, we investigate another subtler, yet powerful factor that contributes to this fear: the ominous background music that often accompanies shark footage in documentaries. Using three experiments, we show that participants rated sharks more negatively and less positively after viewing a 60-second video clip of swimming sharks set to ominous background music, compared to participants who watched the same video clip set to uplifting background music, or silence. This finding was not an artifact of soundtrack alone because attitudes toward sharks did not differ among participants assigned to audio-only control treatments. This is the first study to demonstrate empirically that the connotative attributes of background music accompanying shark footage affect viewers' attitudes toward sharks. Given that nature documentaries are often regarded as objective and authoritative sources of information, it is critical that documentary filmmakers and viewers are aware of how the soundtrack can affect the interpretation of the educational content.

AB  - People with disabilities face attitudinal barriers including prejudice, stereotypes, and low expectations. Many young people without disabilities may doubt that people with disabilities can be fulfilling partners in any loving adult relationship. The objective of the present research was to assess the willingness of non-disabled youth to engage in conjugal relationships with persons with disabilities in Wolaita Sodo town, Ethiopia. Both descriptive and explanatory study designs were used and quantitative data were collected. A self-administered questionnaire was designed and distributed to randomly selected 403 (202 females & 201 males) unmarried youth. Data analysis was undertaken using SPSS software in which both descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were utilized for data presentation. The result showed that most (85.5%) of the young people without disabilities participated in the survey were not willing to have any type of personal relationships with persons with disabilities and the main reason for 44.2% of these respondents being the fear of reaction from family members. Furthermore, it was found that the level of willingness of youth without disabilities to engage in romantic love and marital relationships was not influenced by the socio-economic status of people with disabilities. Moreover, the result of binary logistic regression analysis showed that the willingness of respondents to have marital and romantic love relationship with persons with disabilities is significantly associated to the sex (OR = 2.376; P < 0.05; 95%CI = 1.210, 4.664), raised-up area (OR = 2.512; P < 0.01; 95%CI = 1.319, 4.783), age (OR = 2.886; P < 0.05; 95%CI = 1.012, 8.228) and the presence of person with disability in the family (OR = 3.945; P < 0.01; 95%CI = 1.648, 9.442) of respondents. The findings of the present research demonstrate that people with disabilities have continued to face stereotypes and discriminations. Such stereotypes extend to assuming them as asexual and unfit to carryout roles that arise from love or marital relationships which violates the rights of PWDs to form their own family and have children. It is therefore, important to raise the awareness of young people about the differences between disability and sexuality and that physical disability has nothing to do with sexuality and relationship formation.

AB  - Jeffrey Beall, a US librarian, coined the term "predatory publishing" specifically to describe a movement or phenomenon of open access (OA) journals and publishers that he and others believed displayed exploitative and unscholarly principles. Using a blog to transmit those ideas, and profiling specific cases using blacklists, one of the most polemic aspects of Beall's blog was its tendency to attract and incite academic radicalism. Beall targeted both publishers and standalone journals, but how he precisely determined that an OA journal or a publisher was predatory was in many cases an ambiguity. Beall's deficient and highly subjective criteria, as well as those blacklists' incapacity to clearly distinguish low quality OA publishers from predatory ones, may have negatively impacted the operations of several Beall-blacklisted OA journals and publishers. Freedom of speech that embraces prejudice, via Beall's blog, and the establishment of "predatory" blacklists, are enhanced discriminatory ideologies that continue to be carried downstream from Beall to and by other like-minded individuals and groups who proliferate academic divisiveness and may also be formalizing and institutionalizing a culture of discriminative philosophies by cloning Beall's blacklists and encouraging their continued use.

AB  - Space in Southern African countries is continuously constructed as heterosexual, putting queer individuals at risk of violence. This paper explores the experiences of queer men and transwomen in spaces that they have identified as queerphobic and violent in South Africa and Namibia. In an effort to locate geographies of queerphobic violence, the paper focuses on how queer men and transwomen are prone to both implicit and explicit violence in these spaces. It uses queer geographies as an analytical framework and analyses a subset of qualitative data with 109 partnered queer individuals and 27 queer couples. Our analysis revealed a plethora of spaces that were identified as queerphobic. The data is presented under three major themes: Intersectionality of queerphobia and space; queerphobic and unsafe spaces; and adjustment to self when navigating queerphobic spaces. Spaces identified included participants' homes, immediate communities (mostly rural and township areas), public areas (such as police stations and healthcare centres), roads and local transport areas, shopping areas and places of worship. We found that in order to navigate these spaces, queer participants had to remould themselves both in dress and performance. While decriminalisation is a key agenda for Namibia, social attitude change and challenges to heterosexuality are necessary in both Namibia and South Africa. Further empirical work is needed to understand how queer people locate, use and express their identities in these violent and homophobic spaces.

AB  - Summer extreme heat threatens the health of individuals, especially persons who are involved in outdoor activities. Ensuring the normal function of a city, bus drivers are among those who participate in outdoor physical activities and are exposed to excessive heat in hot summer weather. This qualitative study was performed to explore professional bus drivers' in-depth views of extreme heat risks to their health, and ultimately develop targeted advice and policy interventions for city bus drivers. An interview-based study was performed among professional bus drivers in Jinan, China, including four focus groups with professional bus drivers (n = 37) and three interviews with their managers (n = 14). Five central themes or categories from the bus driver interviews were found: concerns about summer heat; health effects related to extreme heat; adaptive measures; barriers in implementing these adaptive measures; and suggested interventions. The beneficial role of cooling facilities (particularly air-conditioning) during extreme heat are addressed. The barriers not only impede the implementation of behavioral adaptive measures but also enhance the negative attitudes of bus drivers towards their effectiveness. The responsibilities of managers in promoting preventive actions are addressed.

TI  - The Authentic Appeal of the Lying Demagogue: Proclaiming the Deeper Truth about Political Illegitimacy

AB  - We develop and test a theory to address a puzzling pattern that has been discussed widely since the 2016 U.S. presidential election and reproduced here in a post-election survey: how can a constituency of voters find a candidate authentically appealing (i.e., view him positively as authentic) even though he is a lying demagogue (someone who deliberately tells lies and appeals to non-normative private prejudices)? Key to the theory are two points: (1) common-knowledge lies may be understood as flagrant violations of the norm of truth-telling; and (2) when a political system is suffering from a crisis of legitimacy (Lipset 1959) with respect to at least one political constituency, members of that constituency will be motivated to see a flagrant violator of established norms as an authentic champion of its interests. Two online vignette experiments on a simulated college election support our theory. These results demonstrate that mere partisanship is insufficient to explain sharp differences in how lying demagoguery is perceived, and that several oft-discussed factorsinformation access, culture, language, and genderare not necessary for explaining such differences. Rather, for the lying demagogue to have authentic appeal, it is sufficient that one side of a social divide regards the political system as flawed or illegitimate.

AB  - Background/Aim: To investigate recognition, attitudes and causal beliefs regarding dementia in Italian, Greek and Chinese Australians in comparison with 3rd generation Australians. Little is known about dementia literacy in these racial and ethnic minority groups. Methods: A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted of 350 Italian, 414 Greek, 437 Chinese and 500 3rd generation Australians randomly selected from the telephone directory. Results: Third generation participants (85%) were more likely to recognize dementia symptoms in a vignette in comparison to Italian (61%), Greek (58%) and Chinese (72%) participants. Overall, the racial and ethnic minority groups had more negative attitudes about persons with dementia. The racial and ethnic minority groups were more likely to suggest old age and psychosocial risk factors caused dementia, whereas 3rd generation Australians were more likely to suggest brain disease. Differences between ethnic minority and 3rd generation groups remained after controlling for sociodemographic variables. There were differences between Italian, Greek and Chinese participants on markers of acculturation associated with knowledge and beliefs within each group. Conclusions: Racial and ethnic minority groups have poor dementia literacy in comparison to 3rd generation Australians. There is a need for dementia education targeted to and tailored for these groups. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Food and agricultural policy research is often challenged with the issue of commercializing the application of transgenic technology in food production. There is a need for an enhanced understanding of how risk and benefit information influence the general attitudes of farmers towards genetically modified (GM) technology. This paper contributes to existing literature by studying the various adoption factors that influence Ghanaian farmers' attitudes toward GM crop technology by using risk perception as a mediating tool. An empirical choice of methodology which is structural equation analysis was incorporated in this study. We report that, after conducting a survey among 325 respondents, Ghanaian farmers' negative attitudes toward GM technology is as a result of the influence of risk perception on the attributes of the innovative technology (relative advantage, trialability, mass media, and interpersonal relations). We employ a conceptual framework that incorporates Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT) and Risk analysis to assess the relationships between the attributes and attitudes towards GM technology. It was revealed in the structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis that, risk perception exerts a significant influence on the effects of the attributes of GM technology adoption thus reflecting a negative attitude towards the adoption of the related technology. We further discussed the implications for emphasizing the need for a positive attitude toward the acceptance and adoption of GM technology in Ghana.

AB  - Domestic violence (DV) is a widespread social phenomenon, adversely impacting public mental and physical health. The abatement of such issue necessitates a priori social awareness and a posteriori social support. With that in mind, the present study aimed at disclosing dominant discursive constructions of DV among Iranian Instagram users. Driven by Fairclough's (1992) notion of "moments of crisis," critical discourse analysis was employed as the theoretical framework to elucidate the results obtained from 1,028 comments on nine DV-related posts. Our primary objective was to uncover Iranian Instagram commentators' perception of the causes and consequences of DV as well as the perpetrator and victim's roles through probing into the embedded social values and assumptions underpinning such discursive constructions represented within comments. Meticulous inspection of the data yielded six major themes, namely, (a) blaming the responsible, (b) offering solutions to the victims, (c) portraying the male perpetrators, (d) overgeneralizing the transgression, (e) disregarding men's rights, and (f) portraying the female perpetrators. The results indicated that female and male commentators held dissimilar perspectives with regard to DV and that though the conceptualizations of DV were not destitute of prejudice, both perpetrators and victims were encouraged to take requisite steps to minimize the adverse impact of DV on their families and relations as well as on social and public health. The discursive themes identified in the current work may serve as the stepping stone toward the mitigation of DV within society.

AB  - Implicitly-held unconscious associations and attitudes may not align with the beliefs we hold outwardly or explicitly but can affect our professional perceptions, decisions, and actions. In a phenomenological study identifying strategies used to support families in vulnerable circumstances, we conducted nine focus groups to examine how early interventionists (EIs) described families and children, the language they used, and how they used it. Thematic qualitative analysis revealed three themes about families: perceptions of parenting, perceptions of capability, and perceptions of priorities. How EIs characterized families and their interactions with families were both reflective of and counter to family-centeredness and, at times, indicative of implicit bias. This study addresses a critical gap in the field, given the lack of empirical research available about implicit bias in early childhood intervention professionals. Implications for personnel preparation and practice change are discussed to begin the necessary work of moving the field toward more culturally sustaining practices.

KW  - South Africa
AB  - The contact hypothesis predicts that positive contact will reform attitudes towards the out-group and lead to less prejudice as a result. In contexts facing ongoing gender inequality - such as South Africa - romance is usually seen as a beneficial point of contact between unequal groups (heterosexual men and women), because of the sense of intimacy it brings. We investigated romantic practices in a discursive-ethnographic study, by recruiting five young, westernised, middleclass South African couples and interviewing them a number of times about romance and their relationships. We found that these couples positioned being-romantic extremely positively, as a means of sustaining intimacy in marriage. However, we also found that they positioned one version of romance as something they needed to engage in, in order to do relationship-work. We have called this the romantic imperative and suggested that it appears to channel these couples into being romantic in a particular way; one which is restrictive in the way it may be performed and which carries a high cost in terms of the effort, time and financial resources required to perform it successfully. This links to critiques of the contact hypothesis, in that positive contact does not always equate to positive outcomes.

AB  - Newly qualified nurses are mandated to do compulsory community service after completion of their education. Anecdotal evidence indicates that these newly qualified nurses are not properly mentored. The purpose of the study was to explore and describe the experiences of community service nurses (CSNs) regarding their mentoring in the public health facilities in the North West province (NWP), South Africa. A qualitative exploratory descriptive contextual design was applied to get a better understanding of mentoring as experienced by CSNs in the NWP. A tape recorder was used to capture the interviews conducted with 28 newly qualified nurses who completed their community service two to three years ago and who were working at public health facilities in the NWP. ATLAS.ti 7 was used to analyse the data obtained from the participants. Three themes, namely (1) a lack of mentoring, (2) challenges of performing community service nursing, and (3) positive experiences emerged from the data collected from the CSNs. These themes were supported by the following sub-themes: Lack of supervision and support; no proper orientation in general; negative attitudes of other nurses to CSNs; unrealistic expectations from CSNs; getting blamed and bullied; CSNs' lack of practical experience; inadequacy regarding their professional role; use of their education; and gained independence. The study recommended that the facility managers and different stakeholders work together in supporting the CSNs. This will minimise stress and a lack of confidence among CSNs and improve quality patient care.

AB  - Although cognitive behavioral interventions improve attitudes toward mental health treatment and reduce stigma, little is known about which types of attitudes change, or how this change occurs. Active duty soldiers with PTSD (N = 162) were randomized to 10 sessions of exposure therapy or a waitlist. Soldiers were assessed for PTSD and completed measures of stigma and attitudes towards mental health services before randomization and after 5- and 10- sessions of therapy. At post-treatment, soldiers in exposure therapy demonstrated significant improvements in openness to talking about mental health problems and concerns about what others may think if they knew they were seeking mental health treatment, relative to those in the waitlist. There were significant indirect effects from treatment to changes in stigma and attitudes towards mental health treatment through changes in PTSD symptoms at post-treatment. There was also a significant indirect effect from treatment to changes in stigma at post-treatment through changes in attitudes towards mental health treatment at mid-treatment, suggesting attitude change may occur first. Baseline characteristics did not moderate treatment's change in stigma or attitudes. Improvements in PTSD symptoms and positive changes in attitudes towards mental health treatment appear to separately predict later reductions in stigma.

AB  - Objective: To systematically investigate the scope and nature of discrimination and positive treatment experienced by adults with mental health problems when using health services in an Australian population-based survey.
   Methods: Australian adults (n = 1381) who reported a mental health problem or scored high on a screening questionnaire were interviewed about their experience of discrimination and positive treatment from healthcare professionals. Descriptions of experiences were content-analysed to identify key characteristics.
   Results: In all, 11.8% of respondents reported discrimination from a health professional in the past 12 months. The most common types of discrimination included being treated dismissively, being judged and not being listened to, particularly regarding personal history and treatment needs. In contrast, 40.4% reported being treated more positively by their health professional because of their mental health problem. Key types of positive treatment by health professionals were being supportive and understanding and being a good listener. Good quality care approaches were also appreciated, including making a referral, being engaged in the treatment process, regularly checking the status of the person's mental health and providing information.
   Conclusion: A minority of respondents with mental health problems had experienced discrimination from their healthcare professional, potentially interfering with recovery. Anti-stigma education interventions for healthcare professionals should address how to increase knowledge and understanding of mental health problems, reduce negative attitudes and encourage supportive behaviours.

AB  - Normal' is a contentious term. Descriptively, normal' represents what is' as a statistical average. However, the term also represents normative or prescriptive content about what is right' or what should be'. Correspondingly, abnormality is a deviation from the norm. It is both a factual exception to the average and a value judgement about what is a wrong' state of being. Pursuing normal' or deciding against it can be a defining moment in the high technology environment of assisted reproduction. Here, we explore notions of normalcy articulated through legal and policy regimes around screening and testing of gamete and embryo donors. We draw on the work of disability scholars and the diversity of responses to the idea of normal that were registered by four women interviewed in our studies. Three of the interviewees had used or were intending to use donated gametes and the fourth had intended to donate her embryos. We demonstrate how the choice of a particular donor may reveal ingrained or structural prejudice that reconstructs difference as disability. Equally, however, it may reveal a multitude of ways in which difference or deviation from a normative standard is incorporated as a normal part of family formation.

AB  - In this article, I question the production of certain cultural and geographic zones under the new emergency protocols mandated through COVID-19 governance, by drawing upon the theoretical model of Foucault's 'perfectly governed city' (1977, p. 198). I argue that in the first few months of 2020, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic response, the rapid absorption of state directives into the home (two-person rule) and the body (social distancing) set a precedent for a new standard of state boundary-crossing that should be monitored by cultural studies academics with prejudice. Using Berger and Luckman, I point to the State's use of habitualisation through repetition that can be used to monitor and control citizenry at a later time but for different purposes. The purpose of this article is to show that these measures represent a condition of potential COVID-style governance, even after the threat to public health has subsided. In particular, its potentiality lies in the effects of disciplining or training the body (particularly through social distancing practices), routinisation and habitualisation, and the normalisation of bodily surveillance in everyday life.

AB  - This article offers an interpretation of Wharton's first war story in light of classical reception studies. For many First World War writers, the classics offered a way of articulating experiences of war. To date, scholars have not yet acknowledged Wharton's reworking of Homer's Odyssey, the archetypal story of a soldier returning home. I argue Wharton draws on the Odyssey to reinforce her position as an eyewitness to the war in France. She does so to enhance her authority as a noncombatant capable of producing a credible account of the war zone against the prejudices of gender and combat gnosticism. The first allusion to the Odyssey draws attention to the ability of Demodocus, the blind bard, to tell the story of the Trojan War as if (ironically) he had been an eyewitness. Wharton chooses a narrator who prides himself on dealing with factual knowledge, but even he is unable to say what actually happens at key moments of a journey to the war zone. With so many loose threads, Wharton succeeds in giving us a war story that captures the fog of war and the linguistic crisis, which hampers the articulation of experiences far beyond what an individual has heretofore encountered.

AB  - Many voices and stories have been systematically silenced in interpersonal conversations, political deliberations and historical narratives. Recalcitrant and interrelated patterns of epistemic, political, cultural and economic marginalisation exclude individuals as knowers, citizens, agents. Two questions lie at the centre of this article, which focuses on the epistemically - but also politically, culturally and economically - dominant: How can we sabotage the dominant's investment in their own ignorance of unjust silencing? How can they be seduced to become acute perceivers of others' experiences of oppression and reckon with their own participation in it? Situated at the intersection between political theory, aesthetics and epistemology, this article contributes a so-far-unexplored suggestion: that certain literary works create epistemic friction between shared, entrenched prejudices on the one hand, and representations of epistemic exclusion or authority, on the other. Their power to illuminate ideational, moral and experiential limitations makes them valuable tools in problematising, rendering visible and dislocating epistemic injustice, as well as other marginalisations it intersects with. To advance this argument, the article relies on insights from aesthetics, unpacking fiction's multidimensional epistemic potential. Audre Lorde exemplifies literary works' ability to seductively sabotage bias and provide audiences with prosthetic visions of unfamiliar experiences of marginalisation.

AB  - We draw on the literature to categorise the supply chain disturbances (risks and uncertainties) that affect high-value manufacturing (HVM) firms when adopting the following two sourcing strategies: (a) insourcing/nearshore outsourcing, and (b) outsourcing/offshoring. We build a hierarchy structure of disturbances, which was tested in a case study of a European HVM operating in the aerospace industry. A novelty of this study is the quantitative prioritisation and comparison, using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, of the disturbances reported by two groups of managers: three product managers (internally facing) and four supply chain managers (externally facing). Our findings show that managers' perceptions of firm-related, network-related and location-related disturbances can be prejudiced by their functional boundaries. We show that both product and supply chain managers prefer the insource/nearshore outsource strategy, as they feel that the disturbances while outsourcing/offshoring are significantly greater and offset the benefits of low-cost production - a counterintuitive finding. Through in-depth interviews with both groups of managers, we found the mitigation strategies are reshoring, full consideration to the total cost of acquisition (including hidden costs of distant operations) and building clusters in emerging markets to support the firm's regional hub by partnering with its existing suppliers from developed countries.

AB  - One of the intriguing issues connected to power relations in the world of cinema that has yet to be adequately explored is what has happened over the years concerning the dominance and privilege of masculinity as signifying preferred social status. This qualitative study explores this subject based on transcribed semi-structured interviews with 13 award-winning Israeli directors over the age of 55. The research examines two questions: How has the film industry changed its relation to leading, award-winning film directors as they grow older? And, what challenges confront the directors, in terms of their own self-perceptions? These questions capture the collisional intersection between hegemonic masculinity and ageism, because they examine the loss of power attributed to men in the film industry as they reach the second half of their lives. The findings led to the formation of a theoretical model of ageism within the cinematic industry, allowing for the dismantling of the different factors that create obstacles for directors as they get older. The four layers of the model are: arbitrary ageism, manifested in the demands of a rapidly changing industry in a changing world; passive ageism, expressed through encounters with negative attitudes; active ageism, reflected in preventing older directors from receiving funding and from screening their films; and self-ageism, manifested in the directors' attitudes toward themselves.

AB  - Global human health threats, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, necessitate coordinated responses at multiple levels. Public health professionals and other experts broadly agree about actions needed to address such threats, but implementation of this advice is stymied by systemic factors such as prejudice, resource deficits, and high inequality. In these cases, crises like epidemics may be viewed as opportunities to spark structural changes that will improve future prevention efforts. However, crises can also weaken governance and reinforce systemic failures. In this paper, we use the concept of the governance treadmill to demonstrate cross-level dynamics that help or hinder the alignment of capacities toward prevention during public health crises. We find that variation in capacities and responses across local, national, and international levels contributes to the complex evolution of global and local health governance. Where capacities are misaligned, effective local prevention of global pandemic impacts tends to be elusive in the short term, and multiple cycles of crisis and response may be required before capacities align toward healthy governance. We demonstrate that this transition requires broader societal adaptation, particularly towards social justice and participatory democracy.

AB  - The Chinese Government is clear that investment is needed to upskill the workforce, yet VET students, who will play a key role in the upskilling, continue to be positioned at the bottom of the educational hierarchy and suffer considerable societal prejudice. This paper presents new findings on Chinese VET students' perceptions of the job market and career possibilities in the context of the negatively stereotyped VET system. The findings are analysed through the lens of Gramsci's hegemonic power and with reference to Bauman's individualisation. A lack of confidence was found among the VET students who were about to enter the labour market; moreover, they exhibited a passive acceptance of whatever jobs were available, rather than mindfully choosing. Analysis of the findings suggests that the students gave their active consent to the hegemonic human capital form of thinking and accepted their perceived 'inadequacy' and unfavourable places in the division of labour. They were under the impression that they needed to take responsibility for the choices they made as '[our] chances all come down to us'. The study concludes that this individualising force could sustain hegemonic control as well as provide the 'flexible workers' needed by an economy influenced by neoliberalism.

AB  - Tensions between religious freedoms and lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer (LGBTQ) rights have evolved from debates about sinful deviance to competing equality claims. There is a growing debate, originally in the US, but emerging in the UK, about whether religious social workers, particularly those holding fundamentalist Christian beliefs, can deliver affirmative, anti-oppressive services to LGBTQ people. This is important because over two-fifths of social workers identify as Christian and almost a quarter of UK charities, including those running community and residential care services for older people, are religious organisations. These concerns have been highlighted in a recent judicial review involving a social work student, Felix Ngole, who was expelled by the University of Sheffield for making homophobic comments on his Facebook page. The Court of Appeal ruled the University's decision was procedurally flawed and had conflated religious prejudice with discrimination. This paper considers 70 online responses to a Community Care article written by Ngole, which highlight divided opinions within the social work profession. It critically interrogates, within regulatory contexts, whether it is possible to be both deeply opposed to LGBTQ people's lives and yet work affirmatively and anti-oppressively with them. An urgent research agenda is proposed.

AB  - Objective: To identify prospective predictors of psychosocial support service utilisation by people with cancer. Consistent with the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), attitudes towards help seeking and behavioural intentions were predicted to lead to greater support service utilisation.
   Methods: A heterogeneous sample of cancer patients from a regional cancer treatment centre in Australia completed a prospective survey (n=439 at recruitment, 61.2% response rate; n=396 at follow-up) examining the utilisation of psychosocial support services. Demographic variables (age and gender), social support, social constraints, cancer specific distress, and positive and negative attitudes towards help seeking were examined as prospective predictors of support service use. Further, a series of regression analyses explored mediation of the relationship between attitudes to seeking help and support service use by behavioural intentions.
   Results: Approximately 14% of cancer patients reported using a psychosocial support service in the 6 months following the time of the first study. Females and patients with more positive attitudes towards help seeking were more likely to have utilised a support service in the 6 months following recruitment. The relationship between positive attitudes to seeking help and psychosocial support service use was mediated by behavioural intentions.
   Conclusions: The TPB appears to have utility in explaining in part use of psychosocial help services. Future studies should include contextual factors in the model. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Introduction Interprofessional education (IPE) about patient safety positively impacts safety and reduces errors but is challenging to deliver. We aimed to determine if a synchronous virtual IPE program using storytelling and interactive learning impacted student perceptions about patient safety. Methods An IPE patient safety program involving medical and pharmacy students was synchronously delivered virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The program was framed using storytelling about a medication error told by a family member. Post-program survey data, exploring participants' perspectives on the program, collected between July 2020 and November 2020 was retrospectively reviewed. Quantitative results were grouped by the five components of the program. Responses within each category were averaged to generate a summary measure of each student's experience. Qualitative feedback from two survey questions was evaluated. Results There were 236 (96.7% of participants) completed surveys included in the analysis. High proportions of participants responded favorably across all five components of the survey. Qualitative responses were largely positive, with themes of increased empathy, behavior, and attitude change, and meaning making. Conclusion An interactive IPE patient safety program using storytelling about a real-life medication error to frame activities and utilizing a virtual platform was a favorable and impactful method to educate students.

AB  - Affective information about other people's social behavior may prejudice social interactions and bias person judgments. The trustworthiness of person-related information, however, can vary considerably, as in the case of gossip, rumors, lies, or "fake news." Here, we investigated how spontaneous person likability and explicit person judgments are influenced by trustworthiness, employing event-related potentials as indices of emotional brain responses. Social-emotional information about the (im)moral behavior of previously unknown persons was verbally presented as trustworthy fact (e.g., "He bullied his apprentice") or marked as untrustworthy gossip (by adding, e.g., allegedly), using verbal qualifiers that are frequently used in conversations, news, and social media to indicate the questionable trustworthiness of the information and as a precaution against wrong accusations. In Experiment 1, spontaneous likability, deliberate person judgments, and electrophysiological measures of emotional person evaluation were strongly influenced by negative information yet remarkably unaffected by the trustworthiness of the information. Experiment 2 replicated these findings and extended them to positive information. Our findings demonstrate a tendency for strong emotional evaluations and person judgments even when they are knowingly based on unclear evidence.

AB  - Despite the potential of crisis planning and preparedness to create more resilient tourism organisations, the majority of past studies concerned with tourism crises have focused on response and recovery, rather than on crisis planning. Further, most are descriptive in nature and few have undertaken a predictive or explanatory research approach underpinned by a strong theoretical framework. This study attempts to provide a deeper understanding of the psychological factors that influence crisis planning in the Australian accommodation industry. The theory of planning behaviour (TPB) was extended to examine the influence of attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioural control and past experience on crisis planning intentions. Data were collected through a nationwide online survey in Australia (N = 386) and analysed by path analysis using structural equation modelling. In terms of predicting crisis planning intentions, three individual psychological factors (attitude, subjective norms, and past crisis experience) were identified as the key factors that influence crisis planning behaviour, while the path coefficient between perceived control and behavioural intentions was not found to be significant. These findings suggest that managers and industry associations should articulate the advantages of crisis planning and provide resources, tool kits, and workshops to support attitude change and boost reference group support. These findings will also be of interest to tourism sectors other than the accommodation industry, and to countries other than Australia. Future research avenues based on the findings are also outlined. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV and AIDS) is a global health and social problem, with South Africa having an estimated overall prevalence rate of 13.5%. Compared to young male participants, young female participants have been reported to have less knowledge about HIV and AIDS, including prevention strategies, and this is associated with risky sexual behaviours and negative attitudes towards condom use.
   Objectives: The study investigated gender differences in knowledge, attitudes and behaviours towards HIV and AIDS among 542 private higher education students in Johannesburg, South Africa.
   Method: Participants completed an online structured questionnaire measuring knowledge, attitudes and behaviours as well as demographics (including age, gender and relationship status).
   Results: The results indicate that overall there were no significant differences between male and female students in terms of HIV and AIDS knowledge. However, female students had significantly less knowledge with regard to unprotected anal sex as a risk factor for HIV and AIDS. In addition, young female students reported condom use at last sex less frequently than male students. Nonetheless, both genders reported a positive attitude towards condom use and towards people living with HIV and AIDS.
   Conclusion: It is recommended that the relevant authorities at the state and the higher education level seriously consider implementing specific strategies for preventing HIV and AIDS through improved knowledge, attitudes and behaviours among young females.

AB  - This paper examines residents' attitudes to a major non-sport-related mega event, the 2010 Shanghai Expo. Resident attitudes research can ascertain howbest to accommodate host community views, a key issue in developing sustainable tourism strategies. The paper breaks new ground by examining attitudes both before and during the event, revealing considerable fluidity in attitudes, and it examines residents' attitudes in China, reflecting the importance of non-western cultural and political systems on attitude development. The paper contributes to longitudinal research, an areawhere little research is available. Two studies were conducted before and during the 2010 Shanghai World Expo using the same survey instrument. It is based on a representative sample of residents of Shanghai who were asked about their attitudes to Expo 2010. Results indicate that residents on the whole strongly supported (77.9%) or supported (12.7%) the event with all the average scores of the attitude items higher than 5 (on a 1-7 scale). Some negative impacts were identified such as increased prices, traffic problems, crowding and congestion. Residents were classified into three groups in the pre-event survey (whole embracer, ambivalent embracer and neutralist), according to their level of support, and two groups for the survey during the event.

AB  - Previous research has shown that young children robustly display in-group favoritism; that is, they favor in-group over out-group members. Moreover, preschoolers also consider information on morality in their evaluations of others. In the present study, we integrated both aspects: In particular, fifty-six 4- to 6-year-old preschoolers were assigned to minimal groups and observed either prosocial or antisocial acts conducted by either an in-group or an out-group member. After observing these behaviors, children's liking and sharing were significantly higher for moral compared to immoral actors. In addition, children's liking and sharing were substantially higher for in-group compared to out-group actors. However, when children were directly asked to morally evaluate the actor's conduct, no in-group favoritism emerged: In particular, children evaluated immoral acts conducted by an in-group or an out-group agent as equally bad/wrong and similarly claimed that these acts deserve punishment. These findings demonstrate that preschoolers differentially weigh information on group membership and moral valence depending on the type of evaluation, namely sharing and liking versus explicit moral evaluations of others' conduct.

AB  - Human-wildlife conflicts often spur retaliatory killing, which may be a major threat to some wildlife species. Asiatic black bears depredate crops and livestock and also attack humans. We investigated whether human-bear conflicts in Sichuan Province, southwestern China, resulted in increased bear poaching. We conducted semi-structured interviews within 429 15 x 15-km cells across the province, asking villagers about bear occurrence, population trends, attitudes toward bears, human-bear conflicts, responses to bear damage, and bear poaching. Bears raided crops (n = 174 cells), killed livestock (n = 114 cells), and attacked people (n = 49 cells). Fifty percent and 43% of villagers held negative and neutral attitudes toward bears, respectively; attitudes were more negative among people who had previous interactions with bears or lived where bear encounters were more likely. Although killing bears was illegal, villagers in 117 cells (38%) indicated that bear poaching occurred around their villages. However, killing bears was not significantly linked to damage: indeed, killing was more common in areas without human-bear conflicts. Poachers killed bears mainly for trade of their valuable parts (gall bladder and paws, 78.5%). Tibetan people experienced bear damage and also had negative attitudes toward bears, but reported less poaching than Han or Yi people, due to their religious beliefs. Our study indicated that human-wildlife conflicts shaped people's attitudes toward bears, but strong economic incentives, not attitudes, prompted illegal killing. Whereas mitigation of human-bear conflicts could help foster more positive attitudes toward bears and the nature reserves that protect bears, this strategy will not remove the primary threat against this species.

AB  - Internet-delivered interventions can be effective in changing behavior, but more research is needed on effective elements of behavior change interventions. Moreover, although anonymity is one of the advantages of using an online context, it might also increase the perceived distance between the participant and the intervention. Hence, the current study investigated whether the behavior change methods of self-reevaluation and anticipated regret can be used to narrow the perceived distance and, ultimately, foster attitude change. A 3 x 3 factorial between-persons design with an additional control group was used (N = 466), resulting in a total of 10 conditions (n's ranging from 43 to 49). The first factor manipulated is assessment of self-image; cognitive, affective, or the combination of both. The second factor manipulated is behavioral focus; self-image with behavior, without behavior or both with and without behavior. Post-test measurements were conducted immediately after the manipulation. The key finding of the current study is that the behavior change methods of self-reevaluation and anticipated regret did not have an impact on changes in attitude toward oral contraceptive use, nor on the distance perceived by participants. Despite the null results, the current study contributes to the body of evidence regarding self-reevaluation and anticipated regret, which can be integrated in meta-regressions of experimental studies to advance behavior change theory.

KW  - DISPARITIES
AB  - With the increased desire to engage in antiracist clinical research, there is a need for shared nomenclature on racism and related constructs to help move the science forward. This article breaks down the factors that contributed to the development and maintenance of racism (including racial microaggressions), provides examples of the many forms of racism, and describes the impact of racism for all. Specifically, in the United States, racism is based on race, a social construct that has been used to categorize people on the basis of shared physical and social features with the assumption of a racial hierarchy presumed to delineate inherent differences between groups. Racism is a system of beliefs, practices, and policies that operate to advantage those at the top of the racial hierarchy. Individual factors that contribute to racism include racial prejudices and racial discrimination. Racism can be manifested in multiple forms (e.g., cultural, scientific, social) and is both explicit and implicit. Because of the negative impact of racism on health, understanding racism informs effective approaches for eliminating racial health disparities, including a focus on the social determinants of health. Providing shared nomenclature on racism and related terminology will strengthen clinical research and practice and contribute to building a cumulative science.

AB  - Researchers have long documented a significant wage gap between White and Black workers, at least some of which is attributable to discrimination. Drawing on research suggesting that discrimination increases during recessions, we test whether the racial wage gap expands during economic downturns. Using longitudinal wage data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics over a 40-year time period (N = 18,954), we find that the wage gap between Black and White workers increases with the unemployment rate. Moreover, we find that the cyclical wage gap is more pronounced in states in which Whites hold more negative attitudes about Blacks and in states with larger Black populations, suggesting that the racial wage gap expansion during recessions is at least partially driven by discrimination. Finally, we find evidence for at least two mechanisms by which the wage gap expands during recessions. First, we find that Black workers are more likely to lose their jobs during downturns and earn lower wages upon reemployment than comparable Whites. Second, we find that Black hourly workers are slightly more likely to have their hours reduced during recessions than White hourly workers, thereby resulting in lower earnings. These findings suggest that the racial wage gap widens during recessions and that discrimination accounts for at least some of this expansion.

AB  - This study of individualized jury selection for 792 potential jurors across 12 North Carolina capital cases, selected with purposive case selection, analyzes the conversations that occur during voir dire to examine the process that produces decisions about who serves on juries. Lawyers question prospective jurors in voir dire partly to gather information about prospective jurors' ability to decide a case without prejudice. Jury selection, however, suffers from what social scientists call demand characteristics. Demand characteristics provide a respondent with clues about the expected response and interfere with effective information gathering. We identified two characteristics that bear on the presence and strength of demand characteristics: the form and tone of the question. We sorted all 8,583 general legal opinion questions along a four-step scale by combining these characteristics. We then used time-series analyses to examine responses to these questions in sequence. Juror responses were longest and most likely to include an affective utterance when the demand characteristics were weaker, and that loquaciousness and affect fell at each step of the scale. An independent qualitative study replicated these findings, and supported the assertion that length and form are valid measures of quality in this context.

AB  - The article relates Walter Benjamin's insights on history and eternal return to modern spaces in colonial and postcolonial Calcutta/Kolkata. Playing on the renaming of the city, the article argues that contemporary social spaces of urban development associated with "Kolkata" return through 18th and 19th century colonial consumption imperatives to dreams once heralded as Calcutta's fabled "City of Palaces." Today's new developments, which claim to bring a "new world" to postcolonial Kolkata, not surprisingly, return historical commodity logics. Spatial multiplicities of contemporary Kolkata/Calcutta reveal, immanent within the claim to the modern, returned social spaces of consumptive repetition, what Benjamin called "the ever-selfsame." As such, they evidence the dream sleep of modernity-"the newest remaining the same in all its parts"-rather than a continuity of temporal succession, "ages ending and the new stepping out from the old." Attending to the urban modern through the contemporary (post) colonial cityscape requires that we recast how we define the modern and the modern city. But, we must address, co-terminously, both the embedded colonizing assumptions which continue to shape the ordinary prejudices of the modern, as importantly, the constitutive contradictions, layered practices, and material paradoxes fundamental to differentiating global modernities.

AB  - While cross-sectional studies have shown that hookah tobacco smoking (HTS) is an increasingly popular behavior among university students, little is known about factors associated with initiation. This study sought to determine associations between knowledge, attitudes, and normative beliefs and initiation of HTS among university students.
   Data were from a prospective longitudinal cohort study of 569 randomly selected first- and second-year university students. Online questionnaires that were developed in accordance with our composite theoretical model were completed in September 2010 and April 2011.
   About one-seventh (13%) of participants initiated HTS by follow-up. Positive attitudes and favorable normative beliefs were associated with increased adjusted odds of initiation (AOR = 4.12, 95% CI = 2.56, 6.59; and AOR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.35, 2.99, respectively), while negative attitudes were associated with decreased adjusted odds (AOR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.48, 0.80). Correct knowledge regarding toxicants associated with HTS was not significantly associated with initiation.
   While positive attitudes and favorable normative beliefs are associated with initiation of HTS in a cohort of never-users, increased knowledge about toxins is not associated with lower initiation. It may be particularly valuable for educational interventions to attempt to alter positive attitudes and normative beliefs related to HTS.

AB  - In this study, we report on changes to reported attitudes, knowledge, and empathy immediately after and 3 months following a round-robin conversation between "askers" and "answerers" in intergroup sessions created by a local public radio station. Listeners were invited to have short one-on-one in-person conversations with people who were members of an identifiable out-group. These were "Ask A" sessions with Muslims, transgender people, Trump supporters, police officers, formerly homeless, newcomers, immigrants, gun owners, foster parents, journalists, and Special Olympians. We found correlations among our assessed variables for askers (N = 113) going into the interactions and increases in the variables as reported after the event. Two of the expectancy variables remained high three months after the sessions.

AB  - Discussions of intellectual disability are found in medical journals, published biographies, and disability research. However, outside the realm of medicine or personal reminiscence intellectual disability struggles for spaces of social, historical, cultural and imaginative representation. This article addresses these struggles for space and specifically focuses on the imagined space of narrative fiction. Being imagined spaces they should easily be able to accommodate people with disability, and yet, very few characters with intellectual disability are represented or more importantly have agency in narrative fiction. Drawing on work from feminist geographies and literary geographies this article addresses the limiting narrative structures that have been used against fictional characters who have a disability and ways authors may move beyond these limitations. Reconciling feminist geographies and literary geographies allows new critical spatial knowledge around disability to emerge. It is not enough to write characters with disabilities into narrative fiction if the structures surrounding them remain limiting and prejudiced. This article discusses the three main limiting structures in narrative fiction: character representation, narrative voice and genre. Looking at narrative fiction through feminist and literary geographies reveals how these limiting structures function as power hierarchies, and importantly, shows how these imposed structures can be subverted and changed.

AB  - The access, control, and ownership of land and the means of production is an enduring frontier of conflict in post colonial settler states. Whilst racially tinged, colonialism created "structures of feeling" that sanctioned epistemic violence and created an economy of entitlement and belonging that sustained imperial designs. Zimbabwe's independence meant the redistribution and proprietorship of land became a central leitmotif of cadastral politics. The article explores the interplay of the contested tropes of race, entitlement, and indigeneity as they informed the highly polarized land redistribution discourse. The discussion takes stock of the dominant narratives of post-colonial state predations, patronage, populism, and megalomania in contradistinction to the various ways in which whiteness and its prejudices and stereotypes nurtured some hubris of entitlement and belonging that retrogressively not only perpetuated colonial settler values and identities but also entrenched racial distance and indifference. The polarized contestations on land redistribution discourse coalesce around concepts such as restitution, indigeneity, nativity, patriotism, race, and class. Therefore while critiquing state excesses that have masked the honorable intentions of land redistribution, the article underscores the complex ways in which white Zimbabweans contributed to the enduring crisis by obdurately fixating their energies on colonial settler entitlements, values, and identities.

AB  - Single-amino-acid deletions are a common part of the natural evolutionary landscape but are rarely sampled during protein engineering owing to limited and prejudiced molecular understanding of mutations that shorten the protein backbone. Single-amino-acid deletion variants of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) have been identified by directed evolution with the beneficial effect of imparting increased cellular fluorescence. Biophysical characterization revealed that increased functional protein production and not changes to the fluorescence parameters was the mechanism that was likely to be responsible. The structure EGFP(D190 Delta) containing a deletion within a loop revealed propagated changes only after the deleted residue. The structure of EGFP(A227 Delta) revealed that a 'flipping' mechanism was used to adjust for residue deletion at the end of a beta-strand, with amino acids C-terminal to the deletion site repositioning to take the place of the deleted amino acid. In both variants new networks of short-range and long-range interactions are generated while maintaining the integrity of the hydrophobic core. Both deletion variants also displayed significant local and long-range changes in dynamics, as evident by changes in B factors compared with EGFP. Rather than being detrimental, deletion mutations can introduce beneficial structural effects through altering core protein properties, folding and dynamics, as well as function.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this article is to increase awareness regarding the social problem of obesity stigma and its effects on persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In addition, practical strategies to dispel stigma and improve diabetes care that nurse practitioners (NPs) can integrate into practice will be introduced.
   Data sources: Thorough review of the literature was conducted including MEDLINE, PsycINFO and CINAHL, spanning the years 1994-2008.
   Conclusions: Obesity and diabetes are both epidemics that demand immediate attention; however, obesity stigma can act as a barrier to ongoing management of both conditions. Obese patients with T2DM may feel responsible not only for their weight but also their diabetes. Therefore, NPs can employ specific counseling strategies that may be beneficial with T2DM obese patients to improve continuity of care while decreasing weight-related stigmatization.
   Implications for practice: Negative attitudes toward obesity by healthcare professionals can act as a barrier to diabetes management. Primary care providers including NPs must begin through self-reflection to recognize their own attitudes regarding weight-stigma and how these attitudes may affect their patients. By implementing effective strategies to reduce weight bias, an environment conducive to diabetes and lifestyle modification management may prevent patients from forgoing care.

AB  - (1) Background: homeless people are characterized by serious social vulnerability and difficulty in accessing health services worldwide. In Brazil, this population is supported by the Street Clinic teams who are challenged to establish intersectoral networks to expand access and promote unique and humanized care from the perspective of harm reduction. The study aimed to analyze the practices of professionals working at the Street Clinic in a city in the interior of Sao Paulo, Brazil, to tackle the vulnerabilities of the homeless population and expand access to the health care network. (2) Methods: a qualitative study was conducted with a social approach in which we interviewed eight workers from the Street Clinic. Data were analyzed using the thematic content analysis tool. (3) Results: three nuclei of meaning were built: stigma and prejudice as the main barriers to accessing services, harm reduction as a humanized care practice and valuing autonomy, and Street Clinic as a gateway to the health system and main interlocutor with other services. (4) Conclusions: the articulation with network services is marked by contradictory relationships, of conflict and trust, signaling the need for greater investment in educational qualifications and working conditions for professionals at all levels of care to expand access to health care.

KW  - EXPOSURE
AB  - Context: Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is considered as a common occupational hazard among the industrial workers. The printing press is one of the common industrial set up where noise levels are often high. The awareness of people working in such a setup is generally less towards the hazards that is caused by noise exposure. Aim: The current study was designed to identify the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of printing press workers towards NIHL. Settings and Design: Cross-sectional study was carried using an adapted and validated KAP questionnaire. It was administered on 57 workers in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala. Methods and Material: The study was carried out in two phases: phase I included the adaptation and validation of KAP questionnaire to printing press workers. Phase II comprised of the administration of the questionnaire among the study population. Statistical analysis used: Descriptive statistics was used to compile the results. To measure the internal consistency Cronbach's alpha scale was used. Results: The responses obtained from workers showed inadequate knowledge, negative attitudes in certain subdomains and poor practice. Conclusions: The findings from the present study sheds light on the dearth of awareness in printing press workers on hearing conservation and need of training programs to educate the printing press workers towards the effects of NIHL.

AB  - Objective: Physicians' negative attitudes toward patients with obesity are well documented. Whether or how these beliefs may affect patient-physician communication is unknown. To describe the relationship between patient body mass index (BMI) and physician communication behaviors (biomedical, psychosocial/ lifestyle, and rapport building) during typical outpatient primary care visits was aimed.
   Design and Methods: Using audio-recorded outpatient encounters from 39 urban primary care physicians (PCPs) and 208 of their patients, the frequency of communication behaviors using the Roter Interaction Analysis System was examined. The independent variable was measured; patient BMI and dependent variables were communication behaviors by the PCP within the biomedical, psychosocial/lifestyle, and rapport building domains. A cross-sectional analysis using multilevel Poisson regression models to evaluate the association between BMI and physician communication was performed.
   Results: PCPs demonstrated less emotional rapport with overweight and obese patients (incidence rate ratio, IRR, 0.65, 95% CI 0.48-0.88, P = 0.01; IRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.58-0.82, P < 0.01, respectively) than for normal weight patients. No differences in PCPs' biomedical or psychosocial/lifestyle communication by patient BMI were found.
   Conclusions: Our findings raise the concern that low levels of emotional rapport in primary care visits with overweight and obese patients may weaken the patient-physician relationship, diminish patients' adherence to recommendations, and decrease the effectiveness of behavior change counseling.

Results: According to DLUT-Emotion ontology, we examined 3 sentiment orientations of 215,565 valid Weibo posts. Among them, 25,025 posts were judged as positive emotions, accounting for approximately 12%; 22,362 were regarded as negative emotions, accounting for approximately 10%; and 168,178 were judged as neutral emotions, accounting for approximately 78%. Results indicate that the words judged as "Good" have the highest frequency, and words marked as "Happy" have increased over time. The word frequency of "Fear" and "Sadness" showed a significant downward trend. Conclusion: Weibo users have a relatively positive attitude to the TCM in the COVID-19 treatment in general. Results of text analysis show that data with negative emotions is essentially an expression of public opinions to supporting TCM or not. Texts of "Fear" and "Sadness" do not reflect users' negative attitudes to TCM.

AB  - Objectives Concept mapping is used to promote critical thinking and meaningful learning in health professions education. This study aimed to evaluate dental undergraduates' perceptions of concept mapping as a learning tool for oral radiographic interpretation competency. Methods A total of 39 third-year undergraduates at a dental college participated in the oral radiological interpretation session. The students received 1 hour of instruction before creating their concept map (CM). Participants were provided an assignment of four relevant clinical cases to draw an individualised CM. The students' draft and final CM were submitted. The instructor evaluated the CMs to identify whether students could analyse, connect and organise the information in a meaningful way. Among them, 37 completed the questionnaire about their experiences and responses to concept mapping. Results Students perceived concept mapping positively. The instructor's feedback helped them recognise their misconceptions and fostered greater motivation to learn. Students attempted to integrate basic biomedical knowledge and clinical features through cross-linking. However, they also expressed negative attitudes toward concept mapping regarding time consumption and heavy burden. Conclusions Concept mapping motivated students' directed learning and gave them the opportunity to recognise their misconceptions. This study suggests the potential use of CMs as an adjunctive learning strategy in the oral radiographic interpretation class.

AB  - In this paper, I examine whether agents who commit testimonial injustice are morally responsible for their wrongdoing, given that they are ignorant of their wrongdoing. Fricker (Epistemic injustice: power and the ethics of knowing, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2007) argues that agents whose social setting lacks the concepts or reasons necessary for them to correct for testimonial injustice are excused. I argue that agents whose social settings have these concepts or reasons available are also typically excused, because they lack the capacity to recognise those concepts or reasons. Attempts to trace this lack of capacity back to an earlier culpable wrongdoing will often fail, due to there being no point at which these perpetrators knowingly chose to develop their prejudices. Attempts to ground culpability under some Attributionist accounts of moral responsibility will also fail. This is because perpetrators' lack of awareness of what they are doing makes it the case that they are not expressing objectionable evaluative judgments in the way required for blameworthiness. Finally, I argue that our temptation to blame agents who commit testimonial injustice is not completely unfounded. Appealing to Watson's (Philos Top 24(2):227-248, 1996) attributability/accountability distinction allows us to make sense of how some responses to the jurors are appropriate, despite their being excused.

AB  - Although the managerial practice of cheating spans complex and heterogeneous situations (from deception and trickery to fraud and swindling), most business ethics scholars consider that the very idea of cheating is indefensible on moral grounds, and quickly dismiss it as wrongdoing. This paper proposes to fine-tune this conventional moral assessment by arguing that some forms of cheating can be justified-or at least excused. To do so, it starts with a value-free definition of cheating that covers a wide diversity of situations: "breaking the rules while deliberately leading or allowing others to think they have been respected." While using this definition at the metaethical level, the paper contends that the moral assessment of cheating depends on the obligation to comply with the rules. There are rules which do not entail moral obligations, and there are special circumstances where other more important obligations override the obligation to comply with the rules. Furthermore, the paper argues that respecting the penalty rules also influences the moral assessment of cheating on the rules. The key interest of this endeavor lies in contributing to building a more solid theoretical framework for the study of cheating in management, which may replace our common prejudices and basic intuitions on this matter.

AB  - Objective Negative physician attitudes toward patients with substance use disorders (SUD) pose a significant barrier to treatment. This study tests the overall and intra-individual change in attitudes of second year medical students after exposure to a 15 hour SUD course.
   Methods Two cohorts of second year medical students (2014 and 2015) responded to an anonymous 13-item previously published survey exploring personal views regarding patients with SUD using a four-point Likert scale. Students were surveyed one day before and up to one month after course completion. Survey items were grouped into the following categories: treatment optimism/confidence in intervention, moralism, and stereotyping. The Wilcoxon nonparametric signed-rank test (alpha = 0.05) was used to compare the pre- and post-survey responses.
   Results In 2014 and 2015 respectively, 118 and 120 students participated in the SUD course with pre- and post-response rates of 89.0% and 75.4% in 2014 and 95.8% and 97.5% in 2015. Of the 13 survey questions, paired responses to eight questions showed a statistically significant positive change in attitudes with a medium (d = 0.5) to large effect size (d = 0.8). Items focused on treatment optimism and confidence in treatment intervention reflected a positive attitude change, as did items associated with stereotyping and moralism.
   Conclusions These results support the hypothesis that exposure to a course on SUD was associated with positive change in medical students' attitudes toward patients with SUD.

AB  - Our study aimed to determine how age-and disease-related difficulties were associated with attitudes and beliefs about driving self-regulation in men and women in the baby boomer and older generations. Three hundred and ninety-nine men (n =204) and women (n=195) aged between 48 and 91 years participated in a cross-sectional study of Australian drivers. Demographic characteristics and measures of driving confidence, driving difficulty and driving self-regulation; perceptions of visual, physical and cognitive capacity; and attitudes and beliefs about driving were obtained. Driving self-regulation in men and women was explained by different mechanisms. For men, self-report of visual and cognitive difficulties and poor driving confidence predicted driving self-regulation. For women, negative attitudes toward driving mediated the associations found between health-related difficulties and driving self-regulation. Barriers to driving self-regulation were not associated with the driving self-regulatory practices of men or women. Regardless of generation, women reported poorer driving confidence, greater driving difficulty and more driving self-regulation than men. We concluded that age-and disease-related difficulties are related to increasing driving self-regulation in mature men and women. These results indicate that different pathways are needed in models of driving self-regulation for men and women regardless of generational cohort. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this article is to explore how tendencies to stereotype minority ethnic groups intersect with lay discourses about them in ways that can reproduce cultural prejudices and reinforce inequalities in access to services and health outcomes. Drawing upon Black feminist and cultural studies literature, we present a theoretical examination, the stereotypes of the Black woman as mammy' and matriarch'. We suggest that the influence of these two images is central to understanding the normalisation of the larger Black female body within African Caribbean communities. This representation of excess weight contradicts mainstream negative discourses of large bodies that view it as a form of moral weakness. Seeking to stimulate reflection on how unacknowledged stereotypes may shape clinical encounters, we propose that for Black women, it is the perception of strength, tied into these racial images of mammy' and matriarch' which may influence when or how health services or advice are both sought by them and offered to them. This has particular significance in relation to how body weight and weight management are/are not talked about in primary care-based interactions and what support Black women are/are not offered. We argue that unintentional bias can have tangible impacts and health outcomes for Black women and possibly other minority ethnic groups.

AB  - Cultured meat is an emerging food technology that has the potential to resolve many of the social, environmental and ethical issues surrounding traditional factory farming practices. Recently, research has begun to explore consumer attitudes to the product, revealing a number of barriers and demographic predictors. However, our understanding of the psychological mechanisms that underpin attitudes to cultured meat remains limited. In the current study, we draw on an attitude roots model (Hornsey & Fielding, 2017) to explore a range of psychological mechanisms that may underpin attitudes to cultured meat. In terms of negative attitudes and intentions toward cultured meat, the most powerful predictors were food neophobia, political conservatism, and distrust of food scientists. When it comes to absolute opposition to cultured meat-defined by the unconditional belief that it should never be allowed under any circumstances-the strongest predictors were food and hygiene disgust sensitivity subscales, food neophobia, and conspiratorial ideation. A number of presumed mechanisms held no relationships to cultured meat attitudes, including social dominance orientation, speciesism, and naturalness bias. The null results on naturalness bias are of particular interest given recent research identifying concerns about naturalness as a key barrier to consumer acceptance. These results demonstrate the need for a more nuanced understanding of the psychological mechanisms that contribute to cultured meat attitudes and engagement.

AB  - AimTo examine attitudes to patient safety in two intensive care units from the perspective of health care professionals in Saudi Arabia.
   BackgroundDespite adverse errors leading to poor patient outcomes, there is a paucity of literature, including staff perceptions, on adverse errors in Saudi Arabian intensive care units.
   MethodsA descriptive cross-sectional design was used. Health professionals (n=144) completed the safety attitude questionnaire-intensive care unit.
   ResultsThe scores from the six safety domains of the safety attitude questionnaire-intensive care unit showed all respondents had a negative attitude towards patient safety, with participants in one intensive care unit scoring lower in all domains. The mean scores across all domains ranged from 47.1 to 70.3 on a 100-point scale, with the lowest score reported in the perceptions of management domain. Respiratory therapists reported a significantly higher job satisfaction score than nurses, and physicians rated communication amongst themselves and nurses as high.
   ConclusionThere are significant challenges for safety culture in this study, with negative attitudes across all domains.
   Implication for Nursing ManagementManagers may need to review and consider policies relating to safety culture including workforce planning, leadership and patient centred care. Further research into this global health priority is required to contribute to improving patient safety in intensive care units.

AB  - Although literature provides strong evidence for the beneficial role of outgroup contact, longitudinal knowledge regarding the formation and change of outgroup contact remains improvable. Using a longitudinal, large-scale data set including 6,726 majority and minority participants (M-age = 14.98 years at Wave 1;55% female) from 4 western European countries that were followed in 3 waves over 2 years, we systematically examined the development of outgroup contact during adolescence and tested the role of hypothesized predictors (i.e., intergroup attitudes and social identity) for explaining this development. In the majority, growth curve models revealed consistent patterns of ethnic homophily characterized by a continuous decline of outgroup contact, whereas this negative growth was buffered by a positive change of intergroup attitudes and a negative change of national identity during adolescence. In contrast, in the minority, outgroup contact was characterized by higher mean levels and a nonlinear development (i.e., no systematic decline or increase) of outgroup contact. Findings highlight the developmental importance of adolescence for promoting positive intergroup relations, especially for the majority, and emphasize the usefulness of contact interventions with adolescent students in school.

AB  - This paper reports on an exploratory interpretivist study of global millennial consumers' subjective interpretations of ethnic targeted marketing communications in a multicultural marketplace. Although millennials are the most ethnically diverse generational cohort that has ever existed, little is known about their interpretation of ethnicity depiction in advertising and how they draw from advertising imagery to infer their ethnic identity, social acceptance and inclusion in a culturally diverse society. Within the broader context of the global consumer culture, this paper draws on theories of social identity, persuasion and multiculturalism to investigate whether ethnic marketing is still applicable to reach the diverse millennial consumers. In-depth interviews with the photo elicitation technique were conducted with an ethnically heterogeneous sample of twenty-three millennial individuals in the UK. The findings show that ethnic millennials' multicultural identities cannot be primed through mono-ethnic targeted messages, whereas multi-ethnic embedded marketing communications provide a more effective access for the ethnically diverse millennial consumers in the modern society and can potentially be a viable solution towards enhanced wellbeing and lower prejudice. This study contributes to insights into millennial consumers' experience in the multicultural marketplace, the sociocultural meanings of ethnic advertising and the opportunities and challenges of reaching to this diverse audience.

AB  - Research on men's experiences of sexual victimization is limited and largely outdated. The present study seeks to remedy this issue by qualitatively examining the accounts of nine male-on-male survivors of rape and sexual abuse in the UK. It examines survivors' experiences of psychological distress post-incident, the influence and manifestation of male rape myths, challenges in self-recognition and disclosure, and barriers to accessing therapeutic support and reporting to the Criminal Justice System (CJS). Participants took part in one-to-one, semi-structured video interviews, and an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) was utilized to identify four superordinate themes of participants' experiences: i) gendered narratives, ii) coping with the abuse, iii) masculinity, and iv) reporting to the police. These themes emphasized the stigma and hostility repeatedly encountered by survivors after their victimization. Participants provided an account of short and long-term psychological issues following the abuse, emphasizing the role of self-perceptions of masculinity in the development of unhealthy coping mechanisms. Findings also highlighted the prevalence of prejudice and rape mythology that characterized negative encounters within the public, voluntary agencies, and the CJS. Results are discussed in relation to current service provision in the UK, recommendations for future research, and avenues for improvements across multiple vital entry points.

AB  - Introduction: Inadequate water supply, unsanitary behaviors, and sterile environments all have a role in the transmission of infectious diseases. The lack of knowledge, behavior, and practices (KBP) on WASH is one of the most common causes of infectious disease transmission.
   Objective: To assess citizen knowledge and behavior about sterilizing drinking water in district and sub-districts at Kirkuk governorate.
   Methods: "Cross-sectional study design" was used the study carried out Al-Hawija district. The study conducted at Alhawija district for 20 village. The study period from 3rd February 2021 to the 10th of June 2021. A non-probability (purposive) sample of (1200) citizen from village. With the end goal of information assortment, a survey design was built which contains (41) things Demographic information incorporate (9) things, general information about sterilizing water include (10) items knowledge of citizen about sterilizing water include (7) items and knowledge of citizen about effect unsterile water include (7) items finally behavior of citizen about sterilizing water include (8) items. Anova and T.test were used to assess the association between study variables and knowledge and attitude of citizen at level of association among variables at the significance level of p<0.05by using SPSS version 24.0.
   Result: (1200) participated complete the survey. The statistics suggest that citizens aged 20 to 29 years old account for a large percentage of the population (30.2 percent). Also the results show (56.5 %) were male. Most of the citizens were single and constituted (63.4%). Also, the result shows high percentage from citizen were Retired and constitute (33.1). With regard to education level most of the citizen were complete Primary school and constitute (30.2%). (30.2%) from citizen never have Concomitant diseases. With relation to smoking, the majority of the subjects (63.3 %) were nonsmoker. Also the result shows (73.6%) of the sample no family history for kidney stone, finally (40.3 %) from citizen was using river water. Also the result shows poor knowledge and negative attitudes of citizen toward using of sterile water. In addition, the data analysis revealed that there is a statistically significant relationship between citizen knowledge and attitudes and education level and water source in rural areas.
   Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the citizen have poor knowledge and negative behaviors toward sterile water at rural area, also the result shows a significant statistical association between knowledge and attitudes of citizen with education level, gender, marital state and source of water in rural area.

AB  - Student nurses' negative attitudes towards men who are homeless and mentally ill disrupt development of therapeutic relationships. Without therapeutic relationships these men may feel stigmatized. Assessing student attitudes allows for insights to improve students' abilities to develop therapeutic relationships. The purpose of this research was to assess student nurses' pre- and post-perceptions towards homeless mentally ill clients during a mental health clinical through analysis of pictorial data.
   Data was analyzed through a qualitative, phenomenological method. On the first and last days of clinical experience, students were asked to draw a picture in response to the question: "How far apart are you from these men?" We analyzed pre- and post-drawings separately and changes were compared.
   Four pre-attitude themes and two post-attitude themes were identified. Pre-attitude themes demonstrated student drawings as geographically distanced from the clients and living in two different worlds. Post-drawings reflected themes where clients and students were under the same roof and often physically touching.
   We suggest using this easily reproducible, inexpensive method to gain insights into student attitudes. The difference in the drawings objectively demonstrates the effectiveness of clinical experiences in changing student nurse attitudes towards men who are homeless and mentally ill.

AB  - Australian mental health policy clearly articulates recovery focus as the underpinning of mental health services. Barriers to achieving a recovery focus are identified in the literature, with negative attitudes of health professionals receiving particular attention. The involvement of people with lived experience of significant mental health challenges and mental health service use is essential to enhancing more positive attitudes. Lived-experience involvement in the education of nurses is evident; however, it is generally limited and implemented on an ad hoc basis. Overall, there is a paucity of literature on this topic. A qualitative exploratory study was undertaken to elicit the views and perceptions of nurse academics and lived-experience educators about the inclusion of lived experience in mental health nursing education. One major theme to emerge from the research was issues of fear and power, which included three subthemes: facing fear, demystifying mental illness, and issues of power. Lived-experience involvement has an important role to play in the education of nurses in addressing fear and demystifying the experience of mental illness. The power that lived-experience educators exercised in their roles varied considerably, and for many, was limited. Therefore, the effectiveness of lived-experience involvement requires a more equitable distribution of power.

T2  - LANCET GLOBAL HEALTH
LA  - English
KW  - JUSTICE
KW  - POWER
AB  - This Viewpoint calls attention to the pervasive wrongs related to knowledge production, use, and circulation in global health, many of which are taken for granted. We argue that common practices in academic global health (eg, authorship practices, research partnerships, academic writing, editorial practices, sensemaking practices, and the choice of audience or research framing, questions, and methods) are peppered with epistemic wrongs that lead to or exacerbate epistemic injustice. We describe two forms of epistemic wrongs, credibility deficit and interpretive marginalisation, which stem from structural exclusion of marginalised producers and recipients of knowledge. We then illustrate these forms of epistemic wrongs using examples of common practices in academic global health, and show how these wrongs are linked to the pose (or positionality) and the gaze (or audience) of producers of knowledge. The epistemic injustice framework shown in this Viewpoint can help to surface, detect, communicate, make sense of, avoid, and potentially undo unfair knowledge practices in global health that are inflicted upon people in their capacity as knowers, and as producers and recipients of knowledge, owing to structural prejudices in the processes involved in knowledge production, use, and circulation in global health.

AB  - Objective: Our objective is to examine the relationship of patient and provider characteristics and communication with chronic non-cancer pain and opioid management in primary care.
   Method: We conducted an observational study using audio-recorded primary care appointments (up to 3/patient) and self-reported assessments of primary care providers (PCPs) and patients. We coded visit transcripts for 1) opioid and pain management talk and 2) mental health and opioid safety talk.
   Results: Eight PCPs and 30 patients had complete data for 78 clinic visits. PCPs and patients engaged in more opioid and pain management talk when patients reported greater pain catastrophizing and PCPs reported higher psychosocial orientation. PCPs and patients engaged in talk about mental health and opioid safety when patients reported greater anxiety, higher working alliance with their PCP, and when PCPs reported higher burnout. PCPs' negative attitudes about opioids were associated with fewer discussions about mental health and opioid safety.
   Conclusions: Our results should facilitate design of interventions that improve communication and, ultimately, pain outcomes for patients.
   Practice Implications: Clinicians can use our results to increase patient engagement in discussions about opioid use and pain management or mental health and safety discussions. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To examine factors that are associated with the apprehension levels of oncology nurses toward hospice care. Factors examined in this study included demographics, nursing experience, education levels, title and post, personal experiences, and attitudes toward end-of-life care.
   Methods: Questionnaires were provided to nurses (n=201) from three first-tier hospitals in China. A quantitative scale, Professional End-of-life Care Attitude Scale (PEAS), was used to assess personal and professional apprehension levels toward hospice care. The PEAS was translated to Chinese with terms adapted to the cultural environment in China. Statistical analyses were performed to examine the relationships between the apprehension levels and various factors.
   Results: The total PEAS scores exhibited internal consistency and reliability, with a Cronbach alpha=0.897 and Pearson's r=0.9030. Of the 201 nurses, 184 provided a valid response (91.5%). Education level was significantly correlated with personal (P<0.01) and professional apprehension levels (P<0.05). Higher apprehension level was found in nurses with less education.
   Conclusion: The PEAS quantitative survey is useful for evaluating apprehension levels of nurses toward hospice care. Nurses with more education experienced less anxiety when providing care for terminally ill patients. The findings suggested that education programs on hospice care could be strengthened to help nurses cope with negative attitudes toward end-of-life care.

KW  - weathering degree of rock
KW  - granite
AB  - Due to weathering processes that occur all around the world, rocks that are exposed eventually undergo physical and chemical changes. These weathering processes have the potential to turn fresh rocks into soft and weakened derivatives, leading to the collapse and subsidence of structures, such as tunnels, dams, and others, as well as natural structures, such as cliffs and slopes. This study attempts to employ hyperspectral imaging and a deep learning network called Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in the effort to achieve a reliable process for rock weathering degree assessment. This study employs a hyperspectral image camera capable of detecting electromagnetic radiation from 400 nm-1000 nm with a spectral resolution of 204 bands. The CNN algorithm used in this study is based on a modified VGG-16 architecture. The total amount of data from granite samples employed amounts to 19,456 files. 80% of the total data were used as learning data and the remaining 20% as testing and validation data. The results show that the system has an average precision of over 94%. The study, therefore, concludes that the conjunction of hyperspectral imaging with CNN is a practicable process for the evaluation of the degree of weathering granite without the need for specialised human expertise or prejudice.

AB  - It is well established that intergroup contact is associated with more positive intergroup attitudes. Associations between intergroup contact and active outcomes more closely tied to social change are less reliable. Whereas some research demonstrates that intergroup contact can promote social change, other research paradoxically demonstrates that intergroup contact can undermine social change. We review the literature with the goal of explaining this apparent paradox. We present a model for understanding when intergroup contact can contribute positively to active outcomes while still predicting positive intergroup attitudes. Specifically, upon reaching a contact threshold whereby outgroup members are viewed as potential friends, having cross-group friendship that involves recognition of group differences and condemnation of group inequality may promote positive intergroup attitudes as well as positive intergroup behavior, policy support, and collective action aimed at reducing group inequality. We propose that a cross-group friendship involving these qualities will promote ambivalence toward the advantaged group, which will be beneficial in terms of social change related outcomes. It is critical for future research to examine the conditions under which cross-group friendships involving these qualities are formed and maintained.

AB  - Purpose. The objectives of this study were (1) to determine what young cancer survivors know about the effect of their cancer on fertility, how fertility difficulties affected their lives and whether they would opt for fertility preservation (FP) and (2) to assess the sources of information and the helpfulness of them.
   Methods. Women of at least 18 years with cancer affecting reproductive function were recruited from eight cancer websites for this online survey. The Cancer and Fertility Survey (CFS) contained items from validated inventories and items to assess fertility issues in cancer patients. Quantitative analyses (t-tests, chi(2), analysis of variance) and thematic analysis of free text data were performed.
   Results. Of the 80 participating women, 68.1% rated the risk of infertility as high. The mean number of professionals consulted was 3.56 (SD = 2.7), but 20% of women had not discussed fertility with any professional. The weighted mean helpfulness index was the highest for spouses and oncologists. Strength of positive attitudes towards FP was significantly greater than that of negative attitudes.
   Conclusion. The need to discuss fertility is high among women searching for information on cancer websites. Options to preserve fertility were positively viewed but the actual use may be limited by concerns about safety.

AB  - Based on the case of Chinese tourists' travel to Japan, this study is aimed at providing more insight on the relationship between international politics and travel decisions. This study identifies the generational gaps of attitudinal structure between the Chinese Cohort 60 (CC 60) and Chinese Post-80s (CP 80) based on the textual data collected through in-depth interviews with two generations of Chinese tourists. The fluctuation of Chinese tourist arrivals in Japan following diplomatic incidents suggests that Sino-Japanese historical and contemporary political incidents may have an effect on tourism attitude. Result indicated that the association between the attitudes toward tourism, Japan, and political incidents are stronger for CC 60 than for CP 80. Compared with CP 80, CC 60 tourists hold stronger stereotype and prejudice toward the Japanese, as well as experience considerable pressure from anti-Japanese social norm, thereby producing cognitive dissonance for those interested in visiting Japan. CP 80 hold more neutral attitude toward Japan tourism and their intention to travel to Japan is less influenced by their attitude toward this country and the historical incidents. The findings have implication on sustainable Sino-Japan tourism and pointed out the important role of political incidents in tourist behavior.

AB  - Older lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer (LGBTQ) people are concerned that their needs will not be recognised, understood or met in older age care spaces. Some are especially worried about care provided by religious care organisations and/or staff with negative beliefs about LGBTQ people and their lives. While these issues have been raised at the margins of previous research, there has not, until now, been a study which has focussed upon them. This article reports on a recent UK preliminary scoping consultation research project, which explored older LGBTQ people's views about possible care from religious organisations and/or carers. The findings highlight four key fears about: 1) inferior care quality; 2) a lack of affirmative, anti-oppressive care; 3) religious-based prejudice and discrimination; 4) religious conversion attempts. Each theme is considered in relation to social justice, i.e., equality of resources, recognition, representation, and relationality. The need for open dialogue and debate is highlighted and a research agenda is proposed. There is an urgent need to understand what happens in the delivery of care to LGBTQ people by religious care organisations and/or staff, place the concerns identified here in their proper context and determine the appropriate responses.

AB  - Airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is frequently influenced by multiple positioning errors when converting laser echo signals into three-dimensional geospatial data. We focus on the error factor of airborne platform vibration, and analysis of the influence of platform instability on the output point cloud data by simulation, so as to correct it in the subsequent work. First, the influence of LiDAR attitude change on the formation of point cloud was analyzed from the airborne LiDAR geo-location equation. Then, the fluid characteristics of airborne platform in hovering state were obtained by simulation, and the vibration transfer relationship between airborne platform and LiDAR and the vibration model of LiDAR system were obtained based on the dynamic model, which was built on the flexible connection between airborne platform and LiDAR. Finally, we coupled the above vibration model with the airborne LiDAR geo-location equation and conducted a simulation to evaluate its effect on point cloud generation in a LiDAR system. The simulation results show that in the 100-m hovering state, the point cloud error caused by unmanned aerospace vehicle vibration can reach 200 and 400 mm in the horizontal and vertical directions, respectively. Moreover, due to the high vibration frequency, this error factor will also lead to the distortion of point cloud image, which will affect the subsequent point cloud data recognition.

AB  - Purpose of the research: There is increasing recognition of the importance of good communication between healthcare professionals and patients facing cancer or end of life. In England, a new national 3-day training programme called 'Connected' has been developed and is now mandatory for all cancer and palliative care professionals. This study aimed to explore the attitudes of staff in one region to undertaking this training.
   Methods and sample: A survey questionnaire was developed through a series of discussions with experts and semi-structured interviews with five healthcare professionals. The questionnaire was distributed to 200 cancer and palliative care staff; 109 were completed and returned.
   Key results: There were significant differences between doctors' and nurses' attitudes to communication skills training. with doctors demonstrating more negative attitudes. More nurses than doctors felt that communication skills training should be mandatory for cancer and palliative care professionals (p <= 0.001), whilst more doctors felt that these staff should already be skilled communicators and not require further training (p <= 0.001). Nurses also self-rated their communication skills more highly than doctors.
   Conclusions: The current 'one size fits all' approach being taken nationally to advanced communication skills training does not meet the training preferences of all healthcare professionals, and it is recommended that tailoring courses to individuals' needs should be considered.

AB  - Background It is now widely accepted that dark-complexioned skin individuals can be safely treated with laser hair removal (LHR). However, some people are still concerned about the side effects or have been told that hair removal laser is not possible in darkly pigmented skin.
   Aims To measure the knowledge and attitudes of African Americans about LHR and assess the need for additional education focusing on LHR.
   Patients/Methods A cross-sectional survey with questionnaire was administered to African American subjects between the ages of 21-70 years. Questions comprised attitudes and knowledge about LHR. Demographic characteristics, attitudes, and knowledge were assessed by descriptive statistics. Results were considered statistically significant if P < 0.05.
   Results The survey was completed by 221 African American subjects. There were only 122 subjects (55.2%) who knew that dark-skinned individuals can be treated with LHR. Only 44.3% of subjects believed that dark-skinned people are more prone to develop hyperpigmentation from LHR. Female subjects and subjects with higher educational background have a higher tendency to consider LHR as a treatment choice (P < 0.05).
   Conclusions This study shows that many African Americans still have negative attitudes and lack knowledge about LHR. The results of this study provide information that can lead to better informed dermatology providers who can then better educate patients of color regarding LHR knowledge.

AB  - Across two studies, we examined the double-edged sword hypothesis, which outlines effects of weight-related beliefs and public health messages on physical and mental health. The double-edged sword hypothesis proposes that growth mindsets and messages (weight is changeable) predict reduced well-being and stigma via an increase in blame, but also predict greater well-being via an increase in efficacy and less stigma via a reduction in essentialist thinking. We tested this model in a correlational study (N = 311) and in an experimental study, randomly assigning participants (N = 392) to different weight-based public health messages. In Study 1, growth mindsets predicted greater onset blame and more offset efficacy. Blame did not predict any of the outcomes. However, offset efficacy predicted reduced risk for eating disorders, fewer unhealthy weight control behaviors, and less psychological distress. And, growth mindsets had a negative indirect effect on outcomes. In Study 2, we experimentally demonstrated that a changeable message about the nature of weight, designed to also reduce blame, indirectly decreased eating disorder risk, unhealthy weight control behaviors, body shame, and prejudice through increased offset efficacy and decreased social essentialism. This work contributes to our theoretical understanding of the psychological consequences of weight beliefs and messages on well-being and stigma.

AB  - Since 2000, the UK Home Office has implemented a policy of dispersal whereby asylum seekers are housed on a no choice basis in locations around the country. Although the aim of dispersal is to determine local and national movements of asylum seekers, surprisingly little attention has been paid to the role played by dispersal in onward migration flows. Indeed, the majority of literature on UK dispersal has focused upon critiquing the policy for being driven by void housing and concentrating vulnerable populations in deprived, inner city neighbourhoods. Dislocated from existing social networks, asylum seekers have experienced prejudice, racial harassment and isolation. The aim of this article is to sketch out the current state of knowledge on onward migration in the context of UK dispersal policy. Based upon quantitative data analysis and case study material, the complexity of onward migration flows is examined. This includes identifying the geography of onward migration flows as well as the diversity of individuals engaged in movement around the UK, both during the asylum process and after being granted or refused refugee status. Along with relevant literature on past dispersal schemes in the UK, quantitative data is employed to highlight gaps in knowledge as well as discussing ways forward for future data collection and analysis.

AB  - Emerging ridesharing travel could be an effective way in China to reduce travel demand by cars, which can further seek to shift personal transportation choices from an owned asset to a service used on demand and lessen the traffic jam and emissions. Drawing on the raw observed ridesharing trip data provided by DiDi Chuxing company, this study evaluated the direct environmental benefits of ridesharing resulted from the travel mode shift and the indirect environmental benefits resulted from the attitude change towards car purchase behavior. The megacity Beijing is taken as the empirical context given its more serious situation of traffic congestion and difficulties for car purchase. Estimation results show that direct annual energy savings made by ridesharing are approximately 26.6 thousand tce, and annual emission reductions of CO2 and NOx are approximately 46.2 thousand tons and 253.7 tons, respectively. Besides, using ridesharing service will lead to substantial energy savings and emission reductions from the long-term perspective attributing to the weakening willingness on purchasing new cars. Promoting EVs among ridesharing vehicles and switching to clean electricity generation as well as improving vehicle efficiency can further enhance the environmental benefits of ridesharing, with maximum effects amounting to 67% of energy savings and 57% of CO2 emission reductions compared to 2016 level of the fuel related energy consumption and emissions made by ridesharing.

AB  - Government support for the ongoing use of fossil fuels has polarised public opinion in Australia regarding the country's transition to low carbon energy generation. Despite this, polls indicate a desire for more meaningful engagement in the global energy transition amongst the Australian populace, which has stimulated a growing interest in Community Owned Renewable Energy (CORE). This study used a questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) to evaluate intention to invest in a CORE project that would be sited in Queensland, Australia. The analysis also sought to identify the considerations that would have the greatest association with this intention. 67% of respondents indicated an inclination to invest in the project and the mean intention score was 5.0 out of a possible maximum of 7 in favour of investing. This mean was relatively stable across almost all demographic sub-categories for gender, age, employment and income. Beliefs related to the community benefits that the initiative would provide were the most reliable attitudinal predictor of intention to invest. The findings concur with other studies that indicate widespread support for renewables amongst Australians and which suggest that "not in my back yard" (NIMBY) concerns are not a significant influence on negative attitudes to-wards renewable energy in Australia.

LA  - English
KW  - SUPPORT
AB  - Policing is a high-stress occupation requiring emotional management when facing job-related violence, threats to safety and well-being, work-life disruption, and unpredictable hours. A national health pandemic coupled with public order and restraint imperatives has compounded the levels of stress in policing. In the UK, new working patterns have been negotiated to manage the constraints of a different working environment during COVID-19. Using a self-administered survey, this article explores the experiences of 473 female police officers working during the first lockdown in 2020. The article shows that the COVID-19 preventative measures forced police services to navigate new and varied working patterns for their employees. Previous resistance to flexible working practices in policing was put aside as police services sought to manage the virus in its own ranks as well as policing the public. Preliminary findings suggest that officers working from home were more likely to feel satisfied with management responses compared with those working on the front line, although negative attitudes from colleagues and management towards those working from home were present. Those not working from home reported higher levels of stress related to their Force's lack of communication with them about their welfare.

AB  - In 2018, the Australian Government adopted an 'opt-out' strategy to increase participation in My Health Record (MHR), the national digital patient record system. Opt out was rationalised through discourse on the universal right to health. Media controversy ensued due to privacy fears, security and commercial exploitation of patient information. LGBT community organisations warned that people with complex health needs should consider their privacy and legal situation when deciding whether or not to opt out of MHR. With reference to the health needs of sexuality and gender diverse people, we examine MHR's rights universalism, possessive individualism, and state-based rationalisation of health governance. MHR hails all but no-one in particular, erasing diversity and straightwashing data medicine. It is a technological solution to state-based imperatives for health governance, an emphasis that does not serve minority communities or address health needs that attract stigma and prejudice. We counterpose these effects with citizenship framings seated in critical approaches to data assemblages and sexuality and gender diversity. We suggest ways in which data medicine, of which MHR is but one example, can be made more relevant and effective for individuals and communities whose healthcare is poorly served by mainstream health systems.

AB  - As a kind of complex targets, the non-rigid vibration of an aircraft as well as its attitude change and the rotation of its rotating parts will induce complex nonlinear modulation on its echo from low-resolution radars. If these nonlinear modulation features which reflect the physical characteristics of an aircraft target can be extracted effectively, then they are helpful to target classification and recognition. However, the echo translational component and background clutter have a very adverse effect on the extraction of such features. On basis of introducing the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) algorithm, the paper firstly performs the decomposition of real recorded aircraft echo data from a low-resolution radar by EEMD and distinguishes the false component, body translational component and micro-motion component by calculating waveform entropy in the Doppler domain. Secondly, it carries out characteristic analysis and feature extraction further on the echo micro-motion component separated and extracts three features of the micro-motion component, including Doppler domain waveform entropy E-mc, normalized equivalent Doppler spectrum width BW0, and normalized frequency interval between the adjacent maximum spectral peaks on both sides of the spectrum center Delta f(0). The analysis results show that EEMD can be used to separate the body translational component and micro-motion component of an aircraft echo effectively, and the proposed features (E-mc, BW0 and Delta f(0)) can be used as effective features for aircraft target classification and recognition.

AB  - This article examines public values and attitudes associated with the current marine reserves (MRs) in Oregon (United States), and how attitudes might change if these areas were to be designated as marine wilderness. Data were obtained from a representative survey of 530 residents of the most heavily populated region in Oregon. Twenty-one assigned values for Oregon's MRs were statistically grouped into three broader categories of values (environmental protection, emotional well-being, recreation) with respondents clearly preferring that these areas provide values fostering environmental protection over those providing for human emotional or recreational well-being. Respondents who considered environmental protection values to be important were likely to have more positive attitudes (e.g., like, good) about these MRs in general and also feel more positively about these areas if they were to be designated as marine wilderness in particular. Attitudes toward these MRs in general were also positively related to changes in specific attitudes with potential marine wilderness designation. Conversely, those who considered recreation values to be important were likely to have more negative attitudes about these MRs in general and the attitudes for these respondents would become even more negative if these areas were to be designated as marine wilderness.

AB  - Attitudes toward multiculturalism in educational contexts - i.e., multicultural attitudes - are desirable qualities for good teaching practices. Unfortunately, little is known about the antecedents of prospective teachers' multicultural attitudes. Before this backdrop, we argue that prospective teachers' multicultural ideology, national pride, and intergroup contact are related to their multicultural attitudes. Studying these relationships can offer valuable insights for initial teacher education programs. We assessed prospective teachers' (n = 72) multicultural attitudes (adapted version of the Teachers' Multicultural Attitude Survey), multicultural ideology (Multicultural Ideology Scale), national pride (single item from large scale studies) and intergroup contact (experiences in multicultural classrooms and intergroup friendship). Results showed that higher multicultural ideology and lower national pride were related to more positive multicultural attitudes. We found no such relation for intergroup contact. Based on these new insights into prospective teachers' multicultural attitudes, we argue that initial teacher education programs should reinforce and develop prospective teachers' multicultural ideology and consider the role of national pride.

AB  - In this article I maintain that when employers could free workers from the space constraint of the office without incurring unbearable economic losses, it is morally wrong not to grant workers the possibility to work remotely, as this violates the humanity formulation of Kant's categorical imperative. The article therefore aims to contribute to the development of Kantian business ethics, taking into account a series of empirical evidence gathered in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. I firstly discuss the Kantian concept of meaningful work and explain why, due to a prejudice that existed with respect to remote work before the Covid-19 pandemic, the issue of freedom from the office was not given normative relevance. I then introduce a Kantian argument in defence of remote work and proceed to discuss two objections. The first objection is that remote work may well foster productivity, but it creates problems in terms of innovation and training of new staff. The second objection is that remote work hinders rather than fosters meaningful work because it deprives employees of social relations and inhibits workplace identity. I conclude by explaining why neither objection undermines the normative argument that workers should be allowed to work remotely as long as the "bearable costs" clause is met.

AB  - CONTEXTAbortion stigma may cause psychological distress in women who are considering having an abortion or have had one. This phenomenon has been relatively underexplored in low-income women, who may already be at an increased risk for poor abortion-related outcomes because of difficulties accessing timely and safe abortion services.
   METHODSA qualitative study conducted between 2010 and 2013 used semistructured interviews to explore pregnancy intentions among low-income women recruited from six reproductive health clinics in Western Pennsylvania. Transcripts from interviews with 19 participants who were planning to terminate a pregnancy or had had an abortion in the last two weeks were examined through content analysis to identify the range of attitudes they encountered that could contribute to or reflect abortion stigma, the sources of these attitudes and women's responses to them.
   RESULTSWomen commonly reported that partners, family members and they themselves held antiabortion attitudes. Such attitudes communicated that abortion is morally reprehensible, a rejection of motherhood, rare and thus potentially deviant, detrimental to future fertility and an irresponsible choice. Women reacted to external and internal negative attitudes by distinguishing themselves from other women who obtain abortions, experiencing negative emotions, and concealing or delaying their abortions.
   CONCLUSIONSWomen's reactions to antiabortion attitudes may perpetuate abortion stigma. Further research is needed to inform interventions to address abortion stigma and improve women's abortion experiences.

AB  - How do queer people experience menopause? And what is the queer menopausal experience of therapy and the wider healthcare system? The existing literature examines lesbian lives, but there are no studies of the wider LGBTQ + population, particularly as clients in therapy. For this study, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 LGBTQ + identified participants. While some participants had positive experiences, practitioners overall were frequently unable to meet their needs, both in terms of menopause knowledge and understanding queer identities. In summary, participants felt that therapists should: listen to queer menopausal clients and not make assumptions; understand that this client group is likely to have had previous negative experiences with healthcare practitioners; realise that both they and their clients are likely holding inadequate information about menopause; understand that menopause can also be a positive experience; and undertake further training around GSRD (Gender, Sex and Relationship Diverse) identities, menopause and hormones. Queer menopausal clients frequently face multiple discrimination when accessing therapy and healthcare services: acephobia (prejudice against asexuals), ageism, biphobia, homophobia, misogyny (where applicable), and transphobia. Practitioners of all kinds, and by extension training organisations, have a long way to go in creating sufficiently safe and appropriate services for this client group.

AB  - Transgender people are at elevated risk for nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicidal ideation compared to the general population. Transgender (trans) refers to a diverse group of people who experience incongruence between their gender identity and sex assigned at birth. The present study is guided by the minority stress model and the psychological mediation framework, which postulate that sexual minority groups experience elevated stress as a result of anti-minority prejudice, contributing to negative mental health outcomes. This study utilized these theories to investigate the role of internalized transnegativityinternalization of negative societal attitudes about one's trans identityin the relationships of distal trans stress to suicidal ideation and NSSI. A U.S. national sample of trans adults (N=237) completed a battery of online measures. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to compare models with mediation and moderation effects. Results suggested that internalized transnegativity acts as both a mediator and a moderator in the relationship between distal trans stress and suicidal ideation. Log likelihood comparisons suggested moderation models had the superior fit for these data. Results suggest that clinical interventions should directly target individuals' internalized transnegativity as well as societal-level transnegativity.

AB  - Mid-century non-Indigenous visitors to Central Australia such as the naturalist Hedley Finlayson (author of The Red Centre, 1935) and the journalist-cum-conservationist Arthur Groom (author of I Saw a Strange Land, 1950) wrote popular works that overturned prejudices about a "dead heart" and encouraged subsequent visitors and tourists. Yet they were often unsettled by eerie sounds. This article uses Mark Fisher's notion of eeriness, as well as literature on the uncanny, to theorise the ambiguous sonic eerie. In particular, I show how, in the Australian settler-colonial context, the sonic eerie can prompt an unhomeliness that presences Indigenous dispossession or environmental degradation. In this way, it can undermine feelings of wonder and emplacement that other senses, including eyesight, might impart. But sonic eeriness need not always develop in that way, and it is often transient in its effects, even though it can result in echoes. While Finlayson and Groom overcame their unsettlement, part of the power that eeriness possesses is in the way in which those who read about it can also be affected by it. In these after-effects, we can still hear Indigenous claims to land being made, and the ghostly echoes of climate change.

AB  - While touting the importance of building effective networks, scholars have paid far less attention to why so many people feel so ambivalent or conflicted about instrumental networking, and what can be done to change such attitudes. The present research provides the first empirical test of a novel theory, which argues that people are more likely to disengage from networking if they hold a "fixed theory" of networking ability-believing that how well one networks is fixed or innate rather than learned through effort-which triggers negative attitudes toward moral and instrumental aspects of networking. To test this argument, we first develop and validate a Lay Theory of Networking Ability scale (Study 1) and show that this scale predicts people's attendance in networking events over a 6-week period (Study 2). Next, we show that lay theories can be experimentally manipulated, with consequences for attendance in networking events over a 4-week period (Study 3) as well as people's affective experiences in networking events (Study 4). In all, the present research contributes to our understanding of the motivational psychology of networking by highlighting the importance of beliefs as an understudied construct in the networks literature and by introducing methods to measure and manipulate them.

AB  - Countries of the Pacific region are currently undergoing significant reforms. While disability inclusive education has been identified as a regional priority by all member nations, implementing inclusive education in the countries of the region can be quite challenging as many barriers continue to hamper the progress of the countries. Unless the barriers are identified and systematically addressed, it is unlikely that the countries will be able to implement a robust and holistic inclusive education strategy. In this paper, we present possible ways in which the countries of the Pacific could make significant progress in implementing a sustainable inclusive education strategy. We used a collaborative approach of co-examining potential barriers that are likely to impede the growth of countries in implementing a comprehensive inclusive education plan of action. We then identified possible strategies that are likely to result in an improved and perhaps more culturally responsive implementation of inclusive education in the Pacific. The most significant barriers identified by the members included: inadequate teacher preparation, stigma and negative attitudes towards people with disabilities, and limited engagement with the local leaders and key stakeholders. Possible strategies for addressing the barriers are outlined and discussed with possible implications for local, regional, and international researchers and policy makers.

AB  - Background: In the Netherlands, the prevalence of dietary supplement use has doubled (from 17 to 40 per cent) since the 1980s. Yet, limited data is available on which socio-cognitive factors are associated with dietary supplement use. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to explain dietary supplement use with determinants deriving from the Integrated Change Model (ICM) and from formative research.
   Method/design: Socio-cognitive and psychosocial factors were measured among users and non-users of dietary supplements in a longitudinal survey study, with measurements at baseline (N = 1448) and at one-month follow-up (N = 1161). Negative binomial regression analysis was applied to de data.
   Results: Intention emerged as the main predictor of dietary supplement use (OR = 1.99). Further predictors of dietary supplement use with smaller effect-sizes were: health regulatory focus (promotion, OR = 1.46), social modelling (OR = 1.44), attitude (pros, OR = 1.37), attitude (cons, OR = 0.87), health locus of control (OR = 0.77), and risk perception (chance of getting ill, OR = 1.22).
   Conclusions: Individuals tend to use dietary supplements if they are promotion oriented, notice dietary supplement users in their social environment, estimate their chances of getting ill higher, and have positive attitudes towards dietary supplements. In contrast, non-users believe that external factors affect their health, and hold negative attitudes towards dietary supplements. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In an emerging field such as social enterprise, it is important for an organization to secure legitimacy to obtain resources and sustain its business. Specifically, when a government distributing subsidies does not have adequate information to decide which organization is trustworthy, it is the legitimacy-seeking activities of a social enterprise that determines who receives a subsidy; this, in turn, decides which organization will survive. One of the most effective ways to gain legitimacy is to explicitly emphasize in the public promotion that the organization devotes to its social mission. In the case of Work Integration Social Enterprises (WISEs), an organization emphasizes its social employment of the disadvantaged individuals. However, we argue that social enterprises' public promotion that emphasizes social employment can lower the expected wage, job satisfaction, and organizational commitment of the employees who are hired due to their disadvantaged social status. This is because such obvious promotional messages makes the employees more keenly aware of their disadvantaged status; as a result, this reinforces their self-prejudice that they are not competitive enough in the labor market. We test our hypotheses in the context of South Korean WISEs and found general support for our arguments.

TI  - Predicting Positive and Negative Relationships in Large Social Networks
T2  - PLOS ONE

KW  - STRUCTURAL BALANCE
KW  - LINK-PREDICTION
AB  - In a social network, users hold and express positive and negative attitudes (e.g. support/opposition) towards other users. Those attitudes exhibit some kind of binary relationships among the users, which play an important role in social network analysis. However, some of those binary relationships are likely to be latent as the scale of social network increases. The essence of predicting latent binary relationships have recently began to draw researchers' attention. In this paper, we propose a machine learning algorithm for predicting positive and negative relationships in social networks inspired by structural balance theory and social status theory. More specifically, we show that when two users in the network have fewer common neighbors, the prediction accuracy of the relationship between them deteriorates. Accordingly, in the training phase, we propose a segment-based training framework to divide the training data into two subsets according to the number of common neighbors between users, and build a prediction model for each subset based on support vector machine (SVM). Moreover, to deal with large-scale social network data, we employ a sampling strategy that selects small amount of training data while maintaining high accuracy of prediction. We compare our algorithm with traditional algorithms and adaptive boosting of them. Experimental results of typical data sets show that our algorithm can deal with large social networks and consistently outperforms other methods.

AB  - Background: Pain is one of the most disturbing and distressing symptoms experienced by cancer patients, and it is the most stressful factor affecting all aspects of patients and their families' lives. Understanding the barriers to effective cancer pain management in home setting is essential for designing programs to improve the quality of the patients and their families' lives.
   Aim: Exploring family caregivers' and cancer patients' experiences of barriers to pain management at home.
   Design: Qualitative exploratory descriptive study.
   Setting/Participants: Twenty patients and 32 family caregivers were recruited from oncology wards and palliative medicine clinics in hospitals affiliated to Iran University of Medical Sciences.
   Method: In-depth interviews were conducted with each participant, and audio-recorded and transcribed interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Ten major themes emerged regarding barriers to cancer pain management in home setting: "Drug dependence and addiction," "Malingering," "Negative attitudes towards opioid analgesia," "Concealing pain," "Painful comorbidities," "Conflict in family members' perspectives," "Inaccessibility of pain relief facilities," "Poor skill and knowledge," "Patients' feelings of depression and hopelessness," and "Caregiver burden."
   Conclusion: The study documented the need for supportive and educational programs for cancer patients and their family caregivers in an attempt to improve the effectiveness of pain managment and cancer patients' quality of life.

AB  - We conducted two studies and our primary goal was to assess the similarity between stereotypes about women and men and stereotypes about successful scientists. In addition, we examined the degree to which scientists, men, and women are seen as agentic or communal. Results revealed greater similarity between stereotypes about men and stereotypes about scientists than between stereotypes about women and scientists. Men and scientists were seen as highly agentic, women as highly communal, and scientists as less communal than either men or women. The higher the proportion of women in a scientific field, the more similar the stereotypes of scientists in that field were to stereotypes about women. Female participants perceived more similarity between women and scientists and judged women to be more agentic than male participants did. The results are consistent with role-congruity and lack-of-fit theories that report incompatibility of female gender stereotypes with stereotypes about high-status occupational roles. The results demonstrate that women are perceived to lack the qualities needed to be successful scientists, which may contribute to discrimination and prejudice against female scientists.

AB  - This article views appraisal as co-selection patterns of target, source and evaluative parameters and investigates the ways in which news discourse retells news stories and reproduces truthful reality. We combined the corpus-assisted method and quantitative/qualitative analysis of the data, i.e., 904 sentences which were extracted from the corpus of German 5G news reports by selecting the top 5 items from each of the noun keywords lists of the three subcorpora of economics, politics and technology news reports. It was found that the German media restage the necessity and desirability to promote the development of German communication facilities/technology through international cooperation, particularly Germany-Sino cooperation. In addition, a hesitant image was evoked as to the high-profile 5G development in Germany with an awareness of the potential security risks and economic losses. On the intersubjective dimension, our findings suggest that journalists make full exploitation of different dialogistic positioning strategies for closing down or opening up the dialogic space to a greater or lesser degree. More specifically, they tend to acknowledge and endorse the positive/negative attitudes attributed to the non-authorial voices towards particular targets in the fields of economics, politics or technology. A future comparison with the genre of news comments or editorials would deepen our understanding of the performativity of media.

AB  - Culture plays a vital role in shaping public and professional attitudes towards mental illness. In Arab cultures negative attitudes toward patients experiencing mental illnesses are common. There is a lack of studies that investigate the attitudes of professionals towards patients in inpatient mental health settings. This study aimed to assess the attitudes of professionals towards patients with mental illnesses in the only psychiatric hospital in Palestine. A survey was undertaken using the Attitudes Toward Acute Mental Health Scale (ATAMHS 33). The scale was distributed to a variety of professionals at the only psychiatric hospital in Bethlehem. Data was managed and analysed by using SPSS 15 (a statistical package for social sciences). The participants (mostly nurses) expressed both negative and positive attitudes toward patients, however, results revealed more negative than positive attitudes, particularly in relation to alcohol misuse, medication, patients' ability to control their emotions, and genetic predisposition to mental illness. This paper provides baseline data about the attitude of mental health professionals towards patients experiencing mental illnesses. Education and direct contact with patients with mental illness may not be enough to foster positive attitudes towards them. This may indicate the need to revise educational curriculum at the Palestinian universities and offer more training for mental health professionals in order to change their attitudes.

AB  - Mental health nursing consistently emerges as less popular than other specialties, and both service users and mental health practitioners are affected by negative attitudes. Education is fundamental to attracting students to the field of mental health nursing. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of undergraduate mental health curricula on student attitudes to people with mental illness, and career interest in mental health nursing. A traditional mental health course was compared to a course delivered by a person with lived experience of mental illness (and mental health service use) for its impact on student attitudes and career intentions in mental health nursing (cohort 1: n=70, cohort 2: n=131, respectively). In both cohorts, attitudes were measured via self-report, before and after the course, and changes were investigated through within-subjects t-tests. The lived experience-led course demonstrated statistically-significant positive changes in intentions to pursue mental health nursing and a decrease in negative stereotypes, which were not observed in the traditional course. The valuable contribution of mental health nursing emerged in the traditional, but not lived-experience-led, programmes. These findings support the value of an academic with lived experience of mental health challenges in promoting attraction to mental health nursing as a career option.

AB  - Pain is a major symptom that causes suffering among patients diagnosed with cancer. Identifying physicians' and nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and their perceived barriers of cancer pain management is considered an essential step in improving cancer pain relief. The purposes of this study are to compare physicians' and nurses' knowledge and attitudes toward cancer pain management (CPM) and describe their perceived barriers to CPM at oncology units. A descriptive cross-sectional design was utilized to obtain data through self-report questionnaire. The total number of sample size was 207 participants (72 physicians and 135 nurses). Findings revealed that both physicians and nurses had fair knowledge and attitudes toward CPM. Physicians had significantly higher knowledge and better attitudes than nurses (62.3 vs. 51.5%, respectively). Physicians were knowledgeable about pharmacological pain management and opioid addiction but had negative attitudes toward pain assessment. Nurses' knowledge was better in regard of CPM guidelines, while they had poor knowledge about pharmacological pain management and opioid addiction. Physicians and nurses perceived knowledge deficit, lack of pain assessment, opioid unavailability, and lack of psychological interventions as the most common barriers to CPM. It is recommended to integrate recent evidence-based guidelines about CPM in oncology units that aim to improve practice. Offering continuing education courses in hospitals guided by pain teams is another essential recommendation for effective CPM.

AB  - Purpose: This manuscript will provide a review of the literature and a report on the findings of a qualitative study that explored the lived experiences of people with borderline personality disorder (BPD). It also offers resources designed to empower healthcare professionals to provide timely and accurate referrals, diagnosis, or collaborative management of BPD in primary care.
   Data sources: Review of the literature examining background, epidemiology, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and available resources regarding BPD. Content analysis conducted on data obtained from 1109 postings on three different public online forums/blogs specifically for BPD.
   Conclusions: BPD is characterized by unstable moods, behaviors, and relationships. While navigating a healthcare system fraught with health disparities, BPD sufferers may have their feelings of abandonment and hopelessness reinforced. Four core themes emerged (a) a reliance on online blogging to cope; (b) a quality of life that is impacted by debilitating effects of condition; (c) coping mechanisms that encompass healthy and destructive measures; and (d) social injustices that include stigmatization, prejudice, delayed diagnosis, misdiagnosis, limited healthcare access, and lack of cure.
   Implications for practice: Knowledgeable, nonjudgmental primary healthcare providers can play a key role in providing BPD sufferers and their loved ones with accurate and timely diagnosis, referral, treatment, resources, and support. Internet blogging may have important implications in care.

AB  - In evaluative conditioning, a conditional stimulus (CS; e.g. a neutral picture) acquires positive/negative valence if it is paired with a pleasant/unpleasant unconditional stimulus (US; e.g. a positive/negative picture). This valence generalises to other stimuli similar to the CS and to the wider CS category. Being informed that the CS will be paired with the US induces a similar change in valence (instructional learning), but it is not clear whether instructional learning would also generalise. In Experiment 1, participants were informed that one shape would be paired with pleasant and another with unpleasant images. These instructions instilled conditional valence to the CSs which generalised to different shapes from the same category (generalisation stimuli). In Experiment 2, we replicated this finding in an implicit measure using stimuli varying in perceptual features. Participants were informed that three CSs from one category (e.g. vegetables) would be paired with pleasant images and three CSs from a second category (e.g. office supplies) would be paired with unpleasant images. This instruction instilled conditional valence to the CSs which generalised to novel exemplars from the same categories. This suggests that conditional valence instilled via instructions generalises to other stimuli - a finding with implications for prejudice and racism.

AB  - Accompanying with strengthening consciousness of environmental protection and social security, developing sustainable supply chain (SSC) has been becoming more and more important. Under this background, it is essential to deeply understand and evaluate SSCs from comprehensive economy-environment-society aspects. In order to do this, this paper considers the SSC as a dynamic three-stage network system consisting of supplier, manufacturer and distributor across multiple periods, and establishes a novel dynamic network DEA model with desirable and undesirable indicators to compute the detailed efficiencies based on both effective and invalid production frontiers. In the model, the degrees of environmental pollution and customer satisfaction are described as interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Then a method considering the optimistic-pessimistic attitude of decision makers is introduced to get solutions. For case study, the proposed DEA model is used to evaluate 20 SSCs, and analysis from time and stage perspectives are conducted to show the detailed performance. According to the results, the evaluated SSCs can be divided into four groups with different patterns, the weakness stage and period for each SSC can also be identified. The comparison and sensitivity analysis demonstrates our proposed model has more discriminating power and the ability of providing more managerial insights. Not only the sensitivity degree of a SSC to the attitude change of decision makers can be determined, but also the important indicator in different aspects for each SSC can be pointed out.

AB  - Purpose - Women continue to be underrepresented in the athletic director (AD) position across all divisions of the National Collegiate Athletic Association in the USA (Acosta and Carpenter, 2014). The purpose of this paper is to investigate the role of personal aspirations in pursing the AD position.
   Design/methodology/approach - This qualitative examination focuses on the experiences of nine women who occupy senior associate AD positions and applies the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to examine how attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control influence their aspirations to pursue the AD role.
   Findings - The authors suggest a combination of negative attitudes, subjective norms, and lack of perceived behavioral control negatively influencing a woman's aspirations to pursue the AD position. These conclusions indicate women's experiences of career advancement are constraining with regard to advancing to the AD position.
   Research limitations/implications - Although this study lacks generalizability, TPB is helpful in understanding underrepresentation of women in the AD position.
   Practical implications - Furthermore, the authors suggest organizational strategies that cultivate and value women's experiences. These can equalize the hegemonic male environment of intercollegiate athletics and decrease underrepresentation of women in the most senior-level position in athletic administration.
   Originality/value - This study is one of the first to apply TPB to explain career advancement of women in senior management positions in athletic administration.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to compare Israeli gay men and lesbians (GL) with their heterosexual counterparts in terms of their estimated likelihood of parenthood and to further assess the association between estimated likelihood of parenthood and psychological well-being as a function of sexual orientation. Methods A total of 449 childless participants (202 self-reported as GL) ranging in age from 18 to 49 (M = 27.86, SD = 4.49) were recruited through convenience sampling between November 2017 and April 2018. They completed questionnaires assessing their estimated likelihood of parenthood, depressive symptoms, life satisfaction, and happiness. Results GL reported a lower estimated likelihood of parenthood than their heterosexual counterparts. Also, estimated likelihood of parenthood was associated with psychological well-being indicators, and this association was moderated by sexual orientation, such that stronger associations were evident between estimated likelihood of parenthood and fewer depressive symptoms, greater life satisfaction, and happiness among heterosexual men and women in comparison to GL. Conclusions The findings are interpreted in light of GL possible awareness of discriminatory local policies concerning sexual minority rights in their quest to parenthood alongside pressure to have children that is greater for heterosexual couples than that faced by GL in the Israeli pronatal sociocultural environment. Policy makers should consider the disparities in estimated likelihood of parenthood between GL and heterosexual counterparts and their possible linkage to the discriminatory Israeli social policies regarding GL rights.

AB  - Studies of accounting in prisons have documented how the dominance of neo-liberal preferences in the management of prison systems has meant a focus on measuring cost-effectiveness and discharging accountability in a way which ignores important aspects of prison life such as decency and rehabilitation. The present work recognises the need for accounting studies to unmask the prejudiced, interested and potentially socially damaging use of accounting in prison reform by exposing how accounting is often a tool which can be used to discipline individuals consistent with the values of economic and political elites within a society. By applying a Foucauldian lens to the analysis of the prison systems of the major Italian States in the early 19th century, the study shows how accounting was an essential aid in ensuring that the correction of individuals was carried out consistent with the moral priorities of the liberal bourgeois society of the time. The specific visibilities created by means of accounting, upon which decisions on the life of prisoners were made and which still characterise modern prisons, reduced human life to a simplistic numerical representation. These were then used to reconstruct 'deviant' individuals as productive, obedient citizens, regardless of their specific circumstances. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundAlthough staff attitudes towards individuals with intellectual disability (ID) whose behaviour challenges may be an important part of a positive support culture, very little research has focused on the development of training specifically designed to change staff attitudes. Positive contact is hypothesised to be an effective way to change attitudes towards stigmatised groups.
   MethodsWe designed and developed a half day training package about the experiences of individuals whose behaviour challenges - Who's Challenging Who (WCW). The WCW package was delivered according to a manual by a trainer with ID and a professional without disability. Seventy-six staff from a variety of organisations participated in one of 10 WCW training sessions and provided data on their attitudes and empathy towards individuals whose behaviour challenges prior to the WCW training and immediately at the end of training. Staff also completed a post-training evaluation questionnaire.
   ResultsA training package was successfully developed collaboratively with individuals whose behaviour challenges, and received very positive evaluations from staff participants. Short-term positive change was shown for empowerment and similarity attitudes, and staff empathy and self-efficacy. These outcomes were associated with small to moderate effect sizes.
   ConclusionsMeaningful short-term positive staff attitude changes were found and the WCW training model was shown to be feasible. More robust research designs are needed for future evaluation. In addition, the function of an attitude change intervention such as WCW within organisations' training strategies requires further development.

AB  - Background: The present research compares smiling and emotion expression generally to other indicators of negative intra- and interpersonal reactions to ostracism, and in particular negative reactions towards the ostracizers.
   Methods: A total of N=143 participants (n=55 in Experiment 1 and n=88 in Experiment 2) were ostracized from a web-conference by two other individuals. Facial expressions of participants during the exclusion period were coded using EMFACS and compared to selfreported reactions to ostracism and the sources of the ostracism.
   Results: Ostracized individuals showed significant levels of both Duchenne (genuine) and non-Duchenne (social) smiling, despite finding ostracism highly aversive, reporting more negative attitudes towards the ostracizing confederates, and (in Experiment 2) higher levels of negative affect. Experiment 2 showed evidence of a self-regulation and display management function of smiling during ostracism in that participants who exhibited more Duchenne smiling during their exclusion also reported higher levels of positive emotion after the ostracism, and were also rated by a group of judges as experiencing more amusement at their exclusion.
   Conclusion: The web conferencing paradigm used in this study provides an ecologically valid method to study the management of expressive behavior during aversive interpersonal experiences, adding to the existing evidence of facial display management during other types of distressing experience.

AB  - Objective Interaction between physicians and medical representatives (MR) is an area of controversy, which discussed heavily in the literature. However, the perspectives of physicians on the extent and composition of pharmaceutical promotion techniques have been neglected especially in developing countries. Therefore, this study aims to bridge this gap through investigating physicians' perceptions, beliefs and attitudes towards interactions with medical representatives with special emphasis on their perception about the appropriateness of accepting drug company promotions and their either positive or negative attitudes towards drug promotion activities.
   Methods This is a descriptive cross-sectional study that investigates physicians' perceptions about interactions with medical representatives. Data were collected through an anonymous survey questionnaire circulated to 610 physicians.
   Key findings Majority (85.3%) of participated physicians has positive attitudes towards interactions with medical representatives, and they disagree with the idea of banning medical representatives' visits. Also perception of the majority (60.8%) of physicians is that most promotional techniques do not pose ethical problem, and it is appropriate to accept most promotional items.
   Conclusion Majority of the physicians have positive attitudes towards interactions with MRs. Most of the physicians believe that most promotional techniques do not pose ethical problem, and it is acceptable to accept promotional items.

AB  - This article argues for the analysis of public engagement as an essentially mediated activity. Although recent studies note that academic knowledge is increasingly available for consumption by nonacademic audiences, they tell us little about how it gets recontextualized while passing through the hands of media professionals on its way toward such audiences. In Burawoy's (2005) influential call for the rebirth of public sociology, as in the debates his work provoked, the media is treated solely as a means for the transportation of knowledge. But as this article demonstrates, the media does not simply transport knowledge; it also, and at the same time, translates that knowledge in various, rhetorically consequential ways. Focusing on the mediated trajectory of an attempt by a group of academics to connect with audiences beyond academia, their initial contribution is compared to its subsequent translation(s) across various British newspapers. A discursive analysis reveals the techniques via which a classic form of public sociology came to be recontextualized such that, remarkably, these authors were left appearing to voice nothing but their own petty prejudices. The article concludes by noting that where public engagement involves mediation, public sociology should pay more attention to the recontextualizing affordances of media discourse.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Self-stigma represents a process of accepting negative social prejudices with a consequent negative impact on many areas of the patient's life (self-concept, social and work functioning, relationships, cooperation in treatment, quality of life, willingness to strive for something). The study was aimed to examine the level of self-stigma and other significant variables potentially related to self-stigma (personality characteristics, childhood traumatisation, anxiety, depression, personality disorder, dissociation, parental styles, attachment).
   METHOD: The study was conducted at the Psychotherapeutic section of the Psychiatric Department in Regional Hospital Liberec from October 2015 to March 2019. A total of 96 hospitalised patients with neurotic spectrum disorders diagnosed by an experienced psychiatrist according to ICD-10 (panic disorder and/or agoraphobia, social phobia, generalised anxiety disorder, mixed anxiety depressive disorder, somatoform disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, adjustment disorders) were included into the study and filled in the test battery.
   RESULTS: The main finding is that self-stigma is related to the severity of the disorder, anxiety and depression, social anxiety, the comorbid occurrence of other anxiety disorders or personality disorders, dissociation, personality temperamental traits Harm Avoidance, Reward Dependence and Self-Directedness. We have not established a connection between attachment in close relationships and self-stigma. The most important predictors of self-stigma are the disorder's duration, reduced Self-Directedness, a higher rate of depression and social anxiety, which together explain 58% of severity if self-stigma.
   CONCLUSIONS: Self-stigma is a contemporary topic in research and clinical practice. The results can be used as a basis for the development of targeted intervention strategies aimed at reducing self-stigma or for further research studies in the field of self-stigma.

We investigated whether there were differences in mean scores for eating disorder (ED) symptoms among Whites, Asian Americans, and individuals identifying as another race (i.e., non-Asian people of color [NAPOC]). Participants included 716 college students (M age =19.23; SD = 1.65) from a southeastern university. ED symptoms were assessed with the Eating Pathology Symptom Inventory (EPSI). Internalizing symptoms were evaluated via the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). One-way ANOVAs investigated mean differences in symptoms between racial groups, with and without adjusting for sex, BMI, and internalizing symptoms. Overall, 16% (n = 114) of the sample identified as Asian American, 67% (n = 477) as White, and 17% (n = 125) as NAPOC. After correcting for multiple testing and adjusting for covariates, Asian Americans reported higher mean scores of purging, muscle building, and cognitive restraint (qs < 0.05) than Whites and NAPOC. Asian Americans also scored higher on restriction compared with Whites (qs < 0.05), as well as body dissatisfaction and negative attitudes toward obesity compared with NAPOC (qs < 0.05). These findings demonstrate the existence of racial differences among specific ED symptoms, highlighting the importance of considering these distinctions when diagnosing and treating EDs among diverse communities.

AB  - Past evidence has documented that attitudes toward marriage and cohabitation are related to sexual behavior in adolescence and young adulthood. This study extends prior research by longitudinally testing these associations across racial/ethnic groups and investigating whether culturally relevant variations within racial/ethnic minority groups, such as skin tone (i.e., lightness/darkness of skin color), are linked to attitudes toward marriage and cohabitation and sex. Drawing on family and public health literatures and theories, as well as burgeoning skin tone literature, it was hypothesized that more positive attitudes toward marriage and negative attitudes toward cohabitation would be associated with less risky sex, and that links differed for lighter and darker skin individuals. The sample included 6872 respondents (49.6 % female; 70.0 % White; 15.8 % African American; 3.3 % Asian; 10.9 % Hispanic) from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. The results revealed that marital attitudes had a significantly stronger dampening effect on risky sexual behavior of lighter skin African Americans and Asians compared with their darker skin counterparts. Skin tone also directly predicted number of partners and concurrent partners among African American males and Asian females. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of these findings for adolescence and young adulthood.

AB  - The stigma associated with a diagnosis of mental illness is well known yet has not reduced significantly in recent years. Health professionals, including nurses, have been found to share similar negative attitudes towards people with labelled with mental illness as the general public. The low uptake of mental health nursing as a career option reflects these stigmatised views and is generally regarded as one of the least popular areas of in which to establish a nursing career. The aim of the current project was to examine nursing students' attitudes towards the concept of mental illness and mental health nursing across four European countries (Ireland, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands), and Australia, using the Opening Minds Scale and the Mental Health Nurse Education survey. The surveys were distributed to students prior to the commencement of the mental health theory component. Attitudes towards mental health nursing were generally favourable. Differences in opinion were evident in attitudes towards mental illness as a construct; with students from Australia and Ireland tending to have more positive attitudes than students from Finland, Norway and the Netherlands. The future quality of mental health services is dependent on attracting sufficient nurses with the desire, knowledge and attitudes to work in mental health settings. Understanding attitudes towards mental illness and mental health nursing is essential to achieving this aim.

AB  - Attitudes toward urban residential trees and awareness of their ecosystem services and disservices may play an important role in management decisions of private residential green spaces with important consequences to urban sustainability. In 2011, 397 household surveys were conducted in six locations of the Rio Piedras Watershed (San Juan, Puerto Rico) to evaluate residents' attitudes toward residential and neighborhood trees and their association with household socio-demographic factors, how awareness of services and disservices relate to the spatial proximity of trees (home versus neighborhood), and whether attitudes are associated with yard management (tree abundance). Most residents self-reported positive attitudes toward trees in general and these appeared to be more frequent than self-reported negative attitudes. Respondents recognized more tree services (emphasizing shade, lower temperature, food, and ornamental/aesthetics) and fewer disservices (emphasizing maintenance hardship, property damage, and power line obstruction). Not all tree services and disservices were equally recognized, and differences in the spatial context of trees and residents may contribute to the variation in residents' awareness of tree ecosystem services or disservices. Variation in positive attitudes partially explained the current variation in yard tree abundance, along with residents' age, housing tenure, yard size, and watershed location. Results have direct implications for urban forest planning and management in residential contexts.

AB  - Limited research on access and utilization of sexual health services by sexual minorities has disadvantaged improvements of health systems in terms of providing appropriate treatment and care. Studies demonstrate that LGBTQ persons are more likely to experience health inequities, and are seldom recognized in health research and interventions. Using qualitative methods, this study aimed to shed insights into the utilization of health care services among university LGBT students. In-depth interviews were conducted with 12 LGBT university students aged 18-24 years in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The interviews reveal that LGBT youth are victims of stigmatization, prejudice, and marginalization within the health system. Health providers have limited training in addressing the concerns of the LGBT community. The Internet is an important source of health information for LGBT youth. Students preferred private health services, because they felt health providers are more informed about their health needs and concerns. The findings suggest the importance of incorporating the needs of LGBT youth within youth-friendly initiatives. Future research should investigate the incidence and prevalence of diseases among LGBTQ persons, and take into account the perceptions and attitudes of health providers to understand their views on the provision of sexual health care for LGBTQ youth.

AB  - Research on counselor competence regarding bisexuality is scarce, despite the greater prevalence of negative attitudes about bisexuality as compared to other sexual minorities (Flanders & Hatfield, 2014) both within the general public and the LGBTQ + community (Matsick & Rubin, 2018). Therapist attitudes and moral development are 2 constructs known to affect multicultural counseling competence; however, although some research has examined competence in working with lesbian, gay, and bisexual individuals altogether, bisexual individuals specifically are underrepresented or absent in examinations of the relationship between these 2 constructs. Therefore, this study examined whether postconventional moral reasoning has an indirect relationship with bisexual counseling competence through attitudes regarding bisexuality. Currently licensed therapists were surveyed using the Defining Issues Test 2, Attitudes Regarding Bisexuality Scale, Counseling Bisexual Clients Competence Scale, and a modified version of the Multicultural Case Conceptualization Ability Task. Results indicated an indirect relationship between levels of postconventional moral reasoning and self-report of bisexual counseling competence through attitudes regarding bisexuality. However, no such relationships were found when bisexual counseling competence was measured by ability to utilize cultural factors related to bisexuality in case conceptualization of etiology and treatment. Significance of these findings as well as implications for education and training, practice, and research, are discussed.

AB  - This article argues that it is not Buddhism, per se, but rather Buddhist extremism, that is responsible for violence against relevant out-groups. Moreover, it suggests that the causes of Buddhist extremism, rather than being determined solely by textual and scriptural justifications for out-group violence, are rooted instead in the intersection between social psychology and theology, rather than organically arising from the latter, per se. This article unpacks this argument by a deeper exploration of Theravada Buddhist extremism in Sri Lanka. It argues that religious extremism, including its Buddhist variant, is best understood as a fundamentalist belief system that justifies structural violence against relevant out-groups. A total of seven of the core characteristics of the religious extremist are identified and employed to better grasp how Buddhist extremism in Sri Lanka manifests itself on the ground. These are: the fixation with maintaining identity supremacy; in-group bias; out-group prejudice; emphasis on preserving in-group purity via avoidance of commingling with the out-group; low integrative complexity expressed in binary thinking; dangerous speech in both soft- and hard-modes; and finally, the quest for political power, by force if needed. Future research could, inter alia, explore how these seven characteristics also adequately describe other types of religious extremism.

AB  - COVID-19 is an emerging and highly infectious disease that is becoming a global health challenge affecting all sectors. To prevent COVID-19 transmission, all education institutions were closed and advised to turn to online learning. The present study sought to determine the factors affecting the acceptance and use of electronic learning among Ugandan University students in three universities. The study relied on two data collection instruments: a questionnaire and a semi-structured interview. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted on a population of students in three pre-selected universities: Kyambogo (KYU), Makerere (MAK), and Kampala International University (KIU). Of the 614 questionnaires returned, 578 were valid; 65.4% of the respondents were males; 60.7% were from MAK and the majority being in their third year of study (49%). Overall, 69.2% had good knowledge, 22.5% had positive attitudes toward e-learning. The semi-structured interviews revealed connectivity and skills challenges as the main barriers to the implementation of e-learning. For better implementation of e-learning by Universities, effective planning needs to be done with active students' involvement to avert negative attitudes. We recommend more studies be done on the Universities' preparedness for the implementation of e-learning. Universities should collaborate with telecommunication companies to provide subsidized prices for internet costs and information and communications technology (ICT) equipment to students.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to measure levels of suicide literacy and stigma amongst Australian medical students in comparison to a general university population, and to assess medical students' help-seeking intentions.
   Method: A cross-sectional survey was administered to 165 currently-enrolled Australian National University (ANU) postgraduate medical students and 54 final year undergraduate medical students at the University of Adelaide. These samples were compared to another sample of 676 general members of the ANU, undertaken six months earlier.
   Results: Final year postgraduate and undergraduate students had significantly higher levels of mental health literacy (measured using the Literacy of Suicide Scale) than other medical students or general university staff and students. Suicide stigma (measured using the Stigma of Suicide Scale) was comparable across the samples. Less exposure to suicide was associated with greater stigma and increased intentions of informal help seeking. Students who normalised suicide had significantly lower intentions of seeking help for thoughts of suicide.
   Conclusions: The findings indicate that exposure to suicidal people through clinical experience may improve knowledge about suicide but may lead to more negative attitudes toward informal help-seeking. The suicide prevention curriculum should aim to raise mental health literacy levels, reduce stigmatising attitudes and limit the normalisation of suicide.

AB  - Highly publicized acts of violence routinely spark reactions that place blame on the perpetrator's presumed mental illness. Despite solid evidence that people with mental illness are unlikely to be dangerous, such prejudice can lead to support for inappropriately using legal means to force people into treatment. We examined trends in public perceptions of violence and support for coerced treatment across a twenty-two-year period using data from three National Stigma Studies. The studies gave respondents one of three vignettes describing people who met clinical criteria for mental disorders or one describing a person with nonclinical "daily troubles." Perceptions regarding potential violence and support for coercion generally rose over time-significantly so for schizophrenia. By 2018 over 60 percent of respondents saw people who met criteria for schizophrenia as dangerous to others, and 44-59 percent supported coercive treatment. Sixty-eight percent saw people with alcohol dependence as dangerous to others, and 26-38 percent supported coercion. Lower but substantial percentages were reported for people with depression and, remarkably, for those with nonclinical "daily troubles," who were viewed as dangerous. These findings reflect political discourse, not scientific data, and could lead to policies that would be ineffective and misdirect the search for the underlying roots of violence while unnecessarily increasing stigma toward people with mental illness.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the perceptions and attitudes of health professionals toward violence against women in intimate relationships, and to discuss them as opportunities and barriers for improving health professionals' response.
   Methods: Six focus groups were conducted with 71 health professionals employed in the public primary health care centers in Belgrade (Serbia). The data were analyzed according to the direct approach of the qualitative content analysis.
   Results: Findings suggest that the majority of health professionals perceive IPV as an unjustifiable act. They showed an understanding for women; see their role as providing support to women and collaborating with other institutions. They are willing to help, but do not know how. However, some health professionals appeared to be judgmental in terms of what preceded violence, and would insist on extracting a woman's disclosure that violence had occurred. As barriers, they emphasized the lack of training and specific education on IPV, a weak support network, and overall social insecurity.
   Conclusion: There is a gap between health professionals' willingness to help and resources needed, along with prejudice and interrogative attitudes. Barriers appeared at individual, organizational and societal levels.
   Practice implications: Proper education and protocols are priorities in strengthening health professionals' response to IPV. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundAwareness of the specific needs of LGBTQI cancer patients has led to calls for inclusivity, cultural competence, cultural safety and cultural humility in cancer care. Examination of oncology healthcare professionals' (HCP) perspectives is central to identifying barriers and facilitators to inclusive LGBTQI cancer care. Study AimThis study examined oncology HCPs perspectives in relation to LGBTQI cancer care, and the implications of HCP perspectives and practices for LGBTQI patients and their caregivers. Method357 oncology HCPs in nursing (40%), medical (24%), allied health (19%) and leadership (11%) positions took part in a survey; 48 HCPs completed an interview. 430 LGBTQI patients, representing a range of tumor types, sexual and gender identities, age and intersex status, and 132 carers completed a survey, and 104 LGBTQI patients and 31 carers undertook an interview. Data were analysed using thematic discourse analysis. ResultsThree HCP subject positions - ways of thinking and behaving in relation to the self and LGBTQI patients - were identified:'Inclusive and reflective' practitioners characterized LGBTQI patients as potentially vulnerable and offered inclusive care, drawing on an affirmative construction of LGBTQI health. This resulted in LGBTQI patients and their carers feeling safe and respected, willing to disclose sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) status, and satisfied with cancer care. 'Egalitarian practitioners' drew on discourses of ethical responsibility, positioning themselves as treating all patients the same, not seeing the relevance of SOGI information. This was associated with absence of LGBTQI-specific information, patient and carer anxiety about disclosure of SOGI, feelings of invisibility, and dissatisfaction with healthcare. 'Anti-inclusive' practitioners' expressed open hostility and prejudice towards LGBTQI patients, reflecting a cultural discourse of homophobia and transphobia. This was associated with patient and carer distress, feelings of negative judgement, and exclusion of same-gender partners. ConclusionDerogatory views and descriptions of LGBTQI patients, and cis-normative practices need to be challenged, to ensure that HCPs offer inclusive and affirmative care. Building HCP's communicative competence to work with LGBTQI patients needs to become an essential part of basic training and ongoing professional development. Visible indicators of LGBTQI inclusivity are essential, alongside targeted resources and information for LGBTQI people.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Educating medical students about health disparities may be one step in diminishing the disparities in health among different populations. According to adult learning theory, learners' opinions are vital to the development of future curricula.
   DESIGN: Qualitative research using focus group methodology.
   OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to explore the content that learners value in a health disparities curriculum and how they would want such a curriculum to be taught.
   PARTICIPANTS: Study participants were first year medical students with an interest in health disparities (n=17).
   APPROACH: Semi-structured interviews consisting of 12 predetermined questions, with follow-up and clarifying questions arising from the discussion. Using grounded theory, codes were initially developed by the team of investigators, applied, and validated through an iterative process.
   MAIN RESULTS: The students perceived negative attitudes towards health disparities education as a potential barrier towards the development of a health disparities curriculum and proposed possible solutions. These solutions centered around the learning environment and skill building to combat health disparities.
   CONCLUSIONS: While many of the students' opinions were corroborated in the literature, the most striking differences were their opinions on how to develop good attitudes among the student body. Given the impact of the provider on health disparities, how to develop such attitudes is an important area for further research.

AB  - Teachers' racialized interpretations of students' behaviors likely lead to the racial disparities found in discipline across all education levels (Skiba et al., 2011). To explore how four types of teachers' racial inequity beliefs (i.e., post-racial, American Dream, cultural deficit, schooling inequity) may be associated with teachers' racialized interpretations of Black and White boys' behaviors (i.e., hostility, emotionality, behavioral stability, and seri-ousness), a sample of 228 teachers in the United States filled out the Racism and Inequity Beliefs (RIB) Ques-tionnaire and observed videotapes of six boys potentially misbehaving in school. Teachers' cultural deficit beliefs uniquely predicted teachers' negative perceptions of Black boys' behaviors, with little to no impact on their perceptions of White boys' behaviors. Specifically, teachers holding more cultural deficit beliefs perceived the Black boys' behaviors as relatively more hostile, more representative of a behavioral pattern, and more serious compared to teachers who held fewer cultural deficit beliefs, and compared to their judgments of White boys' behaviors. American Dream beliefs were also uniquely associated with assessments of Black boys' behavior as more serious, without impact on White boys' behavior. These results suggest the application of inequitable judgments of boys' behaviors based on teachers' racial inequity beliefs and boys' identifiable race.

AB  - Lifeline Australia operates crisis support services through Lifeline Crisis Supporters. An integral part of their role is to conduct online suicide risk assessments with help-seekers. However, there is limited literature regarding suicide risk assessment practices for this population. This study aimed to examine how suicide prevention training, vicarious trauma and fears impacted suicide risk assessment behaviours of Lifeline Crisis Supporters. A cross-sectional survey design was used to recruit a volunteer convenience sample of 125 Lifeline Australia Crisis Supporters (75.2% females; M-age = 54.9) in 2018 to participate in an online survey. Findings revealed that those with more suicide-specific training had less risk assessment-related fears, and that fears were not related to attitudes towards suicide prevention. There was no significant relationship between vicarious trauma and amount of training or years of experience in the role. Further, participants with higher levels of vicarious trauma demonstrated significantly more negative attitudes towards suicide prevention. Overall, training appears to be a significant factor in suicide risk assessment practice behaviours of Lifeline Crisis Supporters, highlighting a need for ongoing training and support for them. This research also suggests that whilst fears exist, they do not significantly impair Lifeline Crisis Supporters' ability to undertake suicide risk assessment.

AB  - Two principal movers of American politics appear increasingly to be connected: racism and guns. The racial content underlying gun rights rhetoric, however, is rarely made explicit during political campaigns. As such, it is possible that espousing pro-gun messages may be an effective way to surreptitiously court prejudiced voters without transgressing popular egalitarian norms. In other words, gun rights rhetoric may function as a racial dog whistle. In the present study, we test this theory using data from a survey experiment conducted with a national sample of registered voters. The findings from our experiment show that election candidates' National Rifle Association (NRA)-funding status and position on gun control impact voters' evaluations, and racial resentment moderates these effects. Racially resentful voters are more likely than low-resentment voters to say they would vote for a candidate when the candidate is funded by the NRA and does not support gun control. This is true among voters who own guns and among those who do not, and it is true regardless of the candidate's political party. The findings also show that there is a backlash effect among low-resentment voters-such individuals are aversive to NRA-funded candidates but strongly supportive of pro-gun control candidates.

AB  - In this contribution, we elaborate on disapproval of homosexuality in 20 European countries. We mainly focus on the explanation of differences in the disapproval of homosexuality at the individual and the national level. Data from four waves of the European Social Survey are used, using multilevel techniques to test our hypotheses. Individual differences in disapproval of homosexuality can be derived from theories of socializing agents (religious institutions, schools) and socializing circumstances as well as from psychological theories on conventionalism and tradition. We find that religious people, people who support conventionalism, and those who attach to traditions disapprove of homosexuality more, whereas highly educated people disapprove less. Differences between countries can be explained by socializing circumstances of the national context as the countries' religiosity and laws on homosexuality turned out to be important determinants of the disapproval of homosexuality. We found that disapproval of homosexuality is the least in countries where law permits homosexuals to marry. In addition, people who live in more religious countries disapprove of homosexuality more than people who live in secular countries.

AB  - Background: Obesity is a worldwide problem. The Arab world, and particularly the Middle East, has witnessed a recent dramatic rise in obesity and obesity-related diseases. Yet, little is known about physician attitudes toward or management of obesity in this region of the world. The purpose of this study is to explore physician perceptions and attitudes toward obesity in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods: A cross-sectional, self-administered anonymous survey of primary care physicians was performed between December 2015 and January 2017 at academic medical centers in the UAE. Results: A total of 573 of 698 physicians (82% response rate) completed the survey. Thirty-seven percent of respondents met body mass index (BMI) criteria for overweight and 12% for obesity. Physicians had sufficient knowledge but lacked training in obesity management. Physician subspecialty impacted knowledge with internal medicine physicians showing better obesity knowledge (Chi-square 392, df 210, P = 0.00). There was no significant relationship between knowledge and attitudes with physician age, gender, or nationality. Attitudinal responses toward obesity management were generally positive. However, there was an inverse correlation between physician BMI and positive attitudes toward obesity management (Chi-square 1551, df 323, P = 0.00). Conclusions: Although our study did not find significant weight bias, negative attitudes were directly correlated with physician BMI, a significant concern as half of physicians surveyed reported BMIs consistent with overweight and obesity.

AB  - The problem with many ICT4D projects designed for African developmental contexts is that there is a tendency towards deterministic assumptions, in that arguments and implementation guidelines are often presented a-contextually. The reality of the author's lived experience, however, was that ICT4D practices in the African context imply cross-cultural working and worldview collisions. Simply adopting Western values and advice wholesale without adequate reflection, may lead to a design-reality gap, oppressive ICT transfer, and ultimately failure. Understanding cultural context and local development realities may present challenges, because it is interwoven with the assumptions and prejudices of those identifying and representing context from the outside. While there are attempts at addressing these issues, more nuanced examples adequately sensitized to ethical reasoning, insider knowledge, and power dynamics in cross-cultural working, are needed. This paper reflects on how a critical ethnography informed and transformed ICT4D project practices for the developmental realities of a traditional Zulu community in South Africa. Confessional narratives, representing both method and phenomena, are used as case analogies for outsider researchers and practitioners to draw on, firstly; to self-reflect on their own false consciousness and misguided assumptions, and secondly; to make sense of the typical abstractness of ICT4D project guidance and principles.

AB  - ObjectivesStigma towards people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) is strong in Malaysia. Although stigma has been understudied, it may be a barrier to treating the approximately 81000 Malaysian PLWHA. The current study explores correlates of intentions to discriminate against PLWHA among medical and dental students, the future healthcare providers of Malaysia.
   MethodsAn online, cross-sectional survey of 1296 medical and dental students was conducted in 2012 at seven Malaysian universities; 1165 (89.9%) completed the survey and were analysed. Socio-demographic characteristics, stigma-related constructs and intentions to discriminate against PLWHA were measured. Linear mixed models were conducted, controlling for clustering by university.
   ResultsThe final multivariate model demonstrated that students who intended to discriminate more against PLWHA were female, less advanced in their training, and studying dentistry. They further endorsed more negative attitudes towards PLWHA, internalised greater HIV-related shame, reported more HIV-related fear and disagreed more strongly that PLWHA deserve good care. The final model accounted for 38% of the variance in discrimination intent, with 10% accounted for by socio-demographic characteristics and 28% accounted for by stigma-related constructs.
   ConclusionsIt is critical to reduce stigma among medical and dental students to eliminate intentions to discriminate and achieve equitable care for Malaysian PLWHA. Stigma-reduction interventions should be multipronged, addressing attitudes, internalised shame, fear and perceptions of deservingness of care.

AB  - Few social smokers envision themselves being affected by the negative consequences of smoking despite well-known facts that smoking causes serious illnesses and death. However, as smoking habits quickly develop, social smokers cannot be free from the negative consequences of smoking. In this study, we pose the following question: "Would showing social smokers' possible future as a consequence of smoking help them alter their current smoking behaviors?" Thus, using the theoretical concept of possible selves, an anti-smoking educational game was created in which players could see changes to the appearance of their future selves as a consequence of smoking. We used a 2 (Future face: Showing vs. Not showing) x 2 (Self avatar: Self-avatar vs. Other-avatar) between-subjects design for the experiment. Results indicated that participants who viewed the future face, compared to who did not, reported more negative attitudes toward social smoking and greater intention to quit smoking. The main effect of the self avatar was insignificant; however, seeing the future face in the self-avatar condition led to an increase in perceived risks compared to other-avatar condition. The implications of using avatars as visualized possible selves in health promotion are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research indicates that increasing cultural awareness in adolescents may improve their relationships with peers of a different race or ethnicity. Few studies to date examine methods for improving intergroup relations in juvenile detention facilities in which racial tension often leads to de facto segregation, bullying, and violence. Forty-one diverse youth in a juvenile detention facility participated in a pilot program designed to increase cultural awareness using a developmentally appropriate group intervention. This 3-week manualized program was administered on two separate occasions to two groups of male adolescents housed in a secure facility. The findings showed a significant increase in cultural awareness within the group who differed in terms of self-identified race but not within the group who endorsed similar racial identities. Recommendations stemming from this study are meant to spark further investigation of effective interventions for juvenile offenders, as well as to supplement the small body of research informing relations between youth of color within detention facilities.

AB  - ObjectiveCancer patients are more likely to experience depression than the general population. This study aims to evaluate the possible association between cancer stigma and depression among cancer patients.
   MethodsAs a part of the Korean government's program to develop comprehensive supportive care, we conducted a nationwide survey in 2010 at the National Cancer Center and in nine regional cancer centers across Korea. Cancer stigma was assessed by using a set of 12 questions grouped in three domainsimpossibility of recovery, stereotypes of cancer patients, and experience of social discrimination. Depression was measured by using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.
   ResultsA total of 466 cancer patients were included in the study. Over 30% of the cancer survivors had negative attitudes toward cancer and held stereotypical views of themselves: about 10% of the participants experienced social discrimination due to cancer, and 24.5% reported clinically significant depressive symptoms. Patients who had or experienced cancer stigma were 2.5 times more likely to have depression than patients with positive attitudes.
   ConclusionsRegardless of highly developed medical science and increased survivorship, cancer survivors had cancer stigmas, and it was significantly associated with depression.
   ImpactOur findings emphasize the need for medical societies and health professionals to pay more attention to cancer stigma that patients are likely to experience during treatment. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This longitudinal study investigates whether immigrant-origin youths' ethnic identity exploration moderates the link between ethnic identity commitment and positive interethnic relations, operationalized as cross-ethnic friendships. Method: Turkish-German 4th graders (9-12 years old, n = 73) and 7th graders (13-15 years old, n = 67) reported on their cross-ethnic friendships at Time 1 and approximately 10 months later at Time 2. Commitment and exploration were measured at Time 1 with age appropriate versions of the Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure. Results: About 40% of the children's friendships were cross-ethnic and the amount of cross-ethnic friendships did not change from Time 1 to Time 2. Ethnic identity commitment and exploration were unrelated to cross-ethnic friendships in both age groups. Yet, among the 7th graders, exploration moderated the link between commitment and cross-ethnic friendships: when exploration was low, a higher level of commitment was associated with fewer cross-ethnic friendships. These associations were not significant among 4th-grade children. Conclusion: We conclude that by the age of 13 years, ethnic identity exploration can improve interethnic relations.

AB  - Pets have a positive influence on humans' physical and psychological wellbeing, as well as their close relationships. In general, people who hold a positive view of people in turn hold a favorable view of pets. Despite this, previous studies on the relationship between love toward people and love toward pets were inconclusive. In this study, we take a fresh look at the nexus of the domains of love and pets by exploring whether people's views of love with a romantic partner are associated with attitudes toward their pets. To answer this question, we administered scales to assess human love styles and attitudes toward pets. Participants completed measures on their attitudes toward romantic love, romantic relationship satisfaction, amount of social support, self-esteem, and attitudes toward pets. Human love styles assessed include Eros (passionate), Ludus (game-playing), Storge (friendship), Pragma (practical), Mania (obsessive), and Agape (selfless). Factor analyses of the pet attitudes measure revealed two factorspositive and negative attitudes toward pets. An erotic love style was linked to the endorsement of favorable pet attitudes, while a ludic love style was associated with the endorsement of unfavorable pet attitudes. Subsequent gender-specific correlations indicated that favorable pet attitudes were associated with high levels of social support for men, but low levels of support for women. Future research might address whether pets are instrumental in the development of love styles, whether love styles change after adoption of a pet, and if attitudes toward a romantic partner are similar to attitudes toward a particularly close companion animal.

AB  - NIMBY attitudes have been a longstanding obstacle to the implementation of public housing programs. The root cause of community opposition to public housing has primarily been the fear of housing price depreciation. This research extends the previous literature by examining individual perceptions and beliefs in the impact of public housing on neighboring housing prices. This study examines specific characteristics of residents that affect their negative beliefs in the change of housing prices due to public housing in Seoul, Korea. We use a logistic regression method to examine significant characteristics that influence the belief of housing price depreciation due to public housing developments. The findings showed that variables including income category, apartment living, negative physical image of public housing, positive and negative environmental changes due to public housing, and socioeconomically advantaged neighborhoods were positively associated with the belief of housing price depreciation due to public housing. Conversely, female gender, older age, self-employed workers, existence of public housing, and preference for the mixed income approach were negatively correlated with the belief of nearby housing price depreciation. Furthermore, these characteristics that affected the negative belief in public housing regarding the change of nearby housing prices varied across both income and age groups of residents. This study may help planners and scholars develop tailored strategies to mitigate residents' negative attitudes toward public housing.

AB  - How do people evaluate potentially good and desirable behavior by others? We investigate how participants (N=154) evaluate a couple that wants to adopt an orphan that would otherwise die. We collected data from heterosexual Christians in two cities in the Dutch Bible belt. We manipulated whether the adoptive-parents-to-be were a heterosexual couple or a lesbian couple and whether the couple self-identified as devout Christians or not. Using a subjective group dynamics account, we predicted and found that participants evaluated the lesbian couple in more negative terms than the heterosexual couple, especially when this couple was also Christian. These findings illustrate how positive behavior is derogated when displayed by in-group deviants.

AB  - This article examines the effects of quantity restrictions on residential property prices in the presence of neighborhood externalities. A Brigham Young University policy limiting students' location choices provides a natural experiment for studying the externality and quantity restriction effects on property values. A flexible hedonic model is used to control for nonstudent population spatial sorting by type. The estimates show significant positive quantity restriction and student agglomeration effects on student housing prices. There are also significant differences in the negative student externality across nonstudent neighborhoods, with the quantity restriction reinforcing (offsetting) the student price premium (discount) at the boundary.

AB  - P>Objective
   To explore attitudes, perceptions and practices among health care workers, antiretroviral treatment (ART) patients and community members regarding ART care and the social consequences of ART roll-out in rural Tanzania.
   Methods
   We performed focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with health care workers, community members, ART patients, religious leaders, as well as social workers. Field observations and ethnographic assessments were conducted in parallel.
   Results
   We found widespread negative attitudes and perceptions of ART care HIV testing and the ART programme, a lack of trust in its sustainability, as well as lack of community and health worker involvement in the programme planning and treatment. HIV-positive individuals on ART reported risky behaviours with the aim of revenge and were feared by community members. We also found that the ART availability was seen as an incentive to engage in HIV testing among some community members.
   Conclusion
   Our findings underline the importance of involving health workers and the community at a high level and their important role in promoting trust in the ART programme. There is an immense need to adjust interventions focusing on stigma reduction in the direction of ART scale-up and to build awareness among ART patients so they understand how risky behaviours affect their personal well-being and the community at large.

AB  - Purpose: Stuttering is a disorder of fluency that extends beyond its physical nature and has social, emotional and vocational impacts. Research shows that individuals often exhibit negative attitudes towards people who stutter; however, there is limited research on the attitudes and beliefs of speech pathology students towards people who stutter in Australia. Existing research is predominantly quantitative; whereas this mixed-method study placed an emphasis on the qualitative component. The purpose of this study was to explore the attitudes and beliefs of final year Australian speech pathology students towards people who stutter.
   Methods: This mixed-method study applied the Public Opinion Survey of Human Attributes Stuttering (POSHA-S) and semi-structured interviews to gather data from final year speech pathology students from a major university in Australia.
   Principal results: The overall qualitative findings identified that final year Australian speech pathology students exhibit positive attitudes towards people who stutter. The results also illustrated the role of education in influencing attitudes of students as well as increasing their confidence to work with people who stutter.
   Major conclusion: This research revealed that Australian final year speech pathology students exhibit positive attitudes towards people who stutter. They displayed an understanding that people who stutter may have acquired traits such as shyness as a response to their personal situation and environment, rather than those traits being endemic to them. Results also suggested that education can play a role in creating confident student clinicians in their transition to practice, and positively influence their attitudes and beliefs.

AB  - This essay examines a largely undocumented aspect of Irish literary history: the reception and circulation of John Milton's writings in Ireland. Milton's negative views of the inhabitants of Ireland have been well documented, but this essay analyses some of the intellectual responses of readers, writers, and thinkers in Ireland to the English republic's leading apologist for the conquest of Ireland. I argue that such an approach is required in order to redirect the critical narrative away from examinations of the hackneyed anti-Irish stereotypes written for colonial agendas and to shed light on the ways in which Milton was read to speak to and about a range of political, religious, social, and ethical issues in early modern and late modern Ireland. The essay also seeks to introduce my book-length study of the topic which, ranging across printed and manuscript sources-from Irish translations of Milton's poetry to political appropriations of his controversial prose-interrogates the collective assumptions, aspirations, fears, anxieties, and prejudices of readers and writers in Ireland as they are revealed in response to the self-conflicting voice of civil and religious liberties, on the one hand, and aggressive English colonialism on the other.

AB  - Although some research has examined negative automatic aspects of attitudes toward mental illness via relatively indirect measures among Western samples, it is unclear whether negative attitudes can be automatically activated in individuals from non-Western countries. This study attempted to validate results from Western samples with Chinese college students. We first examined the three-component model of implicit stigma (negative cognition, negative affect, and discriminatory tendencies) toward mental illness with the Single Category Implicit Association Test (SC-IAT). We also explored the relationship between explicit and implicit stigma among 56 Chinese university college students. In the three separate SC-IATs and the combined SC-IAT, automatic associations between mental illness and negative descriptors were stronger relative to those with positive descriptors and the implicit effect of cognitive and affective SC-IATs were significant. Explicit and implicit measures of stigma toward mental illness were unrelated. In our sample, women's overall attitudes toward mental illness were more negative than men's were, but no gender differences were found for explicit measures. These findings suggested that implicit stigma toward mental illness exists in Chinese students, and provide some support for the three-component model of implicit stigma toward mental illness. Future studies that focus on automatic components of stigmatization and stigma-reduction in China are warranted.

AB  - Recent research on intergroup contact has shown how interactions with outgroup members may both decrease and increase motivations to achieve social equality. Similarly, social identity theory has identified the conditions that lead individuals to challenge unequal social systems. Integrating these two major theories, the current study examined the processes underlying the relationship between intergroup contact and participants' willingness to engage in collective action to challenge social inequality. Specifically, we tested sociostructural variables (status legitimacy and stability, and permeability of group boundaries) as potential mediators of contact in a sample of both advantaged (Italian high school students, N = 392) and disadvantaged (immigrant high school students, N = 165) group members. We found that contact was positively associated with motivation for change, an effect mediated by decreased perceived legitimacy of status differences. Moreover, for the advantaged group, membership salience moderated the effects of quality (but not quantity) of contact. Indirect effects were instead not moderated by content of contact (an index considering the extent to which contact was characterized by a focus on differences vs. commonalities between groups). Theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed.

AB  - Objective: To describe attitudes about abortion among registered nurses (RNs) licensed in California and to determine if demographic characteristics were associated with these attitudes.
   Design: Cross-sectional, one-time survey.
   Setting: Online between 2015 and 2017.
   Participants: Nurses with active RN licenses in California (N = 2,500).
   Methods: An anonymous survey was sent to a random sample of 2,500 RNs with active California licenses between 2015 and 2017 to assess their personal and professional demographic characteristics and their attitudes toward abortion. Using scores on the Abortion Attitudes Scale, we dichotomized participants into proabortion and antiabortion categories. We used chi-square tests to determine differences based on demographic characteristics.
   Results: Data from 504 RNs licensed in California are included in this analysis. Most respondents identified as female (n = 462, 92%), older than 50 years of age (n = 379, 75%), married (n = 364, 72%), White (n = 354, 70%), and Christian (n = 322, 64%). They were more likely to have negative attitudes toward abortion care if they identified as Christian (p < .001) and more positive attitudes if they identified as White (p < .001) independent of identifying as Christian.
   Conclusions: Respondents had a complex range of attitudes about abortion. In some cases, these attitudes aligned and/or conflicted with stated religious orientation. This study highlights the demographic characteristics that are associated with the attitudes and beliefs about abortion among RNs licensed in California.

AB  - Aim: To test the effects of drug court participation on long-term mortality risk.
   Methods: During 1997-98, 235 individuals charged with a non-violent offense were randomly assigned to Baltimore City Drug Treatment Court (BCDTC) or traditional adjudication. Heroin was the predominant substance of choice among the sample. Participant mortality was observed for 15 years following randomization.
   Results: Over 20% of participants died during the study, at an average age of 46.6 years, and 64.4% of deaths were substance-use related. Survival analyses estimated that neither mortality from any cause nor from substance use-related causes significantly differed between BCDTC and traditional adjudication.
   Conclusions: Frequent and premature death among the sample indicates that this is a high-risk population in need of effective substance use treatment. Roughly half of drug treatment courts are now estimated to offer medication assisted treatment (MAT), which is currently the most effective treatment for opioid use disorders. In this study of BCDTC implemented over 15 years ago, only 7% of participants received MAT, which may explain the lack of program impact on mortality. Historical barriers to providing MAT in drug court settings include access, concerns about diversion, negative attitudes, blanket prohibitions, and stigma. Drug treatment courts should implement best practice standards for substance use treatment and overdose prevention, including increased access to MAT and naloxone, and training to reduce stigmatizing language and practice.

AB  - This study aimed to estimate the multilevel determinants of modern contraceptive use among reproductive-age women living in six cities in Nigeria (Abuja, Benin, Ibadan, Ilorin, Kaduna, and Zaria). Data from cross-sectional surveys conducted between 2010 and 2011 were linked to provide information on five hierarchical levels of the Socioecological Framework. Multilevel logit models estimated the odds of modern contraceptive use among 9,473 non-pregnant married/cohabiting women aged 15-49 years living in 488 clusters. About 25 percent of the women reported using modern contraceptive methods at the time of survey. Individual-level factors found to have a positive association with modern contraceptive use were parity, family planning self-efficacy, and partner discussion about fertility desires while perception of negative attitudes from community member about contraceptive use was negatively associated with modern contraceptive use (p < 0.05). At the community level, media exposure to family planning messages and city of residence were significantly associated with modern contraceptive use in the studied sample (p < 0.05). The positive association between parity and modern contraceptive use was modified by the community's ideal family size. The results of this study support the evidence for multilevel interventions as a way to improve the prevalence of modern contraceptive use in urban Nigeria.

AB  - Despite the accumulating evidence on the positive and negative outcomes of Facebook use, how people perceive themselves to be subject to these outcomes as well as the consequences and mechanisms of these perceptions are underexplored. According to optimistic bias, Facebook users may perceive that bad things are more likely to happen to others than to themselves, while good things are more likely to happen to them than to others. The findings from an online survey among Facebook users indicate that the negative psychological and social outcomes of using Facebook were perceived to be more likely to happen to other Facebook users than to themselves, p<0.001. These self-other discrepant perceptions toward negative social events (e.g., Facebook cyberbullying and scams) significantly mediated one's willingness to support Internet regulation, Sobel z=2.49, p=0.01. For positive outcomes of Facebook use, the direction of optimistic bias was reversed, t(235) = -5.52, p<0.01, indicating that people minimized the likelihoods of experiencing positive events from Facebook while assessing that other Facebook users are prone to encounter those positive events. This reversal pattern emerged among those with negative attitudes toward, and low involvement with, Facebook. These findings demonstrate important and novel self-other discrepant perceptions concerning the risks and benefits of Facebook use.

AB  - Bisexual behaviours are relatively common among men who have sex with men in China. This pilot study aims to reveal the complex processes through which such men manage their sexuality, family responsibilities and sexual behaviours in a rural Chinese setting. A total of 15 men who have sex with men were recruited by purposive sampling. Face-to-face in-depth interviews were conducted to explore participants' views about their sexual experiences and practices. The Chinese traditional moral code, family values and gender roles that form the crucial components of Confucianism were reflected in the participants' efforts to maintain familial and social harmony through a compromised form of sexual partnership. Most study participants demonstrated a mixed experience of social stigma, sexual naivete and ignorance of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Under cultural and family pressure, men who have sex with men entered heterosexual marriages with the intention of maintaining a balance between their collectivist (familial) obligations and their individualistic (same-sex sexual) desires. However, the opaque nature of their concurrent sexual relationships may endanger their personal health and accelerate HIV and STI transmission. Reducing the stigma and social prejudice associated with male same-sex sexual relations is essential for any culturally sensitive HIV-prevention programme to succeed in rural China.

AB  - This article documents the transformation of cognitive and relational dispositions within a group of 14 White female undergraduate students ranging in age from 18 to 21 years and enrolled in a semester-long diversity course. Using Mezirow's transformative learning theory as an interpretive frame to guide our phenomenological analysis of written assignments, data revealed that students experienced multiple cognitive and relational transformative processes. Findings suggest that transformative learning theory's (Kitchenham, 2008; Mezirow & Associates, 2000) framework around processes of transformation is a useful analytical framework for capturing students' unique transformative learning processes or journeys. Findings further suggest that, students' relationships with members of cultural communities previously unfamiliar to them were an important part of students' transformative journeys. These relationships provided students with tangible experiences that assisted them in shifting their worldviews and arriving at greater understanding of how inequality, oppression, and prejudice impact the daily lives of others. Finally, the findings indicate that instructors' perspectives on what accounts for a transformative process is often not aligned with students' opinions of their own growth and development. The study concludes that transformation is a process, and that all steps are a necessary part of a transformative experience.

TI  - Facing Our Fears: The Impact of a 4-Day Training Intervention to Reduce Negative Perspectives on Sexual and Gender Minorities among Religious Leaders in Kenya
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEX RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - This study evaluated short- and long-term impact of a 4-day training intervention to reduce negative perspectives of religious leaders in Kenya on sexual and gender minorities, adopting a one-group pretest-posttest-follow-up design. Religious leaders' perspectives play an important role in maintaining the negative status quo for sexual and gender minorities, especially in Africa, where religion's impact is ubiquitous and holding negative attitudes against these populations is perceived as an expression of doctrinal orthodoxy. The training, developed by a community-based organization, employs a variety of strategies, including education, storytelling, and in-person contact. Data were collected directly before and after the training, and at 3- to 4-months follow-up. After the training, acceptance of lesbian women and gay men and gender diversity had increased, while attitudes toward gender and sexual minorities became more positive. Interaction effect analysis showed that compared to women, men changed more, as did those who scored higher on religious fundamentalism. Changes in attitudes were maintained at follow-up (three to four months). Although it is not clear whether the training had an impact on the religious leaders' interactions with members of their congregation, these findings suggest that intensive trainings may promote positive changes in their perspective on gender and sexual minorities.

AB  - Physical health disparities by sexual orientation are widespread yet under-investigated. Drawing upon theories of biological embedding of social adversity, we tested whether minority stress (in the form of perceived discrimination) is associated with salivary interleukin-6 (IL-6), an inflammatory mediator. Furthermore, we examined whether covering, a strategy involving downplaying a stigmatized social identity, modified this association. A community sample (N = 99) of gay men (n = 78) and lesbian women (n = 21) completed self-report measures of minority stress and identity management and provided saliva samples which were assayed for IL-6. Among gay men, results from generalized linear models supported a hypothesized interaction between perceived discrimination and covering, such that perceived discrimination was predictive of higher levels of IL-6 for those who engaged in less covering but not for those who engaged in more covering. This interaction was robust to a number of potential covariates (alcohol, medication, body mass index, race and age). Results for lesbian women suggested a different pattern: the only statistically significant association detected was between greater perceived discrimination and lower levels of IL-6. Findings from the current study point to an important role for inflammatory processes in understanding and remediating health disparities based upon sexual orientation that stem from exposure to prejudice and discrimination.

AB  - Objective: Recent years have seen advances in theories and models of risk and crisis communication, with a focus on emerging epidemic infection. Nevertheless, information flow remains unilateral in many countries and does not take into account the public's polyvocality and the fact that its opinions and knowledge often "compete" with those of health authorities. This article addresses the challenges organizations face in communicating with the public sphere.
   Methods: Our theoretical approach is conceptualized through a framework that focuses on the public sphere and that builds upon existing guidelines and studies in the context of health and pandemics. We examine how health organizations cope with the public's transformation from recipients to an active and vocal entity, ie, how and to what extent health organizations address the public's anxiety and concerns arising in the social media during outbreaks.
   Results: Although international organizations have aspired to relate to the public as a partner, this article identifies notable gaps.
   Conclusions: Organizations must involve the public throughout the crisis and conduct dialogues free of prejudices, paternalism, and preconceptions. Thereby, they can impart precise and updated information reflecting uncertainty and considering cultural differences to build trust and facilitate cooperation with the public sphere.

AB  - Aims: Today, the prevalence of mental disorders is increasing. In Iran, more than 20% of people suffer from mental problems too. Despite all scientific developments in diagnosis and treatment of the mentally ill patients, presenting psychotherapy service is still facing some problems because of the negative attitudes which require more investigation. The current research aims to study the attitudes of Kashan city population about the mentally ill and the contributing factors. Materials And Methods: In this study, the samples were chosen randomly at two levels among health posts and their covered population in Kashan city (364 samples). Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill questionnaire was used for data collecting. The data were analyzed by SPSS software and statistical tests. Findings: Most of the participants had a positive attitude toward the mentally ill (with the mean of 3.66 from 5 score and standard deviation of 0.37). Attitude of women and higher-educated people were, respectively, better than men (PV < 0.01) and lower-educated people (PV < 0.01). There was no meaningful difference between attitude toward the mentally ill and employment, and there was no meaningful correlation between the attitude score and age either. Conclusion: The results confirm the role of education on the positive attitude of people toward the mentally ill. The positive attitude can show the appropriate awareness of people on these lines.

AB  - Aims We sought to establish the psychometric properties of the Nurses' Professional Values Scale-3 Arabic version among student nurses.
   Background Nurses' professional values are central in the nursing profession; it encompasses principles such as respecting people rights and dignity, compassion, and caring without prejudice.
   Introduction The professional values of student nurses, most specifically in Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries, can hardly be studied due of the lack of a valid and reliable measure that is linguistically and culturally acceptable.
   Methods In this cross-sectional study, we came up with the Arabic version of the tool and tested its psychometric properties among 350 student nurses from two universities in Saudi Arabia.
   Results The principal component analysis revealed three distinct factors with eigenvalues above 1.00 and with an explained variance of 70.5%. The computed Cronbach's alpha of the tool was 0.967, while 0.964, 0.960, and 0.886 were computed for activism, caring, and professionalism, respectively. The test-retest scores (n = 85) revealed an Intraclass Correlation Coefficient of 0.827 for the entire scale, 0.826 for the subscale activism, 0.792 for caring, and 0.870 for professionalism.
   Conclusions The Nurses' Professional Values Scale-3 Arabic version had sound psychometric properties when used among Saudi student nurses.
   Implication for Nursing The tool can provide an accurate assessment of the professional values of Saudi nursing students and other Arabic-speaking student nurses.
   Implication for Nursing Policy The tool can be utilized by nursing and nursing education policymakers in Saudi Arabia and in other Arab countries in guiding the creation of practice and education policies that gears towards improving nurses' professional values in this part of the world.

AB  - This article develops the concept of "mimetic weaponization" for theory-building. Memes recurrently serve as identificatory markers of affiliation across social media platforms, with ensuing controversies potentially proving newsworthy. Our elaboration of weaponization refers to the purposeful deployment of memetic imagery to disrupt, undermine, attack, resist or reappropriate discursive positions pertaining to public affairs issues in the news. For alt-right memetic conflicts, impetuses range from "sharing a joke" to promoting "alternative facts," rebuking "political correctness" or "wokeness," defending preferred framings of "free speech," or signalling cynicism, distrust or dissent with "mainstream" media, amongst other drivers. Of particular import, we argue, is the politics of othering at stake, including in the wider journalistic mediation of a meme's public significance. Rendering problematic this contested process, this article focuses on Pepe the Frog as an exemplar, showing how and why variations of this mimetic cartoon have been selectively mobilized to help normalize - ostensibly through humour, parody or satire - rules of inclusion and exclusion consistent with hate-led agendas. Digital journalism, we conclude, must improve its capacity to identify and critique mimetic weaponization so as to avoid complicity in perpetuating visceral forms of prejudice and discrimination so often presented as "just a bit of fun."

AB  - Though much work has examined how sexual orientation and body shape are jointly constituted, less has examined the joint perception of body shape, gender/sex, and sexuality. We draw upon multifarious person perception approaches to examine how personality and sexuality-related traits are attributed to bodies of varying shape (skinny, average, fat) when presented with differing social identities along the axes of gender/sex (male, female) and sexual orientation (heterosexual, lesbian/gay). In a sample of 991 participants, we found robust evidence that trait application varied by both body shape and sexual orientation. Further, supporting our hypotheses, we found that gay male bodies were perceived as more feminine than heterosexual male bodies, and skinny male bodies were perceived as more feminine than other body shapes. Supporting additional hypothesizing, lesbian female bodies were perceived as more masculine than heterosexual female bodies, and fat female bodies were perceived as the most masculine across sexual orientations. Partially supporting our hypotheses, we found that average bodies were perceived as the most typical for all identities; further, bodies perceived as less typical of their social identity category were perceived as experiencing heightened prejudice on the basis of body shape.

AB  - Introduction: Osteoporosis is a major worldwide health problem represented through decreased bone density. Females at younger ages should be the target for all efforts fighting against this disease aiming toward raising their awareness and promoting healthy behaviours.& nbsp;Purpose: To evaluate the effectiveness of an osteoporosis educational program in promoting female Jordanian university students' knowledge, attitudes and self-efficacy regarding osteoporosis.& nbsp;Method: The design of the research was a randomized control using a one-day educational program as the intervention. Two times of measurement were conducted (before and four weeks after the educational program) to measure participants' knowledge regarding osteoporosis, attitudes and self-efficacy toward osteoporosis.& nbsp;Results: A total of 184 female university students participated in this study randomly assigned to interventional (n=112, 60.9%) and control groups (n=72, 39.1%). Before attending the educational program, participants in both groups were found to have relatively low level of knowledge, negative attitudes, and poor self-efficacy toward osteoporosis. Results of the post test indicated that participants who attended the program had significant improvement in all study variables compared to those who did not.& nbsp;Conclusion: Conducting an osteoporosis education program had positive effects on the female Jordanian university students' knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy. Our results support the importance of conducting awareness programs for this population and confirms the need to include an osteoporosis educational program in university curricula.

AB  - With the development of marine science, the dynamic underwater acoustic network composed of many underwater and surface nodes has become an active research field of information science. The network in this study mainly involves the underwater gliders integrating underwater acoustic transducers and the wave glider carrying an ultra-short baseline positioning system. The attitude change of the underwater glider during zigzag profiling changes the beam pointing of the underwater acoustic transducer, which may lead to communication failure in the network. To deal with this problem, a motion platform for integrating an underwater acoustic transducer is proposed to be installed on the underwater glider. This work first integrates an underwater glider and a wave glider into a multi-body model by taking underwater acoustic signals as the media to illustrate the kinematics of the proposed motion platform. According to screw theory, the motion platform needs at least two rotational degrees of freedom to follow the ultra-short baseline positioning system. According to the bend of the sound ray, the motion angles of the motion platform are modified, and the motion platform controller is designed. The simulation results show that the controller can keep the underwater acoustic transducer tracking and pointing to the ultra-short baseline positioning system during communication when the underwater glider and wave glider move freely.

AB  - Background: Emergency physicians and nurses are frequently dissatisfied professionally when treating alcohol-intoxicated patients, and have negative attitudes towards this patient population and alcohol rehabilitation. Study Objectives: The goal of this study is to examine differences in attitudes between emergency physicians and nurses towards alcohol-intoxicated patients. Methods: This single-site survey study evaluated emergency physicians' and nurses': 1) attitudes of personal professional satisfaction and dissatisfaction when caring for intoxicated patients; 2) attitudes towards the difficulty in caring for alcohol-intoxicated patients; 3) attitudes towards respect of the alcohol-intoxicated patient; 4) attitudes towards the adequacy of training in caring for intoxicated patients; 5) attitudes towards rehabilitation and counseling of alcohol-intoxicated patients. Results: Physicians were less satisfied and more dissatisfied than nurses when caring for alcohol-intoxicated patients. Physicians found treating alcohol-intoxicated patients more difficult than nurses did. Physicians were more likely to agree that alcohol-intoxicated patients should be treated with respect. Physicians felt more adequately trained than nurses in caring for alcohol-intoxicated patients. Nurses were more likely to believe that alcohol-related rehabilitation is ineffective compared with physicians. Both nurses and physicians refer alcohol-intoxicated patients to rehabilitation to a similar extent. Conclusions: Emergency physicians and nurses have similar attitudes but significant differences in the extent of these attitudes towards the care of the alcohol-intoxicated patient.

KW  - EDUCATION
AB  - Background: Pediatric nurses have often reported that pain management is a vital part of patient care. Evidence, however, suggests pediatric procedural pain treatments are often underused. Cognitive dissonance, themental conflict leading to unpleasant thoughts and or feelings, may be related to this evidence-based gap found between what pediatric nurses claim about procedural pain management (that it is important) and what they actually do (underutilize pain treatments). Objective: The purpose of this manuscript is to clarify and further develop the concept of cognitive dissonance in terms of its relationship to nurses' mental struggles with underutilization of pediatric procedural pain treatments. A more relevant and extended definition of cognitive dissonance is presented. Design: The concept of cognitive dissonance was examined using Rodgers' evolutionary concept analysis approach/framework. Analysis Methods: Through a six-step process of concept identification, setting and sample identification, data collection, data analysis, and future implication discussion, a more accurate and representative definition of cognitive dissonance is described. Databases used included CINAHL, Google Scholar, PsycINFO, ERIC, and PubMed. Seminal, recent, and relevant works were included in the review to adequately develop and clarify the concept. Conclusions: Procedural pain management breech among pediatric nurses is proposed to occur before the mental conflict produced. The unpleasant mental conflict created after the breech is followed by the nurse's determination to reduce mental conflict through attitude change followed by cognition change, which more closely reflects his or her behavior.

AB  - Background
   People who inject drugs are subjected to great stigmatization in many parts of the world. How they deal with stigma is closely linked to how stigma means to them. Understanding the strategies individuals employ to cope with these negative attitudes and what resources they mobilize in this process gives useful insights for clinical work and policy development.
   Methods
   We conducted 12 months of field observation in 2017 and 2018 and 54 in-depth interviews with people who inject drugs in Haiphong, Vietnam. Grounded theory underpinned our sampling and data analysis.
   Results
   The strategies participants used to manage stigma were both information and tension management. Many participants not only concealed their drug use but actively cultivated a pro-social image based on Vietnamese cultural virtues such as selflessness, hard work or harmonious living with others. Participants withdrew from social relationships to distance themselves from the stereotype of a money-begging drug user. They used techniques of neutralization to emphasize their good character and reframe their drug-related issues in a different light in order to negotiate their social status with their interlocutors.
   Conclusion
   People who inject drugs endorse the same social values and aspirations as nonusers. A good support structure and resources could help them to cope more effectively with stigma.

AB  - Background: Affiliate stigma of family caregivers may severely influence family caregiving, early treatment, and recovery of people with mental illness (PMI), and it may be impacted by the knowledge of mental illness and contact with PMI. However, little is known about the correlation between affiliate stigma of family caregivers of PMI and contact in Hong Kong. Aims: This study aimed to investigate affiliate stigma and its influencing factors among family caregivers of PMI in Hong Kong. Methods: A total of 106 family caregivers in Hong Kong participated in the study. The measurements included affiliate stigma, contacts (quantity, quality, and level), knowledge, prejudice, and discriminatory behaviors. Multiple regression analyses were employed. Results: The mean score of affiliate stigma scale (ASS) in family caregivers was 2.17 (SD = 0.65). In regression analyses, the results showed that contact quantity and contact level were significantly associated with higher affiliate stigma and its cognitive domain, while contact quality (e.g. positive contact) were significantly associated with lower affiliate stigma and its all domains among family caregivers. The positive relationship between prejudicial attitudes and affiliate stigma was also found. Conclusions: Affiliate stigma is severe among family caregivers of PMI in Hong Kong. The results of this study indicate that contact, especially positive contact, contributes to reducing affiliate stigma among family caregivers of PMI. The results of this study are important for development of health policy on reducing stigma in family caregivers of PMI. The effectiveness of Enhancing Contact Model (ECM) should be examined in future anti-stigma interventions.

AB  - Writing the architecture survey remains one of the biggest challenges in the field. Nineteenth- and twentieth-century Western scholars usually followed a synchronic approach (literally "with-time") and described Chinese architecture without reference to its development and evolution over time. Although synchrony (attention to a particular moment in time) is not incorrect in principle, it is all too often attached with a negative connotation. A possible reason is that Liang Sicheng, and the generations after him, have understood all facets of synchrony as expression of the old dichotic worldview that once glorified Europe and deprived Asia of its history (non-historical timelessness) as formulated by the German philosophers Hegel and Herder and codified in Fletcher's and Fergusson's authoritative textbooks. Challenging the previous misconception of the generalization of synchronic textbooks, the paper attempts to examine the multiple facets of synchrony and identify the writing style of Borschmann's Chinesische Architektur, the prime example of the German-language survey on Chinese Architecture. In doing so, the paper hopefully can provide basis and arguments in defense of the work, presenting a reconciliation to the biased, subjective presentation of Chinese architecture once afflicted with prejudices and misapprehensions. The paper values Borschmann's Chinesische Architektur as a distinguished work different from other synchronic writings through its pioneering, value-neutral and formal approach.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to apply cultivation theory to social network sites by investigating how Facebook uses cultivates users' ethnic diversity perceptions and attitudes. Design/methodology/approach The authors' investigations include an online and offline survey study with 476 Facebook users and a follow-up experiment with 75 individuals. Findings The authors provide empirical support that Facebook use cultivates ethnic diversity perceptions and ethnic diversity-related attitudes. They show that Facebook use relates to perceptions of ethnic minorities that resemble the world on Facebook that is characterized by high ethnic diversity. The authors further demonstrate that the cultivation of ethnic diversity-related attitudes is mediated by diversity perceptions related to users' close social environment. Research limitations/implications Future research should consider culturally and educationally diverse samples as well as longitudinal research designs to address external validity and causality issues. Practical implications Algorithms determining the content users are exposed should be thoughtfully curated to avoid attitudinal and ideological polarization. Social implications Facebook can play an important role in positively shaping intergroup relations, thereby countering negative outgroup attitudes, social anxieties and radical right-wing parties. Originality/value The authors' studies extend the scope of cultivation research by identifying a new media vehicle as a source of cultivation influences and shed light on the cultivation-based process of attitude change on social network sites.

AB  - Despite a vast pan-European literature on extreme right parties (ERPs), few studies speak convincingly to questions of party membership and activism. This article draws on a unique membership dataset to examine contextual predictors of membership of the British National Party (BNP), currently the dominant representative of the extreme right in British politics. We operationalize and test for the impact of both demand-side and supply-side factors, including the seldom examined effects of historical legacies, and of party activism and electoral success on membership levels. Aside from congregating in urban areas that are more deprived and have low education levels, we also find evidence of a legacy effect', whereby membership levels are higher in areas with a historic tradition of extreme right activism. This research is the first ever systematic investigation of national extreme right party membership.

AB  - Numerous studies point to the potential of intergroup contact for reducing prejudice and intergroup tension. However, this potential can be realized only when group members are willing to engage in intergroup contact. The goal of the current article is to provide a theoretical framework for understanding the barriers and the motivations that explain why individuals would be willing (or not) to engage in intergroup contact. Our taxonomy relies on Pettigrew's (1997) multilevel approach for analyzing social phenomenon, considering the impact of factors at the macro societal level, the meso intermediate level, and the micro individual level. This taxonomy enables us to devote special attention to barriers and motivations that are specific to groups trapped in violent intergroup conflict (macrolevel factors), to barriers and motivations that result from membership in social groups (mesolevel factors), and to motivators and barriers that exist at the intrapersonal level (e.g., microlevel factors). We discuss the integration of the various levels and the implication of such integration for future research and practice. This article forms a roadmap for investigating a relatively understudied angle in the literature on contact and provides both theoretical and practical insights as to when and why individuals are willing to engage in intergroup contact.

AB  - It is often recommended that health information should be simplified for people with low health literacy. However, little is known about whether messages adapted to low health literacy audiences are also effective for people with high health literacy, or whether simple messages are counterproductive in this group. Using a two (illustrated vs. text-only) by two (nondifficult vs. difficult text) between-subjects design, we test whether older adults with low (n = 279) versus high health literacy (n = 280) respond differently to colorectal cancer screening messages. Results showed that both health literacy groups recalled information best when the text was nondifficult. Reduced text difficulty did not lead to negative attitudes or less intention to have screening among people with high health literacy. Benefits of illustrations, in terms of improved recall and attitudes, were only found in people with low health literacy who were exposed to difficult texts. This was not found for people with high health literacy. In terms of informed decisions, nondifficult and illustrated messages resulted in the best informed decisions in the low health literacy group, whereas the high health literacy group benefited from nondifficult text in general, regardless of illustrations. Our findings imply that materials adapted to lower health literacy groups can also be used for a more general audience, as they do not deter people with high health literacy.

Often an officer is certified as an expert witness and, accordingly, can provide opinions to the court based on his or her law enforcement expertise. Other times, the officer offers testimony as a layperson. In the latter situation, Federal Rule of Evidence 701 controls the officer's lay opinion testimony. This Rule was first adopted to remedy a problematic common law practice of universally prohibiting lay opinion testimony. As the Rule stands now, all lay witnesses, including law enforcement officers, must limit their opinions to ones that are based on their personal perceptions and that are helpful to the fact-finder.
   Courts, however, are split regarding where to draw the line when lay officers are asked to provide lay opinion testimony about an investigation. In particular, courts have disagreed over the question of when a lay officer may provide opinion testimony about the meaning of recorded phone calls. This Note explores the three approaches the federal circuit courts take to this question. To resolve the split, this Note suggests that an amended version of the Second, Fourth, and Eighth Circuits' approaches be adopted. These circuits hold that officers' lay opinion testimony must be restricted to instances of true first-hand knowledge to ensure that jurors are not prejudiced by unqualified and unhelpful testimony.

AB  - Silence is laden when it comes to race and leadership. We believe it is critical to reclaim the kind of silence that supports conscious transformation. Our contribution in this endeavor is twofold. Firstly, we distinguish between fear-based silence and sacred silence. Fear-based silence can be a running away from discomfort, a covering up of trepidation and anxiety. It can lead to collective amnesia and willful ignorance, a hoarding of status, privilege, and power, and forge deep divides between people. This is the world of masks and performativity, and at its worst harbors prejudice, hate, and destruction. Leadership tolerant of fear-based silence permits a festering of racism. Sacred silence by contrast heals and raises consciousness. For the kind of leadership required to consistently and indefatigably push for change and disruption to racism, we need a practice of sacred silence. Sacred silence cultivates the courage to look fearlessly within personal shadows and bravely at what is required to make the world a safe, secure, and just place for all. Secondly, we present four themes that emerged from our reflexive inquiry into race, leadership, and silence: listening dialogue, returning to Mother Earth wisdom, honoring potential, and practicing mindfulness in a context of collective wisdom.

AB  - Fossa Alternas and double vault urine diverting dry (DVUDD) latrines have been extensively promoted as ecological sanitation (EcoSan) latrine options in Malawi, but little is known about whether they are used properly. A qualitative study of EcoSan users was conducted in Blantyre and Chikwawa districts, Malawi. Data were collected using in-depth interviews (IDIs). Twenty-eight (28) and seventeen (17) IDIs were conducted with household heads that had Fossa Alternas and DVUDD latrines, respectively. Recorded data were transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. Of the total 45 EcoSan users, 40 had moderate to high knowledge on EcoSan latrine use, four had low knowledge and only one had no knowledge of how EcoSan latrines operate. Blockages of urine diversion systems, intensive management and maintenance needed for the latrines were reported as some problems related to the negative attitudes about EcoSan use. Use of soil and ash, urine diverting, use of hot water and chemicals to kill maggots, urinating in the drop-hole of the DVUDDs and poor maintenance of the roof were some of the practices reported on use of these latrines. It is therefore recommended that government, through community workers, should be monitoring practices on EcoSan latrine use and provide necessary support to users.

AB  - Aims: While disability is the focus of much attention in occupational therapy, there has been little attention paid to disability within the profession. Disabled therapists not only bring valuable perspectives on disability, but also pose important challenges to taken-for-granted assumptions about impairment and disability within the profession. At the same time, their cultural beliefs and values may clash with core assumptions of the profession. Methods: This study analyses interview data from two disabled occupational therapists, part of a larger study with cultural minority therapists. Semi-structured interviews explored their experiences of professional practice in the context of societal belief in the superiority of non-disabled and "normal" ways of doing and being. Major findings: Some cultural values of participants clashed with the values and beliefs of their profession, particularly concerning independence. Negative attitudes of colleagues and managers were the key barriers to practice. The responsibility for bridging the disabled/non-disabled cultural divide rested with the disabled therapists, exacerbating inequity. Nonetheless, these therapists believed their disability experiences had advantages for practice. Conclusions: Disabled therapists may be required to engage in invisible work to communicate across cultural differences, and to educate others. Respectful openness to difference could enhance the practice competence of both disabled therapists and their non-disabled colleagues. This demands critical reflexive attention to ableism within the profession.

AB  - The present research demonstrates a dissociation between explicit and implicit intergroup evaluation in the reciprocal attitudes between indigenous (Mapuche) and non-indigenous Chileans. In both social groups, the explicit measures of attitudes towards the respective in-group and out-group were compared with the Implicit Association Test scores. The results indicate that the members of the low-status minority might explicitly express a moderate evaluative preference for their in-group but might implicitly devalue it. Conversely, the members of the high-status majority might implicitly devalue their out-group but might explicitly express no bias. These results are theoretically framed in terms of system justification, conventional stereotypes and motivated correction processes.

AB  - As the workforce becomes increasingly diverse, motivating individuals from different backgrounds to work together effectively is a major challenge facing organizations. In an experiment conducted at a large public university in the United States, we manipulate the salience of participants' multidimensional natural identities and investigate the effects of identity on coordination and cooperation in a series of minimum-effort and prisoner's dilemma games. By priming a fragmenting (ethnic) identity, we find that, compared to the control, participants are significantly less likely to choose high effort in the minimum-effort games, leading to less efficient coordination. In comparison, priming a common organization (school) identity significantly increases the choice of a rational joint payoff maximizing strategy in a prisoner's dilemma game. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

KW  - racism
AB  - Justice is a core principle in bioethics, and a fair opportunity to achieve health is central to this principle. Racism and other forms of prejudice, discrimination, or bias directed against people on the basis of their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group are known contributors to health inequity, defined as unjust differences in health or access to care. Though hospital-based ethics committees and consultation services routinely address issues of justice that arise in the course of patient care, there is variability in whether and how racism and other causes of health inequities are addressed. In this paper, we describe a novel structure and process for addressing health equity within clinical ethics consultation. In addition, we discuss the barriers and challenges to its success, many of which are rooted in the identities, norms and assumptions that underlie traditional clinical ethics consultation. We offer pragmatic recommendations and conclude with unresolved questions that remain as we work to adapt the structure of a clinical ethics consultation service to improve attention to issues of health equity and promote anti-racism in patient care and institutional policy.

AB  - Via colorist and white privilege, colorism and racism mirror one another. Colorism is internalized racism; an oppressive internalization regarding phenotypes and skin tones. Mindfulness and other self-reflective practices have been used to modify manifestations of racism such as prejudiced thoughts and biased behaviors. Mindfulness may also help change expressions of colorism as a derivative of racism. Therefore, the implicit manifestations of colorism were further examined in addition to the viability of mindfulness as an intervention. A review of existing literature was conducted using secondary data collection. Analysis resulted in thematic formulation. The findings suggest increasing awareness and self-determination are salient in mindfulness response to colorist bias and behaviors. Mindfulness alone is symbolic of the past and present legacy that African Americans face with embedded racism and colorism experiences. Social workers will find it optimal to use interventions that aid in transforming colorist bias. Implications for healing others from colorism implicit bias is proposed in social workers' use of self-reflective practices and the RAIN modality, illustrative of actions to recognize, allow, investigate, and nurture. Continuous education is vital in social work practice; therefore, future research is suggested to build on this review because colorism as a hierarchy affects all of humanity.

AB  - The policing of young people, especially through stop-and-search, has been rigorously debated in the context of rising violence in the UK. While concepts based on procedural justice theory and perceptions of police fairness are directly relevant to these debates, these have rarely been tested on young people, nor have they taken account of the impact of stop-and-search. This paper examines young people's experiences of stop-and-search in two Scottish and two English cities, and tests the relationship between these experiences, their trust in the police, their perceptions of police legitimacy and their compliance with the law. The study finds that Scottish adolescents, who experienced higher volume stop-and-search, had more negative attitudes to the police and perceived them to be less procedurally fair than English adolescents. Structural equation modelling confirms that principles of procedural justice theory do apply to young people in this UK sample. However, our findings suggest that stop-and-search may damage trust in the police and perceptions of police legitimacy, regardless of the volume of police stop-and-search, and this may result in increased offending behaviour. With ongoing calls to increase the use of stop-and-search in response to recent increases in knife crime in England, we argue that its use needs to be carefully balanced against the, as yet poorly evidenced, benefits of the use of the tactic.

AB  - Although commonly prescribed, little research exists on bath grab bars. This study examined the use of bath grab bars following an experimentally induced balance perturbation, the influence of the task on grab bar use, and the influence of balance loss on acceptance of grab bars. A mixed design documented the use of four different grab bar configurations: (a) no bars, (b) vertical/horizontal combination, (c) L-shaped bar, and (d) vertical/angled combination following balance loss. Eighty adults were randomly assigned to three groups. Each group tried the "no bar" configuration and one of the other grab bar configurations. In 25% of the trials for each configuration, balance perturbation was induced. Older adults used grab bars 59.4% of time to regain balance, compared to 13.6% for younger adults. The vertical bar on the side wall was favored by both groups of participants during both bathtub entry and exit. To promote safety in the home, existing building codes must be revised to recommend minimally a vertical grab bar on the side wall. Additional bars may be needed to ensure safety during stand-to-sit and sit-to-stand phases of bath transfers. Initiatives must be taken to decrease the prejudice associated with grab bars.

AB  - The importance of social connection to well-being is underscored by individuals' reactivity to events highlighting the potential for rejection and exclusion, which extends even to observing the social exclusion of others ("vicarious ostracism"). Because responses to vicarious ostracism depend at least in part on empathy with the target, and individuals tend to empathize less readily with outgroup than ingroup members, the question arises as to whether there is a boundary condition on vicarious ostracism effects whereby individuals are relatively immune to observing ingroup-on-outgroup ostracism. Of particular interest is the case where members of a dominant ethnic group observe fellow ingroup members ostracize a member of a disadvantaged ethnic minority group, as here there is a compelling potential alternative: Perceived violation of contemporary social norms condemning prejudice and discrimination might instead lead dominant group members to be especially upset by "dominant-on-disadvantaged" ostracism. Accordingly, the present research examines, across four studies and 4413 participants, individuals' affective reactions to observing dominant-on-disadvantaged versus dominant-on-dominant ostracism. In each study, dominant group members (White/Europeans) observed dominant group members include or ostracize a fellow dominant group member or a disadvantaged ethnic minority group member (a Black individual) in an online Cyberball game. Results revealed that dominant group members felt more guilt, anger, and sadness after observing severe ostracism of a disadvantaged as opposed to dominant group member. Although no direct effects emerged on behavioral outcomes, exploratory analyses suggested that observing ostracism of a disadvantaged (versus dominant) group member had indirect effects on behavior via increased feelings of anger. These results suggest that observing ostracism may be a sufficiently potent and relatable experience that when it occurs across group boundaries it awakens individuals' sensitivity to injustice and discrimination.

AB  - Background: Rates of obesity are rising and previous research suggests this is not effectively dealt with in healthcare settings. Nurses are increasingly involved in lifestyle management of patients, and understanding the barriers to discussing weight with patients is likely to increase successful weight management. Obesity management is a role that nursing students will need to be equipped with and more likely to be targeted for future training developments in tackling the increasing rates of obesity.
   Objectives: To explore the perceptions of obesity, potential barriers to successful patient weight management and training needs of nursing students.
   Methods: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 nursing students. Audiotaped interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using an inductive thematic approach informed by principles of grounded theory.
   Results: Participants reported the challenge of managing obesity in healthcare practice, such as the impact of negative attitudes in healthcare practice on patient care. Although perceived as core to their training, nursing students lacked the confidence and techniques to discuss weight management with patients. Participants also perceived the nursing curriculum as lacking a focus on obesity, and reported a need for advanced communication skills training.
   Conclusion: Although seen as important, nurses lack the skills to facilitate weight management, leading to nurses failing to broach the issue. Practice implications: Nurse educators should consider the perceptions of current students when making curriculum developments in this area. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In January 2021, Israel started vaccinating healthcare workers (HCWs) and individuals older than 65 years with COVID-19 vaccines. Scientific literature points to vaccine hesitancy as being a major health concern. During time of pandemics, increased consciousness of health behaviors may be encountered. The current study aimed to assess attitudes to general vaccines and to COVID-19 vaccines in particular among adult (>18) Israeli general public, and among Israeli dentists and dental hygienists. Cross-sectional surveys were filled out by a total of 501 participants (361 Israeli adults >18 years, 73 dental hygienists, and 67 dentists). Along with basic demographics, participants responded to the Hebrew VAX, COVID-VAX and HCS scales. Group comparisons were analyzed using t tests and ANOVAs with Scheffe's test used for post hoc comparisons. Dental hygienists demonstrated significantly higher anti-vaccinations approaches than both dentists (p < 0.01) and the general public (p < 0.05). In all groups, attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccines were more negative compared to attitudes towards general vaccines, with hygienists demonstrating significant negative attitudes compared to dentists (p < 0.05). The general public (p = 0.56) and hygienists demonstrated increased health awareness compared to dentists (p < 0.05). As health awareness has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic primary strategies to combat vaccine hesitancy should be implemented in the general public, and in particular, an dental teams.

AB  - Background: Despite the significant body of evidence on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of internet interventions, the implementation of such programs in Portugal is virtually non-existent. In addition, Portuguese psychologists' use and their attitudes towards such interventions is largely unknown.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to explore Portuguese psychologists' knowledge, training, use and attitudes towards internet interventions; to investigate perceived advantages and limitations of such interventions; identify potential drivers and barriers impacting implementation; and study potential factors associated to previous use and attitudes towards internet interventions.
   Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was developed by the authors and disseminated by the Portuguese Psychologists Association to its members.
   Results: A total of 1077 members of the Portuguese Psychologists Association responded to the questionnaire between November 2018 and February 2019. Of these, 37.2% (N=363) were familiar with internet interventions and 19.2% (N=188) considered having the necessary training to work within the field. 29.6% (N=319) of participants reported to have used some form of digital technology to deliver care in the past. Telephone (23.8%; N=256), e-mail (16.2%; N=175) and SMS (16.1%; N=173) services were among the most adopted forms of digital technology, while guided (1.3%; N=14) and unguided (1.5%; N=16) internet interventions were rarely used. Accessibility (79.9%; N=860), convenience (45.7%; N=492) and cost-effectiveness (45.5%; N=490) were considered the most important advantages of internet interventions. Conversely, ethical concerns (40.7%; N=438), client's ICT illiteracy (43.2%; N=465) and negative attitudes towards internet interventions (37%; N=398) were identified as the main limitations. An assessment of participants attitudes towards internet interventions revealed a slightly negative/neutral stance (Median=46.21; SD=15.06) and revealed greater acceptability towards blended treatment interventions (62.9%; N=615) when compared to standalone internet interventions (18.6%; N=181). Significant associations were found between knowledge (chi(2)(4) =90.4; P<.001), training (chi(2)(4) =94.6; P<.001), attitudes (chi(2)(3) =38.4; P<.001) and previous use of internet interventions and between knowledge (chi(2)(12)= 109.7; P<.001), training (chi(2)(12) 64.7; P<.001) and attitudes towards such interventions, with psychologists reporting to be ignorant and not having adequate training in the field, being more likely to present more negative attitudes towards these interventions and not having prior experience in its implementation.
   Conclusions: This study revealed that most Portuguese psychologists are not familiar with and have no training or prior experience using internet interventions and had a slightly negative/neutral attitude towards such interventions. There was greater acceptability towards blended treatment interventions compared to standalone internet interventions. Lack of knowledge and training were identified as the main barriers to overcome, underlining the need of promoting awareness and training initiatives to ensure internet interventions successful implementation.

T2  - IRISH JURIST
LA  - English
KW  - Fairness
KW  - Ireland
KW  - Judicial review
KW  - Review grounds
AB  - The issue of whether a failure to comply with the requirements of procedural fairness at the first stage of a two-stage process may lead to a successful claim for judicial review is one which needs to be considered in the light of the context in which this question arises. In resolving cases of this nature, the courts are required to carry out a balancing process, weighing up the interests of efficiency in administrative decision-making, on the one hand, and the need to protect an individual's right to fair procedures, on the other hand. Where the initial stage in a process does not cause direct prejudice to an applicant, either in terms of a decision which may become effective after this stage, or in terms of other prejudicial consequences, the full requirements of the principles of fair procedures should not need to be observed at this stage. As O'Donnell J. has made clear in Crayden Fishing Co Ltd v Sea Fisheries Protection Authority [2017] IESC 74, [2017] 3 I.R. 785, it is not appropriate, necessary or even possible to offer "a single bright line rule" resolving all the issues where there is a two-stage process. The key consideration is whether the procedure as a whole has been fair to the individual concerned.

AB  - HIV/AIDS stigma remains a major global health issue with detrimental consequences for people with HIV/AIDS (PWHA), especially when manifested by health professionals. Research on HIV/AIDS stigma has documented negative attitudes towards PWHA among health professionals. However, fewer studies have examined how HIV/AIDS stigma is manifested behaviourally during clinical interactions and how it interacts with other stigmas (i.e. drug use, sexism, homophobia). This study aimed to: (1) examine behavioural manifestations of HIV/AIDS stigma among medical students during clinical interactions, and (2) explore HIV/AIDS stigma intersectionality with other stigmas. We implemented an experimental design using Standardised Patient (SP) simulations, observational techniques, and quantitative questionnaires. A total of 237 medical students engaged in SP encounters with three experimental scenarios: (1) PWHA infected via illegal drug use, (2) PWHA infected via unprotected heterosexual relations, (3) PWHA infected via unprotected homosexual relations. They also interacted with a person with common cold (control condition). Results evidenced statistically significant differences between the experimental and control simulation, with higher number of stigma behaviours manifested towards experimental conditions. Results also evidence higher HIV/AIDS stigma towards MSM when compared to the drug user and heterosexual woman SP's. We discuss the implications of these findings for training of medical students.

AB  - Rates of HIV/STI transmission among Black men who have sex with men (BMSM) are alarmingly high and demand urgent public health attention. Stigma related concerns are a key barrier to accessing health care and prevention tools, yet limited research has been focused in this area. Experiences of stigma related to health care were evaluated among 151 BMSM residing in the Atlanta, GA area, both prior to and post HIV or STI diagnosis in a longitudinal study (data collected from 2014 to 2016). Findings demonstrated that inadequate health care engagement is associated with post-diagnosis anticipated stigma (b = - 0.38, SE = 0.17 p ae<currency> .05). Pre-diagnosis prejudice is a predictor of post-diagnosis enacted (b = 0.39, SE = 0.14, p < .01), anticipated (b = .28, SE = 0.14, p < .05), and internalized (b = .22, SE = 0.06, p < .001) stigmas. This study is the first of its kind to assess experiences of stigma among BMSM during a critical time (i.e., before and after diagnosis) for HIV/STI prevention and treatment. Results provide a novel understanding of how stigma unfolds over-time and provide direction for stigma intervention development.

AB  - Background: Enhanced methods of evaluation are necessary to identify community-based exercise interventions that promote physical activity and improve health and participation for individuals with disabilities. The heterogeneity of the populations served, interventions implemented, and outcome measures used remains a barrier to effectively evaluate programs and generate evidence to inform best practice.
   Objective: To explore goals and benefits of community-based exercise for individuals with disabilities and determine barriers and facilitators to evaluation in a community setting.
   Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews with exercise participants and staff of a community-based exercise program for individuals with disabilities. We then coded responses to interview questions for themes using thematic analysis or deductive content analysis, with codes linked to categories within the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF).
   Results: Identified goals and benefits spanned the ICF domains of Body Functions and Activities and Participation. Commonly cited goals and benefits included improving strength and endurance, general health, self-efficacy, community participation, and the importance of returning to exercise. Barriers and facilitators to evaluation identified by staff included maintaining a balance between evaluation and services, negative attitudes toward evaluation, access to data, and consistency with scheduling.
   Conclusions: These results can be used to enhance evaluation within community-based exercise programs for individuals with disabilities, which may improve both the quality and impact of these programs. (c) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Making sound food and agriculture decisions is important for global society and the environment. Experts tend to view crop genetic engineering, a technology that can improve yields and minimize impacts on the environment, more favorably than the public. Because there is a causal relationship between public opinion and public policy, it is important to understand how opinions about genetically engineered (GE) crops are influenced. The public increasingly seeks science information on the Internet. Here, semantic network analysis is performed to characterize the presentation of the term "GMO (genetically modified organism)," a proxy for food developed from GE crops, on the web. Texts from three sources are analyzed: U.S. federal websites, top pages from a Google search, and online news titles. We found that the framing and sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative attitudes) of "GMO" varies across these sources. It is described how differences in the portrayal of GE food by each source might affect public opinion. A current understanding of the types of information individuals may encounter online can provide insight into public opinion toward GE food. In turn, this knowledge can guide teaching and communication efforts by the scientific community to promote informed decision-making about agricultural biotechnologies.

AB  - Purpose: Qualitative data were obtained from 8 people who stutter about their experiences and changes they perceived following attendance of an intensive group therapy intervention. Measures that related to reductions in stuttering, improved communicative confidence, and impacts on stuttering and quality of life were used to complement the qualitative data.
   Method: Eight participants attended a group stuttering modification course for adults who stutter. They reported their experiences of therapy and perceived changes in a focus group immediately after therapy and at a semistructured interview 6 months post-therapy. Participants completed 5 additional quantitative standardized outcome measures at 3 data collection points (before and directly after therapy and 6 months post-therapy). These measures provided information about stuttering severity and frequency, use of avoidance strategies, attitude change, communicative confidence, quality of life, and locus of control.
   Results: Thematic analysis of the qualitative data identified 4 main areas: thoughts, feelings, and behaviors before therapy and motivation for seeking therapy; direct experience of the course; learning outcomes and challenges and solutions for maintaining change; and ways in which attending therapy had made a difference. These reported changes were supported by the quantitative measures that demonstrated improved communicative confidence; increased self-awareness; affective, behavioral, and cognitive changes; reduced use of avoidance strategies; and lower impact of stuttering on quality of life.
   Conclusions: The qualitative analyses confirmed positive speech and attitude changes consequent on participants' attendance at stuttering modification therapy. These changes, further corroborated by quantitative measures, were linked to reports of improved quality of life. Further research is required to investigate the effectiveness of this form of therapy empirically and from the client's perspective.

AB  - Adolescence is an important period, marked by significant changes in biological and psychosocial domains. Epilepsy is a chronic neurologic disorder associated with social stigma and prejudice. The etiology of depression in epilepsy appears to be a complex interplay between psychosocial and neurobiologic factors. This period may be too taxing for the adolescent with epilepsy to steer, as epilepsy can affect the development of independence by its social, educational, and mental health effects. The study aimed to compare the burden of depression in adolescents with epilepsy with the general population. One hundred forty-five adolescents with epilepsy and their classmates matched for age and gender were studied over a 9-month period. Zung Self-rating Depression Scale was used to determine the burden of depression in the study population. Among the subjects, 70 (48.3%) had scores in the depressive range to varying degrees compared to 38 (26.2%) controls. The difference in scores was significant (OR=2.628,P< .001). Among the population with positive scores, mild depression category was the commonest for both groups (40% and 22.8%, respectively). There was a statistically significant relationship between gender, seizure type, and depression, whereas there was no significant relationship between age, social class, number of antiepileptic drugs, seizure frequency in the last 12 months, and depression. Adolescents with epilepsy had higher rates of depression than the general population. Hence, there might be need for routine screening of adolescents with epilepsy for early detection and management of depression to improve their overall well-being and quality of life.

AB  - Haram City is Egypt's first affordable' gated community, hosting both aspirational middle-class homeowners and resettled poor urban residents. Amidst legal ambiguity during Egypt's 2011-2013 revolutionary period, the management team of this public-private partnership was tasked with creating a fully self-sufficient' city. While Haram City is the product of top-down seeing like a state' master planning (Scott, ), the day-to-day resolution of class vulnerabilities and disputes over reasonableness' in city life requires forms of interpersonal adjudication otherwise addressed through local urban lawseeing like a city' (Valverde, ). This article uses ethnography of management techniques aiming to upgrade behaviour' to theorize that a private entity, in a strategically indeterminate relationship with the state, reconciles future-oriented planning and storied prejudices by merging two visions of governance. Imitating the repertoire of urban law, managers plan the very realm of bottom-up decision making. They then adapt top-down urban planning to bottom-up dispute resolution to spatially consolidate the consensual' outcomes of a rigged game. Evoking both colonial Egyptian vagrancy laws and neoliberal paternalist welfare, seeing like a city-state' governance amounts to authoritarianism that conceals itself within custom, appearing neutral so as to plan streets, codes and inner lives at once.

AB  - Background: Public stigma is a form of devaluation by other people's negative reactions to a specific behavior or mental health condition. When dealing with the physical consequences of addiction, substance users experience distress due to negative prejudice against them and their families. Method: In Shanghai, China, a community survey was conducted with four experimental vignettes to examine the general public's experience with mental health issues and their perceptions toward substance users. Respondents were randomly assigned to answer one of these vignettes regarding public stigma toward a male or female vignette subject (VS) with substance addiction. Results: Data from 123 respondents showed no statistical significance in public stigma perception toward a male or female subject either with alcohol or cocaine misuse problems. However, older individuals perceived mental illness more negatively when it is connected to substance addiction. These respondents see public stigma as a matter of "family shame," "hostility," "discrimination," and "labeling" that represent the risks that hinder help-seeking. Conclusion: This study suggests designing culturally sensitive treatment models that could help substance users recognize face-saving factors in their help-seeking process. Community education as a prevention measure should emphasize the importance of treating substance users as an individual, not as a problem.

AB  - As there are few studies about evaluation of attitudes of health care workers to people with mental disorders in Brazil, a cross-sectional study was carried out to assess the health professionals' attitudes working in a university hospital in Rio de Janeiro and also examine the proportion of negative and positive attitudes endorsed by healthcare professionals in Brazil towards people with mental illness in comparison with other parts of the world. Data were collected using the Community Attitudes towards the Mentally Ill (CAMI) in a random sampling frame of health professionals (n = 246) working in a University Hospital in Rio de Janeiro between April 2013 and June 2013. The CAMI consists of four sub-scales: Authoritarianism, Benevolence, Social Restrictiveness and Community Mental Health Ideology. The results showed attitudes that range from neutral to positive, with the Benevolence and Social Restrictiveness sub-scales showing the least stigmatizing results. The following individual characteristics were associated with negative attitudes: lower levels of education and less clinical experience. In general, health workers attitudes towards service users are characterized as positive when compared with other international studies. However, educational programs for health workers should be reinforced to further promote pre-existing positive attitudes towards people with mental health and the implementation of Brazilian Mental Health Policies.

KW  - social work
AB  - In the delivery of social work education, how can we devise a relevant curriculum that addresses the development of cross-cultural competencies? Some of the assumptions that our students bring to their study programme (many already work in different parts of the human services profession) are premised on outdated ideas that have as their source prejudice, racism, whiteness behaviours, fear and mistrust, and a lack of knowledge and understanding about the complex layers in understanding situations of access and equity, discrimination and the abrogation of human rights for marginalised communities. In this paper, I share some of the strategies and content material that we use at Charles Sturt University (CSU), Australia, together with professionals-in-the-field, in developing cross-cultural competencies to prepare our students for work in the profession. For example, as part of our current social work curriculum, students are introduced to intense debates that scrutinise the above phenomena-in-practice; in particular, they scrutinise their own biases and entrenched worldviews that are often developed out of an ethnocentric monoculturalism. At the very least, a critical reflection framework explores assumptions embedded within practice; this is not a new dynamic for social work and is worth revisiting here, but, ultimately, are we doing enough?.

AB  - Psychological services are culturally encapsulated for dominant cultural groups, and racial minorities underutilize treatment even though they suffer from more severe psychological distress. Sociocultural factors such as acculturation (one's adaptation into mainstream group) and enculturation (one's adherence to culture of heritage) are hypothesized to affect minorities' attitudes toward seeking psychological services. This meta-analysis examined 3 methods to assess acculturation/enculturation-unidimensional acculturation, bidimensional acculturation, and bidimensional enculturation as predictors of help-seeking attitudes (HSAs)-both positive and negative attitudes-among racial and ethnic minorities in 207 samples drawn from 111 research reports. The omnibus correlations between acculturation/ enculturation variables and HSAs were quite small, but in the predicted direction. Moderator analyses suggested a more nuanced understanding of the association between bidimensional enculturation and positive HSAs: This association was significant (r = -.1495% CI[-.18, -.09]) for Asians and Asian Americans, but very close to zero and nonsignificant for other racial minority groups (African Americans, Latino Americans, and others). In addition, the domain of acculturation/ enculturation assessed was predictive of effect size, with enculturation measures containing a higher proportion of cognitive items (e.g., items that assess cultural values and beliefs) showing stronger (more negative) associations with positive HSAs. Post hoc analyses indicated that certain Asian cultural values, including emotional self-control, conformity to social norms, and collectivism, showed especially high negative associations with positive HSAs.

AB  - Vaccination saves lives and can be an effective strategy for preventing the spread of the COVID-19, but negative attitudes towards vaccines lead to vaccine hesitancy. This study aimed to explore the factors influencing the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in the Nepali community in the United Kingdom (UK). This qualitative study included in-depth interviews with 20 people from Nepal living in the UK. Interviews were conducted by a native-Nepali speaker and all interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated into English before being analysed thematically. Our study found that attitudes towards COVID-19 are generally positive. Nine overlapping themes around barriers to COVID-19 vaccination were identified: (a) rumours and mis/disinformation; (b) prefer home remedies and yoga; (c) religion restriction; (d) concern towards vaccine eligibility; (e) difficulty with online vaccine booking system; (f) doubts of vaccine effectiveness after changing the second dose timeline; (g) lack of confidence in the vaccine; (h) past bad experience with the influenza vaccine; and (i) worried about side-effects. Understanding barriers to the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine can help in the design of better targeted interventions. Public health messages including favourable policy should be tailored to address those barriers and make this vaccination programme more viable and acceptable to the ethnic minority communities in the UK.

AB  - Background: In all countries of the world, fewer than half of people with mental disorders receive treatment. This treatment gap is commonly attributed to factors such as consumers' limited knowledge, negative attitudes, and financial constraints. In the context of other health behaviors, such as diet and exercise, behavioral economists have emphasized time preferences and procrastination as additional barriers. These factors might also be relevant to mental health.
   Aims: We examine conceptually and empirically how lack of help-seeking for mental health conditions might be related to time preferences and procrastination.
   Methods: Our conceptual discussion explores how the interrelationships between time preferences and mental health treatment utilization could fit into basic microeconomic theory. The empirical analysis uses survey data of student populations from 12 colleges and universities in 2011 (the Healthy Minds Study, N = 8,806). Using standard brief measures of discounting, procrastination, and mental health (depression and anxiety symptoms), we examine the conditional correlations between indicators of present-orientation (discount rate and procrastination) and mental health symptoms.
   Results: The conceptual discussion reveals a number of potential relationships that would be useful to examine empirically. In the empirical analysis depression is significantly associated with procrastination and discounting. Treatment utilization is significantly associated with procrastination but not discounting.
   Discussion: The empirical results are generally consistent with the idea that depression increases present orientation (reduces future orientation), as measured by discounting and procrastination. These analyses have notable limitations that will require further examination in future research: the measures are simple and brief, and the estimates may be biased from true causal effects because of omitted variables and reverse causality. There are several possibilities for future research, including: (i) observational, longitudinal studies with detailed data on mental health, time preferences, and help-seeking; (ii) experimental studies that examine immediate or short-term responses and connections between these variables; (iii) randomized trials of mental health therapies that include outcome measures of time preferences and procrastination; and, (iv) intervention studies that test strategies to influence help-seeking by addressing time preferences and present orientation.

AB  - Introduction: The burden of HIV is increasing among adults aged over 50, who generally experience increased risk of cormorbid illnesses and poorer financial protection. We compared patterns of health utilisation and expenditure among HIV-positive and HIV-negative adults over 50. Methods: Data were drawn from the Study on global AGEing and adult health in South Africa with analysis focusing on individual and household-level data of 147 HIV-positive and 2725 HIV-negative respondents. Results: HIV-positive respondents reported lower utilisation of private health-care facilities (11.8%) than HIV-negative respondents (25.0%) (p=.03) and generally had more negative attitudes towards health system responsiveness than HIV-negative counterparts. Less than 10% of HIV-positive and HIV-negative respondents experienced catastrophic health expenditure (CHE). Women (OR 1.8; p<.001) and respondents from rural settings (OR 2.9; p<.01) had higher odds of CHE than men or respondents in urban settings. Over half the respondents in both groups indicated that they had received free health care. Conclusions: These findings suggest that although HIV-positive and HIV-negative older adults in South Africa are protected to some extent from CHE, inequalities still exist in access to and quality of care available at health-care services - which can inform South Africa's development of a national health insurance scheme.

AB  - A mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative) design was used to explore the experiences of Muslim women moving to the United States from countries where either Islam is a dominant religion or Muslims comprise a majority of the population. Participants completed established scales measuring both psychosocial adjustment and various dimensions of spirituality. In addition, participants completed a biographic interview which assessed women's sentiments about moving to the United States, their perceptions of treatment in traveling to or once arrived in the U.S., and how newly formed relationships were perceived to have affected participants' intrapersonal, social, and spiritual experience. The contact hypothesis (Allport, 1954) guided the development of biographic interview questions. Participants scored similarly to population-based samples on indices of psychosocial adjustment and they reported high scores on measures assessing spiritual beliefs, strength of faith, and the Reflective Commitment subscale of the Islamic Reflections Scale. Three distinct themes emerged from interpretive analyses following in-depth interviews: 1) participants were aware of media-projected antipathy toward Muslims emerging from inflammatory rhetoric ensconced by political posturing; 2) the reception women received from the majority of American neighbors, friends, and coworkers was very positive; and 3) relationships formed with other Muslims - importantly, persons who also immigrated from other Muslim-majority countries - provided opportunities for personal reflection on the differences across cultural interpretations and practices of faith.

AB  - Attitudes toward immigration have attracted much scholarly interest and fuelled extensive empirical research in recent years. Many different hypotheses have been proposed to explain individual and contextual differences in attitudes towards immigration. However, it has become difficult to align all of the evidence that the literature has produced so far. The present article contributes to the systematization of political science empirical research on public attitudes toward immigration in the last decade. Using a simplified combined-tests technique, this paper identifies the micro- as well as macro-level factors that are consistently linked to attitudes toward immigration. It reports findings from a meta-analysis of the determinants of general attitudes toward immigration in published articles in thirty highly ranked peer-reviewed political science journals for the years 2009-2019. The results warrant a summary of factors affecting attitudes to immigration in a systematic, measurable and rigorous manner.

AB  - In the global media scene, media ownership is controlled by groups with political agendas. Intolerance of 'the other', from Islam and migrants to people of colour, show the rise of fundamentally prejudiced groups who relate well to negative media representations of 'the other', further fuelling financial support for dominant public voices, at the expense of those silenced by discrimination. Media studies on Islam show negative portrayals in Western media which neglect the Muslim voice. Some reasons include news culture, lack of knowledge about Islam and unawareness of the consequences from such narratives. This article identifies the growing trend of stories in the New Zealand media relating to 'Islamic terrorism' and critically analyses a random sampling of five news articles between 2014 and 2016 in terms of the negative, positive and ambivalent news content, both in their use of the written text and visual representations of Islam and Muslims. The tendency to use negative framing is evident with the absence or manipulation of the Muslim voice. Using the Islamic perspective of dialogue and persuasion, the theory of Ta'will, and socio-political rationale, the effects of and motivations for the written and visual news content arc discussed. A case is made for a greater understanding of the textual and visual elements and more ethical reporting through intercultural engagement.

AB  - This article helps close two voids in the literature dealing with dual language (bilingual) marketing. First, it adds to the discussion about whether dual language (specifically English/Spanish) marketing that targets Hispanic consumers living in the U.S. is socially responsible. Second, it discusses how U.S. Hispanics feel about learning English and why some react negatively to bilingual marketing efforts. To determine whether dual language marketing is socially responsible, the corporate governance theories of Milton Friedman and R. Edward Freeman are used. The first conclusion is that, from Friedman's shareholder perspective, bilingual marketing may be much less profitable than expected, if at all. From Freeman's stakeholder perspective, dual language marketing is socially responsible if the focus is on perceived short-term needs of Hispanic consumers; however, from a broader, long-term societal approach, it is not. The second conclusion is that non-Hispanic Americans do not favor bilingual marketing. Recommendations for socially responsible ways of targeting this group are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explore the state of existing research on microfinance lending discrimination against people with disabilities. It argues that existing literature suggests people with disabilities face notable discrimination in accessing microfinance (Labie et al., 2015). The attitudes of employees within microfinance institutions (MFIs) are one of the principal sources of such discrimination, which has important implications for the lives of people with disabilities (Cramm & Finkenflugel, 2008; Mersland et al., 2009; Labie et al., 2015). Moreover, studies conducted by Beisland & Mersland (2012) and Nuwagaba et al. (2012) found that people with disabilities tend not to apply for microfinance due to the anticipation of such rejection. People with disabilities face both 'taste-based discrimination' (prejudice) and 'statistical discrimination' (when a decision-maker uses individuals' observable characteristics as a substitute for unobservable ones). It is reasonable to assume that reducing discrimination in the microfinance market would greatly benefit existing and prospective entrepreneurs with disabilities. However, this requires targeted interventions aimed at inducing systematic institutional reforms, changing the mindsets of employees and people with disabilities, and integrating appropriate accommodations within microfinance operations. In order to implement these changes, I conclude that microfinance regulators must work to identify areas of discrimination that are not correctly covered by existing lending practices.

AB  - This essay explores the critique of 1980s' multiculturalism in Caryl Phillips's 1986 screenplay Playing Away, which depicts a cricket match held between a black British team from Brixton and the well-to-do white villagers of the fictional town of Sneddington. It proceeds by considering Phillips's long-standing commitment to sport as an opportunity where new social and cultural relations can be built which question established prejudices and divisions, captured in the notion of 'sporting tribalry', before turning to a close engagement with the film's key elements. Rather than depict two teams, one black and urban, the other white and rural, at loggerheads both on and off the cricket pitch, Playing Away attends to the many overlappings and similarities shared across communities that are discerned as a way of challenging prevailing models of multicultural difference. Phillips shows how these shared challenges may bring communities together through 'sporting tribalry', where they might learn from each other and move forward from entrenched and divisive notions of difference or 'race relations'. Ultimately, the remoulded model of multiculturalism suggested by Playing Away exists more as a promise than an achieved reality: as is indicated by the vexed cricket match between the teams which forms the climax of the film, the tensions of class, culture, race and gender are not easily erased in the late 1980s.

AB  - Introduction: Effective treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can reduce morbidity and mortality, but adherence rates are low without a clear consensus Of causes.
   Objective: To explore the experiences of adherence to CPAP treatment in patients with OSAS. Methods: A qualitative content analysis was employed. Data were collected by in-depth interviews with 23 purposively selected patients.
   Results: Adherence to CPAP treatment was summarized according to "facilitators" and "barriers" to CPAP treatment. Facilitators for adherence, as described by the patients were a desire to avoid symptoms, knowledge about the risk for medical consequences, fear of negative social consequences and disturbing the sleep of significant others. Other facilitators were a positive attitude to CPAP treatment, trust in healthcare personnel, a sense of engagement from the spouse and a feeling of physical improvement. Barriers included experiencing practical problems, negative psychological effects of the equipment, and negative attitudes to the treatment. Other barriers were side-effects as well as insufficient support from healthcare personnel and the spouse.
   Conclusion: Adherence to CPAP treatment is a multifaceted problem including patient, treatment, condition, social and healthcare related factors. Knowledge about facilitators and barriers for adherence to CPAP treatment can be used in interventional Strategies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Researchers and practitioners have encouraged the use of simulation games as a means of training for enhancing users' IT knowledge. However, prior research on IT knowledge has not paid much attention as to how individuals' perceptions of knowledge shift from the pre-training to the post-training state, and has focused mainly on individual-level interventions. Drawing on the theoretical foundation of belief and attitude change, this study examines the construct of perceived knowledge update (i.e., the difference between perceived post-training knowledge and perceived pre-training knowledge) and its antecedents and consequences. In particular, we examine team collaboration effectiveness at the team level and participant effort at the individual level as predictors of perceived ERP knowledge update, which then influences intention to learn about ERP systems. We tested our research model using 252 students in 85 teams in the context of an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) simulation game. ERP systems are a business process management software which allows an organization to utilize a system of integrated applications. ERP simulation games are designed to educate ERP system users on the complexities of such systems. Our results show that team collaboration effectiveness positively influences individual effort and perceived knowledge update. We also provide empirical evidence that individual effort positively affects perceived knowledge update which in turn influences intention to learn about ERP systems.

AB  - Depression is a significant mental health issue for bisexual women. While theory and research indicates that sense of belonging is important for mental health, limited research has investigated this in relation to bisexual women belonging to the LGBTQ + community. Existing research indicates that identification and involvement with the LGBTQ + community is not protective for the mental health of bisexual women. The protective nature of the extent to which bisexual women feel valued and needed within the lesbian community has not been examined. The current study examined the relationships between sense of belonging to the lesbian and heterosexual communities and depressive symptoms among bisexual women. A sample of 306 Australian self-identified bisexual women completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and the psychological subscale of the Sense of Belonging Instrument. Results indicated that sense of belonging to each community was related to lower levels of depressive symptoms. Further, levels of belonging to each community interacted, indicating that sense of belonging to the lesbian community was protective for bisexual women with lower, but not higher, levels of sense of belonging to the heterosexual community. Results imply that increasing belonging to the lesbian community is important for bisexual women who do not feel they belong in the heterosexual community. The challenge is how to increase sense of belonging of bisexual women in the lesbian community, where they are exposed to negative attitudes about their sexuality.

AB  - Hate crimes against members of the Jewish community have increased dramatically over the past few years. According to federal data, the number of hate crimes directed at Jews now appears to exceed those directed at many, if not most, minority groups. Yet, despite the number of hate crimes aimed at Jews, little recent scholarship has considered the issue of anti-Semitism. To address this gap in the profession's literature, this article examines the issue of anti-Semitism in the United States. Toward that end, the Jewish population is described and data on anti-Semitism are reviewed along with factors that contribute to this prejudice. The article concludes by discussing strategies that social work educators, practitioners, and researchers might pursue to help create a more socially just society for the Jewish community in the United States and elsewhere. For instance, social workers might seek to address spiritual microaggressions aimed at members of the Jewish community. As part of this process, social workers might help create a culture that respects religious freedom, a fundamental human right, and advocate for equitable portrayals of Jewish people and perspectives in diverse media. Particular attention should be paid to Orthodox Jews, who are often targets of anti-Semitism.

KW  - CONTACT
AB  - This study aims to provide a more complete and exhaustive perspective on the whole range of potential strategies to fight stigma by considering the perspectives of different stakeholders. Delegates to a Canadian conference were invited to participate in a survey that focused on stigma, from which the responses to the following question were analyzed: tell us briefly what you do to reduce prejudice and stigma toward people with a diagnosis of mental disorder? From 253 participants, 15 categories of strategies to fight stigma were identified from the verbatim (e. g., sharing/encouraging disclosure). These categories fell under six main themes: education, contact, protestation, person centered, working on recovery and social inclusion, and reflexive consciousness. The occurrence of these themes was different among stakeholders (clinical, organizational, and experiential knowledge). For example, people with mental disorders (experiential knowledge) often mentioned contact and person centered strategies, while mental health professionals (clinical knowledge) preferred education and working on recovery and social inclusion strategies. The results from this study highlight the need to pay more attention to the concept of disclosure of mental disorders in the process for de-stigmatization. Future studies are needed to assess the impact of the emerging strategies to fight stigma in the community.

AB  - Explicit attitudes towards inclusion are increasingly investigated in (preservice) teachers. However, few studies examine implicit attitudes towards inclusion, despite the advantage of being less sensitive to social desirability. Since inclusion is a sensitive topic, we aimed to investigate implicit and explicit attitudes towards inclusion as well as interactions between these attitudes. Using the Single-Target Implicit Association Test, early semester preservice teachers exhibited ambivalent implicit attitudes and positive explicit attitudes. Implicit attitudes were negatively correlated with explicit attitudes. Methodological and contentual explanations for these findings are discussed and theory-based implications for university education are suggested. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

KW  - ADULTS
AB  - UK government policies over several decades have sought to actively encourage disabled people to take up paid employment, most recently by focusing on the 'gap' between employment rates of disabled and non-disabled people. These policies implicitly assume a clear distinction between people who are and are not disabled, linked to medically-oriented, hierarchical notions of deservingness. They also assume that people who need support will self-identify. This article explores factors that undermine those assumptions or expose their contradictory effects. It presents findings from qualitative research with people with mild learning difficulties, discussing their perceptions of disability and how they negotiated an ever-shifting balance of consequences of identifying as disabled or disclosing needs, linked to risks and experiences of prejudice, discrimination and exclusion. Points of interest Government policy to support disabled people into paid work suggests that it is obvious who is and who is not disabled. This research looks at what disability means for people with mild learning difficulties who are looking for paid work. People with mild learning difficulties sometimes view themselves as disabled but sometimes refuse that label, even when they accept that they need support. The research participants gave a wide range of reasons for accepting or rejecting the label of disability. They showed how they balanced hopes for support against fears of rejection or abuse, based on their personal experiences.

AB  - Affective interethnic ties are highly effective for improving out-group attitudes, especially during adolescence. Yet, young people face several obstacles to developing such ties in society. One potential means of fostering greater interethnic connectivity is through youth engagement: that is, formal, organized social participation in groups, clubs, or activities. However, little is still known about its effectiveness; especially for overcoming structural obstacles to contact in society, such as residential segregation. This study has two aims: to robustly examine whether youth engagement can build positive interethnic contact among young people; and, to perform the first systematic test of whether sites of engagement can act as Associational Bridges, providing greater opportunities for contact among youth from more segregated environments. To pursue these aims, the study exploited a unique data opportunity to perform a quasi-experimental analysis of a large-scale, nationally-implemented youth engagement scheme in the United Kingdom. The study uses pre-test/post-test data on N=1371 participants (M-age=16.7; 63% Female; 36% non-White) and N=1946 propensity-score matched controls (M-age=16.7; 62% Female; 36% non-White). Applying a (matched) difference-in-difference approach, the findings demonstrate that participation led to an increase in affective interethnic ties, which were evident at least 4-6 months after involvement had ended. Participation also had a stronger positive impact on youth from more residentially segregated areas: although joining the scheme with fewer interethnic ties, post-participation they reported just as many ties as their peers from less segregated areas. However, participation had no difference in effects for youth from more or less ethnically diverse areas. Youth engagement may thus be an effective tool for fostering positive contact; particularly among those from more segregated environments. However, attention should be paid to the design and recruitment practices of engagement programs to understand which structural barriers to contact in society they can overcome.

AB  - With a formal colour bar on British championships operating until 1948, boxing had long been a site of racial discrimination. The abolition of the sport's colour bar was recognition of the wrongness of racial exclusion and it was followed by a celebration of black fighters as local and national heroes. The sport became a rare space where black men could be spoken about, discussed, and celebrated without primary reference to their colour. However, race was never irrelevant, especially as the number of black boxers rose with wider patterns of migration. Race was thus widely discussed in boxing, although there was rarely open discussion of racism. This absence, along with black successes in the ring, masked deep levels of both structural and interpersonal prejudice. Racial differences remained accepted as common sense by white Britons. Indeed, immigration intensified racism in Britain, changing the perceived position of people of colour from exotic novelties to threats to society. Boxing is thus a reminder of the contradictory dynamics of race. Formal mechanisms of exclusion could be removed, while informal mechanisms intensified. Individuals could be celebrated, while people of colour as a group were looked down upon. Black achievements could simultaneously reinforce ideas of black inferiority.

AB  - In response to U.S. government restrictions imposed as part of a nationwide response to the COVID-19 pandemic, charismatic worship leader Sean Feucht began a series of worship concerts. Feucht positioned these protests as expressions of Christian religious freedom in opposition to mandated church closings and a perceived double-standard regarding the large gatherings of protesters over police violence against Black and Brown persons. Government restrictions challenged the sine qua non liturgical act of encounter with God for evangelicals, Pentecostals, and Charismatics: congregational singing in Praise and Worship. However, as Feucht's itinerant worship concerts traversed urban spaces across the U.S. to protest these restrictions, the events gained a double valence. Feucht and event attendees sought to channel God's power through musical worship to overturn government mandates and, along the way, they invoked longstanding social and racial prejudices toward urban spaces. In this essay, I argue that Feucht's events reveal complex theological motivations that weave together liturgical-theological, social, and political concerns. Deciphering this complex tapestry requires a review of both the history of evangelical engagement with urban spaces and the theological history of Praise and Worship. Together, these two sets of historical resources generate a useful frame for considering how Feucht, as a charismatic musical worship leader, attempts to wield spiritual power through musical praise to change political situations and the social conditions.

AB  - Background: Vaccination against Covid-19 has become an increasingly polarizing issue in western democracies. While much research has focused on social-psychological determinants of vaccine hesitancy, less is known about the attitudes and behaviors of the vaccinated populations towards those who are unvaccinated. Building on Weiner's attribution theory (2005, 1985, 1980), we predict that vaccination status determines the attribution of personal responsibility and blame in Covid-19 social dilemmas. This in turn explains people's affective and behavioral responses towards those who have fallen ill or infected others with COVID-19.Approach: Through two preregistered experiments (total N = 1200) we show that people attribute greater personal responsibility when unvaccinated (vs. vaccinated) people fall ill from, or infect others with COVID-19. This attribution of responsibility manifested in less sympathy towards unvaccinated COVID-19 patients, which was associated with a lower willingness to help patients and their families (Study 1). Likewise, higher perceived responsibility results in greater anger towards unvaccinated people who had (involuntarily) infected others with the virus, which was associated with a greater desire for punitive actions (Study 2).Conclusion: These findings suggest that unvaccinated people experience blame as well as negative attitudes and behaviors from the vaccinated population. This could in turn strengthen people's refusal to get vaccinated and increase polarization between vaccine supporters and vaccine critics.

AB  - Objective LGBT older adults and older people living with HIV (PLWH) experience a disproportionate burden of behavioral health conditions compared to their heterosexual, cisgender, and HIV-negative peers. This study intends to systematically review the literature regarding accessing mental health care among LGBT older adults and older PLWH. Methods This study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement framework. Three databases were searched using Boolean search strings, and inclusion/exclusion criteria were developed and applied to the search outcomes to appropriately narrow results. Article quality and evidence of bias were evaluated using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) quality-assessment tool, and the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) assessment tool, two instruments used to help reviewers in assessing for internal validity of studies. Two independent researchers coded the articles for themes, and consensus was reached on theme grouping through an iterative process. Results Out of 2,031 articles initially screened, 28 met all inclusion criteria and advanced to final analysis. Several key themes emerged, including a lack of provider competency in caring for LGBT patients, lower rates of insurance coverage, greater mental health burden, social and structural determinants of health, policy solutions, and technology and health literacy. Conclusion There were several domains identified in the literature as barriers to accessing mental healthcare, as well as opportunities to better attend to the mental health needs of these populations. Provider training, implementing health technology solutions, and enacting public policy changes could improve mental health outcomes.

AB  - The public housing programme in Puerto Rico was highly influenced by a culturally engrained logic of colonialism that aimed to achieve a behavioural transformation of the residents of public housing based on white criollo norms and conducts. To this day, the process of Othering with which these bodies are understood and viewed has recurrently been reproduced and redeployed utilizing the island's old racial/colonial hierarchies. Criminality and drug-related activities are the main discursive agents employed to stigmatize the communities that live inside public housing in Puerto Rico. It is constantly inferred that most of its residents break with the behavioural norms that the rest of the population abides by. This argument is constantly utilized to perpetuate the cultural lens that views these sectors as lazy, unruly and dangerous. This highly prejudiced misconception justified the police occupations and the fences that were erected in and around public housing premises during the 1990s. However, most of these communities rarely view themselves as victims, and it is this paper's argument that they are constantly and collectively enacting political and physical spaces of dissent, resistance and encounter that - however momentarily - are able to overturn some of these powerful ideological and spatial constructs.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed many aspects of our world including the way we teach chemistry. Our emergence from the pandemic provides an opportunity for deep reflection and intentional action about what we teach, and why, as well as how we facilitate student learning. Focusing on foundational postsecondary chemistry courses, we suggest that we cannot simply return to "normal practice but need to design and implement new ways of teaching and learning based on fundamentally reimagined learning outcomes for our courses that equip students for life after the rupture they have experienced. We recommend that new learning objectives should be guided both by an analysis of existing global challenges and the types of understandings and practices needed to confront them, and by research-based frameworks that provide insights into important areas of knowledge, skill, and attitude development. We identify a core set of competencies along three major dimensions (crosscutting reasoning, core understandings, and fundamental practices) that we believe should guide the design, implementation, and evaluation of chemistry curricula, teaching practices, and assessments in foundational courses for science and engineering majors. The proposed framework adopts systems thinking as the underpinning form of reasoning that students should develop to analyze and comprehend complex global systems and phenomena.

Methods Seventy-nine (79) pregnant women completed the French version of the Pregnancy Weight Gain Attitude Scale (PWGAS), the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) and the Intuitive Eating Scale-2 (IES-2) in their 3rd trimester. Total GWG was calculated as the difference between the weight recorded before delivery and self-reported pre-pregnancy weight. Results Most (55.6%) women gained weight above the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) recommendations, but there was no association between PWGAS scores and total or 3rd trimester GWG. Women with obesity had lower PWGAS total scores compared to women with overweight (3.48 +/- 0.6 vs. 3.99 +/- 0.3, p = 0.005), indicating more negative attitudes in women with obesity vs. overweight. Higher total PWGAS scores were positively correlated with intuitive eating scores (r = 0.28, p < 0.05), and inversely associated with unfavourable eating behaviours such as dietary restraint (r = - 0.42, p < 0.01). Conclusion Women with positive attitudes toward weight gain reported healthier eating behaviours in late pregnancy, which remains to be confirmed in prospective studies. Interventions addressing body image issues during pregnancy may positively influence pregnant women's health, including eating behaviours.

AB  - Soil organic carbon (C) is an essential component of the global C cycle. Processes that control its composition and dynamics over large scales are not well understood. Thus, our understanding of C cycling is incomplete, which makes it difficult to predict C gains and losses due to changes in climate, land use and management. Here we show that controls on the composition of organic C, the particulate, humus and resistant fractions, and the potential vulnerability of C to decomposition across Australia are distinct, scale-dependent and variable. We used machine-learning with 5,721 topsoil measurements to show that, continentally, the climate, soil properties (for example, total nitrogen and pH) and elevation are dominant controls. However, we found that such general assessments disregard underlying region-specific controls that affect the distribution of the organic C fractions and vulnerability. This can lead to misinterpretations that prejudice our understanding of soil C processes and dynamics. Regionally, climate is mediated through interactions with soil properties, mineralogy and topography. In some regions, climate is uninfluential. These results highlight the need for regional assessments of soil C dynamics and more local parameterization of biogeochemical and Earth system models. Our analysis propounds the development of region-specific strategies for effective C management and climate change mitigation.

AB  - In this article, the gained and lost dominance score (GLDS) method is extended into the 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic environment, which also combined the power aggregation operator with the evaluation information to deal with the multi-attribute group decision-making problem. Since the power aggregation operator can eliminate the effects of extreme evaluating data from some experts with prejudice, this paper further proposes the 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic numbers power-weighted average operator and 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic numbers power-weighted geometric operator to aggregate the decision makers' evaluation. Moreover, a model based on the score function and distance measure of 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic numbers (2TLNNs) is developed to get the criteria weights. Combing the GLDS method with 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic numbers and developing a 2TLNN-GLDS method for multiple attribute group decision making, it can express complex fuzzy information more conveniently in a qualitative environment and also consider the dominance relations between alternatives which can get more effective results in real decision-making problems. Finally, an applicable example of selecting the optimal low-carbon logistics park site is given. The comparing results show that the proposed method outperforms the other existing methods, as it can get more reasonable results than others and it is more convenient and effective to express uncertain information in solving realistic decision-making problems.

TI  - The role of collective narcissism in populist attitudes and the collapse of democracy in Hungary
T2  - JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - What are the psychological processes responsible for the recent spread of populist political systems and movements? All political systems essentially reflect the mental representations of their populations, and collective narcissism has recently emerged as a contributing factor in the rise of populism. This article presents two studies examining the role of collective narcissism in predicting populist attitudes and voting intentions in Hungary. Hungary offers a particularly important case study of state-sponsored populism and illiberalism in Europe, as this country has gone furthest in undermining democratic principles and practices within the EU. To establish the pervasive role of collective narcissism we first review the historical evidence, survey research, and narrative analyses of Hungarian political representations. We then present two empirical studies where we predicted and found that collective narcissism was a significant predictor of negative attitudes toward the EU (Study 1), conservatism, and support for the ruling populist party (Studies 1 and 2). Collective narcissism predicted these variables independently from other factors, such as in-group positivity or perceived relative deprivation. However, once conservatism was controlled for the effects of collective narcissism faded out in some cases. The results nevertheless indicate that collective narcissism plays important role in promoting populist politics. The implications of these findings for understanding the psychological appeal of populism and illiberalism are discussed.

AB  - During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, patients in individual psychotherapy needed to suddenly transition to telepsychotherapy (TPT), and for many patients it was their first experience of remote treatment. Since TPT appears to be here to stay after the pandemic ends, it is crucial to understand which factors determine whether TPT is a good fit for patients. We aimed to examine patients' relational predictors, both trait- (attachment avoidance and attachment anxiety) and state-like (working alliance, real relationship) of patients' attitudes towards TPT, and the potential mediating role of state-like relational variables between trait-like variables and attitudes. We used a longitudinal design, where patients (N = 719) who were in individual TPT participated in an online survey at the beginning of the pandemic and at follow-up three months later. Patients completed measures of symptom severity, Covid-related distress, attachment anxiety and avoidance, perceived quality of the therapeutic relationship (working alliance and real relationship), and attitude towards TPT. Results suggested that higher levels of attachment avoidance predicted more negative attitudes towards TPT, and that patient-reported quality of the real relationship in their TPT sessions mediated this negative relationship between attachment avoidance and attitudes towards TPT. Patient's attachment avoidance and the real relationship are important predictors of patients' attitudes towards TPT, and could indicate suitability of the TPT format, as well as inform clinicians' efforts in building a real and genuine connection with their patients online.

AB  - The non-medical use of prescription drugs (NMUPD) among college students is escalating at an alarming rate. A limited number of studies have utilized a theoretical framework to influence this behavior. To utilize the reasoned-action approach theory to design and evaluate a web-based intervention to influence students' attitudes, perceived norms (PNs), perceived behavioral control (PBC) and intentions toward NMUPD. Using a two-group post-test only controlled trial, students were randomized to view either a general health website or a web-based intervention focused on NMUPD. The intervention was presented in multiple sections to address each component of the reasoned-action approach. Subsequently, respondents completed a web-survey. Independent t-tests were used to compare responses between the two groups. Of 391 respondents, 112 (28.9%) students indicated previous NMUPD. The intervention group had significantly (P = 0.04) more negative attitudes toward NMUPD. No significant differences were found in PNs (P = 0.11), PBC (P = 0.68) or intentions to NMUPD (P = 0.97). The intervention was successful in changing attitudes toward NMUPD. Targeting the intervention toward college students regardless of previous experiences of NMUPD might have led to insufficiency of the intervention to influence intentions. Additional research is needed to improve the intervention dissemination and utilization.

AB  - Previous studies have described racial and socioeconomic disparities in the treatment of infertility. Patient factors such as attitudes and awareness may be contributing factors. Since primary care is often the setting that serves as an entry into other areas of medicine, we sought to evaluate mens attitudes and awareness of male infertility in the primary care setting. To do this, we performed a cross-sectional survey of mens attitudes toward mens health issues in 210 men from two primary care clinic waiting rooms in Atlanta, Georgia. The survey was self-administered with closed-ended question items and was approximately 20 min in length. Of the 310 men approached, 210 agreed to participate and returned completed surveys. Overall, 52% of men said they were "very" or "somewhat" familiar with infertility and 25% were familiar with treatments for infertility. Some men had heard of surgery (21%) and medication (35%) as treatments for male infertility. Awareness and familiarity with the condition was greater in high socioeconomic status men (i.e. college graduates or those with income >$100 k per year) but did not differ by race on multivariate analysis. Attitudes toward infertility varied by race with non-Caucasian men being more likely to indicate that infertility is a serious condition, to be concerned about infertility, and to believe it decreases a mans quality-of-life. Therefore, a lack of awareness, but not negative attitudes, may contribute to previously-described disparities in the treatment of infertility.

AB  - Individuals with obesity in Western societies often face weight-related stigmatization and social exclusion. Recurrent exposure to prejudice and negative social feedback alters one's behavior in future social interactions. In this study, we aimed to investigate autonomic nervous system and affective responses to social interactions in individuals with obesity. Women and men with (n = 56) and without (n = 56) obesity participated in episodes of social inclusion and social exclusion using a virtual ball-tossing game. During the experiment, heart rate was measured and parasympathetic activity (overall high-frequency power and event-related cardiac slowing) was analyzed. Our results show that in novel social interactions, women with obesity, relative to the other groups, exhibited the strongest increase in parasympathetic activity. Furthermore, parasympathetic activity was related to a more negative body image in individuals with obesity, but not in lean individuals. Additionally, women with obesity reported a stronger decrease in mood after social exclusion than did the other participants. Our results demonstrate influences of objective and subjective bodily characteristics on parasympathetic cardio-regulation during social interactions. In particular, they show behavioral and physiological alterations during social interactions in women with obesity.

AB  - Workers' compensation systems require injured employees to overcome cumbersome requirements in order to obtain health-care and salary-replacement benefits. The structural vulnerabilities of Latino immigrants put them at greater risk for workplace injuries and further complicate their search for redress. As a medico-legal system, workers' compensation relies on medical professionals to interrogate the bodies of injured low-wage immigrant workers. This article aims to clarify how workers' trajectories are impacted by interactions with health-care system. Utilizing activist research methods, I collaborated with Fuerza Laboral, a worker center in Rhode Island, from the fall of 2013 to the end of 2014, to survey and interview injured Latino workers, physicians, and legal professionals. I bring together worker narratives and physician reflections to identify how the compensation system's reliance on biomedicine contributes to poor outcomes for injured immigrant workers. Considering the medical "gaze," prejudice against injured workers, racial and ethnic bias in medicine, and the pitfalls of cultural competency training, I outline the mechanics of how the medical-legal system corrodes the patient-physician relationship. Evaluating the risks of positioning physicians as gatekeepers, I advocate for uncoupling medical evaluations from compensation cases, the importance of healthcare system reform, and medical curricula that emphasize structural analysis. Such reforms may liberalize access to health care for injured workers as well as stymie bias in medical education.

AB  - Purpose of the Study: Little research has examined factors that contribute to the formation of attitudes toward one's own aging. The current study aimed to examine personality as defined by the Five-Factor model of personality as an antecedent of attitudes, while taking into account demographic and health factors known to be relevant to such attitudes.
   Design and Methods: Participants aged 60 years or older (N = 421) were part of a longitudinal study of health and wellbeing in Australia, and completed a postal survey comprising measures of personality, the Attitudes to Ageing Questionnaire, the SF-12 health survey, and the Satisfaction with Life Scale.
   Results: Higher levels of neuroticism were associated with less positive attitudes toward old age as a time of psychological growth, and higher extraversion and agreeableness were significant predictors of less negative attitudes toward psychosocial loss. Baseline measures of self-reported mental and physical health, as well as change in those scores, also made significant contributions to attitudes toward aging.
   Implications: Personality was a significant antecedent of attitudes towards aging, as were mental and physical health. The data highlight the role of potentially modifiable factors, such as mental and physical health. If these factors act as resources that shape an individual's attitudes during the aging process, then one potential foundation for holding positive attitudes to aging is to maintain physical and mental health. This requires interventions and policies that are effective in encouraging health-promoting behaviors.

AB  - Nurse clinicians and academics need to understand intercultural communication challenges to improve their communication skills and better support students' learning. Gaps exist in the literature regarding intercultural communication resources for students, academics and clinicians. The aim of this study was to explore the experiences of clinical nurses, nurse academics, and student nurses regarding intercultural communication challenges. Data were collected using focus group interviews with nineteen clinical facilitators (nurses who supervise nursing students in clinical practice), five clinical nurses, and ten nursing students. Seven nurse academics were interviewed via telephone. The purposive sample was drawn from a tertiary hospital and a university in Australia. Participants were invited to discuss challenging intercultural scenarios they had experienced including strategies they used to overcome such challenges. Using qualitative content analysis data were analysed resulting in four categories which were: 1) prejudice based on cultural diversity; 2) unfamiliarity with cultural boundaries; 3) stereotyping cultural behaviours; and 4) difficulty understanding English. Strategies participants used to mitigate challenges included resorting to cultural validation through alliance building, proactively seeking clarification, and acquiring cultural awareness knowledge. This study highlights intercultural challenges students, clinicians and academics face and signpost the way forward with useful strategies to better inform nurse education. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Unprotected sexual activity increases the risk of pregnancy and HIV and AIDS. More than three decades into the AIDS pandemic, the condom remains the most effective strategy for protecting against the dual risks of pregnancy and HIV and AIDS, but data from national surveys suggest that condom use among young people aged 15?24 is on the decline in South Africa. This study uses qualitative data from 20 in-depth interviews and one focus group to examine the risk behaviours of university students aged 18?24 years old, with particular emphasis on understanding the decline in the use of condoms. It is well documented that South Africa has one of the highest prevalence rates of HIV and AIDS in the world, however the findings of this study suggest that even though students were well informed about the perceived risks associated with unsafe sexual behaviours, they continue to engage in risk behaviours including unprotected sexual intercourse, multiple sexual partners and the use of alcohol. Male students were more likely than female students to report risky sexual behaviours. Condom use is occurring but not consistently. The majority of students did not use condoms during their first sexual encounter because of a lack of preparedness. Negative attitudes towards condoms continue to discourage students from using them consistently, especially those provided by the government. In light of this, it is recommended that rigorous efforts are directed towards challenging inaccurate perceptions about, and attitudes towards, condom use to promote consistency.

AB  - Purpose. The purpose of this study is to compare the probability of unemployment and duration of joblessness between partnered gays, lesbians and their straight peers in the EU. Design/methodology/approach. Existence of potential differences in the outcomes is tested by multilevel logistic regression model (probability of unemployment) and multilevel linear regression model (length of joblessness) using the EU Labour Force Survey data from 2008 to 2015. Findings. Gays have been found to have a significantly higher unemployment probability and (weakly significantly) a longer duration of joblessness than comparable straight men. No significant difference was identified in unemployment probabilities of lesbians and heterosexual women but the joblessness duration appears to be significantly shorter in lesbians. Originality/value. Previous research indicated that lesbians and gays face barriers in access to employment. To author's knowledge this is the first study which investigates whether gay people experience prolonged joblessness.

AB  - Background: The imbalance in nurse-to-patient ratio and limited physical space may lead to care provision by a nurse of the opposite gender. On the other hand, the relationship with the opposite gender in Iran is limited due to cultural and religious beliefs. The aim of this study was to investigate patients' attitudes toward receiving care from the opposite gender nurse.
   Material and Method: This descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out on 200 patients admitted to different hospital wards. The patients were recruited using convenience sampling. Data collection tools comprised of a demographic questionnaire and a researcher-made questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS (version 16) and running descriptive statistics (i.e., chi(2), independent t test, and linear regression analysis).
   Results: Male and female patients had 31.8% and 42.6% negative attitudes toward receiving care from the opposite gender, respectively, indicating a statistically significant difference (p = .05). Patients' attitudes had a significant and positive relationship with age, level of education, and experience of receiving care from a nurse of the opposite gender.
   Conclusion: A significant percentage of patients had a negative attitude toward receiving care from the opposite-gender nurse. Since people's attitudes affect their relationships, it is necessary to provide conditions for assigning the same gender nurse for patients and improving patients' attitudes toward nurses of the opposite gender.

AB  - A religious prosociality stereotype exists such that religiosity and prosociality are presumed to be positively associated, as evidenced by proxy measures such as personality traits. However, studies using self- and peer-ratings of Agreeableness and Conscientiousness have not simultaneously controlled for the religiosity of the participant and the target. One hundred and sixty students completed measures of religiosity in a prescreening survey. Later, participants rated an array of targets, including a Christian and an atheist, on adjectives corresponding to Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Regardless of participant religiosity, atheist targets were rated as being lower in Agreeableness and Conscientiousness relative to those labeled as Christians. This bias was greater for highly religious participants. This effect was mediated by perceptions of the morality of the target independent of participants' broader attitudes concerning the target's religious group. Implications are discussed.

AB  - Orientation: Managers' and employers' negative attitudes towards people with disabilities are a significant obstacle for employing people with disabilities (PWDs).
   Research purpose: The primary purpose of this study was to measure the attitudes of public sector managers towards PWDs.
   Motivation for the study: The motivation for this study was to explore factors affecting managers' attitudes towards PWDs.
   Research approach/design and method: The study was conducted within the quantitative research paradigm by using a cross-sectional survey design. A convenience sampling method was used. The questionnaire measured public sector managers' attitudes towards PWDs. Descriptive statistics, Cohen's d, chi-square test and Spearman's rank-order correlation statistical techniques were used to provide answers to the research questions.
   Main findings: The results revealed that managers had positive attitudes towards PWDs. The main attitudinal problems identified were that different training methods and tools should be used to meet the needs of different disability types. The results showed that PWDs had no unique characteristics, such as dependability, lower absenteeism rates, better cooperation and more loyalty, compared with those without disabilities. Managers also had the perception that PWDs lack communication, technical and social skills.
   Practical/Managerial implications: The negative perceptions towards the skills and characteristics of PWDs necessitate remedial interventions and different training methods.
   Contribution/value-add: This study has made a significant contribution to the body of knowledge by providing a theoretical-conceptual framework and a reliable measuring instrument to measure public sector managers' attitudes towards PWDs.

AB  - This paper examines the predicament of prejudice that women face in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa. It explores the social and economic factors that militate against the integration of women into senior administrative and political leadership positions in the continent. It contends that if women are under represented in Africa because of open or indirect mechanism of exclusion and discrimination, then educating women and girls is not enough. Equity for women and girls will only change if the public and private sectors' institutions are galvanized to change simultaneously. Further it stresses that the public, private sectors and NGOs in Africa need to introduce diversity management programs as a policy at the national and regional government levels in order to engage talented women in its process of seeking sustainable development.
   The paper also argues that in offering women the opportunity to access economic resources as well as to disentangle their identities from those of their families they will contribute immensely in the sustainable development process of Africa. It contends that no development process will be totally beneficial to a nation if it does not involve women. The concluding section recommended some policies that would effectively reduce discrimination against women in the public service as well as stimulate and integrate talented women interests in the social, economic, leadership, and political development of Africa.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to compare Australian and Chinese nursing students' attitudes and intentions to care for the elderly and the factors affecting these intentions. Method: A cross-sectional design employed two questionnaires to survey 256 Australian nursing students and 204 Chinese nursing students within the first weeks of their nursing curriculum. Factor analysis and logistical regression analysis were performed to identify predictors of intent to care for the elderly. Results: The percentage of students more likely to care for the elderly was significantly higher among the Chinese group (72.1%) than the Australian group (45.3%). Work experience with older people and being under the age of 20 were found to be positive predictors, whereas factors such as prejudice toward the elderly and beliefs that elders should live in separate housing were negatively associated with an intention to care for the elderly. Conclusions: The collectivist culture has a more positive influence on nursing students' attitudes toward the elderly compared with the individualist culture. Implications for Research and Practice: It is highly recommended that elderly care settings should be incorporated in clinical placements and further research is needed to explore how clinical experience affects students' career choice.

AB  - This three-part study examined 421 mid-Atlantic university students' perceptions of the content of social stereotypes related to fathers- and men-in-general. College students viewed men-in-general as having far fewer positive parenting and personal qualities, but generally did not differ in breadwinning characteristics when compared to fathers-in-general. The results empirically supported the notion that younger adults generally do not view men-in-general as having the qualities associated with active fathering (e.g., being physically, financially, or emotionally involved with children), although they are seen as comparable providers. Men-in-general also are viewed much more negatively than fathers-in-general. Implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Limited research has indicated that despite their overwhelming interest in tumor molecular pro filing (MP), 1 cancer patients have poor knowledge about MP. The current study aimed to investigate demographic and psychological predictors of knowledge and perceived importance of MP in an advanced cancer patient cohort. Eligible participants had advanced solid cancers of any histological type with sufficient accessible tissue for MP and were enrolled in the Molecular Screening and Therapeutics (MoST) Program. A questionnaire was completed by 1074 participants (91% response rate) after consent, prior to undergoing MP. Overall, participants had poor to moderate knowledge of MP, yet perceived MP to have high importance. Higher education, speaking English at home, and greater satisfaction with the decision to undergo MP were associated with higher knowledge scores. More negative attitudes towards uncertainty, greater self-efficacy to cope with results, and lower perceived likelihood of cancer progression were associated with greater perceived importance of MP. Less educated participants and those who do not speak English at home will need clear explanations, visual aids and ample opportunity to ask questions about MP at the time of their decision - making. Clinicians also need to consider psychological factors relevant to patients' decision to pursue MP. Given the increased awareness of and demand for cancer genomic information and the rapidly changing nature of the actionability of MP, these findings will help inform an important ongoing debate on how to facilitate ethical and informed consent and manage patient expectations about personalized treatments.

AB  - Introduction: Despite the universal right to access the same range, quality and standard of free or affordable health care and programs as provided to other persons, people with physical disabilities (PWPDs) continue to experience challenges in accessing these services. This article presents the challenges faced by PWPDs in accessing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services in Kampala, Uganda.
   Methods: This was a qualitative study that was conducted with male and female PWPDs in Kampala in 2007. Data on the challenges experienced by PWPDs in accessing SRH services were collected using in-depth interviews with 40 PWPDs and key informant interviews with 10 PWPDs' representatives, staff of agencies supporting PWPDs and health workers. All data were captured verbatim using an audio-tape recorder, entered into a Microsoft Word computer program and analyzed manually following a content thematic approach.
   Results: The study findings show that PWPDs face a multitude of challenges in accessing SRH services including negative attitudes of service providers, long queues at health facilities, distant health facilities, high costs of services involved, unfriendly physical structures and the perception from able-bodied people that PWPDs should be asexual.
   Conclusion: People with physical disabilities (PWPDs) face health facility-related (service provider and facility-related challenges), economic and societal challenges in accessing SRH services. These findings call for a need to sensitize service providers on SRH needs of PWPDs for better support and for the government to enforce the provision of PWPD-friendly services in all health facilities.

AB  - This article describes the population participating in the LGBT Pride Parade in Santiago, Chile, from discrimination and victimization standpoints. The sample consisted of 488 subjects older than 18 years (M = 25.1), who were interviewed during the 2007 event. For this purpose, a questionnaire from the Latin American Centre of Sexuality and Human Rights (CLAM) was adapted and administered. Approximately 35% of respondents reported having experimented school, religious, or neighborhood discrimination. The more discriminated are transgender people. Approximately three fourths of respondents reported experiencing ridicule and almost 60% reported experiencing insults or threats. Transgender were significantly more likely than gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals to experience discrimination or victimization events. Finally, the parade acquired an important social and political character in the context of a clearly homophobic society.

AB  - Background Electronic health records (EHRs) are useful tools in healthcare settings but implementation in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) face challenges. Objective To explore post-implementation challenges affecting the deployment of EHRs and their use in selected health facilities in Ghana. Method Using a qualitative research approach, 21 in-depth interviews were conducted with health workers in two hospitals in the study area in Ghana, in February and June 2020. Purposive sampling was used to select participants. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded into themes using QSR Nvivo12 software to aid thematic analyses. Results Post-implementation challenges were grouped into lack of technological, logistical and managerial support, and inadequate training. Inadequate equipment was the most reported post-implementation challenge that affected EHR use. Unreliable Internet and network connectivity was a source of frustration, which caused staff to develop negative attitudes towards use of the system. Lack of funding stalled implementation of the system and limited its use to critical care units only. It was also the reason replacement of equipment delayed. Conclusion While EHR post-implementation challenges facing health facilities are surmountable, managerial support, backed with the requisite logistical and technical support is needed. It is not enough to rely on funding; health institutions should prioritise emerging EHR post-implementation challenges in their operating budgets. Implications A national framework is needed to guide effective and sustainable EHR implementation across the country.

AB  - Rationale, aims and objectives Despite increasing dissemination efforts, many psychotherapists still do not use treatments that are supported by research. Some have claimed that psychotherapists rely more on their clinical intuition than scientific evidence when making treatment decisions, but there is a paucity of research on this topic. The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between intuition and therapists' attitudes towards evidence-based practices (EBPs).
   Methods Psychotherapists from diverse professional backgrounds completed an Internet-based survey that assessed EBP attitudes, reliance on an intuitive thinking style, attitudes about alternative therapies and endorsement of erroneous health beliefs that are not supported by scientific evidence.
   Results Regression analyses showed that an intuitive thinking style was associated with several dimensions of EBP attitudes, including more negative attitudes towards research, less openness to research-based treatments, and less willingness to use evidence-based treatments if required to do so, even after controlling for background factors such as education level. Furthermore, a tendency to rely on intuition was associated with more positive attitudes towards alternative therapies and the endorsement of erroneous health beliefs.
   Conclusions Most dissemination efforts targeted at psychotherapists focus only on education about EBPs. However, results of this study suggest that dissemination efforts may need to more directly address the potential barriers to using EBPs (i.e. reliance on intuition) to be optimally effective in changing therapists' attitudes and behaviours.

AB  - Anthropomorphism is a phenomenon that describes the human tendency to see human-like shapes in the environment. It has considerable consequences for people's choices and beliefs. With the increased presence of robots, it is important to investigate the optimal design for this technology. In this paper we discuss the potential benefits and challenges of building anthropomorphic robots, from both a philosophical perspective and from the viewpoint of empirical research in the fields of human-robot interaction and social psychology. We believe that this broad investigation of anthropomorphism will not only help us to understand the phenomenon better, but can also indicate solutions for facilitating the integration of human-like machines in the real world.

AB  - Divergent cultural, religious, and ideological beliefs and practices are often challenging to contemplate and difficult to accept when they conflict with an individual's own convictions and way of life. The recognition that children and adolescents grow up in an increasingly diverse world has led to a general interest in fostering tolerance. In this article, we discuss three central questions on tolerance and related research. First, we consider age-related patterns of responses toward tolerance of diversity and whether they depend on the type of dissenting beliefs and practices children are asked to tolerate. Second, we focus on how and why children are asked to be tolerant. Third, we discuss the boundaries of tolerance-the reasons and conditions that make tolerance less likely. Overall, we conclude that tolerance and intolerance can occur at all ages and depend on what, how, why, and when individuals are asked to tolerate belief discrepancy and dissenting practices.

AB  - Microaggression is an unconscious statement or action regarded as discrimination against a marginalized community. Microaggression coupled with implicit bias (unconscious prejudice in favor or against one person or group) can be psychologically damaging to the targeted community. The difficulty with microaggressions and implicit biases is that they are subjective and unconscious, and the offender may not view them as damaging. Microaggressions and implicit biases can affect both the patient and the physician. Whether it is the patient that is the victim of these phenomena or the physician, the goal of quality patient care is adversely affected. When patients are victims, bias can also lead to systematic dismissal of symptoms, inferior medical services, and less aggressive preventive care. Physicians who are victims of such phenomena may deal with the repeated trauma of receiving microaggressions and biases from patients and/or colleagues which may cause mental distress and ultimately functional impairment affecting work performance. In either case, repeated direct and indirect exposure of microaggressions and biases through encounters within and outside the workforce are cumulative leading to lasting internalized damage. Awareness that implicit biases and microaggressions exist and recognition that these phenomena are problematic are the first steps toward fostering a more equitable and inclusive culture. As a society and especially as health care workers, we must become increasingly culturally aware and sensitive of all communities for the ultimate good of patient care.

AB  - Secondhand smoke (SHS) remains a common health threat in densely populated, urban settings. We estimated the prevalence of exposure and associated respiratory symptoms, knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors in a multi-ethnic, weighted sample of Singapore residents using a cross-sectional survey of 1806 adults. We weighted data to match the national population in terms of gender, ethnicity, and education level and analyzed data using descriptive statistics, bivariate analyses, multiple linear and logistic regressions, and a multinomial logistic regression model. About 88% of respondents reported regular SHS exposure. Nearly 57% reported exposure to neighbors' SHS at home. Respiratory symptoms were reported by 32.5% and significantly associated with exposure to daily (AOR = 2.63, 95% CI = 1.62-4.36), non-daily (AOR = 1.75, 95% CI = 1.14-2.77), and neighbors' (AOR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.07-1.76) SHS. More knowledge of SHS was associated with male gender (beta = 0.28, p = 0.0009) and higher household income (linear trend; p = 0.0400). More negative attitudes to SHS were associated with older age (linear trend; p < 0.0001). Engaging in behaviors to avoid SHS was associated with a more negative attitude to SHS (AOR = 1.09-1.23). SHS exposure is common in Singapore's densely populated setting and associated with respiratory symptoms, even if exposure is non-daily or from neighboring homes.

T2  - NEW ZEALAND MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - SUICIDE
AB  - AIM: To consider the possibility of consequences beyond the alleviation of perceived individual suffering, for families left behind, communities and society as a whole should the End of Life Choice Act gain public support in the September 2020 referendum in New Zealand.
   METHOD: This study used the Yin case study approach to undertake a single semi-structured in-depth interview with a participant who self-identified as having first-hand experience of assisted dying from a relative's perspective (in a country where this is legal). Thematic analysis was used to identify themes and trends from the interview transcript.
   RESULTS: Three key themes emerged from the interview: the potential for assisted dying becoming an expectation for others to pursue when unwell and possibly facing a life-threatening illness; the notion of stigma being associated with the individual using assisted dying legislation and the family left behind; and that there may be the potential for such legislation to produce a contagion effect.
   CONCLUSION: The introduction of assisted dying legislation into New Zealand culture provides a potential hotspot for family, community and social discord that may not be easily remedied. Further study in New Zealand is required to investigate whether a contagion effect of assisted dying is possible, and how as a society, we negotiate what could become a conflicted pathway potentially complicated by prejudice, judgement and stigma.

AB  - The rise of Internet-based service platformsmay perpetuate and possibly increase social exclusion of people with disabilities. The expansion of such services potentially creates a new realm of unregulated activity that blurs the boundaries between public and private space andmay undermine the principle of equal access to goods and services. We investigate access for people with disabilities to Airbnb rentals using a randomized field experiment of 3,847 lodging requests. We find that hosts were less likely to preapprove requests from travelers with blindness, cerebral palsy, dwarfism, or spinal cord injury than to approve travelers without disabilities. Thedifferences are onlypartially attenuated amonghosts advertised as "wheelchair accessible," and the host responses did not vary significantly by whether the response wasmade before or after Airbnb required all users to agree to a new nondiscrimination policy. A supplementary MTurk survey of hosts found that both physical accessibility concerns and negative attitudes play independent roles in the lower likelihood of preapprovals for travelers with disabilities, supporting both taste-based and social models of discrimination. Our findings raise questions about the reach of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which applies to hotels but not to most Airbnb hosts. The platform economy appears to create substantial challenges in ensuring equal access for people with disabilities. The findings can informtheoretical development on discrimination, boundaries of the firm, and economic regulation of organizations.

AB  - Background: The University of Queensland has developed the Clinical Practice Performance electronic Portfolio (CPPeP) as a learning and assessment tool for third year nursing students. To promote effective use of the CPPeP in the clinical setting, barriers must be identified and strategies developed to overcome them.
   Methods: A 24-question survey exploring the use and perceptions of the CPPeP was administered to 42 third year nursing students. Questions explored actual barriers encountered while eight open-ended questions were thematically analysed for perceived barriers.
   Results: A 100% response rate was achieved. Students were comfortable with working with computers. Twenty nine students (69%) encountered specific barriers. Of the 152 written comments to the open-ended questions, perceived barriers were evident in 72 of them. Barriers experienced related to gaining access, finding time and staff attitude. The majority of students made their portfolio entries at home.
   Conclusion: Students enjoyed using the CPPeP but competed with staff for the limited numbers of computers available. Heavy workloads and 'busyness' of the wards also prohibited access along with negative staff attitudes and reluctance of registered nurses to engage as student preceptors. The issue of overcoming barriers is more complex than simply providing more computers or overcoming staff prejudices. Finding time is a barrier not easily overcome given the current and projected nursing shortage. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
