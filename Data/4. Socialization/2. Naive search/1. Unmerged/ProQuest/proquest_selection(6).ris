T1  - Teaching bystander action: forming identities that promote opposition to prejudice towards Muslim people
AN  - 2573637222
AB  - Prejudice towards Muslim people in Western countries is common and increasing. This paper describes an educational intervention aimed at increasing positive attitudes and actions to support Muslim Australians. University students participated in a 12-week educational programme that drew on prejudice reduction principles and a pedagogical approach that emphasised active discussion. Results (N = 94) showed an increase in positivity towards Muslim people, increased intention to take bystander action to confront prejudice, and social identification (as a supporter of positive relations between Muslim and non-Muslim Australians). Boosts in positivity towards Muslim people and intention to confront prejudice were mediated by increases in social identity, although changes in social identification only explained increased commitment to confront prejudice in a low risk scenario. Results suggest that educational interventions such as these can foster new, inclusive identities that provide a basis for action to support Muslim people.

T1  - The weight of history: child protection and parenting with a disability in 20<sup>th</sup> Century Iceland
AN  - 2417704156
AB  - This contribution focuses on four periods in Iceland, from the early twentieth century until the time of writing, in order to document and analyse the struggles of people with intellectual disabilities to marry, have a family and maintain custody of their children. Each period is linked to specific pieces of legislation that governed the bodies and lives of disabled people and reflected larger social norms concerning issues of family life and parenthood. An emphasis is placed upon the perspective of contemporary critical disability studies in analysing the historical development of this struggle, and the voices of those who experienced this struggle first-hand, drawn from a number of research projects conducted in Iceland. Our main contention is that the weight of history still comes to bear upon matters of parenting and family life, even in the most recent shift toward a human rights approach to disability. There remains a strong socio-cultural resistance toward parenting with an intellectual disability, rooted in the ideology of early twentieth-century eugenics. Our goal is to document the development of these phases throughout the twentieth century in Iceland in order to illustrate how older ideas and prejudices still inform contemporary child protection practices concerning parents with disabilities.

T1  - Measuring Stability and Change in Personal Culture Using Panel Data
AN  - 2413904149
AB  - Models of population-wide cultural change tend to invoke one of two broad models of individual change. One approach theorizes people actively updating their beliefs and behaviors in the face of new information. The other argues that, following early socialization experiences, dispositions are stable. We formalize these two models, elaborate empirical implications of each, and derive a simple combined model for comparing them using panel data. We test this model on 183 attitude and behavior items from the 2006 to 2014 rotating panels of the General Social Survey. The pattern of results is complex but more consistent with the settled dispositions model than with the active updating model. Most of the observed change in the GSS appears to be short-term attitude change or measurement error rather than persisting changes. When persistent change occurs, it is somewhat more likely to occur in younger people and for public behaviors and beliefs about high-profile issues than for private attitudes. We argue that we need both models in our theory of cultural evolution but that we need more research on the circumstances under which each is more likely to apply.

T1  - Unemployment and social stigma: Naming, blaming and shaming of educated youth in rural Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan
TT  - Unemployment and social stigma
AN  - 2416093008
AB  - PurposeThis article aims to highlight the stigmatization attached to the unemployment of educated youth in rural regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan.Design/methodology/approachThe study explicates the subjective experiences of the youth as being unemployed and societal attitudes toward them through an in-depth qualitative approach. A total of 30 unemployed male individuals were interviewed through an interview guide.FindingsThe study reveals that unemployed individuals are stigmatized and discriminately treated. They experience the difference in social support from their family and friends during unemployment, which is a discouraging aspect. This finding is in contrast to the existing literature on the subject in which family and friends are described as a major source of social support. As the study is conducted in the rural context, it is observed that local factors coupled with the joint family system have intensified negative attitudes toward the unemployed youth. Subsequently, the negative societal treatment serves as a factor for psychological challenges in their lives.Originality/valueThis article serves the need of exploring the experiences of unemployed individuals precisely in the Pakistani context.

T1  - TRANSFORMING INFLUENCE TO WELLNESS: IDENTIFYING ADOLESCENTS' AFFECT AND PREFERENCES DURING THE PRELIMINARY DESIGN OF A SOCIAL BOARD GAME FOR TOBACCO PREVENTION
AN  - 2375485252
AB  - Purpose: Adolescent tobacco use remains a major risk-taking behavior. Ninety percent of adult daily smokers initiate smoking and become addicted before the age of 18. Nicotine dependence is aggravated by the introduction of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). While adolescents tend to be influenced by peers to use tobacco, they may also be influenced to avoid tobacco (i.e., positive influence). While current interventions teach about negative social influence at the individual level, none promote positive influence among adolescents through social interaction. Therefore, there is a need for innovative social programs that promote positive peer influence. One potential solution is a board game for tobacco prevention. Supported by the experiential learning theory, social game play can facilitate the exploration of health information, drive social discussions, and encourage adolescents to learn from their errors through engaging in risky behaviors in a safe environment. To inform the preliminary design of a board game for tobacco prevention, the current study (1) qualitatively explores the experiences and preferences of adolescents regarding activities, games in broad, and board games in particular, and (2) identifies experiences that can promote engagement in game play among adolescents. Methods: Fifteen adolescents (ages 12-15 years) from an after-school program in Houston, Texas, were randomized to three focus groups for 90-minute discussion sessions. A semi-structured instrument was employed, asking adolescents about their preferences, attitudes, and beliefs regarding group activities, games, and board games, and their creative thoughts regarding a first draft of our board game program. Using a thematic analysis approach, transcripts were coded for common themes within and between groups. Results: Participants (73.33% male; mean age = 13 years, SD = 0.75) reported engaging in about twelve hours per week of game play (SD = 14.71), and three participants were susceptible to use tobacco in the future. Analysis revealed four common themes across all groups: First, as evidence of affect regulation, adolescents reported engagement in games as a way to regulate affective states (e.g. anger and boredom). Second, difficult levels and complicated instructions in games were reported to drive unfavorable affect (e.g. frustration and anger) and negative attitudes toward a game. Alternatively, moderately challenging and strategy-based activities were reported to be engaging elements that drive favorable affect (e.g. enjoyment) and positive attitudes. Finally, while moderate competition, teamwork, and cooperation were favorably expressed, adolescents explained that excessive competition can evoke unfavorable emotions (e.g. anger). Conclusions: These results indicate that a game-based program for tobacco prevention must balance between the challenge of game play and adolescents' ability to overcome the challenge. Such a balance can drive a healthy engagement in the program, thereby facilitating learning. Furthermore, social interaction is highly favored among participants, with a support for cooperation and teamwork. Ultimately, a board game for tobacco prevention is expected to bring adolescents together to create lasting memories that nudge them away from tobacco and the harms it can cause. Future work will use a participatory approach to allow adolescents to take part in the design process.

T1  - Economic conditions, group relative deprivation and ethnic threat perceptions: a cross-national perspective
AN  - 2376776340
AB  - Explaining negative attitudes towards immigration in general and threat due to immigration, in particular, has been a major topic of study in recent decades. While intergroup contact has received considerable attention in explaining ethnic threat, group relative deprivation (GRD), that is, feelings that one’s group is unfairly deprived of desirable goods in comparison to relevant out-groups, has been largely ignored in cross-national research. Nevertheless, various smaller-scale studies have demonstrated that GRD can have a decisive impact on prejudice. In the current study, we examine the association between GRD and ethnic threat systematically across 20 European countries, thereby controlling for intergroup contact and value priorities. The 7th round of the European Social Survey (ESS) includes questions assessing respondents’ feelings of group deprivation compared to immigrants and offers for the first time an opportunity to contextualise the threat-inducing effect of GRD across Europe. A multilevel structural equation model (MLSEM) demonstrates a considerable association between GRD and ethnic threat both on the individual and country levels. The results indicate that GRD is not only an important mediating factor between social structural positions and perceived threat, but also fully mediates the relation between contextual economic indicators and ethnic threat.

T1  - School to work or school to home? An analysis of women's vocational education in Turkey as a path to employment
AN  - 2311522163
AB  - This paper focuses on women's vocational education in Turkey as a gendered and gendering process. Cultural norms about women's role in society, a vocational curriculum that echoes these norms, and a labour market with gender inequalities constitute the background against which women formulate their vocational preferences and seek pathways into the labour market. We use the literatures on gender and vocational education, school-to-work transitions, and gender bargains to analyse data from qualitative fieldwork with students and graduates of girls' vocational high schools. First, we scrutinize how students choose vocational tracks. Our findings point to the presence of a gendered bounded agency by students and graduates, according to which their choices echo traditional gender norms. Secondly, we discuss the transition from school to work, during which they are faced with gender prejudice in the labour market. Finally, we show how that process turns into a 'school-to-home' transition whereby graduates become homemakers.

T1  - Anti-immigrant Attitudes in Russia: The Group Position Model Reconsidered
AN  - 2312690251
AB  - This article analyses the relationship between relative group position in an ethnically stratified social order and anti-immigrant attitudes in Russia. Based on data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey of the Higher School of Economics, it studies the role of two objective indicators of group position: relative ingroup size and the group's dominant political status within a region. The findings show that when a group position is measured in numerical terms, the attitudes of ethnic Russians seem to follow social dominance theory, while titulars tend to conform to the alienation-based extension to the group position model.

T1  - Social inclusion and exclusion in same-race and interracial peer encounters
AN  - 2309797587
AB  - This study investigated children's and adolescents' predictions of inclusion and evaluations of exclusion in interracial and same-race peer contexts. The sample (N = 246) consisted of African American (n = 115) and European American (n = 131) children and adolescents who judged the likelihood of including a new peer, evaluated the group's decision to exclude the new peer, and provided reasons for their judgments. European American participants, particularly adolescents, viewed same-race inclusion as more likely than interracial inclusion. In contrast, African American participants viewed interracial and same-race inclusion to be just as likely, and evaluated all forms of exclusion to be more wrong than did their European American counterparts. The findings are discussed with respect to peer messages about interracial peer encounters and the conditions that are necessary for prejudice reduction.

T1  - Effecting Epiphanous Change in Teacher Practice: A Teacher's Autoethnography
AN  - 2313947514
AB  - This study comprises of a series of autoethnographic vignettes stemming from Karen's life experiences that provide a snapshot of her quest for equality and fairness in her personal life, as well as her professional life as a primary school and special education educator. Karen later became a teacher of teachers, keen to share what she had learned with her peers. It was when she began educating other teachers that she became even more self-reflective with the most poignant question being, what causes one to change their beliefs, attitude, or way of thinking? The included vignettes encapsulate significant stories, starting from early childhood, to the motivation behind Karen's teaching career and then the students that she met who shaped her adoption of the belief of equality and fairness for all. The vignettes provide the foundation for a qualitative study where one teacher's journey of transformative and epiphanous change are analysed using autoethnography, reflexivity and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). The study examines the value of tacit knowledge, and then segues to explore resonance with Dewey 's constructivism, Kolb's experiential theory, Mezirow's transformational education theory and Tang's Synergic Inquiry. While these theories provide a foundation for how learning and personal transformation may occur and attempts to answer the aforementioned question; not one theory captured what Karen was seeking; which is: How does epiphanous, mind blowing, life affirming change occur? The author contends that to shift one's value's paradigm, one needs to incorporate the essence of all of the above theories to create a new integrated model.

T1  - Using the Past to Recuperate the Present: The Authentic Evil of Madame Delphine Lalaurie in <i>American Horror Story: Coven</i>
AN  - 2306710703
AB  - The premiere episode of American Horror Story: Coven (2013–14) offers a glimpse into the life of the nineteenth‐century New Orleans socialite Madame Delphine Lalaurie before she is punished for her crimes by the “Voodoo Queen,” Marie Laveau (Angela Bassett), who gifts her with immortality before burying her alive beneath her own home. Lalaurie is then catapulted into the present when she is rescued by Fiona Goode (Jessica Lange), the dying leader—called the Supreme—of a witch coven who wants to know how Lalaurie has managed to stay alive. Lalaurie becomes embroiled in the coven's attempts to rejuvenate itself and with its ongoing conflict with Laveau, who is also immortal. Although her presence allows for many of the most horrific scenes in the show's third season, Lalaurie's character does not add much to the major plotline. What, then, is her primary function? In American Horror Story: Coven, the historical figure and the character of Madame Delphine Lalaurie serves a crucial role in deconstructing the nature of “evil” in women characters. While she would be considered evil in just about any sense, the “authentic” evil of Madame Lalaurie, based on the facts and folklore of her life, is compounded by the way she is portrayed as either flouting or failing gender norms, both in her own time and in the present. Although she is but one “evil” character among several, the nature of her evil—stemming as it does from a connection to “real” history, overt racial bigotry, and a failure to conform to gender norms—resonates with audiences living in an ostensible postfeminist, postracial moment. She is certainly not the only character who destabilizes naturalized gender roles. But while viewers may find themselves uneasily speculating on the complex portrayal of evil in a character, such as Fiona Goode, Lalaurie's more straightforward evil provides an easy alternative for passing moral judgment because she embodies both failed feminine socialization as well as a racial prejudice that is perceived by white audiences to have long since passed. The combination of failed motherhood (and thus failed femininity), racial bigotry, and a verifiable history of atrocities makes Lalaurie the clear antagonist in a season filled with so‐called evil women. Madame Lalaurie thus provides an “authentic” means of recuperation for mainstream (white) audiences struggling against accusations of ongoing systemic sexism and racism in contemporary society.

T1  - "When birds of a different feather flock together" – intercultural socialization in adolescents' friendships
AN  - 2317026993
AB  - Intercultural friendships are a powerful form of intergroup contact to reduce prejudice (Pettigrew, 1998). Little is known about if and how intercultural friendships may also foster intercultural competence. An important prerequisite for the development of intercultural competence is that adolescents reflect on cultural variations. We refer to the degree to which adolescents discuss cultural variations in intercultural friendships as intercultural socialization and explore the following research questions: (1) Does intercultural socialization in friendships mediate the relation between age, intercultural friendship characteristics (friendship group composition, and length, quality, and interaction frequency of the closest intercultural friendship), and adolescents' intercultural competence? (2) Do these relations depend on the adolescents' self-identification with majority and minority culture(s)? The sample included 571 adolescents in Germany (48% female, Mage = 13.69 years, 52% identifying only as members of the cultural majority, 48% (also) as members of a cultural minority. Intercultural competence was measured using a self-report questionnaire and open-ended questions capturing the adolescents' interpretation of and reaction to intercultural situations. Quantitative measures tapped into friendship characteristics (friendship group composition, and length, quality, and interaction frequency of the closest intercultural friendship). To test our model, we employed multigroup path analysis with latent variables in Mplus. Results showed that intercultural socialization linked age and intercultural friendship characteristics with adolescents' intercultural competence. The relations partly varied depending on student's cultural self-identification. We conclude that intercultural friendships are associated with important skills that are needed in increasingly multicultural societies if students experience and discuss cultural variations in these friendships.

T1  - Beyond the Fear of Deportation: Understanding Unauthorized Immigrants’ Ambivalence Toward the Police: PROD
AN  - 2258639948
AB  - This article draws on in-depth interviews and ethnography to examine unauthorized Mexican immigrants’ perceptions of and experiences with police in Los Angeles and Philadelphia. Most existing research focuses on immigrants’ fears of deportation as the primary determinant of negative attitudes toward the police. We add to this body of work by arguing that police interactions serve as important moments of legal socialization that also contribute to undocumented immigrants’ legal attitudes. Our findings reveal that undocumented immigrants express a great deal of ambivalence about American police, believing them to be both trustworthy and overly punitive. Ultimately, the ambivalence that undocumented immigrants feel about the police mirrors the tension between inclusion and exclusion that characterizes immigrant life in the United States.

T1  - The <i>Change Up</i> Project: Using Social Norming Theory with Young People to Address Domestic Abuse and Promote Healthy Relationships
AN  - 2158401863
AB  - This paper presents the findings of a secondary analysis of data collected during a pilot project, Change Up, which used a social norming approach (SNA) to address domestic violence and abuse (DVA) with young people aged 13–14. A SNA is based upon a well-articulated theory of behavior and evidence-based methodology for addressing social justice issues. This reflects a paradigm shift focusing upon strengths and positives, rather than pathologizing behaviors. Adopting a SNA, the Change Up project comprised a baseline survey followed by the intervention (workshop and peer-to-peer campaign), ending with a post-intervention survey. It was delivered in two high schools in a UK city between 2015 and 16. A secondary analysis of the survey data collected during the surveys and qualitative data collected at the end of each workshop was undertaken and this is reported here. Change Up data illustrates that most young people in the sample thought that DVA is unacceptable. There was, however, a gender difference in the norms held about the social acceptability of girls using physical violence against boys (and vice versa). The analysis of Change Up data indicates that a social norming approach to DVA programs aimed at young people can be successful in promoting attitude and behavior change. It also highlights a continuing need for young people’s education about relationships and gender equality.

T1  - Transcultural fandom of the Korean Wave in Latin America: through the lens of cultural intimacy and affinity space
AN  - 2250554164
AB  - This article has examined how the Hallyu phenomenon is integrated into a transnational global cultural landscape, focusing on Chilean reception of K-pop. It analyzed how Hallyu fans engage with a social media-saturated environment in Chile, mapping out transnational pop cultural flows within the digital media environment through which the participatory culture of media users is spread. What is interesting is that Chilean society, in general, shows negative attitudes toward K-pop fans. More importantly, while many Chileans consider K-pop fans weird and strange, often disparaging their family members and friends for liking such music, the marginalization of K-pop fans in Chile promotes a greater sense of bonding among them through the affinity spaces of social media. Under this circumstance, most of our interviewees explained that digital media plays a vital role in the dissemination of K-pop in Chile and Latin America. Unlike Hallyu fans in other regions, K-pop fans in Chile have developed cultural intimacy specific to digital site-media, primarily in the realm of social media, and K-pop generates the creation of affinity spaces via different social media platforms.

T1  - Structural racism as the fundamental cause of the academic achievement gap
AN  - 2235410844
AB  - Over six decades since the Supreme Court ruled that all American children have the right to a high quality education, the academic achievement gap remains an important social problem in the United States. Researchers interested in understanding the achievement gap generally seek to find the mechanisms that can explain why Black students continue to achieve at lower levels than their White counterparts. This research has shown that differences in socioeconomic status, family cultural resources, school quality and racial composition, and bias and prejudice in schools all act as mechanisms that link race to academic achievement. In this paper, we review studies from the past 10 years on the academic achievement gap. We argue that while all of the factors identified in the literature can add insight to how race structures educational achievement, the fundamental cause of the achievement gap is structural racism, a system of social organization that privileges White Americans and disadvantages Americans of color. We argue that acknowledging structural racism as the fundamental cause of the achievement gap can provide a unifying framework for interpreting findings from studies of specific mechanisms link race to academic outcomes.

T1  - Negotiating the Uniform: Youth Attitudes towards Military Service in Israel
AN  - 2212680605
AB  - Military service is one of the key milestones in Jewish Israelis’ transition to adulthood. Given the dominant role of the military in Israeli society, an understanding of young adults’ attitude towards the importance of the military and the nature of their service is needed. Based on 44 group interviews with 132 Jewish Israeli high school students, the study follows the differential attitude of youths towards compulsory military service, along socioeconomic lines. It concludes that (a) despite changes in Israeli society, young people still consider soldiers as the ultimate models of heroism, and view military service as a necessary component of normative citizenship and (b) they negotiate the nature and content of their military service based on its expected contribution to future mobility opportunities. The findings indicate that within the shared cultural script of the military’s importance, alternative paths play out without directly challenging the dominant consensus within Israeli society.

T1  - How and why disgust responses underlie prejudice: Evidence from the field
AN  - 2225864596
AB  - Thank you very much for this invitation and introduction. It is an honor being here and addressing you. The topic of this talk is how and why disgust responses underlie prejudice. Prejudice can be many things. People can be prejudiced against people who are of another sex or another sexual orientation, for example. Today, however, I focus on a particular type of prejudice: prejudice toward people from another ethnic or racial group. My aim is to convincingly argue that we can understand variation in such prejudice by considering the challenges that our ancestors faced over evolutionary history. In particular, I will focus on a perhaps surprising type of challenge, namely, the challenges stemming from diseases and pathogens and the evolved disgust responses that these challenges have selected for. In contemporary politics, how we should — and should not — react to people from other groups constitutes one of the most hotly debated issues. Europe, for example, is in the middle of what is being called an immigration or refugee crisis, facing streams of refugees as a result of the war in Syria. Most dramatically, the summer of 2015 saw large numbers of refugees arriving on the shores of Europe by boat and then walking across the continent on foot by highway. Of course, immigration and refugees are not just European issues; they are also issues in the United States. A focal point of the 2016 U.S. presidential election was whether or not to build a wall to keep out Mexican immigrants. As a political scientist, the most interesting observation about the issue of immigration is what different reactions it elicits in different people. Some people react to refugees and immigration by opening their arms. In the summer of 2015, public demonstrations were held in Europe, with people holding signs saying “Refugees are welcome.” At the central railway station in Copenhagen, people were seen holding signs saying “Welcome to Denmark. We love refugees” and “Welcome, the food is for you,” while handing out food to the newcomers. But that is not the only type of reaction that we have seen. There have been opposite reactions, too. One picture illustrating those reactions made it into the international news. It was a picture of a Hungarian journalist trying to push over a refugee girl who was running across the border into Hungary. Another picture made the Danish news. In this picture, a man was standing on top of a highway bridge, spitting on the refugees who walked underneath. Importantly, the reactions that we observe here are not just very different. Their intensities are also strong and clearly emotion based, independent of whether the reaction is to open one’s arms or to react aggressively. How can we explain this variation? How can we explain the fact that some people react in one way and some people react in quite another way? If we look to the standard accounts within political science, this variation is often explained with reference to factors such as income: people who are worse off in economic terms might be more reluctant to let in immigrants. Political scientists also explain variation by making reference to education: people who have lower levels of education might have fewer multicultural values and therefore might be more reluctant to value open borders. A third factor that political scientists point to is ideology: people who are left leaning might be more open to refugees and immigrants than people on the right. All these factors are important. Still, in order to understand the intensity of, in particular, prejudiced reactions, we have found it fruitful to look at another type of factor. Together with my colleagues Lene Aarøe from Aarhus University and Kevin Arceneaux from Temple University, I have delved into how individual differences in disgust sensitivity are a major cause of variation in reactions to immigrants.

T1  - Racialized perceptions of the police: Measuring the dimensions of juveniles’ perceptions of the police
TT  - Racialized perceptions of the police
AN  - 2193210304
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to examine differences in latent structures/dimensions in public perceptions of the police by race/ethnicity and level of identification with a given race/ethnic group.Design/methodology/approachTo identify differences in dimensions of juveniles’ perceptions of the police by the sub-samples, factor analyses were conducted utilizing data from the Gang Resistance Education and Training program evaluation.FindingsThe results show that minority juveniles have a relatively fragmented dimensional structure for the construct of perceptions of the police, while white juveniles have a unidimensional structure. Furthermore, moderate within-group differences in structures were found among African–American juveniles.Research limitations/implicationsThe results of the current study call for further examination of racial invariant assumptions in criminology. Since individual dimensions constituting perceptions of the police vary by race/ethnicity, those dimensions may potentially have unique associations with endogenous variables (e.g. criminality and cooperation with the police) according to individuals’ racial/ethnic membership.Practical implicationsPolice should clearly understand individuals’ dimensions constituting perceptions of the police and should identify dimensions that greatly impact precursors to compliance and cooperation with police such as perceived police legitimacy or perceived risk of sanction.Originality/valueIndividuals’ dimensions constituting perceptions of the police have significant implications on the construction of measures and their associations with other variables; however, racial differences in these dimensions have not been explored since Sullivan et al.’s (1987) research about three decades ago. In addition, the current study examined within-race differences in the dimensions constituting perceptions of the police.

T1  - Correlates of Substance Use Abstinence and Non-Abstinence Among High School Seniors: Results From the 2014 Monitoring the Future Survey
AN  - 2253914097
AB  - Several risk and protective factors are influential in predicting who uses or abstains from illicit substances during the high school years. The 2014 national cohort data from the Monitoring the Future survey shows the demographics, psychosocial factors, and attitudes regarding substance use that predict abstention by twelfth-graders (versus those who report any lifetime use of any illicit drugs). Being older, having a higher rate of sensation-seeking behaviors, perceiving drugs as easy to obtain, and participation of some social activities were associated with a lower rate of abstention. In contrast, being optimistic, involvement in school activities, perceiving drug and alcohol use as high risk, believing their peers disapprove of substance use, and personally disapproving of substance use were associated with greater abstention from lifetime substance use. A similar model including negative attitudes and experiences (nonuse-related) with marijuana was associated with a greater likelihood to abstain from substances. We examine possible explanations and prevention implications of these findings and discuss the role of abstention in post-high school substance use risks.

T1  - A prospective, longitudinal cohort study: The impact of child maltreatment on delinquency among South Korean youth in middle and high school
AN  - 2179665026
AB  - Background: Cultural groups vary in how they understand child maltreatment and children's misbehavior and these cultural variations may impact the relationship between maltreatment and delinquency. Objective: This study investigated the impact of maltreatment on delinquency among South Korean youth. Participants and Setting: Using Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey data, this study followed two cohorts of middle (n = 2,275) and high (n = 2,272) school youth for their first self-reported delinquency over 4 years. Method: Discrete-time hazard model was used for the analyses. Results: Approximately 19% of middle and 11% of high school youth engaged in delinquency for 4 years. Maltreatment is associated with delinquency only for high school youth (HR = 1.42). In both cohorts, male youth with high levels of aggression were more likely to engage in delinquency. Additional risk factors included high levels of depression (HR = 1.36) and negative attitudes toward school rules (HR = 0.68), father's education less than high school (HR = 0.63), low levels of self-control (HR = 0.63). Findings also identified culturally unique factors that place Korean youth at heightened risk of delinquency: mother's education more than high school (HR = 1.49) and higher family income (HR = 1.93). Conclusion: Preventive interventions need to identify culturally specific risk factors for youth at increased risk of delinquency and thus these preventive interventions should be culturally tailored.

T1  - Teachers’ intentions to report suspected child abuse: the influence of compassion fatigue
AN  - 2333839424
AB  - Teachers are legally mandated to report suspected child abuse – a role that positions teachers as crucial figures in the detection and prevention of child abuse. It is, thus, important to explore underlying determinants of teachers’ likelihood to report suspected child abuse. In this research, we explore teachers’ and school administrators’ (N = 299) knowledge of abuse reporting policy and their self-reported intentions to report hypothetical instances of suspected child abuse. We also explore the relationship between compassion fatigue (i.e., job burnout and secondary traumatic stress stemming from vicarious exposure to client trauma) and teachers’ attitudes toward reporting suspected child abuse. A significant minority of teachers indicate that they would not report suspected child abuse – a finding that holds even after eliminating the 10.3% of teachers who were unaware of policy requiring teachers to report suspected child abuse. Supporting hypotheses, as compassion fatigue increased, negative attitudes toward child abuse reporting significantly increased. Additionally, increased compassion fatigue was significantly associated with increased job efficacy cynicism, psychological detachment from students, and diminished knowledge about reporting child abuse – all factors that statistically explained the relationship between compassion fatigue and negative attitudes toward reporting suspected abuse.

T1  - Cross-Ethnic Self-Disclosure Buffering Negative Impacts of Prejudice on International Students' Psychological and Social Well-Being
AN  - 2188843694
AB  - Intergroup contact theory suggests that developing a close relationship with outgroup members ameliorates the negative impact of prejudice that individuals perceive from outgroup members. This article specifically investigates the moderating role of cross-ethnic self-disclosure in the link between international students' perceived ethnic/racial prejudice and depression as well as loneliness. One hundred and forty-three international students in Japan were asked to rate their perceived prejudice, depression, and loneliness as well as their self-disclosure to host nationals. The results showed that self-disclosure buffers the negative effects of prejudice on depression and loneliness such that international students who were more likely to disclose themselves to host nationals were less likely to be influenced by prejudice. Theoretical and practical contributions are considered.

In Greece, lesbians are not allowed access to in vitro fertilisation (IVF), while a solitary ('single') woman is allowed access for medical reasons. Fifty-nine (59) semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with women. What emerged from our data was a clear trend for participants to wish to have their own biological children based mostly on the belief that pregnancy would lead to a sense of self-completeness and/or fulfilment. Women also reported the negative impact of prejudice and social oppression on their reproductive autonomy. Interviewees reported that their reproductive choices were negatively influenced by their family and the wider socio-cultural environment. Even within a semi-permissive legal framework, impaired social acceptance of lesbian parenthood prohibits lesbians from becoming mothers. A major reason responsible for the positive attitude of most participants to shared biological motherhood was an altruistic attitude towards their partners.

T1  - The emotional costs of computers: an expectancy-value theory analysis of predominantly low-socioeconomic status minority students' STEM attitudes
AN  - 2116068275
AB  - There is a strong push to increase American students' interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematic (STEM) careers. However, minority and female students remain underrepresented in the STEM fields. Therefore, it is essential that we continue to examine the potential factors that both incite and dissuade STEM interest. We apply Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) to examine STEM attitudes of predominantly low-socioeconomic status minority elementary school students over the course of a computing intervention. Furthermore, we integrate the digital inequality mental access conceptualization of 'emotional costs' into the EVT model in order to predict students' negative STEM attitudes. Data are from a large-scale computing intervention that took place in a primarily minority, high poverty, urban elementary school district located in the southeastern USA. Results indicate that positive expectancies for success and subjective task values predict students' positive STEM attitudes. Emotional costs toward technology primarily predict negative STEM attitudes. Students' expectancies/values and emotional costs may have a 'push-and-pull' effect on the formation of STEM attitudes. This study successfully links digital disparities to STEM disparities by integrating the digital inequality concept of emotional costs. Practically, we conclude that future computing interventions should increase students' academic-related expectancies and values while also minimizing their emotional costs in order to address both digital and STEM inequalities. Theoretically, we conclude that broad conceptualizations of emotional costs should be included in future studies to help explain negative attitudes/motivations toward STEM-related topics.

T1  - The geography of anti-immigrant attitudes across Europe, 2002-2014
AN  - 2120084543
AB  - Europe has become a major destination for international migrants. By 2015, 34.3 million people living in an EU member state were born outside of the EU-28, and an additional 18.5 million persons had been born in another EU country than the one currently residing in. In this context of a growing foreign-born population, which is now at about 10% of the total European population, xenophobic attitudes against immigrants are generally perceived as having increased over the past decade across Europe. This study explores the extent to which anti-immigrant hostility is spatially dependent and has spread geographically across European regions of that period. Based on data from seven rounds (2002-2014) of the European Social Survey, analysed at sub-national (NUTS 2 regions) levels, we identify a significant spatial connectivity of anti-immigrant attitudes by showing that spatially more proximate European regions share similar in trends in anti-immigrant sentiments than we observe between more distant regions. The identification of a spatially dependent diffusion and clustering process of anti-immigrant attitudes has a significant bearing for the understanding of the rise and fall of populist movements across Europe and changing electoral support for xenophobic parties across European regions over time.

T1  - Racial/ethnic socialization for White youth: What we know and future directions
AN  - 2178949687
AB  - Teaching and talking about race and ethnicity with children and adults is especially important in racially diverse societies. This process has been coined racial/ethnic socialization (RES). Despite the importance of RES, we still know very little about how this process unfolds in the lives of White youth. Thus, from a social, cognitive, and developmental perspective, the authors summarize findings from empirical research and theory on RES for White youth across stages of development-early childhood through young adulthood. Since RES is linked with cross-group attitudes (e.g., less bias, prejudice, stereotyping) and behaviors (e.g., inclusion), we highlight future directions for research and discuss applications for existing findings for an increasingly diverse society.

T1  - Understanding the dynamics among acculturative stress, coping, and growth: A grounded theory of the Korean immigrant adolescent experience
AN  - 2167806469
AB  - The purpose of the present study is two-fold. First, it aims to develop a theoretical model of the acculturative process of immigrant adolescents based on the understanding of the relationships among acculturative stress, coping, and growth. Second, it aims to propose a typology that offers distinct patterns in the process of acculturation and the resulting outcomes. Using the grounded theory method, the study identified stress related to communication problems, ethnic prejudice, academic pressure, homesickness, and interpersonal conflict. The lack of social support and the school climate were identified as contextual factors of perceived stress. Peer mediation and motivation were identified as intervention factors of coping behaviors. The immigrant adolescent coping behaviors included media use for emotional release, focus on a goal, connectedness to the home country, and the creation of social capital in the host country. The typology of different acculturative patterns classified immigrant adolescents into three types: adaptive, academic, and competent. Based on the findings, the significance of family functioning, peer mediation, self-expansion motivation, and coping behaviors to create social capital for immigrant adolescents' normal development was discussed.

T1  - Culturally aware but not yet ready to teach the “others”
AN  - 2151179051
AB  - PurposeIn this paper, the authors focus on a professional development programme in Cyprus aiming to enhance teachers’ intercultural understanding, awareness and competencies. This paper aims to focus on trainers’ and teacher trainees’ reflections upon a teacher professional development programme in the primary school in Cyprus with the largest number of Roma children.Design/methodology/approachThe training was provided by a small team of six trainers. Immediately after each training session, each trainer participated in an interview, while three of the trainers participated also in a focus-group interview at the end of the training. The trainers’ data were complemented by semi-structured interviews with a number of trainees either before or after the training. All interviews were transcribed, while interview questions comprised the framework for the qualitative analysis. The findings are presented by means of content analysis which formed the basis for emerging themes.FindingsThe authors claim that trainee teachers appeared culturally aware and sensitive, as well as knowledgeable about intercultural education; furthermore, they seemed to implement different teaching methodologies and curriculum interventions to support Roma children’s inclusion in the local school community. At the same time, they seemed to adopt instrumental approaches towards the content and purpose of the programme, seeking explicit instructional guidelines, plans and heuristics to deal with Roma inclusion. Considering the mis-recognition of teachers’ efforts by stakeholders outside the school and the expectations of the educational authorities – voiced via their school inspectors – teachers desperately asserted the need for tangible strategies to help them cope with difference in their classrooms.Research limitations/implicationsThe authors argue that such professional development programmes should aim at facing, deconstructing and bringing to the fore prejudices and discrimination against the Other/s by valuing teachers, first, as reflective individuals and, second, as professionals with their own cultural backgrounds and identities, on which any training programme, of the kind presented in this paper, could start from and build on.Practical implicationsEven though there is no tailored magic recipe to make teachers’ daily professional enterprise in multicultural settings easy, to help teachers master the necessary knowledge, skills and confidence, the authors suggest that training should be directly linked to classroom practice and acknowledge stress and helplessness that accompany work in multicultural school settings.Social implicationsThe inclusion strategy in many educational systems needs to become more comprehensive to cope with varying sources of social exclusion, faced by vulnerable groups of a different cultural background, such as Roma. Teacher training thus needs to meet the challenges of working in a diverse and multicultural environment in general and with Roma children in particular. In view of the multicultural character of local societies, a more critically oriented humanistic education is needed based on tolerance and understanding.Originality/valueThe limited participation of Roma in the school system could be related to teachers’ (mis)conceptions about the Roma culture and that the widely different ways in which Roma relate to schooling are often disregarded by the school.

T1  - Implications of female genital mutilation on girls' education and psychological wellbeing in Tarime, Tanzania
AN  - 2083993756
AB  - Though female genital mutilation is widely practiced in Tanzania, there has been no systematic examination of its long-term implications on girls' wellbeing. Employing interviews and focus group discussions, this study explored the implications of female genital mutilation (FGM) on girls' wellbeing in Tarime, Tanzania. The results revealed that the effect of FGM on girls are multifaceted, including early marriages, parents' negative attitudes towards girls' education, girls' change in attitudes and loss of interest in schooling, which lead to poor educational achievement in many ways. Notably, girls who manage to escape FGM suffer from isolation and stigma from their peers who have been circumcised. Arguably, FGM is both a protective and risk factor for girls in Tarime. FGM is a protective factor against stigma and isolation for circumcised girls, and it is a risk factor in denying circumcised girls' opportunities for education, and in perpetuating stigmatisation for the uncircumcised girls. We have concluded that, in the absence of more positive alternative rites of passage for adolescent girls in Tarime, and despite the widespread awareness about its negative consequences, FGM is likely to continue due to its centrality in the Kuryan cultural, social and economic necessities.

T1  - Men’s and Women’s Gender-Role Attitudes across the Transition to Parenthood: Accounting for Child’s Gender
AN  - 2427333037
AB  - Gender-role attitudes capture individuals’ degree of support for traditional divisions of paid and domestic work and have been linked to the production and reproduction of gender inequality in different social spheres. Previous research has established that life-course transitions are related to within-individual over-time change in gender-role attitudes. Most importantly, becoming a parent is associated with shifts toward more traditional viewpoints. Theories of attitude change suggest that the gender of children should influence the pattern of gender-attitude shifts that accompany parenthood, but very few studies have investigated this. We add to this literature using Australian panel data from the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey (n = 29,918 observations) stretching over 15 years and fixed-effects panel regression models. We find that men’s and women’s gender-role attitudes become more traditional when they become parents, with evidence that this process is more pronounced among men, parents of daughters and, most of all, male parents of daughters.

T1  - 'These War Dramas are like Cartoons': Education, Media Consumption, and Chinese Youth Attitudes Towards Japan
AN  - 2082819375
AB  - The growing prevalence of foreign media consumption, including from Japan, has received considerable notice in recent work on PRC youth culture. To date, however, few studies have considered how youth of different social backgrounds perceive their consumption of Japanese popular culture in the context of the Party-state's 'patriotic education' campaign waged in schools and in the mass media. Studies have also overlooked how rural and urban youth in China juxtapose the images and themes conveyed in the Japanese media that they consume with school and domestic media messages. Drawing on interviews with middle school students in Shanghai and Henan, the present study addresses these issues. It finds that while a majority of youths from different backgrounds express animosity toward Japan, they separate these feelings from their passion for Japanese popular culture. In some cases, consumption of Japanese media also allows teenagers to feel that they 'know'-or even appreciate-the other country better. Amid the anti-Japanese messages currently circulating in PRC schools and domestic media, consumption of Japanese popular culture manifests a form of 'expressive individualism' among teenagers, who creatively construct their own notions of patriotism, national memory, and Sino-Japanese relations.

T1  - Secondary transfer effect among children: The role of social dominance orientation and outgroup attitudes
AN  - 2064683830
AB  - Research has provided evidence that the effects of intergroup contact on prejudice reduction are not limited to the outgroup one has contact with (primary outgroup). Rather, they extend to secondary outgroups uninvolved in the contact situation (secondary transfer effect; Pettigrew, 2009, Social Psychology, 40, 55). We aimed to provide the first empirical evidence for the emergence of the secondary transfer effect among children. Majority (Italian) and minority (with an immigrant background) elementary schoolchildren were administered a questionnaire including measures of contact with the primary outgroup (minority children for the majority, majority children for the minority), prejudice towards the primary outgroup and towards a dissimilar secondary outgroup (disabled children), and social dominance orientation. Results revealed that among the majority group, contact with the primary outgroup had indirect associations with reduced prejudice towards the secondary outgroup. Specifically, we found evidence for sequential mediation by social dominance orientation and prejudice towards the primary outgroup. No secondary transfer effects emerged among minority group members. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of the findings, arguing for the importance of identifying the core processes driving the secondary transfer effect.

T1  - Improving outgroup attitudes in schools: A meta-analytic review
AN  - 2055207508
AB  - To provide information for educators, educational psychologists, school psychologists, and social psychologists, we conducted a quantitative meta-analytic test of n = 50 studies dating from 1995 to 2015 that evaluated the effects of in-school interventions on attitudes toward outgroup members (defined as members of different ethnic or religious backgrounds or different age groups, persons with either physical or mental disabilities, or persons with other distinctive features). Overall, the analysis revealed a mean effect size of d + = 0.36 with a 95% confidence interval that ranged from 0.17 to 0.55, indicating significant, moderate intervention effects, supporting the proposition that meaningful changes in outgroup attitudes can be obtained by applying anti-bias programs in schools. Results from our analysis did not provide evidence that teacher-led interventions produce positive outcomes, yet we found that interventions delivered by researchers promote positive attitudes toward outgroup members. Further, a closer examination demonstrated that one-on-one interventions are most effective at tackling intergroup attitudes. However, classroom-wide programs are more likely to be introduced into regular school activities because of their efficiency and the limited resources available for interventions.

T1  - Initial prejudices create cross-generational intergroup mistrust
AN  - 2030877949
AB  - The present investigation modeled the emergence and persistence of intergroup bias and discrimination in artificial societies. Initial unfair prejudices held by members of a dominant group elicit confirmatory behavior (diminished cooperation) from members of a subordinate group via a self-fulfilling prophecy. Further, when individual learning is tempered by conformity to peers, inaccurate beliefs about the stigmatized subordinate group persist long-term. Even completely replacing dominant group members with enlightened individuals through generational change is inadequate to break the cycle of intergroup distrust and non-collaboration. The longer the enlightenment of a society is delayed, the more intergroup trust is irretrievably lost.

T1  - Are allies who we think they are?: A comparative analysis
AN  - 2025458638
AB  - Although dominant group allies have been increasingly studied by social psychologists interested in positive intergroup relations and the promotion of social justice, most of the existing research focuses on self‐identified allies or dominant group individuals who are engaging in social justice activities. Little comparative work has examined white allies who were specifically identified as such by people of color. Two studies assessed qualities associated with affirming attitudes (low prejudice, high internal motivation to respond without prejudice, allophilia, and awareness of privilege) and informed action (activism) expected to be distinctively characteristic of allies. Nominated white allies in Study 1 had lower prejudice and higher levels of internal motivation to respond without prejudice than nonnominated white participants; this was replicated in Study 2, which compared nominated “allies” and “friends.” In Study 2, nominated white allies rated themselves as lower on prejudice than nominated white friends. They also scored higher on internal motivation to respond without prejudice, understanding of white privilege, and activism than nominated white friends. There were no differences on self‐reported allophilia between the two groups. Allies were rated by the people of color who nominated them as higher on qualities of outgroup affirmation and informed action than were nominated friends. Limitations of and implications for these findings are discussed.

T1  - What Do You Fear? Anti-immigrant Sentiment in Latin America: IMR
AN  - 2157490189
AB  - In this article, we study the material determinants of anti-immigrant sentiment in Latin America. Based on new data on immigration to non-Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, we use the workhorse distributive theories that anticipate who wins and who loses from immigration and test their predictive capacity in labor-abundant countries. We exploit the variation in regional immigration rates, in the skill composition of natives versus migrants, and in the relative generosity of Latin American welfare states. We find that fears of labor-market competition are weak predictors of anti-immigrant sentiment. In contrast, fears of greater tax burdens are strong and robust predictors of anti-immigrant sentiment. We conclude that studying Latin American public opinion opens new avenues for theorizing about anti-immigrant sentiment in developing countries.

T1  - From segregation to intergroup contact and back: Using experiments and simulation to understand the bidirectional link
AN  - 1993908771
AB  - Research on intergroup contact has mostly viewed desegregation as a necessary condition for contact to unfold its power to reduce prejudice. Through residential and school choices, however, prejudice also contributes to segregation. To shed light on this bidirectional link, we conducted two survey-based experiments with stratified quota samples of German adults. In Study 1, respondents with less contact and more prejudice indicated a lower likelihood of renting an apartment in a neighborhood with a larger proportion of minority members, although housing quality and crime rate were held constant. In Study 2, similar results were obtained for the likelihood of enrolling their child at a school with a larger proportion of minority students. Building on these results in a computer simulation, we find that because contact only reduces prejudice, but does not produce pro-minority preferences, spontaneous desegregation is unlikely to occur even under the most favorable structural and economic conditions.

T1  - Reducing Turkish Cypriot children's prejudice toward Greek Cypriots: Vicarious and extended intergroup contact through storytelling: GPIR
AN  - 1980712730
AB  - Two studies investigated the effectiveness of intergroup contact in Turkish Cypriot children with the aim of improving attitudes, intentions, and trust toward Greek Cypriots. In the first study, we found that positive contact and positive family storytelling were associated with more positive outgroup attitudes and intended outgroup behavior in a group of 6- to 12-year-old Turkish Cypriots. We followed this up in Study 2 by using a vicarious intergroup contact intervention technique. Turkish Cypriot children aged 6-11 years took part in a 3-week intervention involving reading stories of solidarity between Turkish and Greek Cypriot children. Results showed that the intervention worked to improve outgroup attitudes, intended behavior, and outgroup trust. These findings suggest that indirect contact techniques such as extended contact and vicarious intergroup contact can be used as prejudice-reduction tools in intractable conflict zones, most in need of such interventions.

T1  - The grace of motherhood: disabled women contending with societal denial of intimacy, pregnancy, and motherhood in Ethiopia
AN  - 2059550687
AB  - This study aimed to provide better understanding of intimacy and marriage, pregnancy, birth, and motherhood experiences of women with disability in Ethiopia. Qualitative, in-depth, and semi-structured interviews along with personal observations were used to explore the full experiences of participants, as told in their own words. The result of the interviews indicated that relationships and motherhood proved a very rewarding option for women with disabilities. They also expressed their need for intimacy regardless of society's denial. Challenges identified include negative societal attitudes toward women with disabilities regarding relationship, pregnancy, and child-rearing. Accessibility of health centers in addition to the ignorance and negative attitudes of the physicians are also reported to be major challenges for the interviewees. This study highlights how rewarding the experience of motherhood was for the interviewees and also shows that women with disabilities face challenges at every step of their experiences, because of society's prejudices toward disability.

T1  - Misinformation About HIV and Negative Attitudes Toward Homosexuality and Same-Sex Couples’ Rights: The Case of Colombia
AN  - 2506669175
AB  - The rights of homosexuals and same-sex couples are currently the subject of debate on the public stage and in courtrooms around the world. This debate is often colored by prejudice and misconceptions regarding homosexuality, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This study investigates the opinions of Colombian women about same-sex couples’ rights and women’s attitudes toward a homosexual child (maternal acceptance). Using a nationally representative data set, we find that that younger, wealthier, and more educated Colombian women are more likely to support their homosexual child and approve of same-sex couples’ rights, while women with misconceptions regarding the human immunodeficiency virus and homosexuality are less likely to be supportive of a homosexual child and less likely to approve of same-sex couples’ rights.The rights of homosexuals and same-sex couples are currently the subject of debate on the public stage and in courtrooms around the world (Becker, 2012; van...

T1  - Islamophobia: What Teachers Can Do To Reduce It in the Classroom
AN  - 2007680714
AB  - The year 2017 marked the sixteenth year anniversary of the destruction of the World Trade Center, the worst domestic attack in US history. The global environment has been very different since Sep 11, 2001. Prior to that date, terms such as terrorism, terroristic actions, and Islamophobia were not commonly heard. The world environment has changed greatly since then. Now people all over the world are continually on edge. When considering a dictionary definition of Islamophobia, the Oxford Dictionary states it as a "dislike of, or prejudice against, Islam or Muslims, especially as a political force." Islamophobia is not only focused on Islam or Muslims, but also on anyone "who may appear to be Muslim". Here, Hossain addressing the issue of Islamophobia from pre-school to college classrooms.

T1  - Gender Roles in the Arab World: Development and Psychometric Properties of the Arab Adolescents Gender Roles Attitude Scale
AN  - 1917822689
AB  - Scant research has been conducted on gender in the Arab world; one explanation is due to a lack of Arabic measures on gender-related issues. To advance scientific work on gender in the Arab world, we developed the Arab Adolescents Gender Roles Attitude Scale (AAGRAS), the first known reliable and valid Arabic measure of gender-role attitudes. To develop this measure, we conducted two studies based on data collected from 776 high school students 15-19 years-old from the state of Qatar. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis produced 12 items divided equally into two subscales. One subscale assesses traditional gender-role attitudes, whereas the other measures egalitarian gender-role attitudes. Our findings indicate that young men are more likely to resist gender equality than young women are. Moreover, those who hold traditional attitudes are more likely to disapprove of women occupying positions of authority. The AAGRAS is a useful assessment tool that policymakers, researchers, practitioners, and educators can use to study gender-role attitudes in the Arab world and to develop educational and intervention programs that encourage adolescents to identify, confront, and avoid prejudice and discrimination against women and ultimately adopt more egalitarian gender roles.

T1  - The Patriotism of Gentlemen with Red Hair: European Jews and the Liberal State, 1789-1939
AN  - 1899810399
AB  - European Jewish history from 1789-1939 supports the view that construction of national identities even in secular liberal states was determined not only by modern considerations alone but also by ancient patterns of thought, behaviour and prejudice. Emancipation stimulated unprecedented patriotism, especially in wartime, as Jews strove to prove loyalty to their countries of citizenship. During World War I, even Zionists split along national lines, as did families and friends. Jewish patriotism was interchangeable with nationalism inasmuch as Jews identified themselves with national cultures. Although emancipation implied acceptance and an end to anti-Jewish prejudice in the modern liberal state, the kaleidoscopic variety of Jewish patriotism throughout Europe inadvertently undermined the idea of national identity and often provoked anti-Semitism. Even as loyal citizens of separate states, the Jews, however scattered, disunited and diverse, were made to feel, often unwillingly, that they were one people in exile.

T1  - ATTITUDE OF EDUCATED URBAN YOUTH TOWARDS RAPE MYTHS
AN  - 1916318067
AB  - Pakistan, being a signatory to almost all international conventions on human rights, stands committed to ending violence against women. Additionally, various national progressive legislation and policies for the protection of women' rights have been initiated during the last couple of years, but the statistics of cases of violence against women in Pakistan are bothersome. Women enduring this agony and mortifying experience may have to face all sorts of negative attitudes of people around them. This study investigated gender differences among university students in their perceptions towards rape myths about female rape victims. Students' perceptions were measured using the indigenous Rape Myth Scale by collecting data from 385 students from the three universities of Lahore. Additionally, information about the demographics of students regarding academic disciplines, residential areas and socio-economic backgrounds of families were also collected. Data was analyzed by using the t-test and ANOVA. The results revealed a significant gender difference in the perception of respondents, all of whom were educated about rape myths. Male students were found to believe more strongly that a woman's willingness is present in rape, women's strong character would prevent them from getting raped, and women's behaviour and dress attracted rapists. Furthermore, the results indicated that academic discipline, residential city and parental socioeconomic background of students were found to play an influential part in determining their perceptions towards rape myths. The findings imply a need to incorporate a gender-sensitive education programme as a part of the curriculum across disciplines at the university level, in order to nurture gender sensitization in society. In this regard, parents, teachers and media, along with policymakers, can play a meaningful role in curbing the incidence of rape by transforming the social mindset of blaming the rape sufferer.

T1  - Whose family fits? Categorization and evaluation of same-sex and cross-race-parent families: GPIR
AN  - 1854784978
AB  - As family structures diversify, attitudes towards "nontraditional" families (e.g., same-sex-parent and cross-race families) appear to be becoming more favorable. Despite more favorable attitudes, we propose that explicitly and implicitly people view nontraditional families as less family-like than traditional (i.e., heterosexual, same-race) families. We also propose that people will hold the behavior of nontraditional (vs. traditional) families to higher standards. In Study 1, participants explicitly rated nontraditional (vs. traditional) family photos as less family-like and as less loving. In Study 2, using a reaction-time measure, participants took longer to correctly categorize nontraditional (vs. traditional) families into the family category, suggesting that at an implicit level people have greater difficulty recognizing nontraditional families as "family." In Studies 3 and 4, ambiguous (i.e., positive and negative) behavior licensed more harsh evaluations of a nontraditional family--but did not affect evaluations of a traditional family--relative to learning only positive family behavior. Despite survey data that suggest that people's views of nontraditional families are becoming more favorable, our evidence indicates that people nonetheless harbor prejudice against certain family structures. Beyond documenting two biases against nontraditional families, this work highlights the need for prejudice researchers to examine meaningful levels of social identity, such as family units, that are intermediate between individuals and broad social classes.

T1  - Living together in multi-ethnic cities: People of migrant background, their interethnic friendships and the neighbourhood
AN  - 1854783733
AB  - This paper explores the extent to which people of different origins, natives and migrants, come together in everyday life in Europe. Instead of looking at overall 'perceptions' and 'stances', which are context-dependent and mediated through political-ideological currents and discourses as well as broader patterns of prejudice, we focus on sustained close contacts that suggest meaningful and organic relationships. Since it is most often people of migrant background who are blamed for leading 'parallel lives' and 'not integrating', we chose to focus on them and their interethnic friendships. Moreover, we seek to understand the relevance and role of the neighbourhood context in the development of those relationships. Despite the expressive fears in public discourses about the supposed negative impact of the presence of immigrants and ethnic minorities on social cohesion, our findings indicate that close interethnic relationships are not uncommon in diverse European cities. They further highlight that the neighbourhood context plays an important role in the first years of migrants' settlement. Relationships in the neighbourhood develop in less formal social settings and are also less demanding in terms of host-country cultural skills on the part of the migrants, thus giving the opportunity to newcomers to develop close interethnic relationships with natives. Finally, the analysis supports the positive role of diversity at the neighbourhood level in the development of interethnic friendships and stresses the importance of the neighbourhood's socio-spatial characteristics and its location in the wider urban net.

T1  - Student-parent attitudes toward Filipino migrant teachers in Indonesia
AN  - 1907275679
AB  - Using ethnographic data gleaned from a foreign-managed Christian school in Indonesia, this article situates the ethnic prejudices of Indonesian Chinese parents and students toward Filipino teachers within the organizational and cultural politics of private schooling. It is argued that the commoditization of education as a form of market consumption alongside the masculinized international curriculum help shape the feminization of teachers from the Philippines. Catering to the aspirations of the country's minority ethnic Chinese, privately managed schools actively recruit trained teachers from the Philippines, many of whom are female and are perceived by students and their parents as exhibiting negative symbolic capital. In the process of their employment, they encounter occasional moments of less than complete success and challenges in their jobs. This article situates this prejudice within the cultural politics of masculinized Chinese schooling in Indonesia, while seeking to shed light on the role of Filipino work migrancy in Indonesia's formal employment sector.

T1  - Judged by the Company You Keep? Exposure to Nonprejudiced Norms Reduces Concerns About Being Misidentified as Gay/Lesbian
AN  - 1837634981
AB  - Social contagion concerns, heterosexuals' fears about being misidentified as gay/lesbian, can lead to avoidant and hostile responses toward gay men/lesbians. We argue that apprehension about becoming the target of prejudice if misidentified as gay/lesbian contributes to contagion concerns. We hypothesized that exposing heterosexuals to others' nonprejudiced attitudes would reduce their contagion concerns. Consistent with these predictions, perceptions of peer prejudice statistically predicted contagion concerns, over and above personal prejudice (Study 1). In addition, participants exposed to a nonprejudiced versus a high-prejudiced norm (or control condition) expressed lower contagion concerns and less anxious/avoidant responses toward gay men/lesbians (Studies 2 and 4). Finally, exposure to fellow students' nonprejudiced views resulted in lower contagion concerns than a control group (Study 3) due to decreased concerns about becoming the target of prejudice if misidentified as gay/lesbian (Study 4). These results provide evidence that changing perceptions of others' prejudice can reduce contagion concerns.

T1  - Cultural Identification and Religious Identification Contribute Differentially to the Adaptation of Australian Adolescent Muslims
AN  - 1821766187
AB  - Australian Muslims are generally perceived as a devalued group in Australia and the public attitudes towards them are generally negative. This context raises questions about belonging and adaptation among Australian adolescent Muslims. The current study investigated how adolescent Muslims relate to their heritage culture, religion, and Australian culture, and which of these three factors is most important to adolescent Muslims' psychological and socio-cultural adaptation. The study employed a mixed-method design. A total of 321 high school Muslim students (149 males and 172 females) aged between 14 and 18 years completed self-report questionnaires, and a subset sample of 18 students in the same age range, evenly split between males and females, participated in semi-structured interviews. The study revealed a hierarchical pattern of identification among Australian adolescent Muslims, with attachment to their religion being the most important, followed by heritage culture identification and being Australian in third place. Australian adolescent Muslims' religious identification was perceived overall as more crucial to their socio-cultural and psychological adaptation, than their heritage culture identification or Australian identification. There was an overall modest contribution of Australian identification to adolescent Muslims' adaptation. This might be connected with the relatively less attachment they show to their Australian identity due maybe to perception of being the target of prejudice, an issue that can be addressed by implementation of prejudice reduction strategies.

T1  - Don't judge a living book by its cover: effectiveness of the living library intervention in reducing prejudice toward Roma and LGBT people
AN  - 1817003843
AB  - In Hungary, prejudices toward Roma and the LGBT community are highly salient and explicit in public opinion, the media, and in the political discourse. The present study examined the effectiveness of the Living Library prejudice reduction intervention--in which participants as "Readers" have engaging contact with living "Books" who are trained volunteers from the Roma and LGBT communities. In a pre-post intervention study with high school students (N=105), results suggest that the Living Library intervention reduced participants' scores on multiple measures of prejudice. The Living Library intervention appeared to be effective among both those participants whose friends endorsed prejudice or more tolerant attitudes toward Roma and LGBT people. In sum, Living Library appears to be a useful method for reducing prejudice in contexts which are characterized by strong negative attitudes toward these different groups.

T1  - Preference and prejudice: Does intermarriage erode negative ethno-racial attitudes between groups in Spain?
AN  - 1802366685
AB  - This paper challenges the idea - rooted in classic assimilation theory - that intermarriage clearly erodes social and ethno-racial boundaries and negative attitudes between groups. Drawing on narratives from 58 immigrants of seven different origin countries residing in Catalonia, Spain, who are in romantic partnerships with Spanish-born people, we focus on preferences and prejudices related to mixing. We find that the members of exogamous couples both suffer social discrimination regarding the crossing of ethnocultural borders, particularly from their respective family members - a rejection that is based on negative stereotypes and preconceptions linked to the partner's origin, phenotype or ethnocultural characteristics, such as religion, in intersection with gender. More significantly, we also find that ethno-racial prejudices (particularly when referring to marriage preferences for the respondents and their children) and discriminatory attitudes (towards one's own and other immigrant minority groups) also exist among intermarried couples themselves. In sum, we question the role of mixed unions as a diluter of differences and an accelerator of integration.

T1  - Symbolic boundaries, incorporation policies, and anti-immigrant attitudes: what drives exclusionary policy preferences?
AN  - 1801902479
AB  - This research empirically approaches symbolic boundary making in the form of individual assent to selective immigration policy. Distinguishing two such types of boundaries, restriction based on immigrant skills and race/religion, we approach the antecedents of such preferences. Do economic or rather cultural concerns about immigration drive boundary making? We furthermore assess whether social boundaries in the form of integration and multicultural policies are of importance. The results obtained from the European Social Survey show that on the individual level, both forms of boundary making are mainly driven by cultural concerns. On the country level, net of several measures of diversity, integration policies dampen skill-related boundaries, while multicultural policies weaken the strength of cultural boundary making along race and religion. These findings expose the political embeddedness of processes of symbolic boundary making into the very policies that approach the respective type of boundary.

T1  - EXPLORING THE ROOTS OF PREJUDICE TOWARD ABORIGINAL PEOPLES IN CANADA
AN  - 1938073801
AB  - Limited attention has been devoted to examining why non-Aboriginal Canadians may harbour prejudicial attitudes toward Aboriginal peoples. The current study addressed this gap by employing a 2-part mixed-methods approach. In part 1, a questionnaire was administered to 192 non-Aboriginal undergraduate students attending a prairie Canadian university. Respondents who self-identified as white/Caucasian and obtained scores denotative of prejudice (i.e., above scale midpoints) were subsequently invited to participate in part 2, which consisted of a series of personal interviews (N = 13; 9 women, 4 men) that occurred either face-to-face or online (instant messaging). Using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), 3 broad themes were identified to represent participants' views and experiences relating to Aboriginal peoples. First, the socialization process emerged as a key contributor to participants' attitudes toward this group. Second, beliefs grounded in modem prejudice were frequently noted (e.g., Aboriginal peoples receive "special" treatment denied their white counterparts). Third, old-fashioned prejudice was evident (e.g., the belief that Aboriginal peoples possess intrinsic deficits and, thus, are culpable for the social problems they encounter). In addition to these three themes, certain communication patterns were observed, such as the use of disclaimers and qualifiers to ostensibly appear non-prejudiced. We propose that participants engage in surface-level evaluations of Aboriginal peoples. Further, their prejudice appears to partly be due to lack of awareness and understanding of concepts such as white privilege, the intergenerational effects of colonization, and institutional and structural factors that serve as obstacles to the socioeconomic advancement of Aboriginal peoples.Alternate abstract:On a accordé peu d'attention â la question suivante: pourquoi les canadiens allochtones éprouvent-ils des préjugés envers les canadiens autochtones? Cet article cherche â combler ce vide en faisant usage d'une analyse en deux parties. Dans la premiére, on a administré un questionnaire auprés de 192 étudiants de premier cycle dans une universitě canadienne des prairies. Les sujets se considerant de race blanche et dont les résultats indiquaient un niveau de préjugé anti-autochtone plus élévé que la moyenne furent invites å participer â la deuxiěme partie de ľenquéte, consistant en une série d'entrevues individuelles (les sujets -9 femmes, 4 hommes- pouvaient ce faire en personne ou via internet). Trois thěmes généraux se dégagent chez ces sujets en ce qui concerne leur vision des autochtones: en premier lieu, le processus de socialisation se révéle important pour ce qui est des attitudes des sujets envers les autochtones. En second lieu, on a souvent remarqué qu'il existait chez les sujets des croyances fondées sur des préjugés (ainsi, ceux soutenant que les autochtones recevraient des « traitements spéciaux » auxquels n'auraient pas droit leurs concitoyens blancs). En troisiéme Heu, des préjugés purs et simples étaient souvent flagrants (ainsi, on croyait que les autochtones souffrent de carences Innées et sont de ce fait responsables des problémes sociaux dont ils souffrent). Ä ces trois thěmes s'ajoutent certaines façons de communiquer, comme par exemple l'utilisation d'un vocabulaire servant â adoucir leur discours afin de ne pas paraÎtre raciste. Â nos yeux les sujets évaluaient les autochtones d'un point de vue superficiei. Qui plus est, leurs préjugés paraissent découler partiellement d'une ignorance et d'une incompréhension face â des concepts tels que le privilége racial des blancs, les effets de la colonisation transmis de generation en génération, et ľensemble des facteurs institutionnels et structuraux qui bloquent chez les autochtones les progrěs socio-économiques.

T1  - Learning and Teaching With Loss: Meeting the Needs of Refugee Children Through Narrative Inquiry
AN  - 1797264811
AB  - Providing refugee students with a safe and welcoming classroom environment is critical for school success but largely dependent on teachers' knowledge, values, practices, and attitudes. This qualitative study juxtaposes the experience of one refugee students' experience in the school system and one beginning teachers' experience in working with and meeting the psychosocial and educational needs of refugee students in the classroom. Using narrative inquiry, from the perspective of a refugee student and a beginning teacher, this study identifies themes and key issues related to teaching refugee students. These experiences are compared to the current literature on refugee education to highlight the beliefs and values that teachers bring to their practice. Findings reveal that there are gaps in beginning teachers' knowledge about who refugees are, their experiences, and how best to support them in the classroom. Some teachers also held negative attitudes and perspective of refugee students and failed to develop a nuanced perspective of diversity and multiculturalism. This study also shows how narrative inquiry, in the formal of a personal history account, can be used as tool to surface, challenge, and overcome negative stereotypes, biases, and assertions that prevent teachers from effectively supporting their students.

T1  - The Ever-Shifting Excuses for Demonizing Black People in America
AN  - 1800544259
AB  - Eric Garner is choked to death in Staten Island, New York. Michael Brown is executed in the streets of Ferguson, Missouri. Another year passes and many more unarmed Black men die at the hands of law enforcement. Brutality against people of African ancestry continues to be justified by the American establishment. As citizens, how do we make sense of the police killing of unarmed young Black men? How do we make sense of the ways in which these killings continue to be justified by the White establishment? How do we talk to a new generation of children in ways that will prevent the horrors of racial profiling against Black people from being replaced by White supremacist narratives of justification? This article examines the entrenched racism in a country that started with a Declaration of Independence written by slave-owners, and how so many White people of all ages, religions, classes, and regions can claim not being prejudiced against African Americans while, under the same breath, justifying the police killing of unarmed African American men. It criticizes the colorblind movement and proposes ways to move toward more powerful narratives of solidarity and redemption for the historical violence against Black people in America.

T1  - "All Lives Matter": The Cost of Colorblind Racial Attitudes in Diverse Social Networks
AN  - 1787037480
AB  - In this study, we examined the effects of colorblind racial attitudes and outgroup prejudice on people's social network positions within a diverse social setting. Sixty-four racially diverse participants created self-resembling avatars and interacted in groups of diverse peers in the virtual world, Second Life. We conducted a social network analysis based on friendships developed during the group interactions and also examined participants' physical distances in relation to outgroup members and levels of chat participation. Colorblind racial attitudes, but not outgroup prejudice, were directly related to lower levels of closeness centrality and clustering within the network. In addition, outgroup physical distance, but not chat participation, was found to be a behavioral mechanism that mediated the relationships between: 1) colorblind racial attitudes and closeness centrality; and 2) colorblind racial attitudes and clustering. Findings are discussed in relation to the adverse affects of colorblind racial attitudes on intergroup behavior and the pro-sociality of recognizing race and racism within increasingly diverse settings such as the workplace or educational settings.

T1  - Minority Identity Strategies Bound by Prejudice: Restricted Perspectives of People Categorized as Gypsies in Hungary
AN  - 1784567758
AB  - In this study, we explored the identity strategies of Hungarian Gypsies with different socialization backgrounds, including the degree of majority and minority identifications, the contents of Gypsy identity as well as coping with threatening social situations. Sampling was based on external social categorization: majority members were asked for contacts to Gypsy acquaintances. Questionnaire data were used to assess socialization background, group identification and preferred coping strategies at different levels, while contents of Gypsy identity were explored in an associative network. Results suggest that subjects make an exclusive choice between national and ethnic identities. While all subjects prefer ethnic identity, subjects with different socialization backgrounds follow different identity strategies. In sum, large-family subjects are emotionally attached to their ethnic group, avoid interaction with the majority and prefer the idea of a multicultural society. Small-family subjects are emotionally detached from their ethnic group and vote for a homogeneous society. Results are interpreted in terms of integration-related social policies. While these are aimed at the foundation of a recognized active minority, members of these new generations find the way of recognition in individual assimilation due to the threat of prejudice.

T1  - Silent professionalization: EU integration and the professional socialization of public officials in Central and Eastern Europe
AN  - 1790887763
AB  - This paper applies theories of international socialization to examine the impact of European Union contact on the professional socialization of public officials in Central and Eastern Europe. Based on a survey of officials in seven new member states, the paper finds that daily work on European Union issues is associated with favourable attitudes towards merit-based civil service governance. The distinction between types of European Union contact shows that officials dealing with 'reception'-related European Union activities such as the transposition and implementation of European Union policies develop more meritocratic attitudes. By contrast, 'projection'-related activities that involve personal contact with European Union officials have no effect. The paper concludes that the small but consistent impact of European Union contact on professional socialization promotes the silent professionalization of public administration in Central and Eastern Europe.

T1  - The impact of Islam and the public and political portrayals of Islam on child-rearing practices - Discursive analyses of parental accounts among Muslims living in Denmark
AN  - 1773275719
AB  - With the rise of Islamist terrorist attacks in the US and Europe the impact of Islam on child-rearing practices has become a matter of public attention and debate. Within the political discourse in the Western world and in the mass media, Muslims are often being portrayed negatively. Research has documented how Muslims living in the West are adversely affected by the negative portrayals of Islam associated with the War on Terror. The aim of the present study was to explore the impact of Islam on child-rearing practices and parental identity formation among self-identified Muslims in Denmark. Using a discursive approach to analyzing interviews with parents in 29 Middle Eastern refugee families, six rhetorical strategies were identified: (1) minimizing differences, (2) highlighting compatibility, (3) emphasizing positive aspects of Islam, (4) countering common prejudice, (5) actively distancing oneself from terrorists/extremists, and (6) separating Islam as a religion from cultural traditions. It is argued that the global as well as national political discourse post 9/11 is reflected in all of the six rhetorical strategies. Whether parents position themselves as having a high or low bicultural identity or a Muslim parental identity, their positioning involves drawing on the discursive resources from the mass media, the global and national political and public discourse. Furthermore, it is argued that all rhetorical strategies can be seen as attempts to counter the hurt associated with the negative portrayal of Islam.

T1  - Pride and Prejudice: Pervasiveness of Colorism and the Animated Series Proud Family
AN  - 1784150856
AB  - Issues of race and racism continue to be subjects of interest for media critique; however, the more subtle notion of colorism is often ignored in the examination of media texts. An analysis of the popular children's animated series Proud Family demonstrates that even in a context where a "traditional" African American family and positive community relations are shown, colorism is still prominent. Rather than being critiqued or challenged, kids' media is used to reinforce colorist ideals within the African American community. Attributes of wealth, beauty, and intelligence are applied to characters with Eurocentric phenotypic characteristics while deviance, stupidity, poverty and unattractiveness typify characters with more Afrocentric facial features.

T1  - Amaya: Dialogic Literary Gatherings Evoking Passion for Learning and a Transformation of the Relationships of a Roma Girl With Her Classmates
AN  - 1751005687
AB  - Roma girls are one of the most invisible social groups within the educational system. Beliefs derived from social prejudice and from nonscientific perspectives suggest that they have little motivation and willingness to learn. However, successful educational actions based on scientific evidence developed in many schools demonstrate a very different reality. This is the case of Amaya, a 12-year-old Roma girl who lives in the poorest neighborhood of Tarragona (Spain) and who has suffered bullying perpetrated by her classmates. However, in the Dialogic Literary Gatherings (DLGs), Amaya found a place to enjoy reading books such as Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet or Twain's Tom Sawyer. This pleasure led to a radical transformation in her classmates' perceptions of her as well as in her own perception of her abilities. Through Amaya's biography, the author explore how the DLGs become a space where children's desire to continue their studies are strengthened and future dreams, such as Amaya's aspiration to become a doctor, are shaped.

T1  - The religious affiliation and anti-Semitism of secondary school-age Swedish youths: an analysis of survey data from 2003 and 2009
AN  - 1722763432
AB  - Not only Swedish studies, but also several international studies, claim an increase in anti-Semitic attitudes in recent decades. As prejudice is acquired in the early years of socialization, and/or is innate and fairly stable over the life cycle, examining adolescents' attitudes is vitally important. Hence, by controlling for individual demographic and socio-economic background factors, we study two interrelated questions: Has anti-Semitism among Swedish secondary school-age youths changed between 2003 and 2009? Are changes equal across groups, with a specific focus on religious groups? Using two unique cross-section surveys of secondary school-age students in Sweden for the years 2003 and 2009, we try to address the above questions. Our analysis shows, in contrast to the views of the general public and other related studies, that anti-Semitism has decreased slightly during the examined period. Moreover, the study finds a variation in anti-Semitism by religious affiliation: it has increased among Muslim youth, but remains stable in other groups.

T1  - Thinking About the Poor: A Bibliographical Essay
AN  - 1684424746; 201518707
AB  - The lower classes smell,' Eric Blair's parents taught him as a child. The lesson stuck: By the time he recounted it in The Road to Wigan Pier (1937), the writer who became known to the world as George Orwell had lived as a tramp in metropolitan London and worked as a dishwasher in Paris. (In fact, he wrote under that pen name to save his family the embarrassment of being related to someone who had gone slumming.) Yet Orwell still discerned within himself and his fellow socialists the workings of that prejudice. To the better off, Orwell knew, poverty was not only the lack of money; it also signified something repugnant, even a moral failing. So while he spent the first half of The Road to Wigan Pier exposing the shocking conditions of the working poor, he spent the second half exposing the prejudices of his fellow socialists.

T1  - No Blacks Allowed: Segregated Gifted Education in the Context of Brown v. Board of Education
AN  - 1692289490; 201522737
AB  - This article examines the under-representation of Black students in gifted education, asserting that social inequalities (e.g., prejudice and discrimination) contribute to segregated gifted education programs. Under-representation trends are presented for gifted education, along with methods for calculating under-representation and then inequity goals. Philosophically, this article is grounded in disparate impact discourse, where outcome is more cogent than intent. Denying access to gifted education based on race is immoral and illegal. Pragmatically, under-representation is couched under the larger and more comprehensive achievement gaps and inequities in school settings with implications for de jure segregation. We discuss the under-representation of Black students in gifted education with Brown v. Board of Education as the legal foundation and then focus briefly on a recent court case in gifted education (McFadden v. Board of Education for Illinois School District U-46) for a contemporary point of discussion. Recommendations for desegregating gifted education for Black students regarding attitudes, instruments, and policies and procedures are provided. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Management of Prisoners' Children in the Russian Federation
AN  - 1559004785; 201434115
AB  - The inherited geography of the penal estate in the Russian Federation, which results in prisoners being sent long distances to serve their sentences, creates difficulties for maintaining prisoners' family ties. Using the results of interviews conducted with prisoners, former prisoners and relatives in the Russian Federation in 2007-2011, the article examines the patterns of contact between minors and their incarcerated parents in the context of arrangements put in place by the prison service to support the parent-child relationship. Despite arrangements that appear positive on the surface, societal prejudice and historical practice combine with geography to militate against good outcomes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - I am not Prejudiced, or am I? Semantic Strategies Used by Ghanaian University Students in the Discourse of Ethnic Prejudice
AN  - 1906055459
AB  - Semantic strategies are a kind of discourse strategy that include the sum of language and cognitive moves which are used to reach an adequate goal of communication normally resulting in text comprehension by the reader or listener. Here, the language user takes a number of steps in order to perform a complex task. Semantic strategies in prejudiced talk have been examined extensively in western cultures (e.g., Augoustinos & Every, 2007; Bonnila-Silva, 2002). In order to close the gap on the vastness of western studies, the Ghanaian context is investigated in this study. Ten Ghanaian university students from differing ethnic backgrounds were sampled and interviewed to reveal their ethnic prejudices using the Discourse-Historical approach as advocated by Wodak and Reisigl (1999). The analysis of data reveals projection, semantic distancing, incoherence, and rationalization as the four semantic strategies used in the discourse of prejudice among Ghanaian university students. This study has implications for language socialization.

T1  - Poetic Perspective, Critical Insight: A Study of Youth Attitudes Toward Place and Community
AN  - 1667953645; 201511733
AB  - To provide insight into young people's attitudes toward community, place, and public discourse on youth and the environment, and to constructively situate the concept of 'a sense of place' within these insights for critical pedagogy and community development. This project utilizes a grounded theory approach to identify salient themes in young people's expressions of place relationships through poetry. About 677 poems about 'local watersheds' written by youth aged 5-18 for the River of Words Poetry Contest between 1996 and 2009 are analyzed using poetic and content analysis. Findings include the importance of place experiences that employ risk-taking and play, engage central family relationships, and provide access to historical and political narratives of place for the development of constructive place relationships. We also present findings regarding emotions in the sample, showing changing levels of hope and idealism, sadness, pessimism, and other emotions as expressed in the poems. Using poetic analysis to study attitudes, values, and feelings is a promising method for learning more about the perceptions and values of individuals that affect their self-efficacy and agency. Engaging youth as active participants and empathetic knowledge-creators in their own places offers one opportunity for critical reflective development in order to combat and reframe disempowering public discourses about young people and their relationships to nature and community. Educators can use this research to adapt contextually and emotionally rooted methods of place-based learning with their students. The paper uses a nontraditional, mixed methods approach to research and a unique body of affective data. It makes a strong argument for reflective, experiential, and critical approaches to learning about nature and society issues in local contexts. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Narrow imaginations: How imagining ideal employees can increase racial bias
AN  - 1504423941; 201405292
AB  - When people make important decisions, such as selecting a job candidate or graduate school applicant based on how well they fit with that imagined ideal. In two experiments we provide evidence that imagining the ideal has unintended consequences. Imagining an ideal candidate for a professional job led participants to preferentially imagine a White candidate (Experiment 1) and to preferentially hire a White candidate over a Black candidate with matched qualifications (Experiment 2). These effects were independent of explicit prejudice, suggesting that even low-prejudice individuals may be affected by this bias. However, an alternative imagery strategy-imagining a variety of suitable applicants-was effective at remediating the bias. In some cases discrimination may result not from prejudiced attitudes but from failures of the imagination. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Enacting Cultural Interests: How Intergroup Contact Reduces Prejudice by Sparking Interest in an Out-Group's Culture
AN  - 1933733885
AB  - In the present research, we examined the hypothesis that cues of social connectedness to a member of another social group can spark interest in the group's culture, and that such interest, when freely enacted, contributes to reductions in intergroup prejudice. In two pilot studies and Experiment 1, we found that extant and desired cross-group friendships and cues of social connectedness to an out-group member predicted increased interest in the target group's culture. In Experiments 2 and 3, we manipulated cues of social connectedness between non-Latino American participants and a Latino American (i.e., Mexican American) peer and whether participants freely worked with this peer on a Mexican cultural task. This experience reduced the participants' implicit bias against Latinos, an effect that was mediated by increased cultural engagement, and, 6 months later in an unrelated context, improved intergroup outcomes (e.g., interest in interacting with Mexican Americans; Experiment 4). The Discussion section addresses the inter- and intragroup benefits of policies that encourage people to express and share diverse cultural interests in mainstream settings.

T1  - Do All Associations Lead to Lower Levels of Ethnocentrism? A Two-Year Longitudinal Test of the Selection and Adaptation Model
AN  - 1429641905; 201335740
AB  - Within the literature on the relation between membership in voluntary associations and tolerance, three theoretical perspectives can be distinguished. The socialization perspective assumes that the interaction within association leads to higher levels of tolerance; the self-selection perspective suggests that tolerant actors are more likely to join associations; while the selection and adaption model predicts that the group culture within an association will have a specific effect on members' attitudes. We use a two-year panel study among Belgian adolescents to ascertain the empirical merits of these three approaches. Results show that not all associations have an effect on the reduction of prejudice, but that this effect is limited to specific associations. A structural equation model furthermore suggests that socialization effects are significantly stronger than self-selection effects. As such, this analysis of panel data lends support to the selection and adaptation model. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Assessing the Dimensionality of Beliefs About Children's Adjustment in Same-Sex Families Scale (BCASSFS) in Chile
AN  - 1429624003; 201338078
AB  - The main purpose of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the Beliefs about Children's Adjustment in Same-Sex Families Scale (BCASSFS) (Frias-Navarro 2009), in terms of confirmation of internal consistency and dimensionality via confirmatory factor analysis. In addition, we set out to validate this scale using the Attitudes toward Lesbians and Gay Men (ATLG) Scale Cardenas and Barrientos (The Journal of Sex Research 45(2):140-149, 2008a). Finally, we divided our sample into categories with a view to creating a typology (Egalitarian, Normative opponents, Bigots, and Individual opponents). No research to date has confirmed the hypothesized factor structure of the BCASSFS in Latin American countries. Using data from a convenience sample obtained through the application of a survey of heterosexuals at a university in northern Chile (N=283), a model of two correlated factors was used and the fit indexes obtained. The results indicate that the BCASSFS is a valid and reliable scale for measuring beliefs about children's adjustment in same-sex families in Chile. Moreover, the findings indicated that responses to BCASSFS could be explained by two factors (individual opposition and normative opposition) and that the two factors were correlated. Finally, differences between "egalitarian," "normative opponents," "bigots," and "individual opponents" in the ATLG scale were examined, statistically significant differences being found between groups in the ATL and ATG subscales.

T1  - Modern Prejudice and Same-Sex Parenting: Shifting Judgments in Positive and Negative Parenting Situations
AN  - 1313501111
AB  - The current study compares the effects of traditional and modern antihomosexual prejudice on evaluations of parenting practices of same-sex and opposite-sex couples. Undergraduate university student participants (N = 436) completed measures of traditional and modern antihomosexual prejudice and responded to a vignette describing a restaurant scene in which parents react to their child's undesirable behavior. The parents' sexual orientation and the quality of their parenting (positive or negative quality) were randomly varied. It was predicted that participants who score higher in modern prejudice would rate the negative parenting behaviors of same-sex parents more negatively than similar behaviors in opposite-sex parents. It was also predicted that this modern prejudice effect would be most pronounced for male participants. Both hypotheses were supported. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Nonheterosexual Binational Families: Resilient Victims of Sexual Prejudice and Discriminatory Immigration Policies
AN  - 1551001970; 201430624
AB  - An unprecedented number of American citizens are facing the challenge of being in a non-heterosexual binational relationship. Although immigration laws are based on the principle of family unification, under current federal law lesbian, gay, and bisexual Americans cannot sponsor their same-sex foreign national partners for residency in the United States. Consequently, an estimated 36,000 couples face the threat of family separation because the narrow definition of 'family' used by U.S. immigration services excludes same-sex binational couples and their children. Despite the fact that family research indicates that long periods of separation have harmful effects on the family, immigration law continues to deny binational families the basic right of family unity afforded many of their heterosexual counterparts. Bi-national couples must learn how to function in a social system while dealing with heterosexism, overt discrimination, violence, and the psychological symptoms that result from helplessness. This article will explore the ways in which nonheterosexual binational families must struggle to keep their families together as a result of the discriminatory ways in which laws are constructed in this country. We propose that discriminatory immigration policies have neglected contemporary family research that describes the family as a diverse array of intimate systems that provide mutual care.

T1  - The impacts of friendship groups' racial composition when perceptions of prejudice threaten students' academic self-concept
AN  - 1417522448; 201333530
AB  - Literature on racially prejudiced stereotypes suggests that students' academic self-concepts (ASC) can be damaged when a stereotype demeans the intelligence of their racial or ethnic group. There is little research on how students overcome this burden, but there is some evidence that the racial composition of friendship groups play a role. One argument suggests having racially diverse friends could help students see the inaccuracy of stereotypes and another points out that racially homogenous friends could collectively resist the stereotypes as a support group. In this study I analyze a nationally representative and racially diverse sample of United States adolescents to examine these hypotheses. After estimating multivariate regression models for four separate racial/ethnic groups (Asian, African-American, Hispanic, white), results show that although perceptions of prejudice do predict decreases in ASC for African-American students, racially homogenous friendship groups have the opposite effect which lends credibility to the support group hypothesis. In addition, racial diversity of friendship groups predicts decreased ASC for African-American students, suggesting diverse groups could make prejudice more salient. The implications for these findings include the reminder that prejudice is still a valid concern in American schools and that peers can be a significant source of racial tension and/or support. In terms of students' ASC, it is important for educators to be aware of these social conditions and to continue to seek a better understanding of race relations in schools so that more students are not psychologically burdened by racial tension.

T1  - Student and teacher perceptions of school involvement and their effect on multicultural education: a Catalonian survey
AN  - 1322718480; 201312385
AB  - In multilingual schools students have diverse identities, cultural backgrounds, perceptions, capacities and linguistic experiences. The space for teaching and learning is also mediated by stereotypes and prejudices associated with this diversity. Diversity, stereotypes and prejudices shape how teachers and learners operate in a world of complex social relationships. In this survey we explore the hidden attitudes of immigrant students and teachers in secondary education in Catalonia (Spain). The research uses the distinction between explicit and implicit attitudes to analyse immigrant students' perceptions and teachers' subconscious perceptions about school involvement. The sample includes 4078 immigrant students with more than six months of residence in the host country that were attending linguistic support classes in secondary schools of Catalonia during the year 2006-2007, and also their regular classroom teachers and support teachers. The survey aims to establish if is there any statistically significant associations between the attitudes of newcomer students and teachers, and the linguistic and geographical origins of the students. We wanted to know if teacher and student perceptions agreed or differed and to characterise stereotypes and prejudices affecting positive or negative attitudes about the organisation of teaching while learning. The results show how the teachers' perceptions about newcomer students' involvement differ in many cases from the views of the students, and how lower expectations and subjective manifestations of racism are evident with some groups, especially with students of African origin.

T1  - The Role of Parent-Child Bonding, Attachment, and Interpersonal Problems in the Development of Deviant Sexual Fantasies in Sexual Offenders
AN  - 1081866848; 201237092
AB  - To understand the origin, development, and functions of deviant sexual fantasy in sexual offenders, the present article investigates three areas of the literature on sexual offenders (i.e., parent-child relationships, attachment, and interpersonal problems), hypothesizing a possible path through which dysfunctional parent-child relationships might lead to deviant sexual fantasies. The review of the literature provides indirect evidence that an insecure attachment style developed in response to dysfunctional parenting practices may generate feelings of inadequacy and inferiority to others and a lack of the self-confidence and social skills to initiate or maintain consensual intimate relationships with appropriate others. It is hypothesized that such problems, in turn, might promote low levels of intimacy and satisfaction in romantic relationships and serious and chronic emotional loneliness, withdrawal, and negative attitudes (such as anger and hostility) toward potential partners, leading to a progressive retirement from the real world and refuge in an internal world of deviant sexual fantasies in order to satisfy attachment-related needs for intimacy, emotional closeness, or power. Such a combination of insecure attachment, interpersonal problems, and use of deviant sexual fantasies as a means to achieve the intimacy, power, or control absent from reality might predispose to sexual offending.

T1  - The 'Born Frees': The Prospects for Generational Change in Post-apartheid South Africa
AN  - 1283641945; 201304700
AB  - South Africa's 1996 Constitution ushered in a democratic regime that brought new freedoms and rights and greatly expanded opportunities for political participation. In 1998, South Africa also implemented a new school curriculum intended, among other things, to promote democratic and other constitutional values. At the same time, South Africa has undergone rapid demographic change as growing proportions of young people enter the electorate with no working memory of apartheid. Given our knowledge of post-regime change shifts in popular attitudes in postwar Europe and Japan, theories of socialisation and democratic habituation would lead us to expect significant pro-democratic shifts in South Africa's political culture, especially amongst the youngest generation, who are popularly known in South Africa as the 'Born Frees'. Against these expectations, however, survey evidence indicates that the post-apartheid generation are less committed to democracy than their parents or grandparents. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Nationwide Study of Norwegian Beliefs About Same-sex Marriage and Lesbian and Gay Parenthood
AN  - 1221408406; 201245919
AB  - In Norway, a gender-neutral Marriage Law that secured equal marriage and parenting rights for lesbian, gay and heterosexual couples took effect in January 2009. The aim of the current study was to explore Norwegian beliefs about equal marriage and parenting rights for lesbian, gay and heterosexual couples and the welfare of children with lesbian and gay parents. A sample of 1,246 Norwegians participated in the study by filling out a questionnaire. The majority reported that they were supportive of equal marriage rights for lesbian, gay and heterosexual couples, whilst there was less support for granting gay and lesbian couples equal right to become parents. The negative attitudes towards equal parenting rights for lesbian, gay and heterosexual couples were explained mainly by concerns about the welfare of children growing up with gay and lesbian parents.

T1  - Sociology by Any Other Name: Teaching the Sociological Perspective in Campus Diversity Programs
AN  - 918716624
AB  - This article suggests that the way in to sociology may not always be through the front door. The authors demonstrate how students in a three-day campus diversity program develop a sociological imagination despite not having a formal affiliation with the sociology department. In particular, students demonstrate a move from color blindness into racial consciousness and a shift from individual prejudice into institutional privilege when understanding both diversity issues and their own personal biographies. In short, despite not knowing the phrase, they develop a sociological imagination. While the goal is not to diminish the significance of traditional sociology classrooms, the authors argue that programs like theirs may diminish resistance to learning about privilege and inequalities once students enter the classroom. Such programs may also have the benefit of attracting students to the discipline and creating a more welcoming environment for related programs and events on campus. It is one model of public sociology that other campus communities may mirror outside of the traditional classroom environment. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Prejudice Against Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Coaches: The Influence of Race, Religious Fundamentalism, Modern Sexism, and Contact with Sexual Minorities
AN  - 1266146192; 201301027
AB  - In drawing from Herek's (2007, 2009) sexual stigma and prejudice theory, the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among prejudice toward sexual minority coaches, religious fundamentalism, sexism, and sexual prejudice and to determine whether race affected these relationships. The authors collected data from 238 parents. Results indicated that Asians expressed greater sexual prejudice than Latinos and Whites, while African Americans expressed more religious fundamentalism than did Whites. There were also differences in the associations among the variables. For African Americans, sexism held the strongest association with prejudice toward sexual minority coaches. While for Asians and Whites, religious fundamentalism held the strongest association, contact with lesbian and gay friends was a significant predictor of prejudice for Asians, but not for the other groups. For Latinos, both religious fundamentalism and sexism were associated with sexual prejudice. The authors discuss the results in terms of theoretical and practical implications.

T1  - My Culture Made Me Do It: Lay Theories of Responsibility for Automatic Prejudice
AN  - 1221407596; 201243949
AB  - The present research examined the effects of egocentric motivations on individuals' explanations for how their automatic racial prejudices came into being. The majority of participants reported experiencing biased thoughts, feelings, and gut reactions toward minorities which they found difficult to consciously control, and they attributed such biases to cultural socialization. Of particular interest, ego-threatened participants were significantly more likely to attribute their automatic racial biases to their culture and significantly less likely to attribute such biases to themselves. Results suggest that attributing one's racial biases to cultural socialization can be a defensive, motivated process aimed at diminishing personal responsibility. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Children's social groups and intergroup prejudice: Assessing the influence and inhibition of social group norms
AN  - 1081866998; 201235092
AB  - A simulation group study examined whether the effects of group norms on 7- and 9-year-old children's intergroup attitudes can be moderated by a contrary school norm. Children learnt that their school had an inclusion norm, were assigned to a group with an outgroup inclusion or exclusion norm, and indicated their ingroup and outgroup attitudes under teacher surveillance or not. Results revealed reduced outgroup liking when the group had an exclusion norm, but that the effect was moderated when the school had an inclusion norm, especially among the older children. The participants' ingroup liking was also reduced, but teacher surveillance had no effect on attitudes. The findings are discussed in relation to possible strategies to moderate social group norm effects. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Gendered Capital: Childhood Socialization and the "Boy Crisis" in Education
AN  - 874308149
AB  - This study examined the effect of gender socialization on kindergarten grades using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study- Kindergarten Cohort. The sample consisted of 6,394 children (3,177 girls; 3,217 boys) from across the United States. MANOVA and follow-up tests revealed that both boys and girls tend to participate in gender-typed activities. Girls are more likely to have positive school attitudes and exhibit positive social behavior; boys are more likely to have negative school attitudes. Regression analyses indicated that participation in "female" activities and positive social behavior positively affect grades; participation in "male" activities has no direct effect. Positive attitudes positively affect the grades of girls; negative attitudes negatively affect the grades of boys. Teacher evaluation practices are also considered.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Eastern European Transformation and Youth Attitudes toward Violence
AN  - 1023453580
AB  - This cross-national examination of the motives behind adolescent approval of violence in major cities in Germany and four Eastern European transformation societies (Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, Slovenia) draws on Institutional Anomie Theory (IAT), which leads us to expect higher instrumental motivation for violence among adolescents in the transforming societies. Differences in institutional structure and cultural orientations between Germany and the Eastern European societies are assessed using data from ILO and ESS. Analysis of the different motives for violence is based on data collected by the Criminological Research Institute of Lower Saxony (KFN) in Krakow, Volgograd, Ljubljana, Plzen, and Hamburg. Comparability and cross-cultural interpretability of the violence attitude measure is assessed by applying confirmatory factor analyses in multi-group comparisons. A lack of sufficient data meant that specific assumed linkages as implied by IAT could not be established, but the results for a specific instrumental/utilitarian motive for violence and for institutional structure and cultural orientations point to the utility of applying insights from IAT to understanding the dynamics of violence within the Eastern European context of transformation. We find empirical indications that specific features of the family mediate the "Eastern effect" on the instrumental/utilitarian motive. Further research is needed to discover whether economic dominance affects motives for youth violence indirectly via the socialization provided by non-economic institutions rather than directly via cultural orientations.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Evaluations of Race-Based Exclusion in Urban Minority Children and Adolescents
AN  - 867421682; 21052799
AB  - There is a dearth of published research on the role of intergroup contact on urban US ethnic minority children's and adolescents' evaluations of racial exclusion. The current investigation examined these issues in a sample of low-income minority 4th, 7th, and 10th grade (N = 129, 60% female) African American and Latino/a students attending predominately racial and ethnic minority US urban public schools. Using individual interviews, participants were presented with scenarios depicting three contexts of interracial peer exclusion (lunch at school, a sleepover party, and a school dance). Novel findings were that intergroup contact was significantly related to low-income urban ethnic minority youth's evaluations of the wrongfulness of race-based exclusion and their awareness of the use of stereotypes to justify racial exclusion. Further, significant interactions involving intergroup contact, context, age, and gender were also found. Findings illustrated the importance of intergroup contact for ethnic minority students and the complexity of ethnic minority children's and adolescents' judgments and decision-making about interracial peer exclusion.

T1  - American elementary school children's attitudes about immigrants, immigration, and being an American
AN  - 881466882; 201116356
AB  - The current study examined 5 to 11-year-old European American children's (N = 90) attitudes regarding immigrants, immigration policy, and what it means to be an American. The majority of children in the sample (from a predominantly European American community) held strong American identities and had distinct ideas about what it means to bean American (namely, one must love America, live by its rules, and be White). Children were in favor of legal immigration as a policy, and although they believed in allowing illegal immigrants to stay if employed, many younger children believed they should go to jail. Many children in the sample were aware of Americans' anti-immigration sentiments, largely attributing it to ethnic/cultural discrimination. Finally, children held negative attitudes about immigrants, particularly Mexican immigrants. These negative attitudes were most evident among children who held a strong, prototypical national in-group identity. In contrast, children did not hold differential attitudes about White and Black Americans. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Youth Attitudes Toward Dating Violence in Thailand
AN  - 881469275; 201117575
AB  - This study assessed the occurrences and intensity of psychological, physical, and sexual attitudes toward dating violence among Thai youths, and examined possible variables related to the formation of these attitudes. The random sample consisted of 1,296 male and female adolescents from high school, vocational school, and out-of-school groups. Thai youths in general reported attitudes that were supportive of dating violence. The variables more closely related to attitudes toward dating violence were personal variables. Peer influence, partner relationships, and family characteristics were related to higher support for dating violence. Females reported higher endorsement of dating violence than males. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed, and recommendations for policy makers are drawn. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - When Biased Language Use is Associated With Bullying and Dominance Behavior: The Moderating Effect of Prejudice
AN  - 758122510; 201058955
AB  - Biased language related to sexual orientation is used frequently among students and is related to prominent social concerns such as bullying. Prejudice toward gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender individuals also has been examined among adolescents, but separately from these behaviors. This study tested whether biased language use was associated with bullying and dominance irrespective of sexual prejudice or if sexual prejudice moderated these associations among 290 high school students (50% female; 56% White). Sexual prejudice was associated with biased language use among boys only. Biased language was associated with bullying regardless of levels of sexual prejudice for boys. However, this association was dependent on sexual prejudice for girls. For dominance behavior, its association with biased language was moderated by sexual prejudice for boys, but not girls. However, girls' engagement in all behaviors was significantly less than boys. These results indicate nuanced ways in which multiple factors contribute to the use of sexual orientation biased language. Also, they underscore the need to address biased language and prejudice as part of anti-bullying programs. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Role of National Identity Representation in the Relation between In-Group Identification and Out-Group Derogation: Ethnic versus Civic Representation
AN  - 754040739; 201049632
AB  - Two studies investigated whether the content of in-group identity affects the relation between in-group identification and ethnic prejudice. The first study among university students, tested whether national identity representations (i.e., ethnic vs. civic) moderate or mediate the relation between Flemish in-group identification and ethnic prejudice. A moderation hypothesis is supported when those higher in identification who subscribe to a more ethnic representation display higher ethnic prejudice levels than those higher in identification who subscribe to a more civic representation. A mediation hypothesis is supported when those higher in identification tend towards one specific representation, which in turn, should predict ethnic prejudice. Results supported a mediation hypothesis and showed that the more respondents identified with the Flemish in-group, the more ethnic their identity representation, and the more they were inclined to display ethnic prejudice. The second study tested this mediation from a longitudinal perspective in a two-wave study among high school students. In-group identification at Time 1 predicted over-time changes in identity representation, which in turn, predicted changes in ethnic prejudice. In addition to this, changes in identity representation were predicted by initial ethnic prejudice levels. The implications of these findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Attitudes Toward Homosexuals Among Youth in Multiethnic Brussels
AN  - 743046809; 201031991
AB  - This study examined attitudes toward lesbians and gay men (referred to in the literature as sexual prejudice ) in a sample of pupils from 70 secondary schools in Brussels. We used items measuring traditional and modern sexual prejudice and support for gay civil rights. We performed a multilevel linear multivariate response analysis to assess both the impact of individual characteristics and school influence on pupils' attitudes. Controlling for sociodemographic variables, second-generation migrants had more prejudice toward homosexuals than pupils from the ethnic majority group. Identification with the receiving society and perception of group-level institutional discrimination, however, mediated the association between ethnic origin and homonegativity. In contrast to traditional sexual prejudice and gay civil rights issues, modern sexual prejudice items were less affected by individual sociodemographic variables. Modern sexual prejudice also remained rather stable across schools; however, schools did appear to affect civil rights issues and traditional sexual prejudice. This contribution sheds light on the relationship between ethnic origin and sexual prejudice and on the variation of several sexual prejudice dimensions across social groups and schools.

T1  - 'Away with the fairies?' Disability within primary-age children's literature
AN  - 2059579383
AB  - This article outlines the findings of a new study that explores the portrayal of disability within a sample of the primary-age children's literature most readily available to UK schools. The kind of literature to which children are exposed is likely to influence their general perceptions of social life. How disability is handled by authors is therefore important from the standpoint of disability equality. Findings suggest that whilst there are some good examples of inclusive literature 'out there', discriminatory language and/or negative stereotypes about disability continue to be present in a range of more contemporary children's books. Clearly, more still needs to be done to ensure that schools and teachers are provided with information relating to the best examples of inclusion literature and efforts must continue to be made to inform authors, publishers and illustrators about how to approach the issue of disability.

T1  - The "Childhood Obesity Epidemic": Health Crisis or Social Construction?
AN  - 848720310; 20420299
AB  - There has been a meteoric rise over the past two decades in the medical research and media coverage of the so-called global childhood obesity epidemic. Recently, in response to this phenomenon, there has been a spate of books and articles in the fields of critical sociology and cultural studies that have argued that this "epidemic" is socially constructed, what Natalie Boero (2007) dubs a "postmodern epidemic." As an anthropologist who has studied child nutrition and obesity in relation to poverty and the school environment, I am concerned about both the lack of reflexivity among medical researchers as well as critical scholars' treatment of the problem as entirely socially constructed. In this article I present both sides of this debate and then discuss how we can attempt to navigate a middle course that recognizes this health issue but also offers alternative approaches to those set by the biomedical agenda.

T1  - Prejudice in the police: On the processes underlying the effects of selection and group socialisation
AN  - 743050539; 201029019
AB  - The principal aim of this study is to determine why police officers are generally found to be more prejudiced towards disadvantaged groups than are the standard population. Two independent processes were expected to account for this effect: Selection and group socialisation. Using a cross-sectional design (N = 170), firstly, we compared, newly recruited police officers with a control population (selection effect), and secondly, police officers with 1 year of training with the newly recruited ones (group socialisation effect). Results reveal a significant effect of both selection and group socialisation, the two being underlined by distinct processes; right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) in the case of the former and internalisation of a prejudice norm in the case of the latter. Finally, the results show that group identification moderates the change in internalisation of the prejudice norm. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - The relationship between outgroup size and anti-outgroup attitudes: A theoretical synthesis and empirical test of group threat- and intergroup contact theory
AN  - 60339315; 201017652
AB  - Although anti-immigrant attitudes represent a widespread social problem in many European societies, research has only partially understood the role the demographic size of the immigrant population plays for the prevalence of such attitudes. In this study, we use group threat- and intergroup contact theory to derive competing hypotheses on the role the size of the immigrant population plays for explaining the anti-immigrant attitudes of Dutch citizens. To this end, we used structural equation modeling with robust standard errors on nationally representative individual-level survey data enriched with official municipality-level statistics. We found empirical evidence for both group threat- and intergroup contact theory. Objective measurements of immigrant group size corresponded with subjective perceptions of a larger immigrant group size. Conversely, subjective perceptions of a larger immigrant group size were associated with perceptions of threatened group interests, which in turn related to anti-immigrant attitudes. On the other hand, however, larger immigrant group size facilitates intergroup contact, which was negatively associated with perceived threat and subsequent anti-immigrant attitudes.
