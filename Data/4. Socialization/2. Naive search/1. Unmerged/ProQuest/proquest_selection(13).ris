T1  - How Has Cultural Heterosexism Affected Thinking about Divorce? Asymmetric Framing of Same-Gender and Mixed-Gender Divorces in News Media and in Minds
AN  - 2403185152
AB  - Herek’s notion of cultural heterosexism describes an ideology that works implicitly through language, and leads non-heterosexuals to be framed as “others.” National statistics in many countries indicate group differences between same-gender and mixed-gender couples in divorce rates, and we used media accounts and individual interpretation of group differences in divorce to operationalize it here. We found qualified support for three hypotheses in two studies. In Study 1, analysis of 412 English-language news articles on divorce indicated that comparative statements overwhelmingly positioned same-gender couples as figure and mixed-gender couples as ground. In Study 2, 88 participants read about how same-gender couples differed from mixed-gender couples, or about how mixed-gender couples differed from same-gender couples in their reasons for dissolving relationships. Results indicated that participants showed higher perceived legitimacy of inequality, higher sexual prejudice, and higher estimates of global divorce rates in the former conditions. Analysis of participants’ explanations of group differences in divorce rates indicated that they spontaneously contrasted mixed-gender couples against same-gender couples more of the time. As the media discourse focused on male couples (Study 1) and the effects of linguistic framing was evident only when male couples were described (Study 2), we discuss how these studies, which operationalized and evidenced cultural heterosexism, may point to the emergence of homonormative ideologies that recognized gay men more than lesbians in twenty-first century politics.

T1  - Does adoption of an evidence‐based practice lead to job turnover? Results from a randomized trial
AN  - 2407733964
AB  - It is important to understand the impact of implementation of evidence‐based practices (EBPs) on the workforce. EBP implementation can increase job demands, stress, and burnout, and may thereby exacerbate turnover. This study examined the effects of implementation of an EBP on turnover among staff at nine child welfare agencies. A total of 102 providers were randomized to either adopt an EBP, SafeCare©, or continue providing services as usual. Participants completed a baseline survey assessing demographics, attitudes toward EBPs, and organizational functioning, and provider turnover was recorded for up to 18 months following implementation. The overall turnover rate was 35%, but did not differ by EBP assignment (odds ratio [OR] = 1.27; 95% confidence interval [0.66, 2.45]). Variables associated with turnover included age (OR = 0.92), years since degree completion (OR = 0.94), prior exposure to EBP (OR = 3.91), believing that adopting an EBP was burdensome (OR = 0.52), and motivation for change (OR = 0.89). EBP assignment moderated two aspects of negative attitudes toward EBP (divergence and monitoring) to predict turnover; those attitudes were only positively related to turnover for individuals assigned to the EBP (OR = 1.46, 1.16). Implications of the findings for implementation are discussed.

T1  - WHITE OPPOSITION TO NATIVE NATION SOVEREIGNTY: THE ROLE OF “THE CASINO INDIAN” STEREOTYPE AND PRESENCE OF NATIVE NATION GAMING
AN  - 2577680327
AB  - Since first contact with Europeans, Native American nations have strived to maintain and strengthen their sovereignty. Yet, non-Native individuals and groups, as well as federal, state, and local governments, continue to challenge this sovereignty. Despite the critical importance of sovereignty, the only academic study focused on U.S. public attitudes toward Native nation sovereignty predated the rise of Native nation gaming and relied on samples from three universities. In our study, we surveyed over 2000 White Americans from across the United States to examine attitudes toward Native nation sovereignty. Of the many factors that may influence these attitudes, we focused on three: belief in “the casino Indian” stereotype, the perception that Native American interests conflict with the interests of Whites, and the presence of Native nation gaming in participants’ states.We find two significant models predicting attitudes towards Native nation sovereignty. First, greater endorsement of the casino Indian stereotype is associated with more negative attitudes toward Native nation sovereignty. This relationship is explained, at least in part, by the perception that Native American interests conflict with the interests of Whites. That is, the more White participants endorsed the casino Indian sterereotype, the more apt they were to believe that their interests conflict with Native Americans, which in turn is related to more negative attitudes towards Native nation sovereignty. The second model revealed that the presence of Native nation gaming in the participant’s state has important indirect implications for attitudes towards Native nation sovereignty. Specifically, White participants living in states with Native nation gaming are more likely to endorse the casino Indian stereotype, which is related to greater perceived conflict of interest with Native Americans, and, ultimately perceived conflict of interest is associated with more negative attitudes toward Native nation sovereignty. We situate our findings relative to group position theory and discuss practical implications for Native nation sovereignty.

T1  - How Discrimination and Bias Shape Outcomes
AN  - 2434475919
AB  - In this article, economists Kevin Lang and Ariella Kahn-Lang Spitzer take up the expansive issue of discrimination, examining specifically how discrimination and bias shape people's outcomes. The authors focus primarily on discrimination by race, while acknowledging that discrimination exists along many other dimensions as well, including gender, sexual orientation, religion, and ethnicity. They describe evidence of substantial racial disparities in the labor market, education, criminal justice, health, and housing, and they show that in each of these domains, such disparities at least partially reflect discrimination.Lang and Kahn-Lang Spitzer note that the disparities we see are both causes and results of discrimination, and that they reinforce each other. For instance, harsher treatment from the criminal justice system makes it more difficult for black people to get good jobs, which makes it more likely they'll live in poor neighborhoods and that their children will attend inferior schools.The authors argue that simply prohibiting discrimination isn't effective, partly because it's hard to prevent discrimination along dimensions that are correlated with race. Rather, they write, policies are more likely to be successful if they aim to eliminate the statistical association between race and many other social and economic characteristics and to decrease the social distance between people of different races.

T1  - “A Golly was simply a toy. End of”: Inoculation, attention deflection, and attempted puzzle‐resolution in contesting racism in online discussions
AN  - 2384449210
AB  - In producing arguments against minority groups that are designed to avoid accusations of prejudice, speakers routinely deploy two discursive strategies. One strategy of “inoculation” seeks to ward off such accusations, while the other strategy of “attention deflection” directs attention away from the potential target group. Where despite use of one or both strategies accusations arise, the result is a puzzle that needs to be resolved through explanation. Here, in a discourse analysis of online discussions as to whether “blacking up” is to count as racism, we see contributors contest (a) whether absence of intention to offend inoculates individuals from accountability for potentially racist actions, (b) whether “blacking up” depicts toys/characters rather than people, and (c) whether attempted explanations of accusations of racism work to resolve the apparent puzzle that has arisen. Contributors do not reach any consensus. These findings point to the difficulties in attempting to challenge potential racism.

T1  - Humour is serious: Minority group members’ use of humour in their encounters with majority group members
AN  - 2369759944
AB  - This article adds to the social psychological literature on how minority group members seek to manage their interactions with majority group members. Specifically, it focuses on minority group members’ use of humour in interactions where they anticipate or actually experience prejudice. The data on which our analysis is based originate from interviews conducted with Roma in Hungary (N = 30). Asked about their interactions with majority group members, interviewees reported using humour as a means to (a) manage embarrassment; (b) gather information about the other's intergroup attitudes; and (c) subvert taken‐for‐granted understandings of social relations. The humour involved was diverse. Sometimes it entailed the telling of (Roma‐related) jokes. Sometimes it involved the exaggerated performance of roles and identities that ironised majority–minority social relations. The significance of humour as a tool for minority group members to exert some control over their interactions with majority group members is discussed.

T1  - Not Quite Monoracial: Biracial Stereotypes Explored
AN  - 2348215501
AB  - Stereotypes often guide our perceptions of members of social groups. However, research has yet to document what stereotypes may exist for the fastest growing youth demographic in the United States—biracial individuals. Across seven studies (N = 1,104), we investigate what stereotypes are attributed to various biracial groups, whether biracial individuals are stereotyped as more similar to their lower status monoracial parent group (trait hypodescent), and whether contact moderates these stereotypes. Results provide evidence of some universal biracial stereotypes that are applied to all biracial groups: attractive and not fitting in or belonging. We also find that all biracial groups are attributed a number of unique stereotypes (i.e., which are not associated with their monoracial parent groups). However, across all studies, we find little evidence of trait hypodescent and no evidence that the tendency to engage in trait hypodescent varies as a function of contact.

T1  - Is negative the new positive? Secondary transfer effect of exposure to LGBT portrayals in TV entertainment programs
AN  - 2354725994
AB  - This study investigates the primary effect of positive, neutral, and negative exposure to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) TV portrayals in entertainment programs on attitudes toward the LGBT community and the Secondary Transfer Effect (STE) of such exposure on attitudes toward people with Asperger's Disorder (the secondary out‐group), controlling for face‐to‐face and online contacts with both out‐groups. Research was conducted using a mixed methods approach. Quantitative Study 1 used an online survey of 716 Israeli Jews, to investigate primary and secondary effects of TV exposure to LGBT portrayals. The positive primary effect of TV exposure was shown—regardless of LGBT portrayals perceived as positive, neutral, or negative. STE of TV exposure to neutral and negative LGBT portrayals is likely to diminish social distance to people with Asperger's Disorder, while no STE was found with positive LGBT portrayals. Full mediation effect of attitudes toward the LGBT community was found. Qualitative Study 2, based on 52 in‐depth interviews, was conducted in order to reveal the hidden mechanisms of these effects, examining the parasocial experience and its interpretations by the viewers. According to qualitative findings, the positive primary and secondary effects of negative exposure may be explained by varied interpretations of gay portrayals on TV by different people depending on social background and life experience, opposite reaction on stereotypical gay portrayals on TV, and asymmetrical negative‐positive heuristic. Given the important role of TV in fostering more positive intergroup relations, this research revealed sources of prejudice reduction and increase in tolerance toward “others” for society at large.

T1  - MATERNAL TRANSFERABILITY OF TRAUMA AND PSYCHOSOMATIC NATION IN SORAYYA KHAN'S NOOR
AN  - 2425868095
AB  - Ignored or less voiced representation of victimized mothers may appear in the form of certain explicit psychological reactions within generations. Maternal trauma may seep through generations resulting in a psychologically paralyzed nation. The main concern of this paper is to study Sorayya Khan's novel Noor to unearth treachery and to unfold unspoken traumas (PTSD) inflicted specifically upon mothers during violent incidents. Mothers have always been the carriers of distortion, loss, violence, abuse and acute callousness, transmitting confused and anxious situations to the next generation. Sorayya Khan's first novel, Noor, addresses such violence and prejudice, thereby reflecting how such intense traumatic experiences actuate the suffering of mothers. This epic piece of art brings forth the hushed voices of both mothers and children who are marginalized, forgotten, oppressed, traumatized, subjected to dislocation and exposed to violence and sexual assault against the backdrop of war. This research tends to unveil the ways in which mothers have been subjected to trauma to cripple the sound psychological foundations of the community/nation. The main purpose of this essay is to address certain essential questions such as: what in fact trauma is, how war affects the life patterns of society, how the trauma inflicted upon women (Mothers) becomes an irresolvable disorder, how trauma can act as a catalyst for the disruption of all sectors of the society, and finally how inherited trauma gives birth to a traumatized nation. The focal point of this research is to examine and explore the issues faced by the fallen ones (Mothers) during times of war and how these issues become precursors for the future lives of the characters, thereby resulting in a hollow nation.

T1  - Beyond Islamophobia? The role of Englishness and English national identity within English Defence League discourse and politics
AN  - 2299329690
AB  - Unsurprisingly, most scholarship on the English Defence League (EDL) focuses on the Islamophobic nature of the group's politics. This has found that, whilst the group presents a more moderate, public-facing image, the EDL's backstage discourse is a far less nuanced brand of Islamophobia and cultural racism (Allen, C. (2011). Opposing Islamification or promoting Islamophobia? Understanding the English Defence League. Patterns of Prejudice, 45(4), 279-294; Kassimeris, G., & Jackson, L. (2015). The ideology and discourse of the English Defence League: 'Not racist, not violent, just no longer silent'. British Journal of Politics and International Relations, 17, 171-188). A more fundamental area of EDL ideology has been left unexamined, however: what notion of 'England' is the EDL trying to 'defend'? Using content analysis of EDL online discourse, this article examines how the EDL articulates, represents, and uses English national identity within its discourse and politics.

T1  - Gender stereotypes and contact with gay men and lesbians: The mediational role of sexism and homonegativity
AN  - 2314168954
AB  - This study is grounded in Allport's intergroup contact theory and Herek's sexual prejudice theory. We aimed at (a) investigating the mediational role of sexism and homonegativity on the relation between gender, age, and contact with gay and lesbian people with gender stereotypes about gay men and lesbians; and (b) replicating and corroborating the direct associations found in previous research among these variables. The present research used secondary data from a survey conducted by the Italian National Institute of Statistics and comprehending a representative sample of 5,863 Italian adults. The results from path analysis indicated that both homonegativity and sexism partially mediated the effect of gender and age on gender stereotypes, whereas they totally mediated the effect of contact with gay and lesbian persons. Findings suggest that reducing sexist and homonegative attitudes and increasing contact with gay and lesbian people may reduce stereotypical beliefs about homosexual people.

T1  - Privilege, White Identity, and Motivation: A Call to Action in Social Work
AN  - 2322613665
AB  - Understanding how privilege is constructed and reconstructed over time is imperative to move toward a more just society. White fragility and tactics used to avoid race-based stress sustains privilege. The roots of Fragility are examined through the lens of three Whiteidentity theoretical models: the White Identity Development Process Model, the White Racial Identity Model, and the White Male Identity Development Model. Further, motivation theories are explored to tie privilege, White identity, and social work together cohesively. Recommendations for social work education, research, and practice are given for combating prejudice and racism.

T1  - Understanding Appalachian Microaggression from the Perspective of Community College Students in Southern West Virginia
AN  - 2339037811
AB  - The term "Appalachian" is wrongly understood to represent a single culture of rural White poverty (Keefe, 2005). This conception contains stereotypical images that obscure hardships many rural White Central Appalachians face. Similar to other oppressed minorities in the U.S., what it means to be Appalachian is a social construction based on what differs them from the White hegemony. Recent scholarship on discrimination recognizes the importance of microaggression, small insults and slights experienced frequently by people from minority groups (Sue, et. al., 2007). Microaggression may be an especially insidious mechanism in the oppression of Appalachian people, since the derogatory stereotypes are broadly accepted while their oppressed status tends to not be acknowledged. This study applied qualitative focus group methodology to understand perceptions of microaggression and oppression among a sample of college students living in rural Central Appalachia. Results reveal themes of microaggression. Identifying Appalachian microaggression provides evidence of marginalized status and offers a framework for understanding how the social construction of White Appalachian perpetuates reduced status, stereotypes, and prejudice. Implications are discussed to consider how to foster resilience to oppression among rural White Central Appalachian people.

T1  - Intimate Partner Violence Against Disabled Persons: Clinical and Health Impact, Intersections, Issues and Intervention Strategies
AN  - 2114944858
AB  - One of the crimes currently affecting our society is intimate partner violence (IPV), which is regarded as a major global health issue especially affecting women. These health problems concern every citizen, but even more so for women with disabilities who are more exposed to dependence, prejudice and marginalisation. Although a greater focus has been placed on IPV against women with disabilities during the last decade, data about the incidence of violence still need to be confirmed and the way by which abuse situations are perpetuated has not been clarified, especially regarding what the practical aid for women living in this situation might be. This work highlights the clinical impact of the IPV phenomenon on women with disabilities, describes the difficulties experienced while dealing with this phenomenon and suggests the most appropriate intervention strategies. Our work found that people with disabilities are at a higher risk of facing IPV when compared to individuals without disabilities. The results unquestionably show that such acts of violence are often not even reported, partly because of sentimental, emotional and economic reasons. Finally, we point out policies and initiatives aimed at helping people with disabilities tackle the phenomenon.

AB  - This article explores how issues of race and prejudice permeate knowledge production. By way of theory-driven processing, this article examines how traditional positivist practices, entrenched more than half a century ago, continue to dominate and have set the foundations by which knowledge is acquired, disseminated, understood and naturalized in two aspects: academia (tenure) and the publication process. This article further discusses how social justice and activism figure into productivity and concludes with some practical steps and suggestions to advance a more inclusive critical pedagogy in research, teaching and service.

T1  - What’s the Deal? Women’s Evidence and Gendered Negotiations
AN  - 2132132369
AB  - South African law has traditionally denied property sharing rights to people in non-marital intimate partnerships, but a series of new cases has created the possibility of enforcing universal partnership contracts to claim a share in partnership property. However, evidential biases within these progressive cases reflect a historical disdain for women’s contributions to relationships and a widespread reluctance to believe women’s testimony about the existence of agreements to share. These biases bear strong resemblances to the gender stereotypes which have been the subject of feminist critique in rape law. Central to both rape and universal partnerships is the issue of consent or agreement between men and women. This, in turn, depends on social beliefs about male and female entitlements in the realms of sex and intimate relationships. The paper highlights the commonalities and parallels between the legal treatment of women’s evidence about the existence of contracts on the one hand, and the prejudice faced by complainants in rape cases.

T1  - Racing Law: Legal Scholarship and the Critical Race Revolution
AN  - 2291125044
AB  - The advent of critical race theory (CRT) in legal scholarship changed the way in which legal scholars think about race and racism in at least three ways. First, CRT scholars argue that the problem of racial justice is fundamental to American law, whereas the previous generation of civil rights scholars saw racial justice as a problem of institutional dynamics resolvable through ordinary legal process. Second, CRT scholars have infused greater social, disciplinary, and scholastic “reflexivity” into legal scholarship on race. Third, CRT scholars have developed a rich and nuanced language for understanding race and racism, replacing an earlier and less sophisticated legal conception of people of color as “discrete and insular” minorities facing unreasoning prejudice.

T1  - Racism and the Christian Church in America: Caught between the Knowledge of Good and Evil
AN  - 2201769724
AB  - Those persons with church membership or professing a faith or relationship with God represent a microcosm of society. Therefore, the demons of racism, bigotry, and prejudice found in society at large are found in the church. Despite the very nature of Christianity that calls on Christians to be a countervoice in the world against evil, many have capitulated to various strains of racism in the world and in the Church. Some Christian denominations have begun to explore racism in the church and have developed responses to addressing the issues in the church and in the world. This article examines the historical context of race and religion in the Christian church in the United States, and addresses the current efforts of some Christian denominations to become proactive in the struggle against racism.

T1  - The Development and Validation of the Ableist Microaggression Scale
AN  - 2193088749
AB  - Approximately 20% of U.S. residents are currently living with a disability. Ableism values a specific type of physical, mental, and/or emotional capital as well as supports socially constructed expectations of ability, valuing these expectations over different types of ability and disability. One way in which ableism is perpetuated is through microaggressions, or acts of aggressions that occur at the more interpersonal-or micro-level. Microaggressions are everyday interactions that perpetuate inequalities and stereotypes against people who belong to marginalized communities. Experiencing multiple microaggressions has been referred to as "death by a thousand paper cuts," indicating the severity of the sum total of these casual types of prejudice and oppression. Research demonstrates that experiences of identity-related microaggressions can negatively impact mental health outcomes, increase somatic symptoms, and increase negative affect. This mixed methods study explores how to measure ableist microaggressions by developing the 65-item ableist microaggression scale using qualitative interviews with stakeholders (N = 13) and a nationwide survey in the United States (N = 984).

T1  - Political constructions of a cross-community identity in a divided society: how politicians articulate Northern Irishness
AN  - 2153869934
AB  - A shared identity has been shown to reduce prejudice between conflicting social groups. One such common national category is the 'Northern Irish' identity which can be inclusive of both Catholics and Protestants. This study analyses the plenary sessions of the Northern Ireland Assembly to show how the national category 'Northern Irish' is framed by politicians. Content analysis shows that it is used more often by centrist parties who tend to frame it positively and as part of their political viewpoint. There is also evidence of the instrumental use of this identity by unionists in line with the ingroup projection model.

T1  - That latent sense of otherness: old and new anti-semitisms in postwar Italy
AN  - 2124554070
AB  - This article traces the evolution of anti-semitism in post-war Italy, from the early responses to the Holocaust to the increasingly concerning signs of contemporary anti-Jewish prejudice. Tracing the discourses of religious and secular attitudes towards Jews, the piece shows how resilient certain stereotypes are, and how assumptions about citizenship continue to undermine the respect of difference in Italy. With a reflection that is meant to be personal and scholarly at the same time, this contribution has the aim of facilitating a broader reflection, that spans instances of anti-semitism among the anti-racist Left, the correlation between unresolved anti-Jewish prejudice and widespread racist, anti-immigrant discourses, the challenges of a politicised memorialisation of the Holocaust, and also the role Jewish communities may play in this unsettling context.Alternate abstract:Italian summaryQuesto articolo prende in considerazione l’evoluzione dell’anti-Semitismo nell’Italia post-bellica, a partire dalle prime reazioni all’Olocausto fino ai preoccupanti segnali di riemersione del pregiudizio anti-ebraico nell’Italia contemporanea. Tracciando i contorni dei rapporti tra lo Stato italiano, la Chiesa cattolica e gli ebrei, questo contributo dimostra quanto alcuni stereotipi siano resistenti e adattabili, e quanto un certo concetto di cittadinanza continui ad ostacolare l’accettazione della differenza in Italia. Attraverso una riflessione che si propone di essere al contempo accademica e personale, l’articolo vuole facilitare una discussione più ampia, che consideri da una parte il rapporto tra anti-Semitismo e xenophobia, e dall’altra quello con l’anti-Sionismo, oltre alla politicizzazione della memoria dell’Olocausto e del ruolo, complesso, che le comunità ebraiche possono giocare in questo contesto.

T1  - Metric of Rebarbarization: Real Time in The Authoritarian Personality
AN  - 2148952857
AB  - “The essay as form,” Adorno (1984: 160) writes in The Authoritarian Personality, seeks to understand concepts as they “are already unconsciously named in language.” This is not exactly philology since it is only in pressing the given meanings further than their given sense that they can be grasped reflectively. The intention, then, in this essay, written between November 9, 2016, and November 9, 2017, is to enunciate what authoritarianism has come to mean in the wake of the American presidential election of Donald Trump. The point made is that domination is self-destruction, now immediately so, and that its metric is cognizable in a critical understanding of the received idea of “real time.” Following an introduction titled “Undercount Nation,” the essay proceeds in six sections: (I) Studies in Prejudice, Primordial Restitution, Interpretation neither Stringent nor Arbitrary; (2) Savage Beating, Get Even for What?, The Use of Humankind; (3) The Authoritarian Personality, Is It Fascism?, Transcendental Deduction of Psychoanalysis; (4) The Uninterpretation of Dreams; (5) Primitive Thread of Human History; and (6) Historical Trend: Real Time. The essay as a whole is a commentary on Adorno et al.’s The Authoritarian Personality.

T1  - Multicolored Blindfolds
AN  - 2133339156
AB  - Past studies have found that multicultural approaches to diversity can reduce prejudice and stimulate positive intergroup relations. The current research explored a possible negative side effect of multiculturalism: whether organizational diversity structures geared toward multiculturalism can conceal racial discrimination and delegitimize racial discrimination claims. Three studies found that, even when objective information was indicative of discrimination, both Whites and racial minorities perceived organizations which had diversity policies emphasizing multiculturalism as more fair toward minorities. This perception of (false) fairness led individuals to perceive less racial discrimination and to view claims of racial discrimination against that organization as less legitimate. Furthermore, we found that organizational multiculturalism and externally granted diversity awards both produced a (false) fairness effect. The results suggest an irony of multicultural diversity structures: They can create a false fairness effect that conceals and delegitimizes discrimination.

T1  - Immigration Policies and Social Determinants of Health: Is Immigrants’ Health at Risk?
AN  - 2063531578
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of immigration legislation on Latino immigrants within the social determinants of health framework to understand the impact of such legislation on the immigrant’s health. While the socio-political climate in California is geared towards more pro-integration immigration policies, findings indicate that immigrants still experiences poor treatment in the form of microaggressions, horizontal discrimination, and institutional discrimination. This poor treatment may be an indication of residual anti-immigrant sentiment that remains in the state as well as a spillover effect from the anti-immigrant legislation being passed in neighboring states or national rhetoric. The findings overlap with four domains of the social determinants of health framework including economic stability, education, health and access to care, and social and community context. Implications for practice, policy and research are discussed.

T1  - Different sides of the same conversation: Black and White partners differ in perceptions of interaction content
AN  - 2091600982
AB  - A positive interracial interaction can create a foundation for friendships, improved intergroup attitudes and reduced prejudice. Recent research has demonstrated that what people talk about in important. Here, two studies expand the interaction content model of interracial interactions to reveal that Black and White Americans perceive interaction content in similar and different ways. As expected, Black and White participants evaluated conversation topics along the same three dimensions, but differed in their perceptions of specific conversation topics. These convergences and differences emerged for pre‐generated (Study 1) and self‐generated (Study 2) topics. Factor analyses revealed that conversation attributes similarly distilled to the predicted underlying content dimensions of intimacy, valence, and controversy for Black and White Americans. However, Black individuals found interaction content, in general, to be more controversial, race‐related, enjoyable, and predictable than White individuals. Although both groups found race‐related content more controversial, Black individuals were less bothered by discussing race and found race‐related topics to be more predictable and enjoyable to discuss. These findings supported the interaction content model which may provide a framework for future research on interracial interactions. We conclude with the importance of considering differences in perceptions of interaction content, as well as suggestions for how intergroup interaction research could benefit from systematically incorporating such content.

T1  - Living under threat: Mutual threat perception drives anti‐Muslim and anti‐Western hostility in the age of terrorism
AN  - 2072256300
AB  - This research demonstrates a common psychology of outgroup hostility driven by perceived intergroup threat among three groups and seven cultural contexts: non‐Muslim Westerners, Muslims in Western societies, and Muslims in the Middle East. In Study 1, symbolic, but not realistic and terroristic threats, predicted non‐Muslim Norwegians' intentions to join anti‐Islamic movements. In Study 2, symbolic and realistic, but not terroristic threat, predicted non‐Muslim Americans' willingness to persecute Muslims. In Studies 3 and 4, symbolic threat predicted support and behavioral intentions against the West among Swedish and Turkish Muslims. Finally, in Study 5, a comparison demonstrated that symbolic and realistic threats had the same effects on violent intentions among non‐Muslim and Muslim Danes, and Muslims in Afghanistan. Meta‐analysis showed that symbolic threat was most strongly associated with intergroup hostility. Across studies, participants with high religious group identification experienced higher levels of threat. Implications for intergroup research and prejudice reduction are discussed.

T1  - The Motivated Cognitive Basis of Transphobia: The Roles of Right-Wing Ideologies and Gender Role Beliefs
AN  - 1963776582
AB  - Transgender individuals challenge the traditional assumption that an individual’s gender identity is permanently determined by their assigned sex at birth. Perceiving ambiguity surrounding indeterminate gender identities associated with transgender individuals may be especially disturbing for those who generally dislike ambiguity and have preference for order and predictability, that is, for people scoring higher on Need for Closure (NFC). We tested the associations between NFC and transphobia in two studies using community samples from the United Kingdom (n = 231) and Belgium (n = 175), and we examined whether right-wing ideological attitudes and traditional gender role beliefs mediated these relationships. Confirming our expectations, we found that NFC was significantly associated with transphobia through both stronger adherence to social conventions and obedience to authorities (i.e., right-wing authoritarianism) and stronger endorsements of traditional gender roles in the UK and Belgium, as well as through stronger preferences for hierarchy and social inequality (i.e., social dominance orientation) in the UK. Our results suggest that transgender individuals are more likely to be targets of prejudice by those higher in NFC at least partly due to the strong preference for preserving societal traditions and the resistance to a perceived disruption of traditional gender norms. Hence, attempts to reduce transphobia might be especially challenging among those high in NFC. Nevertheless, prejudice-reducing interventions could incorporate techniques that satisfy epistemic needs for predictability, certainty, and simple structure which may have higher chances of success among high NFC individuals.

T1  - A critical participatory pedagogical approach to enabling life orientation students to develop social literacy through HIV education
AN  - 2068965793
AB  - HIV education is an important component of the life orientation curriculum, since an intersectional understanding of HIV provides an entry point to appreciate the interrelatedness of various social injustices. Yet, our interaction with predominantly white and privileged pre-service life orientation students led us to believe that they did not perceive HIV education as something that was relevant to their personal or professional lives. Their rigid, stigmatising belief systems and "othering" attitudes prevented them from embodying the inclusive and life-enhancing values that life orientation is supposed to develop. This paper explains how we used iterative cycles of reflection and action to enable 86 student teachers of life orientation to interrogate their misconceptions about HIV education and its applicability for their professional and personal contexts. Students were able to acknowledge their prejudices and privileges, which in turn created a willingness to engage with HIV education and to embody their learning to bring about change in their daily interactions. The knowledge generated from this study indicates how a critical, participatory pedagogical approach to HIV education can develop the social literacy of students to enable them to live out the life-enhancing values that underpin the life orientation curriculum.

T1  - The multimodal construction of race: a review of critical race theory research
AN  - 2050474882
AB  - Issues of race periodically rupture in the national and international consciousness, while at other times, there is a false belief that society has arrived at a post-racial era. Either way, there remains impetus for the critical interrogation of the racialisation of multimodal literacies in education, and critical race theory (CRT) is a leading approach. This article reviews original studies that collectively analyse multimodal texts and practices to understand the construction of race in education. Multimodal texts have proliferated in online textual ecologies due to the ease of production and rapid global dissemination of image-based texts in the twenty-first century. Such texts combine two or more modes, such as images, words, sounds, and gestures. Sites for the circulation of multimodal literacies - online and offline - serve to disrupt, reify, or perhaps even exacerbate racial identities, prejudice, and subordination in education. The review highlights the prevalent themes: (a) Discursive construction of race in the spoken mode, (b) Anti-racist and multimodal counter-narratives, (c) The racialisation of multimodal literature for children and adolescents, and (d) Race in music, visual and performing arts, and digital media. Gaps in CRT research and challenges are posed for future research of race in the context of cultural and technological change.

T1  - Injury resulting from targeted violence: An emergency department perspective
AN  - 2049906685
AB  - BackgroundHate crimes – those perpetrated because of perceived difference, including disability, race, religion, sexual orientation or transgender status – have not been studied at the point of the victim's hospital emergency department (ED) use.AimTo investigate the frequency, levels of physical harm and circumstances of targeted violence in those seeking treatment at EDs in three UK cities.MethodIn a multimethods study, face‐to‐face semi‐structured interviews were conducted with 124 adult ED attenders with violent injuries. Victim and perpetrator socio‐demographics were recorded. Patient narratives about perceived motives and circumstances were transcribed, uploaded onto NVivo for thematic analysis.ResultsNearly a fifth (23, 18.5%) of the injured patients considered themselves to have been attacked by others motivated by hostility or prejudice to their ‘difference’ (targeted violence). Thematic analyses suggested these prejudices were to appearance (7 cases), racial tension (5 cases), territorial association (3 cases) and race, religious or sexual orientation (8 cases). According to victims, alcohol intoxication was particularly relevant in targeted violence (estimated reported frequency 90% and 56% for targeted and non‐targeted violence, respectively).ConclusionsOur findings support a broader concept of hate victimisation and suggest that emergency room violence surveys could act as a community tension sensor and early warning system in this regard. Tackling alcohol misuse seems as important in this as in other forms of violence perpetration. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - Beyond the Westphalian rainbow: a dissident theory of supranational systems
AN  - 2571459790
AB  - Beyond the Westphalian rainbow: a dissident theory of supranational systems. Territory, Politics, Governance. This article focuses on the work of Adam Watson from the English School of International Relations for two purposes. The first is to highlight the potential it contains for transcending the prejudices imposed upon international relations theory by the anarchy assumption and by the reification of independent statehood. The second and the more specific purpose is to understand the formation of legitimate supranational systems once these prejudices are removed. Watson approaches supranationalism as an extant condition in international society rather than as a deviation from a normal condition of anarchy or independent statehood, and proposes a culturalist and a moralistic framework in which supranational systems can be legitimized. As a case study to determine which framework is more valid, I analysed the convention on the future of Europe and concluded that the moralistic serves better for understanding how the European Union is legitimized. Once juxtaposed with Neo-Weberian historical sociology’s insights into the state, Watson’s moralistic framework can offer a foundational theory for reconsidering legitimate supranational systems and open up new research agendas in international relations theory.Alternate abstract:摘要西伐利亚的国家集锦之外：超国家系统的异议理论。 Territory, Politics, Governance. 本文为了下述两造目的，聚焦来自国际关係英国学派的亚当．华生之着作：第一个目的在于强调它超越无政府预设和独立国家状态的具体化所施加在国际关係理论上的偏见之潜能。第二个更为具体的目的，在于理解上述偏见移除后，合法的超国家系统的形成。华生将超国家主义视为国际社会中的现行状态，而非无政府或独立国家状态的常规境况之外的偏差，并提出文化主义与道德主义的架构，其中超国家系统能够被合法化。我分析了欧盟未来制宪大会，作为証实何种架构更为有效的案例研究，并以道德架构能够更佳理解欧盟如何合法化的主张作结。当与新韦伯式历史社会学对国家的洞见并陈时，华生的道德架构能够提供重新思考合法的超国家系统之基础理论，并在国际关係理论中开啓崭新的研究议程。

T1  - Examining Discrimination against Women, non-Han Minorities, Intellectuals, and non-Communist Members among the Current China's Provincial Political Elites
AN  - 2025298334
AB  - Drawing on a new biographical database of the current provincial leaders, this article aims to test the hypothesis whether women, non-Han minorities, intellectuals, and non-Communist members are discriminated against in the Chinese political sphere. Our findings indicate that women, despite being underrepresented in leadership positions, do not suffer from discrimination in obtaining chief positions, after controlling for their capability related variables. Non-Communist members are still facing the glass ceiling, preventing their rise to the top of China's power structure, while at the same time being underrepresented in leadership positions. However, there is no evidence showing that intellectuals (i.e., doctoral degree holders) and non-Han minorities are suffering from underrepresentation, inequality, and discrimination. Further analysis indicates that traditional prejudice, discriminatory rule manipulation, and no well-defined and legally binding quotas are fundamental causes contributing to women's underrepresentation in power structure and non-Communist members' political discrimination.

T1  - Social Transformation and Human Mobility: Reflections on the Past, Present and Future of Migration
AN  - 2024042324
AB  - This article examines the development of international migration in the context of broader changes in global economic and political formations since the late 1940s. It also reflects on changing official policies and public attitudes to migration, as well as on the emergence of migration studies as a special interdisciplinary area of the social sciences. Four phases are discussed: 1. The period of concentration of investment in the old industrial areas of Western Europe up to the mid- 1960s , which led to attraction of mainly lower-skilled labour as 'guestworkers' or post-colonial migrants. Prejudice against newcomers was interpreted mainly in social-psychological terms as a 'natural reaction' against newcomers. 2. The beginnings of a new wave of globalisation in the 1970s and 1980s. Manufacturing employment in old core industrial areas fell, while new industrial economies (based largely on low pay and anti-union policies) burgeoned. Western European governments tried to send home the 'guestworkers'. The failure of such policies led to the emergence of multicultural societies. At the same time, the growing economies of the Gulf oil states and some Asian 'tigers' pulled in millions of workers, bound by very strict and often discriminatory contracts. 3. From the late 1980s to the recession of 2008 the globalisation of investment and production reached new heights. Cheaper transport and the growth of new media supported the growth of international migration at all skill levels. Developed countries cut back on education costs by importing human capital from countries like India and China, while denying the need for low-skilled workers. Yet the lack of nationals willing to take such jobs fuels the growth of temporary contract migration and irregular movement. Increasingly, migrants have come to be seen as a threat to jobs for low-skilled nationals and as a danger to national security. 4. The article argues that a new phase in global change is emerging following the 2008 crisis, and examines possible trends and their meaning for human mobility in the 21st century.

T1  - The Process of the Universalization of Holocaust Education: Problems and Challenges
AN  - 2019980026
AB  - This article discusses the process of the universalization of Holocaust education and sets its conceptual and educational framework, highlighting its pedagogical challenges and hazards. It explores the phenomenon of the universalization of Holocaust education as a means to combat racism and to analyze how a particularistic educational issue has become the subject of global, universalistic concern. Through reviewing current literature, it argues that the complexity of this approach needs to be considered, particularly with the increasing violence and xenophobia in the world. Drawing on the paradigm of the Holocaust, this universal approach to anti-racist education to promote peace and harmony globally within civil society has been promoted as a way of countering prejudice. However, there are pitfalls to seeking universal lessons from a particularistic event. These challenges can be addressed to advance anti-racist education using the Holocaust as a case study and thus developing a reflective culture of remembrance.

The current research, informed by conversation analysis and discursive psychology, examines how speakers manage such troubles‐in‐speaking in public settings. The sample of naturalistic data includes five such instances and related apologies sourced from YouTube and news websites. The analysis examined how speakers initiated repairs when making offensive racial slips and gaffes and followed these up with apologies. Self‐detected transgressions were repaired in fewer turns than other‐detected blunders. Speakers accounted for their transgressions as innocent mishaps (e.g., ‘it was just a slip of the tongue’, ‘an honest mistake’) to fend off attributions of prejudice or a racist identity. Thus, a common resource that speakers drew upon to exonerate themselves was that what they said, did not align with their psychological intentions. Intention then was a notable psychological resource for denying and fending off attributions of prejudice. Follow‐up apologies were related organizationally and worked to either address or decrease the likelihood of dispreferred responses from the public/audience. These apologies included the use of affect, graduation, amplification, and judgements of capacity. Although this research does not address the possible psychological nature of racial slips and gaffes – the question of what they really mean – their occurrence in everyday life and institutional settings suggest that their repressive qualities reflect shared patterns of understanding in societies structured by racial inequality.

T1  - Rhetoric and Etiological Beliefs About Sexuality: Reader Responses to Cynthia Nixon's New York Times Interview
AN  - 2002462532
AB  - In 2012, the U.S. actress Cynthia Nixon was quoted in the New York Times Magazine as having stated that "for me, it [being gay] is a choice. I understand that for many people it's not, but for me it's a choice, and you don't get to define my gayness for me." The interview attracted international media attention and public criticism by lesbian and gay activists. This article suggests a rhetorical approach to understanding etiological beliefs and provides a discursive analysis of 198 online comments by readers of Pink News, a gay news Web site that reported on Nixon's controversial interview. This article explores common arguments used in readers' comments about Nixon and examines the rhetorical construction of sexuality. The analysis examines three themes within the data. First, biological essentialism was treated by many readers as common knowledge; second, readers suggested that only bisexuals have "choice"; and, third, it was suggested by both Nixon's critics and her supporters that counterarguments colluded with homophobia. The article suggests that there is an ideological dilemma whereby both "born-this-way" and "choice" arguments can be understood as colluding with anti-gay prejudice.

T1  - Media Representation of Tongxinglian in China: A Case Study of the People's Daily
AN  - 1977678354
AB  - Over the past few decades, the worldwide lesbian and gay movements have diversified and increased their rights claims. The achievement of gay rights claims in society is the result of an interplay among various social factors and forces. Media is one of most influential players in building homosexual images and promoting mutual understanding. Chinese homosexuals were not treated as criminals or mental illness patients anymore in 1997 and 2001, respectively, after decriminalization and depathologization. Thus this article aims to explore how homosexuals were portrayed in the official media of China, particularly the People's Daily, to illustrate the changing perception of homosexuals in China's political and social spheres. It argues that representation of homosexuals in the People's Daily changed gradually from a negative perception to a more positive one with less discrimination and prejudice as shown by the article's quantitative and qualitative results.

T1  - Young sexual minority women's definition of community: Toward addressing health disparities in the LGBTQQ community
AN  - 1977214846
AB  - In accord with Healthy People 2020 goals, the elimination of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQQ) health disparities will require community-level strategies to address stigma, discrimination, and prejudice linked to poor health. We explored how young sexual minority women (YSMW) define LGBTQQ community, community connection, community engagement, and community tensions because these concepts have implications for development and evaluation of health disparities interventions. A total of 30 YSMW (aged 18-24 years) from Michigan participated in semistructured, in-depth interviews. Participants varied by sexual identity, residency, and race/ethnicity. We analyzed transcribed interviews using thematic analysis and compared emergent themes across sexual identity, residency, and race/ethnicity. Women described community connection in terms of organizational involvement, participation in LGBTQQ spaces, and collective social identity. Participants noted how community connections were linked to stigma towards the LGBTQQ community. YSMW highlighted how divisive tensions exist within subgroups constituting the LGBTQQ community, hindering opportunities for social advocacy, unified policy priorities, and community-level interventions. The heterogeneity of YSMW's experiences identifying with the LGBTQQ community and engaging within LGBTQQ spaces suggest that researchers should attend to the role of community dynamics when developing health disparities interventions and policies. Efforts to reconcile tensions within the LGBTQQ community may strengthen and advance policymakers' ability to address sexuality-related disparities.

T1  - Predicting support for marriage equality in Australia
AN  - 1966005146
AB  - Objective
The marriage equality debate is becoming increasingly prominent in Australian political and media discourse. Moreover, as policy that would legislate marriage equality continues to be debated in political circles, public opinion on the topic appears to be becoming increasingly divided. This article presents a cross-sectional study exploring predictors of support for marriage equality.
Method
A sample of 137 Australians (66% females) responded to a series of demographic items, a measure of attitudes towards gay men and lesbian women, and a forced-choice question asking whether or not they would support marriage between two people--regardless of their gender.
Results
The results revealed that support for marriage equality in this sample was predicted by religious affiliation, political orientation, and sexual prejudice. More specifically, individuals in support of marriage equality were more likely to be non-religious, politically liberal, and have more positive attitudes towards gay men (attitudes towards lesbian women were unrelated to support for marriage equality). Age and gender did not predict support for marriage equality.
Conclusions
Support for marriage equality in Australia can be predicted by social attitudes and demographic variables. These findings are discussed in terms of the implications of maintaining the legal status quo, which mandates marriage inequality.

T1  - The "Wallpaper Effect" Revisited: Divergent Findings on the Effects of Intergroup Contact on Attitudes in Diverse Versus Nondiverse Contexts
AN  - 1924453526
AB  - This article reexamines the so-called "wallpaper effect" of intergroup contact, which contends that for minority group members living in areas more densely populated by majority group members, intergroup contact fails to reduce prejudice. We tested this claim in five studies, using data from five countries, two types of contexts, a range of measures, and involving different minority versus majority groups. Using multilevel cross-level interaction models, we considered whether effects of contact on outgroup attitudes were moderated by relative outgroup size. Results failed to replicate the previously reported findings, revealing, by and large, nonsignificant cross-level moderation effects; instead, we witnessed consistent positive contact effects on attitudes. Findings are discussed against the backdrop of recent research on the consequences of diversity, as well as context-based considerations regarding minority versus majority constellations. We also discuss some exceptions to our findings that emerged for some respondent groups and contexts across the five studies.

T1  - Beyond the Binary: Exploring the Role of Ambiguity in Biphobia and Transphobia
AN  - 1911627540
AB  - A sample of 273 college students who were heterosexual completed measures of religious fundamentalism and three aspects of social cognition to test the proposition that there are key differences between the bases of different sexual and gender prejudices (homophobia, transphobia, and biphobia). Specifically, because bisexuality and transgenderism are ambiguous by nature, with bisexuality challenging the sexual orientation binary and transgenderism challenging the gender binary, it was predicted that fear of invalidity and possibly need for structure would be associated with greater biphobia and transphobia, but not homophobia, over and above the general effect of religious fundamentalism. Need for cognition was predicted to be associated with lower prejudice across homophobia, biphobia, and transphobia. Results were supportive of the predictions, with fear of invalidity being associated with transphobia and biphobia, but not homophobia, even after controlling for religious fundamentalism and the other social cognition variables.

T1  - Informal Training Experiences and Explicit Bias against African Americans among Medical Students
AN  - 2424651982
AB  - Despite the widespread inclusion of diversity-related curricula in U.S. medical training, racial disparities in the quality of care and physician bias in medical treatment persist. The present study examined the effects of both formal and informal experiences on non-African American medical students’ (N = 2,922) attitudes toward African Americans in a longitudinal study of 49 randomly selected U.S. medical schools. We assessed the effects of experiences related to medical training, accounting for prior experiences and attitudes. Contact with African Americans predicted positive attitudes toward African Americans relative to white people, even beyond the effects of prior attitudes. Furthermore, students who reported having witnessed instructors make negative racial comments or jokes were significantly more willing to express racial bias themselves, even after accounting for the effects of contact. Examining the effects of informal experiences on racial attitudes may help develop a more effective medical training environment and reduce racial disparities in healthcare.

AB  - Most bias crime literature focuses on adults despite the fact that youth account for a large proportion of prejudice-motivated violence. The LA County Commission on Human Relations data for all bias crimes from 2002-2008 was used to examine similarities and differences between adult and youth suspects of bias-motivated crimes. Findings showed youth victims of racial bias crimes were 12 times more likely to be targeted by youth suspects and over five times more likely to commit property offenses. Public places were nearly three times more likely than resident places to be the location of the bias crime by youth suspects. Female perpetrators of racial bias crimes were two times more likely to be youths. Implications of the findings are discussed.

T1  - Effects of majority members' positive intergroup contact on minority members' support for ingroup rights: Mobilizing or demobilizing effects?
AN  - 1891309302
AB  - While some research suggests that ethnic and cultural diversity hinders societal cohesion, other studies show that it promotes intergroup contact opportunities, which, if exploited, help to overcome intergroup prejudice. Recently, however, intergroup contact theory has been criticized for neglecting the wider social context as well as for ignoring potential demobilizing contact effects for minority members. Using two cross-sectional general population surveys (European Social Survey in 22 countries, Swiss MOSAiCH), we address these criticisms by examining whether ethnic majority members' positive contact influences ethnic minority members' support for ingroup rights at the social context level. Applying multilevel path analysis, we show that minority members are more likely to support anti-discrimination laws and immigrant rights when living in social contexts in which majority members have positive intergroup contact experiences. Theoretical and practical implications of our findings are discussed for understanding how minority groups are affected by the climate of the social context they reside in.

T1  - Overarching findings
AN  - 1863793839
AB  - The issue of racism in the Australian Football League (AFL) is one that has been officially recognized since 1995. Since then, the AFL, the AFL Players Association (AFLPA) and the AFL clubs have been bound by the rules of the code, specifically Rule 35, to deal with racism, racial and religious intolerance and racist abuse, as well as other forms of vilification, when it has arisen. The most recent player-to-player vilification incident occurred in 2011 and involved Western Bulldogs forward Justin Sherman and Gold Coast Sun defender Joel Wilkinson. Despite the problems that many had with Sherman’s suspension, which still allowed him to play with the Western reserves side, what was very marked was the speed of the process from the lodgement of complaint to the suspension. This would seem to indicate that when it comes to such matters, the AFL is serious about dealing with racial vilification and it wanted to send a message to all the clubs and players. In the weeks and months after the incident, what become quite evident was the damage Sherman has sustained to his reputation as a professional athlete: his ‘brand’ is tarnished from here on. Furthermore, the overarching message from this incident as it related to the AFL was that racism in any form is wrong and it will not be tolerated. The main aims of this project were to assess the ways that AFL players have engaged with the education programmes and professional development offered, and how they understand issues of race, racism, ethnicity and difference within the professional environment of elite football in the AFL, and by association, the everyday. The reason for this is the length of time that has passed since Michael Long made his stance in 1995 and the resources that have gone into educating the players on these matters. What this book is seeking to provide is an understanding of the efficacy of those programmes in educating professional elite athletes about racial and religious issues within the AFL and also the athletes’ everyday lives and extended communities. This is important given that the AFL has become an international and national leader on this issue and its corporate and community standing is heavily connected to by Rule 35 and its associated programmes.

AB  - This paper looks at the context with which the research for the collection came out of. It draws on recent examples in the media and football and connects that up to the examples in the past particularly the incidents in the AFL that involved Nicky Winmar in 1993 and Michael Long in 1995 and the introduction of Rule 35. This paper sets the scene from which the rest of the collection positions itself.

T1  - Changing Attitudes Toward Older Adults Through a Simulated Aging Exercise: Implications for Family Therapy
AN  - 1772856104
AB  - Past research suggests that many young people hold negative attitudes toward the elderly. Simulated aging is one method to reduce aging that had been successfully applied with those individuals working in the helping professions. However, it has not yet been applied to ordinary young adults. The current study examined whether a simulated aging activity would cause more positive attitudes toward the aged, an increased desire to help, and higher satisfaction with life. Seventy-eight college students participated; half were randomly assigned to complete three tasks with sensory deficits designed to simulate aging (i.e., wearing non-magnified glasses covered with petroleum jelly, wearing foam earplugs, and wearing cloth gloves), and half served as the control. Three questionnaires were completed that measured attitudes toward older adults, prosocial desires, and satisfaction with life. Results showed that young adults who experienced simulated aging had more favorable attitudes toward older adults than did individuals in the control condition. These results suggest that simulated aging activities may be an effective method to reduce ageism. This has potential implications for multigenerational family therapy, such as to assist younger people to understand what their grandparents may be experiencing.

T1  - Support for far right ideology and anti-migrant attitudes among youth in Europe: A comparative analysis
AN  - 1728660721; 201535816
AB  - The last decade has seen a notable increase in support for far right parties and an alarming rise of right-wing extremism across Europe. Drawing on a new comparative youth survey in 14 European countries, this article provides deeper insight into young people's support for nationalist and far right ideology: negative attitudes towards minorities, xenophobia, welfare chauvinism and exclusionism in relation to migrants. We first map the support for far right ideology among youth in Europe, and then use multilevel regression analysis (16,935 individuals nested in 30 locations) to investigate which individual or contextual factors are associated with a higher propensity among young people towards getting involved in far right movements. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'We Inspire Each Other, Subconsciously': The Circulation of Attitudes towards Difference between Polish Migrants in the UK and their Significant Others in the Sending Society
AN  - 2076975345
AB  - In this article, I explore how attitudes towards difference in terms of ethnicity, religion, sexuality and gender travel between Polish migrants to the UK and their significant others in Poland. In doing so, I bring together and critically engage with two disparate literatures-on social remittances and family and peer transmission of attitudes. I demonstrate that what occurs between Polish migrants and their non-migrant significant others is a complex process in which favourable and prejudiced attitudes are passed on, challenged, rejected or negotiated. While I stress that both migrants and non-migrants influence each other's perceptions of difference, I show that non-migrants are more likely to assume the 'correctness' of migrant's attitudes due to the construction of migrants as trusted experts. Acknowledging the multidimensionality and simultaneity of such mutual influences, in the article, I call for the use of the term 'circulation' to describe the mobility of ideas, values and attitudes between people and places.

T1  - I Don't Think You Like Me Very Much: Child Minority Status and Disadvantage Predict Relationship Quality With Teachers
AN  - 1703407761
AB  - Even when accounting for past performance, academic achievement can be influenced by teacher expectations, which are lower for disadvantaged and visible ethnic minority children. We use a Quebec (Canada) population-based sample (N = 1,311) to examine whether ethnicity and teacher-perceived signs of disadvantage in kindergarten predict child reports of their relationship with teachers in fourth grade. Results suggest that visible minority children were 50% less likely and perceived disadvantaged children were 32% less likely to report having a positive relationship with their teacher. The findings are discussed in terms of directing efforts toward reducing teacher prejudice and improving child academic success.

T1  - Transforming Higher Education Through Mother Tongue Teaching: A Case Study of One South African University
AN  - 1799007502
AB  - This paper reports on how one South African university has responded to a call for transformation in Higher Education by formulating a language policy that emphasizes the use of an African language as the medium of instruction. This was a qualitative study located within the interpretive paradigm. Methods used in the study included reflections and literature review. The objectives of the study were threefold, that is, to understand how University X understands transformation, to establish how this University has responded to transformation, and to explore the extent to which University X has succeeded in implementing the mother tongue policy as a way of responding to transformation. Results indicate that the language policy is being implemented with some success. It also shows that there are negative attitudes towards this move as well as serious challenges that require human resource and materials development, which have financial implications. The paper acknowledges the need to extend the debate to include different stakeholders and to develop strategies to increase the participants' awareness of the importance of teaching in the mother tongue in institutions of higher learning.

T1  - Attitudes about Childlessness and Infertility Treatments: A Comparison of Turkish and American University Students 1
AN  - 1785001844
AB  - Studies of contemporary attitudes about childlessness and infertility have focused mainly on highly industrialized countries, with less attention to developing countries like Turkey. This project explored attitudes about childlessness and infertility treatments and their interrelations among university students, who are often the forerunners of new attitudes and social change, in Turkey (N = 850) and the United States (Florida; N = 761). Turkish students, especially men, reported more negative attitudes about permanent childlessness and reported more positive attitudes about ethics and availability of infertility treatments. Students in Florida had more favorable attitudes toward childlessness and supported broader social access to infertility treatments (e.g., for those who were unmarried or who had chosen to delay childbearing). Women in both samples generally reported more positive attitudes about childlessness and the ethics and availability of infertility treatments than men. In addition, Turkish students who were female, from urban areas, or who aspired to a doctoral education reported more positive attitudes about childlessness than others. Regression analyses of pooled data confirmed persistent gender and country differences. In both samples, positive attitudes about childlessness were correlated with support for broader social access to infertility treatments. The results suggest that infertility treatments are viewed as a means for avoiding childlessness by those with traditional perspectives, but are seen as a mechanism for allowing for broader social access to parenthood and greater choice about reproduction among those with less traditional viewpoints.

T1  - Perceptions of and Objections to Christianity Among Unchurched and Dechurched Adults
AN  - 1768532498
AB  - Mars Hill Church—a large multisite church centered in Seattle—commissioned research examining the perceptions of and objections to Christianity among unchurched and dechurched adults in the United States. ‘‘Unchurched’’ persons were defined as those who attend worship services every few months or less and who did not regularly attend worship services growing up. The ‘‘dechurched’’ were defined as persons who attend worship services every few months or less but who regularly attended services as a child. Data were gathered using both a quantitative and a qualitative component. For the quantitative portion, GfK Public Affairs and Corporate Communications conducted a nationwide telephone survey using random digit dialing (RDD). To qualify for the study, respondents had to be between 18 and 44 years of age and be either unchurched (n = 259) or dechurched (n = 741) as defined above. The surveys were conducted on landlines and cell phones between late April and early June 2013 and took roughly 12 min each. Saurage Marketing Research conducted the qualitative portion of the research, which consisted of eight focus groups with unchurched and dechurched U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 44 years. The groups were held in Austin, Boston, Phoenix, and San Francisco. In each city, two focus groups were conducted: one with women and another with men. The groups involved 68 respondents in total, who were selected to maintain diversity in terms of educational level and church experience for each group.The findings reveal that a majority of survey respondents describe themselves as spiritual, whether ‘‘very’’ (21 %) or ‘‘somewhat’’ (35 %). Being at least somewhat spiritual is much more common among the dechurched (61 %) than among the unchurched (42 %). The respondents tended to understand Christianity as mostly about acceptance, tolerance, and the Golden Rule, and they criticized Christians for not living in accordance with those values. While some tried to avoid over-generalizing, most respondents viewed Christians as off-putting. Many think that Christianity and Christian leaders play on fear of death and the unknown, and that Christianity is primarily an existential ‘‘crutch’’ that they do not need. For most respondents, their perceptions of church are derived from their exposure to the Catholic Church, Evangelical mega-churches, and television preachers.The primary objection to Christianity across all focus groups and demographics was that some Christians are too intolerant (55 % of survey respondents indicated this as an objection). Beliefs about sexuality and reproduction—especially gay marriage and abortion—were the second leading objection (50 %), followed in third place by the role of Christianity in U.S. politics (49 %).

T1  - “The White Space”
AN  - 2406941943
AB  - Since the end of the Civil Rights Movement, large numbers of black people have made their way into settings previously occupied only by whites, though their reception has been mixed. Overwhelmingly white neighborhoods, schools, workplaces, restaurants, and other public spaces remain. Blacks perceive such settings as “the white space,” which they often consider to be informally “off limits” for people like them. Meanwhile, despite the growth of an enormous black middle class, many whites assume that the natural black space is that destitute and fearsome locality so commonly featured in the public media, including popular books, music and videos, and the TV news—the iconic ghetto. White people typically avoid black space, but black people are required to navigate the white space as a condition of their existence.

T1  - Validity and Reliability of the Spanish Translation of the Attitudes Towards Divorce Scale
AN  - 1667952659; 201511883
AB  - The set of studies described in this article analyzed the psychometric properties of the Attitudes Towards Divorce Scale (ATDS; Kinnaird & Gerrard, 1986) in a group of 964 Spanish emerging adults between 18 and 30 years old. Factorial validity, concurrent validity, internal reliability, and measurement invariance across males and females were examined. Two factors accounted for 50% of the total variance: positive and negative attitudes toward divorce. This 2-factor structure fit adequately in males and females. The internal consistency of the questionnaire was good (Cronbach's a = .74), and its convergent validity was supported by a significant positive correlation with the Attitudes Towards Marriage Scale and gender differences in attitudes toward divorce. Overall, the results suggest that the AD, the Spanish version of the ATDS, is a reliable and valid instrument that could be used to measure Spanish emerging adults' attitudes toward divorce.

T1  - What Makes a Young Assertive Bystander? The Effect of Intergroup Contact, Empathy, Cultural Openness, and In-Group Bias on Assertive Bystander Intervention Intentions
AN  - 1559005085; 201433440
AB  - The present research tests the indirect effects of intergroup contact on adolescents' bystander intervention intentions via four potential mediators: 'empathy,' 'cultural openness,' 'in-group bias,' and 'intergroup anxiety.' British adolescents (N = 855), aged 11-13 years, completed measures of intergroup (interethnic) contact and the identified indirect variables. Intended bystander behavior was measured by presenting participants with an intergroup (immigrant) name-calling scenario. Participants rated the extent to which they would behave assertively. The findings extend previous intergroup contact research by showing a significant indirect effect of intergroup contact on assertive bystander intentions via empathy, cultural openness and in-group bias (but not via intergroup anxiety). Theoretical implications and practical suggestions for future prejudice-reduction interventions are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Personality Factors and Attitudes Toward Euthanasia in Iran: Implications for End-of-Life Research and Practice
AN  - 1494751090; 201404112
AB  - This article reports on the relationship of personality and euthanasia attitudes. Results from a survey of 165 Iranian students showed that religiosity, honesty-humility, agreeableness, and extraversion were related to negative attitudes toward euthanasia, whereas openness was related to acceptance of euthanasia, with the unconventionality facet driving this relationship. Moreover, openness explained additional variance when added to a multivariate model containing religiosity and HEXACO factors. This study illustrates the possibility of accounting for variation beyond the traditional group level predictors of attitudes toward euthanasia and promoting future cross-cultural studies into personality and end-of-life issues and informing end-of-life conversations at the bedside.

T1  - Familiarising the Gay, Queering the Family: Coming Out and Resilience in Mambo italiano
AN  - 1500941655
AB  - This article explores how two Italian-Canadian families negotiate the coming out of their sons in the film Mambo italiano, a comedy/ drama released in 2003 and set in Montreal, Canada. The Italian-Canadian protagonist, Angelo, after years of living in the closet, decides to tell his parents he is gay, outing at the same time his Italian-Canadian lover, Nino, and provoking initially strong and vexed reactions in their respective families. Although full of stereotypes and cliches on ethnicity and gender identities, and following closely the so-called coming-out films' genre, arguably concerned with positive representations of gay coming-out experiences, the film portrays the ironic, creative, and interesting ways in which these Italian-Canadian families negotiate a coming out despite the homophobic prejudices they are imbued with. Moving from studies of family resilience, this article argues that the major strategies used for integrating gayness into the family are drawn from the resources available to (post)migrant families. These are the use of rituals and the adaptation of ethnic schemata to new realities in order to cope with the unfamiliar, and the ability to envision family as an evolving and changeable reality, as this capability and the hope for a better future is what had sustained the survival of migrants in a hostile land. These considerations are backed up with reference to Italian-Canadian and Italian-North/American gay, lesbian, and bisexual (GLB) writers, whose concerns are similar to those found in Mambo italiano.

T1  - Can Numbers Lie? Race, Data Collection, and Black and Italian Infant and Maternal Health Care in Early Twentieth Century New York City
AN  - 1462012846
AB  - In 1899, W. E. B. Du Bois warned in The Philadelphia Negro, the first sociological study produced in the United States, that persons creating statistical studies must be aware that, left unchecked, inaccuracies fueled by individual biases may distort their work as much as errors arising from flawed methodologies and observations. Building upon this early caveat and contemporary admonitions from sociologists Tukufu Zuberi and Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, the author examines two 1924 pamphlets, Health Work for Mothers in a Colored Community and Protecting the Mother and Child. Both were compiled and published from data created by the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor which, respectively, covered infant and maternal health demonstrations conducted among two neighborhood groupings of impoverished African American and British West Indian mothers and children, and Southern Italian mothers and children. When these pamphlets are compared against internal unpublished data, inconsistencies arise which may have resulted from then commonly held racially-gendered biases against blacks and Italians. In turn, these biases-coupled with the desire to publish efficacious outcomes-mav have led the AICP to change the initial focus of its health experiment with black mothers and children from respiratory diseases to syphilis; to explain failed morbidity and mortality outcomes among Southern Italian infants by attacking mothers for their cultural preference for midwives; and, in both cases, to publish statistical data more positively than that contained in source materials. In sum, Du Bois' exhortation stands as powerfully today as over a century ago: even well-meaning researchers should check personal biases at the door before creating, conducting, and publishing statistical studies of racialized minority groups. To do otherwise may result in flawed data supporting the very biases that they may aim to overcome. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Inter-Ethnic Neighbourhood Acquaintances of Migrants and Natives in Germany: On the Brokering Roles of Inter-Ethnic Partners and Children
AN  - 2076975954
AB  - Social scientists have long emphasised the importance of personal inter-ethnic contact for overcoming prejudices and enhancing social cohesion in mixed societies. But why do some people have more contact with their neighbours of other ethnicity? Using new data from a large-scale German survey, I analyse the brokering roles of children and inter-ethnic partners in explaining inter-ethnic neighbourhood acquaintances. Even on a contextual level, my results suggest that people living in regions with larger shares of children have more inter-ethnic neighbourhood acquaintances, which expands earlier findings on the general integrating function of children. However, I also argue that we should recognise brokering to be context-specific and exemplify this by showing how the brokering role of inter-ethnic partners is evident particularly in interaction with inter-ethnic encounters at local bars and restaurants, while that of children is evident particularly given their frequent inter-ethnic encounters in public parks and playgrounds. On a theoretical level, my results demonstrate the importance of studying the interaction of mechanisms in explaining personal (inter-ethnic) contact.

T1  - The Effect of Psychoeducation on Attitudes Toward Bisexuality
AN  - 1463011650; 201347129
AB  - The attitudes of 124 heterosexual college students were measured using the Attitudes Regarding Bisexuality Scale before and after reading a factual excerpt on bisexuality, an autobiographical excerpt of a bisexual woman, or an article unrelated to bisexuality. Tolerance toward bisexuality and the belief in the stability of bisexuality were assessed. Results showed that factual information was more effective in increasing the belief that bisexuality is stable compared to exposure to personal information. No change was found in tolerance toward bisexuality under any of the conditions. Factual information is a valuable tool in addressing negative attitudes towards bisexuality.

T1  - STIGMA TOWARDS PLWHA: THE ROLE OF INTERNALIZED HOMOSEXUAL STIGMA IN LATINO GAY/BISEXUAL MALE AND TRANSGENDER COMMUNITIES
AN  - 1512218380; 201410430
AB  - Stigma negatively affects the health of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Negative attitudes and discriminatory actions towards PLWHA are thought to be based, among other factors, on stigma towards sexual minorities and beliefs about personal responsibility. Yet, there is little evidence to support these linkages and explain how they take place, especially among Latinos. This study analyzes attitudes towards PLWHA among 643 Latino gay/bisexual men and transgender (GBT) people. It examines whether discriminatory actions are predicted by beliefs about personal responsibility and internalized homosexual stigma. Results indicate that Discriminatory Actions towards PLWHA is associated with HIV/AIDS Personal Responsibility Beliefs and Internalized Homosexual Stigma. Further, HIV/AIDS Personal Responsibility Beliefs partially mediates the relationship between Internalized Homosexual Stigma and Discriminatory Actions towards PLWHA. Latino GBT persons who have internalized negative views about homosexuality may project those onto PLWHA. They may think PLWHA are responsible for their serostatus and, hence, deserving of rejection.

T1  - The Place of Liberal Education in Contemporary Higher Education
AN  - 1438560761; 201341236
AB  - Inasmuch as an education seeks to lead a human being to some desired end, it aims to be formative. To say that every education seeks to form a human being in light of some designated end or telos is to say that one can receive an education in many different things or many different ends. This point is sharpened -- and made more problematic -- when we think about the fundamental end of all of the various kinds of education. Here, the opening of Augustine's short work On Christian Doctrine is instructive. Like Plato's Socrates does in the first book of the Republic, Augustine begins this work by noting that ultimately education requires human beings to think about the question of how they should live. At its peak, human education is inextricably caught up with our desire to answer the question what kind of human being do we really want to be. Taking responsibility (or "ownership" to use the wince-inducing jargon of contemporary Educational Schools) for this kind of education is a daunting task, both for students and for teachers. For it requires us to think courageously and seriously about a wide range of important -- and by no means easy -- historical, moral, political, philosophical, and theological questions. The sophistic alternatives to such education either set such weighty questions aside or dogmatically assume that these questions have already been definitively asked and answered. Such alternatives reduce all aspects of human education to forms of methodological training. In the names of expediency or ideological certainty, they all but ensure that we will remain enslaved to the particular prejudices of our particular caves. As Max Weber, the founder of modern sociology, made clear in his "Science as a Vocation" lecture nearly a century ago, if education is understood simply as the acquisition of a specific set of methodological skills, it fatalistically resigns itself to forming only "specialists without spirit or vision and voluptuaries without heart." Liberal education refuses to accept such radical lowering of the educational horizon. It understands that specialized forms of educations, in the final analysis, must be tied to the overarching concerns of human beings' most fundamental education. It understands that to the extent that education is a kind of specialization, it must eventually specialize in the end and perfection of human beings. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Risky Sexual Behaviors in Emerging Adults: Longitudinal Changes and Within-Person Variations
AN  - 1438556318; 201341531
AB  - This study examined longitudinal changes in condom use inconsistency and sexual encounters involving alcohol use and the within-person associations of these two risky sexual behaviors with other personal and contextual factors. Data were drawn from a sample of college students who completed surveys on four occasions across 3 years and included 317 participants (48% male; 32% African American, 28% Latino American, and 40% European American) who reported recent penetrative sexual activities on at least one of the occasions. Multilevel models revealed that, although condom use inconsistency increased and then leveled off over time, sexual encounters involving alcohol use showed a linear increase. Moreover, at times when students held more negative attitudes toward condoms than usual, they used condoms less consistently than usual; at times when students felt more anxious about HIV/AIDS than usual, they had more sexual encounters involving alcohol use than usual; and at times when students were involved in a serious relationship, they used condoms less consistently and had fewer sexual encounters involving alcohol use than usual. Findings demonstrate the utility of a developmental perspective in understanding sexual behaviors, the importance of examining the unique correlates of different risky sexual behaviors, and the distinctiveness between within-person versus between-person associations.

T1  - Attitudinal and Individual Differences Influence Perceptions of Mock Child Sexual Assault Cases Involving Gay Defendants
AN  - 1438556007; 201340290
AB  - Many people hold negative attitudes and stereotypes about gay men, including the stereotype that gay men are likely to be child molesters. This article explored the implications of this stereotype for judgments made in a hypothetical legal case involving child sexual abuse accusations against a male teacher by either a male or female victim. Mock jurors who held the most anti-gay attitudes and those who endorsed the stereotype of gay men as child molesters made the most pro-prosecution judgments in scenarios involving gay defendants. A new scale (the Stereotypes about Gays and Child Abuse scale) was developed to assess the extent to which participants endorsed the stereotype of gay men as being likely to sexually abuse children. This scale was a stronger predictor of case judgments than existing, more general scales measuring biases against homosexuality. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Marital Scales: Measurement of Intent, Attitudes, and Aspects Regarding Marital Relationships
AN  - 1429630328; 201338228
AB  - Studies on marital relationships focus on intent to marry, global positive or negative attitudes toward marriage, and expectations for what married life will be like. There are currently no instruments capable of assessing all three of these areas. This study outlines the development and validation of the Marital Scales. One is designed to measure intent to marry (Intent to Marry Scale), another is for general attitudes toward marriage (General Attitudes Toward Marriage Scale), and the last scale measures expectations for marital relationships (Aspects of Marriage Scale). They are also designed to be applicable for any individual, regardless of marital status or sexual orientation. Results demonstrated excellent factor structure, and good internal reliability and construct validity for the instrument. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Young People's Trends in Political Trust and Views of their Declining Sense of Duty
AN  - 1432709213
AB  - At European level, the society is facing one of the most serious concerns, namely the young people voter turnout and their non-involvement in politics. They also have poor opinions of politicians and parliamentary behaviour. Low trust suggests that something in the political system, politicians, institutions or both is thought to be poorly functioning. Studies show that Romanian young voters as well as the British ones have little expectations from the political system commitment, being pessimistic about the slogan: "Your today's vote can be your tomorrow's chance!" This article is meant to investigate the reasons why this is so, and to further debate young people's political views and behaviour, by suggesting solutions to help strengthen their bond to their local politicians and policy makers. Our research should also be viewed within the context of the evolution of political and citizenship education in schools, promoting initiatives and attitude change and focusing on answering a series of key research questions.

T1  - Mothers Affected by Domestic Violence: Intersections and Opportunities with the Justice System
AN  - 1504422371; 201407823
AB  - Secondary analysis from two qualitative studies was used to explore the interactions of mothers exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) with the justice system. Results were categorized according to three key themes: (a) negative interactions within the justice system, (b) positive interactions within the justice system, and (c) recommendations for an improved justice system response to domestic violence. Overall, findings suggested that mothers affected by domestic violence are confronted with negative attitudes and ineffectual practices within convoluted bureaucratic criminal justice systems, leaving many feeling revictimized. Despite the negative aspects of the legal system, women in both studies cited positive examples of feeling comforted, validated, and even empowered by the actions of the specific service providers. The findings of both studies underscore the need for greater efficiencies within the justice system and mandatory training for service providers, making it easier for women who have left their abusers to access appropriate support services, as well as the importance of affirmational support particularly when it can be provided by a peer with shared experiences. Future research is needed to guide the development of interventions that will limit the impacts of IPV exposure on child developmental outcomes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A feminist postcolonial examination of female principals' experiences in South African secondary schools
AN  - 1315601967; 201310232
AB  - A central theme that dominates most studies on gender and leadership in education is the emerging tendency towards mitigating pervasive forms of discrimination against females. Yet, women still remain, for the most part, a minority within leadership positions in education. Despite policy initiatives emphasising gender equity, discrimination, prejudice and stereotyping continue to perpetuate the myth of women's submissiveness and remain a redoubtable barrier for impeding women in acquiring leadership positions. The awareness of gender politics combined with challenges related to gender equity in organisations remain a thorny concern in education circles. This paper examines the barriers South African women experience. A qualitative approach was employed using a post-colonial feminist perspective. Findings indicate that stereotypes concerning female inadequacy as leaders persist and act to distort perceptions of male and female performance and potential. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Older women and their representations of old age: a qualitative analysis
AN  - 1283637125; 201306246
AB  - In this article we shall be analysing the representations of old age and ageing made by three generations of older women with different life stories (single, married, children and childless). Our principal findings, based on a qualitative analysis of 25 in-depth interviews conducted with three generations of older women (65-74, 75-84 and 85 and older), mainly reveal their reluctance and even refusal to define themselves as 'older or elderly women', largely due to persistent stereotypes linking old age to dependency, social isolation and fragility. Aware of the social prejudice regarding women and old age, they reject it unanimously. Older women represent a challenge to these homogenising preconceptions of old age, which they, on the contrary, experience in a multitude of ways, often enjoyable. Their conceptions of 'ageing well' are diverse and do not correspond to a clinical definition of ageing. Their representations of 'ageing well' and of ageing express positive values of autonomy, independence, consistency and integrity, maintenance of physical and intellectual health, and being socially active so they can 'stay in the swing of things', in the continuum of their lives and future projects, rather breaking with contemporary life or existing on the margins of society.

T1  - Women and warfare at the start of the twentieth century: the racialization of the 'enemy' during the South African War (1899-1902)
AN  - 1283644051; 201303298
AB  - The internment of Boer civilians in concentration camps by the British military authorities during the South African War of 1899-1902 was a highly controversial policy, not least because around 26,000 women and children were estimated to have died as a result of epidemics in the camps. Both supporters and opponents of the camps addressed the policy using gendered language rooted in ideas about British standards of 'civilization'. Apologists defined the camps as one of the protective measures of the chivalrous British authorities, and downplayed the significance of the mortality rates by blaming infant deaths on the maternal shortcomings of Boer women. Opponents, however, stressed similarities between the British and Boer peoples, and invoked gendered language to attack what were held to be barbaric policies towards defenceless members of the community. At the heart of both discourses was a belief in British aspirations to embody an ideal 'civilization', underpinned by traditional gender ideologies. The association of this concept of 'civilization' with not merely cultural but racial difference led to the development of a racialized image of the enemy, rooted perhaps more strongly in perceptions of the female Boer civilian than of the male soldier.

T1  - Easing in: Fluent processing brings others into the ingroup
AN  - 1125220033; 201240265
AB  - Four experiments demonstrated that perceptual fluency can facilitate categorization of others as ingroup members. In Experiment 1 (replications A, B, and C), White participants were first exposed to a group of White target individuals and later judged whether fluent (repeated) and disfluent (novel) targets were members of a particular ingroup or not. In each replication, fluent targets were categorized as ingroup members more readily than were disfluent ones. Experiment 2 replicated and extended this finding by showing that both White (racial ingroup) and Black (racial outgroup) targets were more frequently perceived as school ingroup members when fluent (repeated). In Experiments 3 and 4, fluency was manipulated via visual clarity and, again, fluency engendered more ingroup categorizations than did disfluency, for both racial ingroup and outgroup targets. Moreover, findings from Experiment 4 suggested that liking fully mediated the fluency-ingroup categorization relation. Implications of these findings for the literatures on fluency and intergroup relations are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Speaking of Privilege: Family Therapy Educators' Journeys toward Awareness and Compassionate Action
AN  - 1285243508; 22690858
AB  - This study explores how family therapy educators from privileged social locations understand issues of privilege and the process by which they integrate their personal and professional journeys to create and model equity in family therapy training and professional development. These educators developed awareness about issues of privilege and oppression and owned their privilege. Increased awareness involved personal struggles with guilt and managing internalized voices of prejudice that are constantly reinforced in society. These educators adopted a stance of action and accountability for equity. We hypothesize that the process leading to owning one's privilege involves the ability to be compassionate for others' suffering and one's own limitations. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Nationalism versus multiculturalism: the minority issue in twenty-first-century Bulgaria
AN  - 2697558508
AB  - The paper negotiates ideas, views and beliefs of Bulgarians towards the ethnic minorities of their country published in the Bulgarian press during the period of 2005–2009. Through these aspects it becomes clear that three years after Bulgaria's accession to the European Union and despite various state attempts to integrate minorities – mostly initiated and funded by the EU and various governmental and non-governmental organizations – prejudice and racism have not been overcome, the Other is still differentiated and the way to multiculturalism is very long. The research field is limited to the Turkish and the Roma minorities, which are “visible” in the sense that they are officially recognized.

T1  - Models of integration in a settler society: caveats and complications in the US case
AN  - 1551002765; 201428961
AB  - The United States is a classic country of immigration that has long defined itself as having been built by successive waves of immigrants. Social scientists often speak of a multicultural or cultural pluralist 'model of integration' in the US that recognizes, sometimes even celebrates, diversity at the same time as it assumes and expects immigrants and their children to assimilate and become American. This article complicates the picture. It brings in history to show how national models of integration in the US are not stable but have changed over time. In fact, the very incorporation of earlier waves of immigrants in the past has contributed to these changes. It also considers local-level variation-that is, differences among US cities in policies as well as in widespread understandings about the integration of immigrants. Despite these complications, there are clearly ways that national models of integration matter in the US, which is the theme of the concluding section. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Commentary on the Treatment of Gender Variant and Gender Dysphoric Children and Adolescents: Common Themes and Ethical Reflections
AN  - 1266144056; 201300472
AB  - This commentary offers preliminary ethical reflections on the range of treatments for gender variant and gender dysphoric children, adolescents, and young adults described in the preceding five clinical articles. After clarifying the terminology used to discuss these issues, this commentary reviews several common themes of the clinical articles. Focusing on ethical values of informed consent, full disclosure, the minimization or avoidance of harm, and the maximization of life options, the commentary expresses concerns about various treatment options endorsed by some of the articles. In particular, this commentary focuses on how these practices problematically reproduce social prejudices and stereotypes and how they fail to acknowledge and embrace the multiple pathways for expressing one's gender. It also compares and contrasts the ethical issues related to gender variant and gender dysphoric youths and youths who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or queer. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Does the Lack of a Profit Motive Affect Hiring in Academe? Evidence from the Market for Lawyers
AN  - 900194625
AB  - The comparative performance of academic and economic markets continues to be debated. One factor potentially distinguishing academic markets is the profit motive. Profit and competition have been shown to curb discrimination in markets, and the absence of profit discipline could result in myriad forms of prejudice in academic hiring. We explore the role of the profit motive in the performance of academic markets by comparing the pedigree of employees of top law schools and top law firms. Top law schools are much more likely to employ graduates of top ranked law schools than elite law firms, and the difference exists at both the junior and senior levels. We find no evidence that the graduates of top 5 law schools outperform grads of less prestigious schools in publications or citations. In the absence of a profit motive, academic hiring appears more likely to indulge a preference for pedigree, and by implication, this may explain other scholarly prejudices in the academy.

T1  - Representing Noncitizens in Criminal Proceedings: Resolving Unanswered Questions in Padilla v. Kentucky
AN  - 1125217517; 201243114
AB  - In Padilla v. Kentucky, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that an attorney is obligated to tell a noncitizen client that pleading guilty to a crime may result in the client's forced removal from the United States. The defendant, Jose Padilla, claimed that his counsel failed to advise him that choosing to plead guilty might result in his deportation. This failure, Padilla argued, violated his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. The Court agreed: "constitutionally competent counsel would have advised him that his conviction for drug distribution made him subject to automatic deportation." In reaching this conclusion, the Court reasoned that "[o]ur longstanding Sixth Amendment precedents, the seriousness of deportation as a risk of a criminal plea, and the concomitant impact of deportation on families living lawfully in this country demand no less." Two major issues remain unresolved in the wake of this pivotal opinion. First, the Supreme Court did not say whether its decision should apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. To date, only three federal circuit courts have decided whether defendants whose convictions are final should be able to seek relief based on Padilla. As a result, most lower courts are forced to revisit this issue anew every time a defendant raises Padilla to challenge a final conviction. Second, it is uncertain whether Padilla will actually prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Court remanded the case to the Kentucky Supreme Court because it concluded that Padilla's entitlement to relief "will depend on whether he can demonstrate prejudice as a result [of counsel's deficient performance], a question we do not reach because it was not passed on below." Further clarification of these issues is imperative. These issues impact the lives of some of the most vulnerable people in the country -- noncitizens. Today, noncitizens, whether illegal aliens or lawful permanent residents, can be removed from the United States for even the most minor drug offenses. Once removed, the individual is often barred from coming back to the United States. So for an individual without United States citizenship, being found guilty in a criminal case means facing punishment associated not just with the crime itself, but also with the individual's legal status in the country. In light of these high stakes, federal and state courts throughout the United States require guidance to address immigration issues in criminal proceedings in a way that is uniform, just, and efficient. Lacking such guidance, they must apply the standard announced in Padilla, but with little direction as to whether the decision allows for retroactive application and what kind of "prejudice" a noncitizen defendant must prove to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. This Comment argues that Padilla v. Kentucky should be applied retroactively because it did not announce a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure. Next, this Comment argues that Jose Padilla was "prejudiced" and therefore meets the requirement under Strickland v. Washington for showing that his Sixth Amendment right was violated.

T1  - Involvement in Sport and Intention to Consume Alcohol: An Exploratory Study of UK Adolescents
AN  - 1545066684
AB  - We tested the hypothesis that school "athletes" and "non-athletes" differ in intentions to consume alcohol and get drunk, attitudes toward alcohol, and perceptions of subjective norms. We also investigated, using the theory of reasoned action, whether athletic involvement is a factor in predicting alcohol-related intentions. Data were obtained from students in a stratified sample of schools in a major Welsh city. Male athletes were significantly more likely than male non-athletes to intend to get drunk and to believe friends would approve of their alcohol consumption. For males, sporting involvement was a significant predictor of likelihood of getting drunk. In contrast, female athletes showed significantly more negative attitudes than did female non-athletes toward drinking alcohol. Differences in intentions were nonsignificant.

T1  - Plantation Economics, Violence, and Social Well-being: The Lingering Effects of Racialized Group Oppression on Contemporary Human Development in the American South
AN  - 1030865162; 201227827
AB  - Historic patterns of racialized oppression, discrimination, and prejudice have been linked to contemporary levels of racialized inequality. Such patterns are thought to be created and maintained through a series of institutions aimed at limiting access to resources for some while opening doors for others. It is expected that patterns of historical racialized inequality are the by-product of a historical lack of investment in the cultural capital of the local community, which later manifests itself in the form of low levels of human development, both in relational and absolute terms. In order to test this pattern in the American South, this link is tested using historical and contemporary data from the US Census Bureau, the National Institute for Literacy, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Center for Disease Control, the Historical American Lynching Project, and the Negro Participation Survey. Spatially-centered nested regression models provide support for this thesis through the identification of links to persistent patterns of underdevelopment in counties with a history of low levels of non-white education, school desegregation, racialized group mobilization, agricultural means of production, and a history of oppression through lynchings.

AN  - 907929169; 201125728
AB  - This article explores the question: what kind of relationship problems do bisexual people experience as a result bi-negative attitudes? It explores stereotypical representations of bisexuality focusing on bisexual identity, intimacy, and sexuality. Bisexuals are often cast as highly problematic or risky lovers or partners. Bisexual intimacies face erasure through invisibility, misrecognition through distortion, or condemnation through moral devaluation. The article locates the origin of common discourses on bisexual people's psychic deficiency, personal incapacity, and lack of loyalty in heteronormative and bi-negative conceptualizations of sexuality.

T1  - Social Dominance Orientation of Hungarian National Radicals
AN  - 905650542
AB  - The extremely radical (mostly youth) political organizations may be regarded as peculiar youth subcultures. We believe it is true not only for Hungary where relatively rich social scientific knowledge exists on the majority perception of such organizations. However, not many instances are found for the empirical sociological study of the organizations. The sample of the survey conducted in the autumn of 2010 by the Centre of Conflict Research at ELTE and the Sociology and Social Policy Department at the University of Debrecen consists of members of a right-wing paramilitary organization (The National Army of Guardsmen Heritage Protection and Civil Guard Organization) founded three years ago and, as control sample, the members of an environmental protection (non-radical, non-militant) organization (E-mission) operating in the same region (N=100-100 persons). The research focuses on new authoritarianism, which only partly rests on the "classical" authoritarianism, i.e. the socially determined pattern of the modern individual interiorized throughout socialization, as described by freudo-marxism in the beginning of the 20th century. In developing the theoretical background and the operationalization, besides traditional dimensions and socializational characteristics, we relied on theories (e. g. social dominance) and topics (e. g. conflict perception and reduction) which have not been applied in such studies before. Based on interpretational-statistical models, this paper analyses the socio-cultural factors that shape the social dominance orientation characteristics for the two sub-samples.

T1  - Who Counts? Hawai'i's Mahuwahine (Male-to-Female Transgenders) and Vulnerability to HIV/AIDS
AN  - 1037877426; 201234604
AB  - How are we to understand the situation of Hawai'i's transgenders? With little chance of their full inclusion in data-collection efforts or research studies, at least in the near future, what hope is there for the development of meaningful interventions or of equitable resource allocation? Even more, can this cycle of erasure, leading to continued erasure, be broken? What will this require and who should take the lead? In response to these questions, it is helpful to remember that health disparity issues are not isolated health system problems. In fact, health disparity is the cumulative result of both past and current forms of public policies, whether local or national. Within the U.S., barriers to quality health care may manifest in: lack of economic access to health care, prejudice or insensitivity of physicians and other healthcare providers, discriminatory policies and practices, lack of linguistic and cultural sensitivity, inadequate inclusion in healthcare research, and lack of data and limited collection methods, among others. Further, as the provision of funding and resources hinge on need, as demonstrated through data, these assets, too, are withheld. The risk of HIV among Hawai'i's mahuwahine is exacerbated by all these obstacles and barriers, related in part to conventional understandings of identity -- whether around race, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. This continued reliance on a standardised biomedical and western set of classifications, inattentive to the particularities of culture and of place, is one example of the many ways that local transgenders remain excluded from surveillance data or research efforts. As a result, it is difficult to develop responsive prevention or policy measures. Further, the continued absence of meaningful data fosters continued marginalisation, at the same time, suppressing opportunity and reinforcing the linkage between transgenders and social deviancy, irresponsibility and disease.

T1  - Acculturation Strategies and Mental Health in Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Youth
AN  - 758123251; 201058928
AB  - In this article, we examine the impact of acculturation strategies on minority stress and mental health in lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) youth in Flanders, Belgium. Building on previous identity minority studies and on the social stress model, we investigate how LGB youth acculturate within both the LGB subculture and mainstream society and how this correlates with their mental health. Our sample is taken from an online survey and represents 561 LGB youth aged 14 through 21. The four traditional acculturation strategies are represented in this population (integration, separation, marginalization, assimilation). Bisexual boys are mostly absent from separation and integration strategies; gay and lesbian youth in middle adolescence are significantly more represented in the separation strategy compared to their late adolescence counterparts. Further, our findings suggest the relevance of identification with the LGB community, especially for internalized negative attitudes toward homosexuality. LGB youth who identify with the LGB community score significantly lower on this internalized homonegativity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Stacked Deck: An Effective, School-Based Program for the Prevention of Problem Gambling
AN  - 902082256; 201123890
AB  - School-based prevention programs are an important component of problem gambling prevention, but empirically effective programs are lacking. Stacked Deck is a set of 5-6 interactive lessons that teach about the history of gambling; the true odds and "house edge"; gambling fallacies; signs, risk factors, and causes of problem gambling; and skills for good decision making and problem solving. An overriding theme of the program is to approach life as a "smart gambler" by determining the odds and weighing the pros versus cons of your actions. A total of 949 grade 9-12 students in 10 schools throughout southern Alberta received the program and completed baseline and follow-up measures. These students were compared to 291 students in 4 control schools. Four months after receiving the program, students in the intervention group had significantly more negative attitudes toward gambling, improved knowledge about gambling and problem gambling, improved resistance to gambling fallacies, improved decision making and problem solving, decreased gambling frequency, and decreased rates of problem gambling. There was no change in involvement in high risk activities or money lost gambling. These results indicate that Stacked Deck is a promising curriculum for the prevention of problem gambling.

T1  - Learning to control ethnic intergroup bias in childhood
AN  - 743065769; 201043058
AB  - The aim of this research was to identify what factors deter explicit intergroup bias in childhood. Two studies were conducted to examine what facilitates the control of ethnic bias amongst 6-9-year-old majority children. In both studies in-group accountability was either low (i.e., only accountable to experimenter) or high (i.e., also accountable to classmates and teachers). Study 1 (n = 287) found that only 8-9-year-old with low social emotions reduced their bias with increased accountability. Study 2 (n = 236) showed children with low Theory of Social Mind (ToSM: Abrams, Rutland, Ferrell, & Pelletier, 2009), who perceived an anti-prejudice in-group norm, decreased their bias when accountability increased. In both studies children high in social emotion and ToSM showed low bias irrespective of accountability. Together these studies make a novel contribution by showing for the first time affective and social-cognitive factors that influence how children learn to control explicit bias.

T1  - Young people's attitudes towards Muslims in Sweden
AN  - 743047852; 201031563
AB  - With the use of multiple regression technique, the principal objective of this study is to clarify and examine young people's attitudes towards Muslims, and the relationships between these attitudes and a large number of background factors. We use a representative sample of 9,498 non-Muslim youths between 15 and 19 years of age. The main results show that, when controlling for several background variables simultaneously, the country of birth, socio-economic background and school/programme factors all have an effect on the attitude towards Muslims. Moreover, socio-psychological factors, the relationship to friends and the perceptions of gender role patterns are found to be important. In addition, local factors like high levels of unemployment, high proportions of immigrants in a local environment also have an effect. No differences in the attitudes of boys and girls were found. Further, the study establishes a correlation between negative attitudes and right-wing populist seats in local government. Adapted from the source document.
