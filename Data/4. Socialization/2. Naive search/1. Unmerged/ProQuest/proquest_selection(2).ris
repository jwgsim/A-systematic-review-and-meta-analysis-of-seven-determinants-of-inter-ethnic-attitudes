T1  - <i>Possible</i> Citizens: Migration Enforcement as the Performance of Citizenship in the United Arab Emirates: IMR
AN  - 2685962047
AB  - While most boundary-making studies examine native-born citizens’ opposition to immigration, this article explains why immigrants develop anti-immigrant attitudes. Under what conditions do previous generations of immigrants develop solidarity with newcomers? When might immigrants, instead, police national boundaries and oppose further immigration or naturalization? I argue that under uncertain citizenship status, long-term immigrants are unlikely to develop solidarity with newcomers, despite common experience with exclusionary citizenship policies. Drawing on interviews with naturalization applicants in the United Arab Emirates, this article analyses how policies that unevenly distribute rights and protections to non-citizens structure relationships between immigrant groups. Moving beyond citizen/non-citizen binaries, it calls attention to hierarchies among non-citizens, examining how long-term immigrants with partial and conditional rights police national boundaries to navigate exclusionary policies. When states restrict citizenship, making it a scarce good, immigrants may respond to uncertainty by competing and, thus, limiting access to that good for newcomers. When naturalization is arduous, applicants face pressures to continually perform citizenship to prove that they deserve inclusion. Naturalization applicants lacked citizenship, but they immigrated to the UAE before the establishment of its guest-worker program and claimed Emirati identity by differentiating themselves from “migrant workers.” I show how migration enforcement and boundary-policing factored into their perceptions and performances of what it meant to be a “good” Emirati citizen. Ethnic hierarchies and the timing of migration created distinctions between immigrants eligible for naturalization and those who were not. The mere possibility of inclusion in the citizenry may generate hierarchies between immigrants, precluding solidarity, and encouraging boundary-policing.

T1  - Linkage from Self-Sacrifice to Hope Through the Intervening Roles of Perceived Family Support and Attitudes to Aging in Chinese Older Adults
AN  - 2699221882
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the relationships between self-sacrifice and hope as well as the possible intervening roles of perceived family support and attitudes to aging in this relationship among Chinese older adults. A total of 475 older adults participated in the current study. They completed measures related to self-sacrifice, hope, perceived family support, and attitudes to aging. Attitudes to aging measured the extent to which older adults hold positive and negative attitudes toward aging in three domains of physical change, psychological growth, and psychosocial loss. The results showed that self-sacrifice was positively associated with older adults’ hope. Mediation analyses revealed that perceived family support mediated the relationship between self-sacrifice and older adults’ hope. Moderated mediation analyses revealed that attitudes to physical change moderated the relationship between self-sacrifice and older adults’ hope, and attitudes to psychological growth moderated the relationship between perceived family support and older adults’ hope. Specifically, the association between self-sacrifice and hope was stronger for older adults with less positive attitudes to physical change than for those with more positive attitudes to physical change. The association between perceived family support and hope was stronger for older adults with more positive attitudes to psychological growth than for those with less positive attitudes to psychological growth. The findings can contribute to a better understanding of the relationship between self-sacrifice and hope and can aid in designing effective interventions aimed at improving older adults’ hope.

T1  - A New Second-Generation Mindfulness-Based Intervention Focusing on Well-Being: A Randomized Control Trial of Mindfulness-Based Positive Psychology
AN  - 2699221673
AB  - Second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) align well with positive psychology philosophy and practices, but trials of SG-MBIs have largely focused on ill-being. This study developed a mindfulness-based positive psychology (MBPP) intervention integrating positive psychology with an SG-MBI to enhance well-being. A randomized control trial was performed to compare MBPP with a waitlist condition among 138 Chinese participants. The results showed that MBPP significantly reduced negative emotions for subjective well-being and significantly improved environmental mastery for psychological well-being. Improvements in self-compassion and negative attitudes but not avoidance, mediated changes in well-being. Changes in positive emotions, positive relations, and awareness were associated with the amount of meditation practice. These findings showed that MBPP is promising for improving well-being and that the positive psychology components play important roles. Broadly, the study illustrated that positive psychology and SG-MBIs can be effectively integrated, and it supported the further application of SG-MBIs from the positive psychology perspective.

T1  - Unrestricted Sociosexuality Decreases Women’s (but not Men’s) Homophobia
AN  - 2685822876
AB  - A recent evolutionary theory of female sexual fluidity suggests that women do not have sexual orientations in the same sense that men do, and instead women’s apparent sexual orientation is a function of their sociosexual orientation. Among other things, the theory predicts that women’s unrestricted sociosexual orientation decreases their negative attitude toward same-sex behavior, whereas men’s unrestricted sociosexual orientation increases it. An analysis of the General Social Surveys data shows that, net of age, education, race, religion, religiosity, political attitude, intelligence, urbanicity and region of residence, and survey year, sociosexually unrestricted women are less likely to believe homosexual relationships are always morally wrong, while sociosexuality was not associated with homophobia among men. The study provides further evidence for the evolutionary theory of female sexual fluidity.

T1  - Ethnic identity concealment and disclosure: Contexts and strategies
AN  - 2683928549
AB  - Ethnic minority group members’ responses to their prejudicial treatment can take several forms. One involves identity concealment (e.g., ‘passing’). In order to understand such a response, we must explore participants’ understandings of the interactional context before them, their meta‐perceptions of the identity others ascribe to them, and the varied meanings that identity concealment/non‐disclosure may have in that context. Our analysis of interview data (N = 30) obtained with Roma in Hungary reveals diverse forms of, and motivations for, the concealment of their Roma identity. Some participants reported examples of proactive identity concealment, others reported more reactive forms (in which they went along with others’ mistaken assumptions concerning their identity). The motivations for identity concealment (whether proactive or reactive) included the desire to: secure material benefits; avoid conflict; take pleasure from seeing others’ assumptions blinding them to the reality before them; test (and expose) majority group members’ attitudes; allow themselves opportunities to experience the world in new ways. Our analysis highlights the importance of social identity researchers recognizing the diverse motivations for ethnic identity concealment: From the actors’ perspective concealment is not always assimilatory, and in some contexts can be experienced as empowering.

T1  - When a story contradicts: correcting health misinformation on social media through different message formats and mechanisms
AN  - 2677304207
AB  - The study examined the effects of message format (narrative vs. nonnarrative) and correction mechanism (social vs. algorithmic correction) in correcting e-cigarette related misinformation on social media. Two experimental studies were conducted. In study 1, correction mechanisms explicitly endorsed the message corrective (n = 235). As an explicit endorsement may reveal persuasive intent and influence narrative persuasion, Study 2 replicated the design and employed a manipulation for correction mechanism with a more implicit endorsement (n = 235). Findings generally suggest that nonnarrative correction is more effective when it is suggested by social media contacts; narrative correction may have merit when it is prompted by algorithms with explicit endorsement. Credibility evaluations and narrative transportation highlight the psychological mechanisms for understanding this interaction effect.

T1  - The myth of academic tolerance: the stigmatisation of East Asian students in Western higher education
AN  - 2667088812
AB  - This article focuses on the stigmatisation of East Asian students within Western universities. This is necessary because East Asian students are often overlooked in existing literature about racism in Western academia. It is argued that East Asian students may be generalised as undesirable students in ways that resonate with more broadly held prejudices about East Asian people. To illustrate this, academic publications about East Asian students are critiqued. This involves identifying, analysing and deconstructing the stereotypes of East Asian students which inadvertently totalise them as homogenous, inadequate and deficient. More specifically, it is argued that East Asian students are often unfairly depicted as: a) lacking critical thinking skills; b) being prone to plagiarism; and c) harming the educational environment. This article introduces the notion of ‘the myth of academic tolerance’ and calls upon academics and universities to actively resist the stigmatisation of East Asian students.

T1  - Heterosexual men in Trump's America downplay compassion more for masculine (than for feminine) gay victims of hate crime: Why?
AN  - 2675939622
AB  - Why would heterosexual men downplay their compassion for masculine (vs. feminine) gay victims of hate crime? Two social identity‐inspired explanations provide contrasting answers to this question. The reactive distinctiveness thesis (RD) assumes that heterosexual men would downplay their compassion more, when cued to a gay victim's masculinity than to their femininity, provided evaluative concerns are strong. In contrast, the feminization‐threat thesis (FT) assumes that compassion downplays would be more visible when heterosexual men are cued to a gay victim's femininity (not to the victim's masculinity), provided evaluative concerns are strong too. Consistent with RD, three experiments (Ntotal = 1,475) revealed that heterosexual men who read news about (gay) victims at a hate crime scene downplayed their compassion to a greater degree when cued to the masculinity rather than to the femininity of such targets (Studies 1–3). Meanwhile FT's prediction received partial support when considering feminine (vs. masculine) heterosexual victims, rather than homosexual victims (Study 3).

T1  - Does Origin Matter? Ethnic Group Position and Attitudes Toward Immigrants: The Case of Russia
AN  - 2637624636
AB  - This article analyzes the relationship between the relative position of an ethnic group, as measured by its majority/minority status at a subnational level, and attitudes of its members toward immigrants of different origins. Based on the Russian case, it addresses the question whether the effects of in-group majority status within a region on attitudes toward the general category of immigrants hold regardless of out-group origin and, if not, what may drive this variation. Using data from the Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey of the Higher School of Economics and Bayesian hierarchical structural equation modeling, the study demonstrates that the relative position of an ethnic in-group is of varying importance as a predictor of attitudes toward migrant groups of European versus non-European origin in Russia. A group’s majority status within a region proved to play a role in predicting attitudes toward migrants originating from the “south” (encompassing North and South Caucasus; Central Asia; and China, Vietnam, and Korea) but not toward migrants coming from the “west” (Ukraine and Moldova). We draw on arguments related to the source and the level of threat induced by the out-groups, ethnic hierarchies, and group cues to explain this pattern of results.

T1  - Hindsight 20/20: Looking Back for a Vision Forward in Gerontology
AN  - 2637030719
AB  - This article contains excerpts from the opening and closing remarks delivered at CAG2021 – the Annual Scientific and Educational Meeting of the Canadian Association on Gerontology (CAG) – which was hosted virtually from October 21 to 23, 2021. This event commemorated CAG’s 50th anniversary and included 645 delegates from across Canada and the world. The conference theme, “Hindsight 20/20: Looking Back for a Vision Forward in Gerontology,” focused on the burgeoning gerontological work that examines the various and complex ways that COVID-19 has affected older people and aging, as well as the need to develop a stronger emphasis on justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion in the field of gerontology.

T1  - Stuck in the Present: A Human Lack of Ability to Visualise (Different) Needs in the Future May Hamper Timely Implementation of AAL and Supportive Technology
AN  - 2674341869
AB  - Cities face an evident demographic change, making assistive technologies (AAL) an interesting choice to support older adults to autonomously age in place. Yet, supportive technologies are not as widely spread as one would expect. Hence, we investigate the surroundings of older adults living in Vienna and analyse their “socio relational setup”, considering their social integration and psychophysical state compared to others (health, fitness, activeness, contentedness). Method: Our data included 245 older adults (age: M = 74, SD = 6654) living in their own homes (2018–2020 with different grades of needing support). We calculated univariate and multivariate models regressing the socio-relational setup on the change of routines, technology attitude, mobility aid use, internet use, subjective age, openness to move to an institutional care facility in the future, and other confounding variables. Results: We found a strong correlation between all categories (health, fitness, activeness, contentedness) of older adults comparing themselves to their peers. Among others, they are significantly related to institutional care openness, which implies that participants who felt fitter and more active than their peers were less clear in visualising their future: unpleasant circumstances of ageing are suppressed if the current life circumstances are perceived as good. This is an example of cognitive dissonance.

T1  - Labeling, causal attributions, and social network ties to people with mental illness
AN  - 2672382849
AB  - Evidence supports Allport's (1954) contention that social contact reduces mental illness stigma and promotes symptom recognition. However, an important limitation of existing research is that it typically relies on relatively simplistic measures of contact (e.g., any contact, number of contacts). Here, we build on prior work by examining how contact with persons with mental illness within social networks shapes labeling processes and beliefs about the causes of mental illness. Using egocentric network methods and vignette data from the 2018 General Social Survey (N = 1173), findings reveal that connections to valued ties (e.g., friends, family) that disconfirm commonly held stereotypes about people with mental illness contribute to improved recognition of mental illness and reduce the likelihood of endorsing stigmatizing beliefs about causes of mental illness. By using network theory and methods, this research extends current understanding of the role of contact by revealing not only whether contact matters, but how it matters and under what circumstances it may reduce prejudice and discrimination attached to mental illness in contemporary society.

T1  - Mob Rules: Toward a Causal Model of Social Structure
AN  - 2656852248
AB  - This essay enriches causal models capturing the propagation of prejudice, bias, and other aggregative social mechanisms, negative or positive. These explananda include the reinforcement of economic inequality, "mob-like" behavior, peer pressure, and the establishment of social norms. The stage is set by introducing various forms of redundant causation and discussing some difficulties with mainstream preemption. Next the main proposal extends current representations of aggregative social mechanisms in two respects. First, it is more nuanced, as it identifies three distinct kinds of inferences: relevance of causes to effects, degree of redundancy of an effect, and the influence that causes exert on other causes. Second, it offers a quantitative-as opposed to merely qualitative-distinction between the causal contribution of preempting and preempted causes.

T1  - Differences in Pre-Service Teacher Attitude Change about Family Involvement across Four Universities
AN  - 2653020017
AB  - This study explored item-level change in pre-service teachers’ attitudes toward teacher- and parent-initiated parent involvement across four diverse universities. Pre-service teacher (N = 1658) attitudes toward parent involvement were measured before and after exposure to the online Parent Teacher Education Connection (PTEC) curriculum which provides information about Epstein’s six types of parent involvement. The four universities infused this curriculum differently into their coursework. Results showed that items demonstrated change related to how the four universities infused parent involvement curriculum into coursework. Overall, teacher-initiated involvement items showed more changes than parent-initiated items. Across the whole sample, there was change in items related to all six types of parent involvement. Results highlighted the importance of infusing parent involvement into the curriculum or teaching a full course, including activities placing pre-service teachers in the role of the parent, including service learning, and focusing on cultural diversity.

T1  - Parental perceived immigration threat and children's mental health, self-regulation and executive functioning in pre-Kindergarten
AN  - 2640799501
AB  - Many children in immigrant households endure unique stressors shaped by national, state, and local immigration policies and enforcement activity in the United States. Qualitative studies find that during times of heightened immigration enforcement, children as young as 3 years of age show signs of behavioral distress related to national anti-immigrant sentiment and the possibility of losing a parent. Using multiple sources of data from 168 racially and ethnically diverse families of children in pre-Kindergarten, the present study examined variability in perceived levels of immigration enforcement threat by parental immigrant status and ethnicity. This study examined associations between immigration enforcement threat and child mental health, self-regulation, and executive functioning and whether parent immigrant status or child gender moderates these associations. We found substantial variability in perceived immigration threat, with immigrant parents and Latinx parents reporting significantly greater levels of immigration threat compared to nonimmigrant parents and non-Latinx parents. Immigration enforcement threat was associated with greater child separation anxiety and overanxious behaviors, and lower self-regulation among boys and girls and among children of immigrant and U.S.-born parents. In contrast to our hypothesis, immigration enforcement threat was associated with higher self-regulation according to independent assessor ratings. Educators and healthcare providers working with young children from immigrant and Latinx households should be aware of the disproportionate stress experienced by immigrant and Latinx families due to a xenophobic sociopolitical climate marked by heightened immigration enforcement threat and racist, anti-immigrant rhetoric.

T1  - The pathway to care of patients with SUD who presented at addiction treatment centers (AMATEM) in Turkey
AN  - 2634665145
AB  - AimRecent studies have shown that alcohol and drug use in Turkey is rising year on year. In order to prevent and treat substance use disorder (SUD), many Alcohol and Drug Research, Treatment and Training Centres (AMATEM) have been established in Turkey. The purpose of this study was to investigate the pathway to care of patients who presented at AMATEM.MethodA total 235 patients with SUD between16-69 age groups who presented at AMATEMs in 2017 were included in this study. A sociodemographic form and a structured self-report questionnaire consisting of 36 items assessing the pathways of care were given to all the patients. Data were analysed with descriptive statistics using SPSS software.ResultsThe majority of the patients included in the study were single (55%) and male (96%). Patients mostly had a secondary school level of education (51%) and social security (65%). The majority of the patients stated that they used more than one substance (44%), opiates (20%) or alcohol (18%).ConclusionThis is the first study evaluating the pathway of care in patients with SUD in Turkey. It was observed that a significant majority of patients with SUD presented to AMATEMs and patients who applied to different health institutions stated that they were mostly informed about SUD and AMATEM. There were also patients with negative attitudes towards AMATEMs and non-medical treatment seeking behavior other than AMATEM. Families, relatives and friends of patients with SUD have an important place in reaching the treatment.

T1  - The educational divide over feelings about ethnic minorities: does more education really lead to less prejudice?
AN  - 2624032717
AB  - Virtually all studies on inter-ethnic attitudes in Western Europe and North America find that higher educated individuals report greater tolerance towards migrants and ethnic minorities. The overwhelming evidence on this link has even led scholars to call for educational expansion as a policy measure to increase social cohesion in today’s ever more diverse societies. But most of this evidence comes from cross-sectional correlations, and it is still unclear whether increasing education actually causes greater levels of tolerance. In this study, we follow a cohort of students aged 15 years over a period of 8 years from the German Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey (CILS4EU-DE). We focus on students who change from lower tracks into upper secondary and later tertiary education (the ‘treatment’ group) and compare them to a control group of similar students who stay in the lower track and leave school without entering university. Matching and fixed-effects panel regressions provide no evidence for a causal effect of changing into a higher educational track on subsequent prejudice towards ethnic minorities. We conclude that the descriptive difference between educational groups in their attitudes towards ethnic minorities is evident, but attending higher education per se does not seem to cause this difference.

T1  - ‘Look not at what is contrary to propriety’: A meta‐analytic exploration of the association between religiosity and sensitivity to disgust
AN  - 2617655413
AB  - Previous research has suggested that disgust sensitivity contributes to moral self‐regulation. The relationship between religiosity and disgust sensitivity is frequently explored as a moderator of moral‐regulating ideologies, such as conservative and traditional ideologies. However, religiosity is suggested to differ from these in moral attitudes against social dominance and racial prejudice. Psychological theories, such as the societal moral intuition and the evolved hazard‐perception models, have proposed that there could be reasons to support a distinct relationship between religiosity and disgust sensitivity. These reasons relate to the intuitive pursuit of spiritual purity and the non‐secular transcendental emotional‐reward value of moral behaviour for religious individuals. In the present manuscript, we conducted the first dedicated meta‐analytic review between religiosity and disgust sensitivity. We analysed a summary of forty‐seven experimental outcomes, including 48,971 participants. Our analysis revealed a significant positive association (r = .25) between religiosity and disgust sensitivity. This outcome suggests that sensitivity to disgust could have distinct spiritual purity and moral self‐regulatory response value for religious individuals.

T1  - Using Social Support Matter in the Association of Post-Traumatic Cognitions and Perceived Social Support? Comparison of Female Survivors of Intimate Partner Violence With and Without a History of Child Abuse
AN  - 2595971634
AB  - The association between high levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and low levels of perceived social support is well-documented in the trauma literature; research on processes that may underlie this association is less common. The current study examined negative attitudes about using social support as a potential link between negative post-traumatic cognitions about the world and self, one aspect of PTSD, and perceived social support in two groups of female survivors of intimate partner violence: those who had a history of child abuse (n = 153; IPV/CA+) and those who did not (n = 96; IPV/CA−). Negative attitudes about using social support were found to be an important link between negative post-traumatic cognitions and social support for both groups. IPV survivors with a history of child abuse had higher levels of negative post-traumatic cognitions about the world (d = .32) and self (d = .33), greater negative attitudes about using social support (d = .35), and lower perceived social support from family (d = .48), compared with IPV survivors without a history of child abuse. These results support the relevance of negative attitudes about using social support as one important factor in the relationship between PTSD symptoms and social support in interpersonal trauma survivors and highlight the impact that negative attitudes about using social support can have on the trauma survivor’s functioning.

T1  - “Why Always me?”: Childhood Experiences of Family Violence and Prejudicial Treatment against People Living with Albinism in Nigeria
AN  - 2582283058
AB  - In an attempt to address the paucity of research examining the childhood experience of people living with albinism within family context, the present study explored family-based violence and prejudicial treatments against children born with albinism in Nigeria. In addition, issues that traumatized children with albinism (CWA) within their family setting, and the coping strategies they found effective were identified. The research was located within an interpretive qualitative paradigm and framed within the theories of ‘othering,’ self-esteem, and family system. Interviews were conducted with 62 adults living with albinism who were raised in family settings. The prejudicial treatments and family-based violent behaviors experienced by participants were explored, and a thematic analysis of the narratives was carried out. Findings confirm the existence of family violence and prejudice regarding albinism. Prejudices on albinism were found to result in parents denying CWA of educational and vocational sponsorship, cordial family relationship, social interactions and attendance of social events. Family members’ perceptions of CWA were reportedly influenced by social and religious inclinations. Families were found not to be only violent with CWA but also facilitating institutional violence by religious organizations. Participants expressed developing emotional problems like paranoia, anger, depression, feelings of powerlessness, and low self-esteem, while they utilized varieties of emotion-oriented coping strategies during their childhood experiences. CWA are subjected to prejudice and violence within their families that are unique and deserving of research and policy interventions. Therefore, family-based orientations, screening for family violence, religious and social groups’ support for people living with albinism (PWA) were suggested.

T1  - “Ma sei fuori?”: a path to awareness on mental health and stigma
AN  - 2597246281
AB  - Mental health issues, frequently associated with weirdness and danger, can easily derail the lives of the people who suffer from them, creating loneliness and isolation. Due to stigma, people with mental health disorders could experience limitation in their economic, social and cultural human rights. In the effort to fight stigma against mental health issues, Fondazione The Bridge promoted a contest called “Ma sei fuori?”, targeted to students from secondary school. “Ma sei fuori?” could be translated as “Are you off your rocker?” or, more simply, as “Are you crazy?”; this phrase has been adopted by our juvenile slang to identify a person who's generally considered “not in line”. To those who answered our public call, we sent the contest regulation and factsheets on schizophrenia and stigma, matched with a brief bibliography/filmography. Students involved had to develop a slogan on stigma linked with music and images; 140 classes competed. The best catchphrase had been voted by a jury composed of influencers, clinicians, policy makers, writers, patient associations and other KOLs; besides the winning class, the jury issued three special mentions. All the results had been broadcasted live on Facebook during a public event. The winning class, as prize, got access to financial resources for didactic use and its slogan will be the core of a TV spot. The project had been backed by a communication campaign on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, with the involvement of the most famous italian tiktokers; just on TikTok the campaign reached 4.8 billion views. The project final scope was to raise young people's awareness about mental health issues and stigma, by stimulating a cultural shift. Students underlined another important result: working together online after school during the pandemic helped them filled the gap caused by the lack of socialization. Projects of this kind, easily replicable in other contests, could help creating a common language on the impact of stigma. Key messages  Social stigma still has a great impact on the lives of people with mental issues and disorders. Tackling bias and discrimination is the first step to raise awareness and build a stronger community. As a community, we must promote a responsible behavior and a common language to tackle prejudice on mental health issues; starting from young people could be the key to boost a cultural shift.

T1  - “Communitas in Crisis”: An Autoethnography of Psychosis Under Lockdown
AN  - 2591052464
AB  - In this article, I use autoethnography to examine time spent on an acute psychiatric ward during the COVID-19 lockdown. I employ the device of “communitas in crisis” to emphasize the precarious nature of this experience and the extent to which, for myself at least, informal social interactions with fellow patients and “communitas” were significant features of my hospital experience and subsequent discharge. I suggest that a lack of emphasis on inpatient to inpatient relationships in the recovery literature is an omission and a reflection of psychiatry’s authority struggles with both service users and professionals, along with a general perception of psychosis as individual rather than as a socially constructed phenomenon. I also suggest that, especially in the wake of greater social distancing, mental health and social services should safeguard against psychological and social isolation by creating more spaces for struggling people to interact without fear or prejudice.

T1  - ‘Kouri, kouri! Bis la ap vini!’: Reflections on the stigma of being Haitian at primary and secondary school in the Bahamas
AN  - 2582376200
AB  - There is a pervasive stigma attached to being Haitian in the Bahamas. This article examines reflections on the experiences of the stigma of being Haitian at primary and secondary school among second-generation Haitians in the Bahamas. Based on this research, I argue that primary school functions as the first major institution where children of Haitian descent experience stigma as it relates to their ethnic heritage and, in turn, are exposed to the idea of being the ‘other’ in Bahamian society through bullying and anti-Haitian sentiments from students and teachers. Stigma, prejudice, exclusion, and discrimination characterize primary and secondary education for Haitians living in the Bahamas and are manifest in the form of cruel teasing, bullying, and discrimination primarily from students and teachers. The goal is not to argue that children of Haitian descent are completely unaware of anti-Haitian sentiment in the Bahamas until they attend school but, rather, that school functions as one of the first institutions children of Haitian descent learn there is stigma in being Haitian in the Bahamas.

T1  - Teacher Attitudes Towards the Representation of Homosexuality in Film and Television: A New Self-report Questionnaire
AN  - 2568815931
AB  - The aims of the present research were to evaluate the preliminary psychometric properties of a new measure for evaluating teachers’ attitudes towards the representation of homosexuality in film and television, and to explore the association between moral disengagement and teachers’ negative attitudes towards homosexual representations. Participants were 241 Italian primary and secondary school teachers. The new self-report measure comprises 14 items or 8 items (brief version) scored on a 5-point Likert scale. Teachers completed three instruments: the new measure created to capture participants’ social and emotional evaluations of homosexuality in film and television, the latent and manifest prejudice scale, and the Italian moral disengagement scale. Exploratory factor analysis of the new measure suggested a single factor. The results demonstrated that the measure had satisfactory construct and convergent validity and reliability. Finally, we identified how teachers’ dehumanization of victims and euphemistic labelling were positively associated with their negative attitudes towards representations of homosexuality.

T1  - A double-edged sword: Children's intergroup gender attitudes have social consequences for the beholder
AN  - 2596068989
AB  - We examined the development of children's positive and negative attitudes toward other-gender peers over 1 year, and explored the longitudinal social consequences of holding positive or negative attitudes on the beholder of these attitudes. Participants were 206 second graders (Mage = 7.18 yrs, SD = .56, 50% girls) and 206 fourth graders (Mage = 9.10 yrs, SD = .66, 44.2% girls) from diverse ethnic racial backgrounds (54.6% White; 17.2% Latinx, 4.4% Black, 5.3% Asian, 2.9% Native American, .7% Pacific Islander, 13.1% other) with average household income ranged from $51,000 to $75,000, and they were assessed in 2 consecutive years. Developmental change was assessed using latent change score analysis, which showed that positive other-gender attitudes increased over time (for boys) whereas negative other-gender attitudes decreased for everyone. Path analyses showed that both positive and negative other-gender attitudes predicted children's perceptions of stressful other-gender interactions and their inclusion expectancies by other-gender peers longitudinally, controlling for same-gender attitudes. We also examined the extent to which the predicted relation between attitudes and inclusion expectancies was mediated by children's perceptions of stressful experiences with other-gender peers. We found that the extent of mediation varied by the type of attitudes and by children's age. Overall, findings contributed to the understanding of the development of children's other-gender attitudes, and underscored the consequences of these attitudes for the beholder of attitudes. This work also sheds light on the discussion of intervention strategies aimed at improving children's gender-based intergroup relations.

T1  - Opposing Immigrants in Europe: The Interplay Between Religiosity, Values, and Threat
AN  - 2574660933
AB  - Previous research located two opposite findings and frequently used threat perceptions and value‐support to explain the relationship between religiosity and attitudes toward immigrants: Religious individuals have negative attitudes toward immigrants because they support conservative values and feel threatened by unfamiliar groups. Second, they are open toward immigrants because they integrate prosocial and altruistic teachings of religion into their daily lives. Both lines have been confirmed repeatedly, which is puzzling. I argue that we need to consider all three factors (religiosity, value‐support, threat perceptions) simultaneously and explore their mutual interactions. In this study, I test this line of argumentation empirically with data from the European Social Survey (Round 7). The analyses reveal that religiosity has the weakest direct effect on attitudes toward immigrants. Threat perceptions, on the other hand, have the strongest direct effects, followed by value‐support. However, religiosity affects the attitudes toward immigrants indirectly via threat perceptions. These findings highlight that religiosity, value‐support, and threat perceptions are closely linked and need simultaneous consideration to make reliable claims about their effects.

T1  - Contact-implicit preference relationships: Two large sample tests
AN  - 2567817337
AB  - This work examines relationships between friendships and implicit preferences across two large samples. There is considerable evidence in the contact literature suggesting that friendships relate to more favorable attitudes toward outgroups, however, most evidence reflects explicit self-report measures. Using samples of 235,543 participants who completed the Disability IAT and 533,220 participants who completed the Sexuality IAT on the Project Implicit website, results indicate that participants reporting either a disabled friend or close acquaintance demonstrated weaker implicit preferences for abled over disabled people. Similarly, those with gay friends demonstrated weaker implicit preference for “straight” over gay. The size of these relationships were considerably smaller than found for explicit evaluations. These effect size estimates should be useful to researchers studying contact-implicit preference relationships as it informs power analyses and sample size planning decisions.

T1  - Child Development in Same-Sex Families: Beliefs of Chinese Lesbians, Gays, and Heterosexuals
AN  - 2564698489
AB  - IntroductionSame-sex parenting remains controversial, with many arguing that it negatively impacts children’s psychological and social development. This study investigated the influences of beliefs about the etiology of homosexuality (as either learned or genetic) and ambivalent sexism (benevolent and hostile) on beliefs about children’s development in same-sex families.MethodsA Chinese sample of 1400 respondents completed an online questionnaire in March–July 2019 and February 2020. The respondents self-identified as gay (490), lesbian (256), heterosexual male (266), or heterosexual female (388). Participants’ beliefs about children raised by same-sex parents were measured using the Scale on Beliefs about Children’s Adjustment in Same-Sex Families which included two subscales, namely individual opposition and normative opposition. We tested four hypotheses using multiple analysis of variance and hierarchical multiple linear regression.ResultsRespondents who were male, heterosexual, older, or had stronger beliefs in the learned etiology showed stronger individual and normative opposition to same-sex parenting. Overall, benevolent sexism was related to individual opposition; lesbians and gays’ hostile sexism was related to individual opposition, while heterosexuals’ hostile sexism was related to normative and individual opposition. Participants’ individual opposition was significantly stronger than their normative opposition.ConclusionsChinese lesbians, gays, and heterosexuals hold relatively conservative and traditional beliefs about children’s development in same-sex families.Policy ImplicationsOur results suggest a need for legal and policy protection against prejudice and the dissemination of educational material about same-sex families through public service advertising and educational programs.

T1  - Anticipation of Stigma upon Parenthood Impacts Parenting Aspirations in the LGB Community in Israel
AN  - 2564698389
AB  - IntroductionThis study compared childless Israeli lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals to their heterosexual counterparts on anticipation of stigma upon parenthood and assessed its mediating role in the association between being a member of a sexual minority and lower parenting desires, intentions, and likelihood estimations.MethodsA total of 612 childless participants (174 self-reported as LGB people) ranging in age from 18 to 49 (M = 31.18, SD = 3.89) were recruited through convenience sampling between November 2019 and February 2020. They completed online questionnaires assessing their anticipation of stigma upon parenthood, parenting desires, intentions, and likelihood estimations.ResultsLGB individuals reported a higher anticipation of stigma upon parenthood than their heterosexual counterparts. The anticipation of stigma upon parenthood fully mediated the association between being a sexual minority and lower parenting desires and intentions and partially mediated the association between being a sexual minority and lower estimated likelihood of parenthood.Conclusions and Policy Implications The findings are interpreted in light of LGB possible awareness of prejudice and discrimination by local legislation that prohibits or impedes sexual minorities from pursuing parenthood. Policymakers and health professionals should be alerted to the impact of anticipation of stigma when accounting for the disparities in parenting aspirations between LGB individuals and heterosexual counterparts and its possible connections to discriminatory Israeli social policies toward LGB rights.

T1  - Legislation, Linguistics, and Location: Exploring Attitudes on Unauthorized Immigration
AN  - 2563062422
AB  - Contemporary discourse on domestic immigration policy varies widely based on political affiliation, linguistics, and regional differences. This experimental study aimed to concurrently investigate three social psychological bases of attitudes toward unauthorized immigrants in the USA: political ideology, social labels, and social context. Participants were 744 adults, recruited from “New York Community College” (“NYCC”/urban) and “New Jersey Community College” (“NJCC”/suburban), who were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: “illegal” vs. “undocumented.” Participants completed a scale measuring their attitudes toward unauthorized immigrants with the embedded label manipulation, followed by the General System Justification scale, and culminating with demographic items. Results demonstrated that whereas social context and political ideology both contributed significantly to the regression model, the social labels did not. Both high system justification and political conservatism predicted negative attitudes, but the latter effect was stronger for suburban students. Post hoc analyses revealed a significant difference between suburban and urban students in the frequency of the social labels “illegal” and “undocumented” heard and seen among family members, friends, and the media. Implications are discussed with a focus on system justification as an explanatory theory for immigration attitudes, as well as contextual effects for it.

T1  - Let’s Work Together: Assessing the Impact of Intergenerational Dynamics on Young Workers’ Ageism Awareness and Job Satisfaction
AN  - 2556919309
AB  - Previous studies suggest that intergroup contact has a positive effect on older workers’ perception of ageism and satisfaction. This study aims at assessing such relationships amongst Canadian younger workers. Precisely, in light of the intergroup contact theory (ICT), it was first hypothesized that a positive perception of intergenerational workplace climate (IWC) and knowledge sharing practices (KSP) increase younger workers’ awareness of ageist behaviors targeting older peers. Second, it was hypothesized that such awareness has a positive effect on young workers’ level of satisfaction. Relying on a cross-sectional design composed of 612 participants, path analysis was conducted. Findings suggest that whereas KSP increases younger workers’ awareness of ageist behaviors towards older workers, this is not the case for IWC. On the other hand, both IWC and KSP have a direct and positive impact on younger workers’ level of satisfaction. Theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed.

T1  - Social media use and anti-immigrant attitudes: evidence from a survey and automated linguistic analysis of Facebook posts
AN  - 2555493579
AB  - Social media has a role to play in shaping the dynamic relations between immigrants and citizens. This study examines the effects of threat perceptions, consumptive and expressive use of social media, and political trust on attitudes against immigrants in Singapore. Study 1, based on a survey analysis (N = 310), suggests that symbolic but not realistic threat perception, is positively associated with anti-immigrant attitudes. The consumptive use of social media and political trust is negatively related to anti-immigrant attitudes. Moderation analyses suggest that consumptive social media use has negative consequences for individuals with increased symbolic threat perception and high political trust. But is there a correspondence between consumptive and expressive use of social media in terms of predicting prejudicial attitudes? Study 2 benchmarks the survey findings against participants’ opinion expression via Facebook posts (N = 146,332) discussing immigrants. Automated linguistic analyses reveal that self-reported survey measures correlate with the expressive use of social media for discussing immigrants. Higher anti-immigrant attitudes are associated with higher negative sentiment, anger, and swear words in discussing immigrants. The findings highlight the need to pay attention to the combined influence of social media use and individual political beliefs when analyzing intergroup relations.

T1  - Family Matters: The Support of Parents to Change Black Male’s Attitudes Towards HIV
AN  - 2545498072
AB  - This study explored the associations between family (mother and father support), peers, and individual factors (self-efficacy) and how these relationships influence HIV attitudes among African American males 12 to 19 years of age, with an average age of 16 years. For this study, we used restricted data obtained from Wave I of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (ADD Health). Descriptive statistics suggest that most of the sample had negative attitudes towards HIV. Bivariate regression analysis followed by a linear regression analysis was conducted to identify the factors that were associated with HIV attitudes. Major findings from regression analysis indicate that mother support, father support, self-efficacy, and age, predicted HIV attitudes. Mother support positively predicted positive HIV attitudes and surprisingly, father support negatively predicted HIV attitudes. Our findings can be used to better inform HIV prevention and intervention programs to help Black males stay healthy.

T1  - Predictors and consequences of non-suicidal self-injury in relation to life, peer, and school factors
AN  - 2566522506
AB  - Introduction: Numerous life, peer, and school-related factors have been found to be associated with non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) among adolescents; however, most studies have not explored the possible reciprocal nature of these associations. The aim of the current study was to examine bidirectional and longitudinal associations between NSSI and several life, peer, and school-related factors (i.e., stressful life events, peer relationships, academic achievement, and attitudes towards school). Method: Community-based adolescents completed questionnaires assessing the variables of interest at three time points; age 12 (T1; 55.09% girls), age 13 (T2; 56.95% girls), and ages 14–15 (T3; 57.41% girls). In total, 529 adolescents provided complete data across all three-time points. Results: Analyses showed a bidirectional association between NSSI and both attitudes towards school and stressful life events. Specifically, stressful life events at T2 predicted engagement in NSSI at T3, and NSSI at T2 predicted increased risk of stressful life events at T3. Similarly, having negative attitudes towards school predicted NSSI at T2, which, in turn, predicted negative attitudes towards school at T3. Further, academic achievement at T1 was negatively associated with NSSI at T2. Peer relationships were neither a predictor nor a consequence of NSSI. Conclusions: Our results suggest that NSSI can be both a predictor and a consequence of various life, and school factors. Focus on these factors in prevention and intervention efforts for NSSI among adolescents may be warranted.

T1  - ‘I don't feel insulted’: Constructions of prejudice and identity performance among Roma in Bulgaria
AN  - 2546893321
AB  - Drawing on studies showing that arguments about the nature of intergroup prejudice allow members of privileged groups to ‘perform’ a positive social identity, the present study explores how arguments about the nature of prejudice are produced by targets of prejudice in order to consolidate or challenge their own social identity. We conducted interviews with Bulgarian Roma and, based on a discursive psychology approach, analysed the way participants contested being assigned to a Roma‐exclusive identity category, which they treated as produced by prejudiced beliefs of the non‐Roma high‐status majority population. Positive intergroup contact was used to demonstrate the absence of prejudice and counter Roma identity threat. Auto‐stereotyping and disidentification, in turn, revealed how one's own situation is distinguished from the group. We discuss how identity performances founded on prejudice constructions work to maintain or challenge intergroup boundaries. We conclude that studies revealing prejudice constructions of minority groups can explain the sedative effect of positive intergroup contact on ethnic activism and help to reflect on integration strategies that would be compatible with social change in favour of disadvantaged minority groups.

T1  - Predictors of Attitudes toward Lesbian and Gay Parenting in an Ecuadorian Sample
AN  - 2546813749
AB  - In the past few years, Ecuador has experienced legal changes toward the recognition of sexual minority rights. However, lesbian and gay (LG) individuals and couples still face legal obstacles to become parents and social barriers that place their families in disadvantage compared to their heterosexual counterparts. To date, it is not known whether the legal changes reflect society’s move toward a more progressive and accepting climate. This study analyzed the attitudes toward LG parenting in an Ecuadorian online-recruited sample. Three hundred thirty-eight (338) participants answered an online questionnaire about the negative effects and the benefits of having LG parents. The strongest belief among participants was that children of LG parents would be victimized because of their parents’ sexual orientation. Analyses indicated differences in attitudes based on age, sexual orientation, marital status, education level, as well as religiosity. Finally, regression models suggested that beliefs about the origins of sexual orientation and contact with LG people predicted attitude scores. Implications of these findings are discussed.

T1  - Classed patterns in the course and outcome of parent-teacher interactions regarding educational decision-making
AN  - 2544355372
AB  - Educational transitions are crucial sites of social selection. Whereas social bias in teacher recommendations is well-established, less is known about teacher guidance in the process preceding the actual choice. Bridging the literature on social class and educational choice and home-school relations this study explores classed patterns in the course and outcome of parent-teacher interactions regarding educational decision-making (EDM) at the transition from primary to secondary education in Flanders (Belgium). We used a qualitative research design combining observational data from 104 parent-teacher conferences in two schools in the final year of primary education, with 26 in-depth interviews with parents reflecting on educational choice and teacher guidance. Using grounded theory, our results show that the importance of teacher guidance for parents’ decision-making is strongly dependent on their social and cultural resources on the one hand and the types of educational decisions they are facing on the other. Nevertheless, teachers remained largely blind to the social dynamics in the choice market. Our results depict how teacher guidance regarding EDM is little proactive and unstandardized. In this context parents’ cultural and symbolic capital came into play. When needed, middle-class parents proved to be entitled and effective in their exchanges with the primary school. Working-class and migrant parents more often showed constraint and therefore failed to extract the necessary information. Disagreement and fear for biased recommendations further complicated the interaction, alienating those most in need of assistance.

T1  - Support for the political community in a community that doesn’t support you: immigrant youths’ exposure to anti-immigrant attitudes
AN  - 2534831632
AB  - Expressions of hostility in immigrants’ surrounding environment have been shown to negatively influence their relation to the political society. The impact of such contextual hostility on immigrant youths and political community support however remains unexplored. Filling these gaps, I test the hypothesis that contextual hostility decreases immigrant youths’ political community support, captured with a sense of national pride. In addition, I test two rivalling hypotheses regarding the influence of contextual hostility on the so-called second generation of immigrants, expecting the impact to be either weaker or stronger among the second generation of immigrants in comparison to the first generation. Analysing survey data on the political beliefs of youths in secondary school classes in Sweden, my main finding is that immigrant youths in school classes with high levels of anti-immigrant attitudes are less supportive of the political community, entailing a potential legitimacy problem for the democratic system. The impact of anti-immigrant attitudes among the second generation of immigrants is in turn weak or non-existing.

T1  - Women’s Daily Performance, Enjoyment, and Comfort in Male-Dominated Majors: The Role of Social Interactions in Classes
AN  - 2531845567
AB  - Women drop out of male-dominated majors (MDMs) at a higher rate than men (Blickenstaff 2005). Research is needed to better understand contextual factors in the major, such as social interactions in major classes, that may increase women’s engagement in MDMs and ultimately reduce attrition (Lawson et al. in Sex Roles 78:542–560, 2018). The present study examined whether women in MDMs differed from men in MDMs and women in gender-neutral majors (GNMs) in terms of (1) levels of daily student engagement in major classes; and (2) the association between daily social interactions in classes and student engagement. Daily data were collected from 120 students (40 women in MDMs, 40 men in MDMs, 40 women in GNMs) about social interactions (talking to a peer, interacting with a professor one-on-one, and class discussions) and student engagement (perceived performance, enjoyment, and feelings of comfort) in major classes at the end of the day over a two week period. Results indicated that women in MDMs reported lower levels of daily engagement in major classes, relative to their peers. Talking with a peer and class discussions were associated with higher levels of student engagement, but these associations were qualified by group. Overall, the daily association between social experiences and student engagement were stronger for women in MDMs, relative to their peers. Results support the social-contextual model of prejudice (Murphy et al in Policy Insights Behav Brain Sci 5:66–74, 2018) in that classroom experiences disadvantaged women in MDMs, but daily social interactions may be particularly beneficial for women in these contexts.

T1  - When multiracial individuals are the numerical majority: Children's racial attitudes in the Dominican Republic
AN  - 2553021567
AB  - The Dominican Republic is a uniquely valuable context in which to study children's racial stereotyping and prejudice, in part because multiracial individuals comprise the majority of the population and race is viewed largely as a continuous rather than dichotomous construct. In two studies, we use developmental and social theories to ground an exploration of Dominican children's racial biases. In studies 1 (n = 54; ages 6–11) and 2 (n = 122; ages 6–11), children were given measures of racial identity, preference, stereotyping, and/or status. As expected, children identified their own race in a manner consistent with others (e.g., their teachers). Across a variety of tasks, children failed to consistently favor members of a specific racial group-as indicated by differing levels of racial stereotyping and associations of social status with different races. They did, however, sometimes systematically express greater liking of individuals of mixed racial heritage, a finding that was contingent on the modality of assessment (i.e., whether race was framed as a continuous vs. dichotomous category, and measured via nonforced vs. forced-choice methods). Implications for current theories of racial attitude development are discussed.

T1  - Inter-ethnic relations of teenagers in England’s schools: the role of school and neighbourhood ethnic composition
AN  - 2521296241
AB  - In the context of ongoing debate about the positive and negative consequences of ethnic diversity for intergroup relations, we study inter-ethnic relations among adolescents in England’s schools. In the first national study of schools throughout England to relate inter-ethnic attitudes to both school and area ethnic composition, we combine survey data collected from 14-year-olds in nearly 100 schools with administrative data. We focus on relations between three ethno-racial categories: White-British, Asian-British and Black-British, for three conceptually distinct indicators of inter-ethnic orientations: warmth, friends, and attitudes. We posit that ‘contact’, proxied by school outgroup composition, should lead to more positive intergroup orientations, while ‘exposure’, proxied by neighbourhood outgroup composition, should lead to more negative intergroup relations. We show that higher school outgroup shares are associated with more positive orientations towards that group for almost all relationships and measures. We further show that for the two instances where higher school outgroup shares do not enhance positive intergroup orientations, they nevertheless moderate negative effects of neighbourhood composition. We conclude that schools offer the opportunity to enhance intergroup relations and to mitigate the threats associated with increased neighbourhood diversity with potentially enduring consequences.

T1  - Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Parents: Examining the Antecedents of Parenting Ability Evaluation
AN  - 2514989020
AB  - Hostility toward same-sex parenting is widespread. Literature supports one persistent argument against same-sex parenting which focusses on the concern for children’s wellbeing, whereas lesbian and gay parents’ ability is sometimes evaluated positively. In particular, the belief that children need both a father and a mother impacts the evaluation that same-sex parents are unfit to raise well-adjusted children. The present research aimed to investigate linking mechanisms and conditional processes underlying the evaluation of same-sex parents’ ability. Cisgender heterosexual Italian participants (N = 320) read one of four vignettes describing a family situation – two types of same-sex (step)parents (i.e., lesbian and gay (step)parents) vs. two types of different-sex (step)parents (i.e., heterosexual (step)parents) – in which a child misbehaved in the context of a mild family disagreement. After reading the vignette, the participants rated parenting ability and to what extent the child’s misbehavior was attributable to the parenting relationship. Moderated-mediation analyses indicated that same-sex (step)parents were perceived as being less capable parents compared to different-sex (step)parents by giving them greater responsibility for the child’s misbehavior, among participants with medium and high levels of gender role beliefs. Implications for research on sexual discrimination are discussed.

T1  - “We are the victims of racism”: Victim categories in negotiating claims about racism against Black‐Africans in India
AN  - 2581010372
AB  - How is racism negotiated by those who are otherwise victims of racism? Social psychologists show the relevance of categorization in negotiating racism. In the present article I focus on a setting where the majority group itself can be considered a target of racism: racism against Black‐Africans in India. I examine how victim categorization of the majority group is developed and used through a membership categorization analysis of broadcast media news debates. Analysis shows that, first, victim categories complicated the use of racial prejudice as an explanation for the attacks. Second, victim categorizations were developed in relation to social groups that were removed from the present setting. These allowed for accomplishing specific actions: denials and rejections of racism, moral concerns in racism, and acceptance of Black‐Africans' claims about racism. Together, the findings show that racism can be negotiated in terms additional to racial/ethnic group membership: as victims or perpetrators of racism.

T1  - Has religiosity become a key factor in Jewish Israelis' attitudes toward minorities? A call for research
TT  - Religiosity and minorities
AN  - 2537650332
AB  - PurposeAttitudes toward minority employees are hard to predict, and there is no enough information about the variables that are associated with increased and decreased prejudice toward them. The Jewish and Arab education systems in Israel are, for the most part, segregated, which may potentially contribute to prejudice and alienation between the two populations. The integration of Israeli–Arab teachers in Jewish schools has been suggested to reduce prejudice. The current study sought to examine Israeli teachers' attitudes toward the inclusion of Arab teachers in Jewish schools (AJ) and its relation to degree of religiosity, minority status and demographic variables.Design/methodology/approachA total of 1,644 teachers completed an online 22-item questionnaire that surveyed background variables such as gender, mother tongue, seniority and degree of religiosity, the two independent variables, religiosity and minority status, and the dependent variable, attitude toward the inclusion of AJ.FindingsOverall, teachers exhibited positive attitudes toward the integration of AJ. Multiple linear regression indicated that among Jewish teachers, the degree of religiosity was the strongest predictor of the teachers' attitudes toward inclusion but was a poor predictor among Arabs. Conversely, minority status was the strongest predictor among Arab teachers but was a poor predictor among Israeli Jews. Not only did religiosity differ in its prediction of attitudes among Arabs and Jews but also the patterns of religiosity were quite different among these two groups.Research limitations/implicationsWhile the overall sample was wide, the specific minority groups that were examined were small and did not allow deep exploration of minority nuances. The study's generalizability is hampered by the given exceptionality of the Israeli context, where “Church” and State are not separated. Religiosity was examined in a unidimensional way and failed to explore other related factors that may be relevant, such as political inclination.Practical implicationsThe study further refutes the notion of commonality among minorities. It proposes to place more emphasis on religion's role in attitudes toward minority employees. Further research into the role of religiosity in Israeli Jews' attitudes toward Arabs is needed.Social implicationsThe findings suggest that the degree of religiosity might be a central factor in Israeli Jews' attitudes toward the Arab minority in general.Originality/valueThe research calls attention to the association of Judaism and nationalism as well as segregation, contributing to negative attitudes and prejudice toward the Arab minority. Unlike previous research using contact theory, the authors call attention to the importance of examining willingness to make contact prior to examining the impact of contact itself.

T1  - Hegemonic masculinity, gender, and social distance: the mediating role of perceived dangerousness
AN  - 2509921960
AB  - Given the aggressive behaviours and negative attitudes associated with hegemonic masculinity, and the fact that men are more likely to commit violent crimes than are women, people might choose to avoid men displaying characteristics consistent with hegemonic masculinity. In a vignette-based study, we assessed whether the gender of a person displaying behaviours and attitudes consistent with hegemonic masculinity influenced people’s desire for social distance. Further, we explored whether the relationship between hegemonic masculinity and social distance was mediated by perceived dangerousness. A fictitious man displaying attitudes and behaviours consistent with hegemonic masculinity was perceived to be more dangerous than a woman displaying the same characteristics, and an increase in perceived dangerousness was associated with a desire for greater social distance. Once this was removed from the direct path, there was no link between the gender of the fictitious individual and social distance, indicating that people do not desire greater social distance from men but from anyone exhibiting ‘toxic’ attitudes and behaviours. The findings have important clinical implications, highlighting the role social connections play in changing prejudiced attitudes and recovery from depression.

T1  - You’ve got the disease: how disgust in child culture shapes school bullying
AN  - 2509429526
AB  - This paper brings an ethnographic experience to bear on the existing research field of school bullying, rounding out our understanding by focusing on an essential aspect: children’s culture. Based on 14 months of fieldwork and a close analysis of the case of Anat, a 9-year-old victim of bullying, the paper identifies a unique formation of school bullying with no leading bully. Drawing from theoretical approaches which focus on pupils’ everyday life, the paper asserts that bullying without a leading bully is rooted in children’s culture which effectively enforces bullying as a binding norm by constructing its object as disgusting. The paper explores how disgust shapes school bullying into a collective omnipresent rejection. It also discusses intervention programmes and suggests that within such a social position, one practice to consider would be transferring to a new environment where bullied pupils will not be forced to cope with collectively enforced prejudices.

T1  - Between survival and vision: Boundary-crossing Arab teachers in Jewish schools and Arab teachers in their community
AN  - 2549948304
AB  - This mixed-methods study examined the experiences of belonging/otherness among Arab teachers in Israel. A group of boundary-crossing teachers: Arab teachers in Jewish schools (AJ; N = 57) was compared with Arab teachers teaching in their own community (AA; N = 103). We found that the AJ group had a multicultural orientation, unlike the AA group, who were community-orientated. These orientations are reflected in different otherness sources, different motivations for selecting a workplace, and differences in identity ratings. While professional and social sources promoted teachers' sense of belonging in the two groups, the source of AJs' sense of otherness was the national divide as opposed to community-oriented aspects in AAs. Selfefficacy ratings were high in both groups with a significant advantage for AJs, an unanticipated finding given that most of them were women, had attended teacher training colleges rather than universities, and were rarely homeroom teachers. Arab teachers' involvement in Jewish schools was partial with a low proportion of classroom educators or teachers in managerial roles. AJs tend to leave their national identity outside the school, and are not involved in political discourse or in the staffroom power relations. The phenomenon of integrating AJs is relatively new, and within a segregated education system that limits the opportunities for Jews and Arabs to meet, it can provide a viable, albeit limited, tool to inhibit prejudice and antagonism between Jews and Arabs.

T1  - How Often Have You Felt Disadvantaged? Explaining Perceived Discrimination
AN  - 2534814128
AB  - Based on longitudinal data from Germany, we analyze how perceptions of discrimination change once migrants’ integration evolves. Individuals who identify more strongly with the host country, speak the language, have native friends, and are adequately employed report less discrimination overall. However, group-specific analyses reveal that German-born Turks feel more rather than less discriminated against after their language skills and their identification increase. For this group, we find evidence for the “integration paradox”, i.e., the finding that better educated migrants have more rather than less negative attitudes about the host society. Results suggest that attributional processes rather than rising exposure to discrimination might be the main mechanism linking integration to higher levels of perceived discrimination. Obviously, discrimination does not disappear for groups facing salient ethnic boundaries and is met with growing awareness and sensitivity among individuals that have become more similar to the majority of members. This, in turn, by no means implies that perceived discrimination is detached from reality.

T1  - The practice of surrogacy as a phenomenon of ‘bare life’: An analysis of the Japanese case applying Agamben’s theory
AN  - 2494826849
AB  - This article elaborates the cultural and political structures that inform the belief among Japanese that surrogacy is legitimate. It argues that this belief reflects a transition from previously negative attitudes toward surrogacy practices developed in the United States. The article first elaborates the history of the Japanese recognition of surrogacy by introducing early forms of East Asian surrogacy that lasted until the first half of the 20th century. Second, it explores the recent shift in Japanese discussions about surrogacy through an analysis of cultural representations on the topic, mainly referring to a dataset of magazine articles published from 1981 to the present. The author then calls upon Giorgio Agamben’s theoretical framework to discuss the juridico-political perspective of ‘bare life’ as it relates to surrogacy, and argues that considering surrogate mothers and children conceived through surrogacy as bare life makes surrogate practice seem reasonable in modern Japanese society. To conclude, the article stresses the importance of incorporating women’s reproductive functions into law to prevent women and their conceived children from becoming bare life, and being exposed to violence, in the form of a surrogacy contract.

T1  - Reducing prejudice toward Syrian refugee children: A vicarious contact intervention among Turkish elementary school children
AN  - 2493134673
AB  - We conducted an experimental intervention to test the effectiveness of vicarious contact in the relationship between Turkish and Syrian elementary school children; the participants were Turkish children. We used a mixed‐methods approach, investigating effects by using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Participants in the experimental condition were asked to read stories on positive contact between Turkish and Syrian children over the course of six weekly sessions. The results revealed that vicarious contact, compared to a control condition where participants did not engage in any activity, led to greater intentions to help outgroup members. Importantly, effects only emerged among children who reported higher initial negative outgroup attitudes. Results from qualitative data revealed that vicarious contact produced richer, more positive, and complex representations of the relationships and friendships between groups. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

T1  - Evaluation of the relationship between youth attitudes towards marriage and motivation for childbearing
AN  - 2524411499
AB  - Introduction: It is known that the oldest and smallest social structure of human beings, which has been a social entity throughout history, is the family. Although there may be different opinions all over the world, marriage is seen as a cultural necessity in order to establish family unity. In this study, we aimed to determine the relationship between motivations of youth, that are among the cultural inheritors, for marriage and childbearing. Methods: This descriptive and correlational study was conducted with 820 midwifery and nursing students who attend Van Yuzuncu Yil University, Van Health High School in 2019–2020 fall semester. Data were collected through Student Information Form, Inonu Marriage Attitude Scale (I-MAS) and Childbearing Motivations Scale (CMS) and the data obtained were examined with descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal Wallis Test, Pearson's Correlation and simple linear regression analysis. Results: The mean age of the patients was 21.415 ± 1.593 (min = 18, max = 26) years, 73.4% were female and almost all of them (99.6%) have not been married before. It was found that the students have positive attitudes towards marriage with high scores they received from I-MAS (73.312 ± 18.323). It was determined that decisions of the studies who reported positive opinion about childbearing were influenced by personal satisfaction level, childbearing burden and immaturity before birth, experiencing marriage stress and negative financial predictions for future. There was a positive moderate (r = 0.675, p < 0.001) correlation between attitudes of the students towards marriage and motivations of childbearing, and a positive weak correlation between attitudes of the students towards marriage and negative motivations of childbearing (r = 0.239, p = 0.000). Conclusion: It was found that youth generally have positive attitudes towards marriage and childbearing, but socioeconomic factors may have negative effects on the decisions made for future. For this purpose, it can be recommended that public policies should be regulated in terms of marriage and childbearing, and young people with negative opinions should be referred to marriage and family counseling centers.

T1  - A Three-Tiered Model for Addressing the Mental Health Needs of Immigrant-Origin Youth in Schools
AN  - 2484011182
AB  - To date, little research has systematically considered the ways in which schools can better address the needs of immigrant-origin youth (IOY). Further, considering the increased negative attitudes toward and policies targeting IOY and families within the U.S., there is a need to go beyond targeting just IOY at risk for mental health concerns and promote a culture of inclusion throughout the school. The goal of this paper is to address ways in which schools can best attend to the mental health needs of IOY by systematically integrating prevention and intervention efforts across three tiers of support within the school setting. Specifically, we propose a three-tiered model of school based mental health services for IOY. Based on a thorough review of current literature, we propose universal, selective, and targeted programming to support the MH needs of IOY and families. We discuss implications for implementation as well as future directions for research.

T1  - Protective Factors for LGBTI+ Youth Wellbeing: A Scoping Review Underpinned by Recognition Theory
AN  - 2596023801
AB  - Considerable research has been undertaken regarding the mental health inequalities experienced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI+) youth as a consequence of societal and individual prejudice, stigma and discrimination. Far less research has focussed on protective factors that promote wellbeing for this population. A scoping review was conducted using a six-stage methodological framework, and is reported in accordance with the PRISMA-ScR statement. This explored the extent, range and nature of the peer-reviewed, published, academic literature on what is known about the protective factors that promote LGBTI+ youth wellbeing. Six databases were systematically searched applying Population–Concept–Context key inclusion criteria, complemented by contact with authors to identify additional sources, reference checks and hand searches. Ninety-six individual research records were identified and analysed, drawing from Honneth’s Recognition Theory. Interpersonal relations with parents (n = 40), peers (n = 32) and providers (n = 22) were associated with indicators of enhanced wellbeing, as were LGBTI+ community relations (n = 32). Importantly, online (n = 10), faith (n = 10) and cultural (n = 5) communities were potentially protective. Content and thematic analysis highlighted the importance of Gay–Straight Alliances (GSAs) (n = 23) offering powerful protective opportunities through intersecting interpersonal, community and legal forms of recognition. GSAs enhance allyship by peers and providers (n = 21), facilitate access to LGBTI+ community networks (n = 11) and co-exist alongside inclusive policies (n = 12), curricular (n = 5) and extracurricular activities (n = 1). This scoping review underscores the need to move beyond the predominant focus on risk factors for LGBTI+ youth, which subsequently inform protectionist approaches. It concludes with an appeal to develop mechanisms to apply recognitive justice to policy, practice and, importantly, future research directions. This emphasises the salience of enhanced understandings of inclusion, which is rights-based, universally available and of potential benefit to all.

T1  - Female adopted Chinese-American youth's sense of exclusion and short-and long-term adjustment
AN  - 2574461517
AB  - In this article, we tested if female adopted Chinese youth's sense of exclusion predicted their behavioral adjustment and mental disorder diagnoses concurrently (Study 1) and longitudinally 5 years later (Study 2). In Study 1, 224 adoptees (M = 13.6 years, SD = 2.1) provided survey data on sense of exclusion (as indexed by ethnic marginality, ethnic identity search, and negative feelings toward adoption) and Internalizing Problems (i.e., anxiety, withdrawal, and somatic complaints), measured with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)-Youth Self-Report. In Study 1, the adoptive parents additionally completed the CBCL parent-report on the adopted children's Internalizing Problems and reported if the adopted children had any mental disorder diagnoses. In Study 2, 60 youth from Study 1 (M = 18.6 years, SD = 2.1) completed the 3rd edition of the Behavioral Assessment System for Children-Self Report of Personality (BASC-3-SRP) that measures School Problems (i.e., negative attitudes toward teacher, negative attitudes toward school, and sensation seeking), Internalizing Problems (i.e., atypicality, locus of control, social stress, anxiety, depression, sense of inadequacy, and somatization), Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; i.e., inattention and hyperactivity), and Personal Adjustment (i.e., relations with parents, peer relations, self-esteem, and self-reliance). They also responded to questions on receiving mental disorder diagnoses and treatments. We found that in Study 1, 33.2% of the youth had at least one diagnosis, with Anxiety Disorder (21.4%), ADD/ADHD (16.7%), and Attachment Disorder (7.5%) being the top three disorders. In Study 2, 40.3% had at least one diagnosis, with Anxiety Disorder (25.0%), Depression (21.7%), and ADD/ADHD (16.7%) being the top three disorders. Path analyses showed that in Study 1, ethnic marginality and negative feelings about adoption, but not ethnic identity search, significantly predicted parent-reported and self-reported Internalizing Problems; in Study 2, none of the three indicators of sense of exclusion predicted the adopted youth's adjustment. Implications for clinical practice and future research were discussed.

T1  - Of Pride and Prejudice—A Cross-National Exploration of Atheists’ National Pride
AN  - 2565667205
AB  - This paper explores how atheism relates to national pride. Previous research reports the strong positive relationship between religiosity and national pride. Inversely, it can be assumed that atheists feel less national pride. Whether this assumption holds true and whether the perceived relevance of religiosity for values perceived as fundamental for national pride is a national-specific or a global phenomenon will be investigated here by examining attitudes towards atheists and assessing cross-nationally how proud atheists truly are of their countries. The data reveals cross-country differences in both respects. In highly religious countries, prejudice against atheists is pronounced, while atheists’ feelings of national pride indeed tend to be weaker. But what exactly predicts atheists’ feelings of national pride? For a Multilevel Analysis of this question, this article uses the ONBound database offering cumulated and harmonized data from international survey programs as well as linked country-level data on national identities and religion. Results identify countries’ ideological background as one of the crucial country-level predictors for national pride among atheists. In highly religious countries, people who deny religion also seem to possess ambivalent feelings towards their country. In turn, if the state ideology opposes religion, atheists tend to support the combination of anti-religiousness and patriotism.

T1  - Whose lives mattered? How White and Black Americans felt about Black Lives Matter in 2016
AN  - 2533412241
AB  - White Americans, on average, do not support Black Lives Matter, while Black Americans generally express strong support. The lack of support among white Americans is striking, and we argue that it matters why this racial gap exists. Using a nationally representative survey collected during the crest of the first wave of widespread attention to the movement, we explore four potential explanations for interracial differences in feelings toward Black Lives Matter. These explanations reflect competing claims made by advocates and opponents of the movement and have distinct implications for understanding the meaning of these racial differences. Two explanations focus on attitudes toward the police, and two focus on racial prejudice. The results suggest that interracial differences in contact with the police mattered to views of the movement, though in opposite ways for white and Black Americans. Support for the movement among Black Americans was not motivated by an animosity toward the police. Ultimately, the lack of white support for Black Lives Matter was best explained by anti-Black animus and racial resentment, reflecting a concern about the threat this contemporary civil rights movement presents to the racial status quo.

T1  - Exploring Inconsistencies in the Interpretation of Canada’s Section 161 Order for Sexual Offending
AN  - 2521461068
AB  - Community-based risk management strategies for people convicted of sexual offences (PCSO) can hinder successful reintegration, which plays an important role in reducing sexual recidivism. Section 161 of the Criminal Code is a Canadian risk management strategy, which aims to protect children by prohibiting people convicted of sexual offences against children (PCSO-C) from engaging in behaviours assumed (sometimes erroneously) to be associated with sexual offending. This study was the first to evaluate Section 161 prohibition orders. We explored inconsistencies in the interpretation and (hypothetical) application of these conditions between PCSO-C subject to Section 161 and two non-forensic subsamples of the Canadian public – community members and undergraduate students. Non-forensic participants expressed more negative attitudes towards the treatment of PCSO, which were found to mediate the relationship between group membership and subjective legal decision-making. Degree of support for Section 161 conditions did not appear to moderate this effect. Results raise concerns about the potential for increased personal discretion when enforcing or adhering to ambiguous or overly broad legal conditions. We suggest the need for continued efforts to establish an empirical understanding of the application, efficacy, and potential collateral consequences associated with this Canadian risk management strategy.Alternate abstract:
Les stratégies de gestion du risque dans la communauté pour les personnes reconnues coupables d’infractions sexuelles (PCIS) peuvent nuire à une réintégration réussie, ce qui joue un rôle important dans la réduction de récidive sexuelle. L’article 161 du Code criminel est une stratégie de gestion du risque canadienne, laquelle cherche à protéger les enfants en empêchant les personnes reconnues coupables d’infractions sexuelles contre les enfants (PCIS-E) d’avoir des comportements qui sont présumés (parfois de façon erronée) comme étant associés avec des infractions sexuelles. Cette étude a été la première à évaluer l’ordonnance d’interdiction de l’article 161 et à explorer les incohérences dans l’interprétation et l’exécution de ces conditions entre les PCIS-E contraints par l’article 161 et deux sous-échantillons non judiciaires du public canadien – des membres de la communauté et des étudiants de premier cycle. Les participants non judiciaires ont exprimé des attitudes plus négatives envers le traitement des PCIS, ce qui servait de médiateur entre l’appartenance au groupe et la prise de décision juridique subjective. Un certain soutien des conditions de l’article 161 conditions n’a pas semblé modérer cet effet. Les résultats soulèvent des inquiétudes en ce qui concerne le potentiel d’avoir une plus grande discrétion personnelle lors de la mise en application de conditions légales ambiguës et trop étendues. Nous suggérons que nous devons continuer nos efforts pour établir une compréhension empirique de la mise en application, de l’efficacité et des conséquences collatérales potentielles associées avec cette stratégie de gestion du risque canadienne.

T1  - Koreans' attitudes toward China and Chinese people: The effect of direct contact experience
AN  - 2512819498
AB  - Although the number of Chinese immigrants moving to South Korea has increased in the past decade Koreans still hold negative attitudes toward China and the Chinese populace. To discover whether this prejudice can be reduced, we examined the effect of direct contact with Chinese people on Koreans' explicit and implicit attitudes toward China and Chinese people. Participants in our study were 91 Korean university students who were divided into two groups based on their contact experience with people from China. The contact group (n = 43) and the noncontact group (n = 48) both completed a cultural experience questionnaire, the Explicit Attitude Questionnaire, and the Implicit Association Test. According to the results, the contact group displayed more positive explicit and implicit attitudes toward China and Chinese people than did the noncontact group. These findings suggest that it may be possible to improve Koreans' perception of China and relations with Chinese people by increasing direct contact experience between the two communities.

T1  - Testing three explanations for stigmatization of people of Asian descent during COVID-19: maladaptive coping, biased media use, or racial prejudice?
AN  - 2487346041
AB  - ObjectiveTo investigate factors associated with the stigmatization of people of Asian descent during COVID-19 in the United States and factors that can mitigate or prevent stigmatization.DesignA national sample survey of adults (N = 842) was conducted online between May 11 and May 19, 2020. Outcome variables were two dimensions of stigmatization, responsibility and persons as risk. Hierarchical regression analyses were performed.ResultsRacial prejudice, maladaptive coping, and biased media use each explained stigmatization. Racial prejudice, comprising stereotypical beliefs and emotion toward Asian Americans, was a stronger predictor of stigmatization than maladaptive coping or biased media use. Fear concerning the ongoing COVID-19 situation and the use of social media and partisan cable TV also predicted stigmatization. Low self-efficacy in dealing with COVID-19, when associated with high estimated harm of COVID-19, increased stigmatization. High perceived institutional efficacy in the handling of COVID-19 increased stigmatization when linked to high estimated harm of COVID-19. On the other hand, high perceived collective efficacy in coping with COVID-19 was associated with low stigmatization. More indirect contacts with Asians via the media predicted less stigmatization.ConclusionsEfforts to reduce stigmatization should address racial stereotypes and emotions, maladaptive coping, and biased media use by providing education and resources to the public. Fostering collective efficacy and media-based contacts with Asian Americans can facilitate these efforts.

T1  - The Cycle of Violence: Examining Attitudes Toward and Experiences of Corporal Punishment in a Representative German Sample
AN  - 2477170666
AB  - The use of corporal punishment (CP) is controversial despite the negative consequences of its use that have been documented. Consequences include the use of CP by those who experienced CP themselves, described in the theory of the cycle of violence. There are little data on the cycle of violence, especially on those who break it and in representative samples. This study examines the cycle of violence in a representative sample by analyzing experiences of and attitudes toward CP. Attitudes toward, and own experiences of, CP by their parents were assessed in a sample of 2,519 individuals (female 54.6%, age range = 14-99 years, M = 48.9 years). Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subgroups of participants who support and oppose CP. Breaking the cycle, defined as having experienced CP and opposing CP, was examined. Factors associated with positive and negative attitudes toward CP were identified using group comparisons and binary logistic regression. The majority of the sample opposed CP (56%), whereas one third supported less severe forms of CP and 8.2% also supported severe CP. Those supporting CP reported having experienced CP by their parents more often. Of those who had experienced CP, 47% were identified as breaking the cycle. Female gender, younger age, not being divorced, and being married and living together, as well as a higher level of education were associated with breaking the cycle. Even though CP was legally banned in Germany, a relatively high proportion still reports positive attitudes toward and experiences of CP. The ban of CP by the federal government seems to be an effective measure to change attitudes on a societal level as rates were lower in comparison with earlier studies. Future studies should examine interactions between different types of CP, attitudes toward its use, and additional mediating factors.

T1  - “Wonderful but Weak”: Children’s Ambivalent Attitudes Toward Women
AN  - 2474583045
AB  - According to ambivalent sexism theory, prejudice toward women has two forms: hostile (i.e., antipathy toward women) and benevolent (i.e., patronizing and paternalistic attitudes toward women). We investigated whether 5- to 11-year-old children’s gender attitudes exhibit this bipartite, ambivalent structure. Consistent with this possibility, latent variable modeling on a new developmentally appropriate instrument revealed that children’s (n = 237) hostile and benevolent attitudes were two distinct but positively associated factors. Using this instrument, we then explored age and U.S. regional differences in ambivalent gender attitudes, as well as whether these attitudes predicted self-evaluations and preferences associated with traditional gender roles. Stronger agreement with hostile and benevolent gender attitudes was found among younger children, except for boys’ benevolent attitudes, which did not vary with age. Children also reported lower agreement with benevolent gender attitudes in a more gender-egalitarian region of the United States (New York vs. Illinois). Finally, children’s benevolent and hostile attitudes differentially predicted their self-evaluations (e.g., boys’ benevolent vs. hostile attitudes predicted higher vs. lower self-evaluations of warmth, respectively). No evidence emerged for links between gender attitudes and traditional career or relationship expectations. These findings provide the first known evidence that children’s gender attitudes are ambivalent—comprising distinct, but positively related, dimensions of subjective positivity and negativity.

T1  - Youth Perceptions of Voting Participation in the Midst of Catalonia’s Active Struggle for Independence
AN  - 2465705831
AB  - Focusing on youth attitudes during a time of political upheaval in Catalonia, we study 1,438 high school students, aged 15 to 16, nested within 30 high schools. Using multilevel analyses, we examine their perceptions of the importance of voting across different election types (independence referendum, local, subnational, national, supernational) and intent to vote regularly upon turning 18. Results show a matching effect of perceived voting importance with levels of municipal, Catalan, Spanish, and European identification. Notably, voting importance across different elections also relates to the extent students perceived their social studies teacher as open to debate and the expression of student opinions within the classroom. This study also highlights differences between the importance that students place on voting in a possible independence referendum compared with conventional elections. For example, socioeconomic status and political dialogue with parents are not associated with perceived voting importance concerning the referendum but are with other election types.

T1  - Intersectional patterns of prejudice confrontation by White, heterosexual, and cisgender allies
AN  - 2472327791
AB  - Scholarship produced by psychologists typically focuses on one area of social identity and oppression per study (e.g., only sexism) with very little intersectional analysis across systemic oppression and privilege. To better understand the intersecting patterns of ally behavior, we examined online confrontation behavior by privileged individuals in response to antigay, antitransgender, and racist comments. Study 1 explored rates and types of confrontation during encounters with anti‐Mexican and antigay comments. Study 2 used an experimental design to assess rates and types of confrontation of anti‐Arab and antitransgender comments in the presence of a second confederate who either confronted the prejudice or remained silent. When exposed to anti‐Mexican bias, men were initially more likely to speak up than women, whereas women were more likely to respond to antigay comments. In terms of anti‐Arab and antitransgender bias, social influence resulted in more direct confrontation for anti‐Arab statements and higher rates of confrontation for antitransgender bias. Applying an intersectional lens, patterns of power and privilege reveal gender socialization may impact ally responses to racism and antigay bias. For example, gender socialization and stereotypes equating femininity with gay men may both decrease ally behavior among men and increase confrontation of antigay bias among women. When another potential ally is present, social influence appears to become the most powerful predictor of both whether or not a participant confronts bias and how direct they are with the perpetrator. Intersectional examination of invisible norms for promoting ally confrontation informs development of effective equity and justice interventions.

T1  - Plural Belongings: Mothering Co-resident Children Post-migration in the USA
AN  - 2471587136
AB  - Immigrant mothers to the USA skillfully negotiate a sense of belonging that is local, global and in-between, as members of multiple spaces for themselves and their children. However, popular conceptions of migrant mothers paint them as traditionalists at best, expected to be grateful for their new ‘here’. This research is based on a small qualitative study of middle-class migrant mothers from multiple parts of the world living in North America. It exposes the differential impact of race and ethnicity on the mothers’ experiences, despite the relative socioeconomic privilege in the backgrounds and life trajectories of the women and their families. The mothers build flexible concepts of home that transcend single countries, raise children who have multiple homes and ideas of identity and strategize to confront prejudices and build ties to their new communities. By focusing on questions enmeshed with women’s mothering acts, we gain insights into notions of identity and belonging. As the mothers in this study negotiate the double transition into motherhood and into a new sociocultural experience, this article explores how they make intentional choices to negotiate, renegotiate and work around migration in ways that are reflective of their senses of self pre- and post-migration. In understanding migrant mothers’ experiences, we also see how policy makers may meet migrant’s needs and by extension, the needs of communities in a world shaped by internationalisms.

T1  - The Prevalence, Correlates, and Consequences of Racial Apathy Among Black Teenagers
AN  - 2471552770
AB  - Racial apathy is a socially desirable and contemporary form of white racial prejudice that resonates with color-blind ideologies. Survey researchers assert it indicates whether whites do not care about racial equality. Deviating from prior studies, we investigate racial apathy among black teenagers. Specifically, we examine racial apathy’s prevalence and correlates, and associations with emotional well-being and alcohol use. Analyzing data from the 2003 National Study of Youth and Religion (NSYR, n = 3290), we find one in four black teenagers does not care about racial equality. In terms of correlates, we find daily importance of faith links negatively with racial apathy. Low grades and school difficulties directly predict racial apathy among black teenagers. Living in the West, compared to other regions, associates with larger odds of expressing racial apathy. Finally, black teenagers’ expressions of racial apathy do not predict their emotional well-being or alcohol use.

T1  - The affective lives of doubled‐up Latinx youth: Influences of school experiences, familism, and ethnic identity exploration
AN  - 2457200409
AB  - Doubled‐up Latinx youth experience many daily challenges associated with ethnic minority status and residential instability. Doubled‐up youth share housing with noncustodial caregivers such as friends and/or extended family members primarily because of economic hardship and a breakdown in available parental support. Using data from baseline and 10 days of twice‐a‐day surveys, this study examined how in‐school positive experiences, familism (i.e., a perspective that gives precedence to the family), and ethnic identity (i.e., affirmation, exploration, and resolution) influence after school positive (e.g., feeling joyful/happy) and negative (e.g., feeling stressed/anxious) affect among doubled‐up Latinx youth (70% female; Mage = 16.5). Results indicate that in‐school positive experiences were associated with more after school positive affect and less after school negative affect. In addition, youth with higher levels of familism reported experiencing less after school negative affect. However, gender moderated the relation of ethnic identity exploration and experiences of after school positive affect. Specifically, females with higher levels of ethnic identity exploration reported relatively lower levels of after school positive affect compared with males. Overall, study findings highlight the importance of both person‐level and varying contextual influences on the affective lives of doubled‐up Latinx youth.Alternate abstract:Practitioner Points1) Doubled‐up Latinx youth (i.e., youth who share housing with a series of friends and/or extended family) encounter complex and challenging experiences in their daily lives, such as prejudice and residential instability, which can place them at a higher risk for emotional difficulties and mental health concerns.2) The current study's main findings revealed that daily positive school experiences and cultural factors (i.e., familism and ethnic identity) were positively associated with youth's end‐of‐day positive affect and negatively associated with end‐of‐day negative affect.3) These findings support the notion that culture and context are necessary to consider in supporting Latinx youth to cultivate a pattern of daily resilience in spite of their unstable residential circumstances.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Opposition to Same-Sex Parents: the Mediation Effect of Satisfaction with Contact
AN  - 2449451148
AB  - IntroductionThe intergroup contact variable has been widely studied in the literature, and it has been shown to be closely related to less prejudice. The present article analyzes the role of an affective mediator in the relationship between the degree of contact-rejection of the outgroup (same-sex parents) variables, linked to the variable quality of contact or satisfaction with contact with people with a homosexual sexual orientation.MethodsThe sample is composed of 401 Spanish university students (67 males, 16.2%, and 347 females, 83.8%) with a mean age of 21 years (SD = 3.20). The data collection took place between November 2016 and March 2017.ResultsThe results show a complete mediation effect in the case of open or traditional prejudice (individual opposition), and partial mediation when analyzing modern or subtle rejection of same-sex parents (normative opposition).ConclusionsOur findings suggest that efforts to reduce the rejection of same-sex parents must take into account the individual’s positive evaluation of the contact because it is a mechanism that mediates the relationship between degree of contact and rejection.Social policy implicationsHomophobia intervention programs must consider the intergroup contact variable, taking into account that it is also necessary to act on positive emotions and affectivity toward relationships with people with a homosexual sexual orientation. Increasing positive contact with same-sex parents could be a key element in reducing rejection toward the effects of their child-rearing on their children.

T1  - Harnessing Social Influence Theory to Improve Attitudes Towards Gay Parents
AN  - 2449450728
AB  - IntroductionDespite the legal recognition of gay men’s right to marry and form families in numerous countries, they remain at risk of mental health impacts from prejudice. This novel experimental study aimed to harness social influence theory to improve heterosexuals’ attitudes towards gay parents.MethodThree hundred and forty-seven community members (Mage = 38.7 years, 52% male) and 249 university students (Mage = 19.9 years, 42% male) volunteered for an online quasi-experiment in mid-2018. Participants were randomly allocated to reading a vignette that contained either a highly supportive group attitude about gay parents, a less supportive group attitude about gay parents or an unrelated filler-task.ResultsThe study found that (i) exposure to a high-support condition improved individuals’ attitudes towards the social context of gay parents, compared to baseline, within the student sample; (ii) males reported significantly less positive attitudes towards gay parents than females in the community sample; and (iii) religiosity significantly moderated attitudes towards gay parents’ parenting skills among those in the baseline condition and not among those the high-support condition, in both samples.ConclusionThe findings suggest that group attitudes can be harnessed to mitigate the negative relationship between higher religiosity and individual attitudes towards gay parents. The findings are important in the aftermath of divisive debates about legalising same-sex marriage and parenting. The study findings point to the potential for religious groups to share overtly supportive group messages about gay parents, rather than staying silent, in order to prevent the harms of prejudice towards this vulnerable population.

T1  - Parents' responses to toys representing physical impairment
TT  - Parents’ responses to toys representing impairment
AN  - 2459571589
AB  - PurposeThis study aimed to look at parents' perceptions of a number of different toy prototypes that represented physical impairments and predictors of these perceptions.Design/methodology/approachA correlational survey design was used. Parents of children aged 4–10 years who identified their child as having a disability (n = 160) and not as having a disability (n = 166) took part. They rated a number of prototypes for likelihood that their child would enjoy playing with them and completed measures of their responses toward children with disabilities and of their own and their child's direct contact with people with disabilities.FindingsIt was found that, among parents of children who did not declare that their child had a disability, the more open the parents were toward disability, the more contact the children had with other children with disabilities and the more likely they were to consider that their child would like to play with a toy prototype representing a physical impairment. This pattern of results was not found among parents who identified their child as having a disability, where instead positive friendship intentions of parents mediated this association.Research limitations/implicationsThese findings have implications for theories informing the positive benefits of disability representation.Practical implicationsThese findings indicate different paths through which parents might be moved to purchase toys that represent physical impairments for their children.Social implicationsThese findings suggest that representative toys might be associated with an open dialogue around the topic of disability.Originality/valueThis is the first study of the responses of parents to toys that represent physical impairments known to the authors.

T1  - RWAc and SDOc: The measurement of right‐wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation in childhood
AN  - 2451721903
AB  - Right‐wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) predict prejudice and discrimination in adults. To create analogous scales for children, we carried out four studies. First, we gave 112 adults from New Zealand (Study 1) and 146 adults from Turkey (Study 2) novel child‐appropriate measures of RWA and SDO, along with the standard adult measures. The two RWA measures correlated more highly with each other than with the SDO measures, and the two SDO measures correlated more highly with each other than with the RWA measures. Study 3 tested 75 children aged 6 to 12, finding acceptable to good reliability for the two child scales. Child RWA (RWAc) and SDO (SDOc) decreased significantly over age. SDOc correlated with maternal SDO and RWA, and RWAc correlated with children's racial bias. Study 4 examined the RWAc scale with 39 children aged 5 to 11 years. There was good reliability for the RWAc scale and a correlation with anti‐fat prejudice. Overall, the findings indicate that: (a) the scales are reliable, (b) SDOc correlates with parental attitudes, (c) RWAc correlates with children's prejudice, and (d) RWA and SDO are present early in life and decline with age.

T1  - Perceived Group Threat, Perceived Injustice, and Self-Reported Right-Wing Violence: An Integrative Approach to the Explanation Right-Wing Violence
AN  - 2435507275
AB  - The present study aims at explaining individual differences in self-reported political violence. We integrate key concepts from the field of criminology that are conceptually related to social identity theory (Flemish identity, feelings of group superiority, and ethnocentrism) and the dual process model on prejudice (perceived injustice, perception of threat, and right-wing authoritarianism). In our model, social identity concepts are hypothesized to play a mediating role between mechanisms derived from the dual process model and political violence. To test the integrated model, a model was run for testing the strength of direct and indirect effects of perceived injustice, authoritarianism thrill-seeking behavior, feelings of superiority, Flemish nationalism, ethnocentrism, right-wing extremist beliefs, and exposure to racist peers on political violence. The analyses are based on a web survey (N = 723) among adolescents and young adults in Flanders, Belgium. Results indicate that social identity variables play an important mediation role between perceptions and ideological attitudes related to injustice, and political violence. The main path revealed by our study is that perceived injustice may result in heightened perceptions of threat, which in turn positively influence levels of right-wing authoritarianism. Mediated by ethnocentrism, this variable has a significant and positive effect on right-wing beliefs, which in turn has a positive effect on political violence.

T1  - Confronting Islamophobia through Social Work Education: A Cohort Study
AN  - 2477272828
AB  - As part of an ongoing curriculum assessment project, faculty associated with the Bachelor's level social work program of the University of Houston-Downtown identified a significant gap in the enrollment of Muslim students as compared to the community at large. In addressing concerns related both to implicit and explicit curricula, the social work faculty developed several action items to address this gap, including the creation of a project to assess student knowledge regarding issues affecting the Muslim community. As part of this effort, a classroom-based intervention was developed, specifically addressing issues of Islamophobia. The intervention was administered to both BSW and MSW students at affiliated universities in the same city. Using a one group, quasi-experimental design, 88 students (70 BSW students and 18 MSW students) participated in a 60-minute classroom intervention session with pre- and post-test surveys administered to assess student knowledge and attitude change. Findings suggest a significant increase in knowledge and a positive change in certain attitudes post-intervention. Implications include the addition of a teaching component on Islamophobia to support the social justice-specific competency, and activities to address larger campus-wide climate issues to support a culturally appropriate and inclusive welcoming environment for Muslim students.

T1  - “It's Nothing to be Ashamed of, I'm Like, I'm Bisexual and I Love Women, I Like Men” - Being a Bisexual Person with an Intellectual Disability
AN  - 2470588821
AB  - Despite increasingly liberal attitudes in the UK, people who identify as bisexual face unique challenges from both mainstream society and within the LGBTQ + community. Negative stereotypes persist surrounding bisexuality, such as people are confused or hiding their ‘true’ sexual orientation as a gay man or a lesbian. No research explores the experiences of bisexual people with an intellectual disability. However, LGBTQ + people with an intellectual disability are a minority and potentially face double discrimination. Eight bisexual people with intellectual disabilities took part in semi-structured interviews exploring their experiences. Participants' narratives were analyzed using interpretive phenomenological analysis. The study highlighted that being bisexual was an essential part of their identity. They experienced the same challenges, such as biphobia, as bisexual people without an intellectual disability. Participants were fearful of disclosing their sexuality to family, friends or their support staff, but overall, this has been a positive experience by enabling individuals to be their authentic self. Participants’ sexuality could pose challenges within their intimate relationships if their partner was not also bisexual. The research highlights the importance of LGBTQ + support groups to people with intellectual disabilities as a safe space to explore their identity, build connections with peers and provide support to integrate within the LGBTQ + scene. There is a clear need for those supporting people with intellectual disabilities to have training surrounding bisexuality and the distinct issues that this group can face.

T1  - The Prospective Association of Internalized Sexual Prejudice during Adolescence with Binge Drinking, Smoking, and Disordered Weight Control Behaviors in Adulthood
AN  - 2470588419
AB  - Prior research shows the importance of internalized sexual prejudice and participation in health indicators for sexual minority people, yet no research has used prospective measures or differentiated sexual minority groups. Data come from the longitudinal cohort study Growing Up Today Study 1 (N = 6,606), limited to participants who provided information on internalized sexual prejudice in adolescence and health indicators in adulthood. Completely heterosexual women with same-sex partners and mostly heterosexual women who reported high internalized sexual prejudice during their adolescence were more likely to binge drink during adulthood than completely heterosexual women with no same-sex partners. Similar patterns existed for mostly heterosexual and lesbian women when predicting smoking. Sexual orientation-related disparities in binge drinking smoking were largest for women with high internalized sexual prejudice who identify as completely heterosexual women with same-sex partners and mostly heterosexual women–groups that may have lower levels of connectedness to the buffering effects of sexual minority communities.

T1  - Exploring the influence of repeat pregnancy on the lives of teenage mothers
AN  - 2442807027
AB  - Repeat pregnancy may be more challenging to teenage mothers and their children because of increased socio-economic impact, as well as the influence of generally short pregnancy interval. Guided by Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory, this study explored challenges faced by teenage mothers with repeat pregnancy and support services available to them. Utilizing a qualitative research design, convenience and snowball sampling methods were used to recruit 41 participants, which consisted of 33 teenage mothers and eight health workers from Mamprobi Polyclinic, Accra, Ghana. Individual in-depth interviews and focus group discussions were utilized to gather data that were analyzed thematically. Findings showed that teenage mothers faced educational, financial, and health challenges. They also experienced psychological issues, particularly stigma. Additionally, teenage mothers did not obtain much support from their spouses and had to fend for themselves or relied on their families, neighbors, and health workers. Furthermore, teenage mothers encountered some barriers (family members rationalizing their problems, being accused of infidelity, and negative attitudes of some health professionals) when they accessed support services. Moreover, many of the teenage mothers were ignorant of available formal support services. The findings suggest the need to promote education on repeat pregnancy, family planning, and available support services.

T1  - Tackling Prejudice and Discrimination Towards Families with Same-Sex Parents: An Exploratory Study in Italy
AN  - 2434147685
AB  - Though studies have shown that the sexual orientation of parents does not influence their parenting skills or the well-being of their children, prejudice against same-sex families is still very widespread. Research has not sufficiently explored the ways in which parents tackle this prejudice. Using qualitative methodologies, in particular textual analyses, this study has analysed the discourse used by same-sex families to handle the prejudices that they face. The results highlighted that conflicts, which may even be ideological in nature, are sometimes created between traditional families and “atypical” families. These often result in estrangement and isolation from their own family and the communities to which they belong, in turn damaging the growth of the children involved. Furthermore, means for moving beyond conflict, sharing experiences and effectively tackling prejudices are also discussed.

T1  - Moral Foundations, Sexual Prejudice, and Outness Among Sexual Minorities
AN  - 2434147377
AB  - Recent decades have seen greater acceptance of sexual minorities and greater legal recognition of same-sex couples in the U.S. However, sexual minorities still experience sexual prejudice in their everyday lives and often internalize these negative attitudes. Among heterosexuals, sexual prejudice has been linked with moral foundations, which are individual differences in moral decision-making. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether, among college students identifying as a sexual minority (N = 176), individualizing and binding moral foundations were associated with sexual prejudice, internalized sexual prejudice, and outness. Sexual prejudice and internalized sexual prejudice were associated with greater emphasis on the binding moral foundations and less emphasis on the individualizing moral foundations. Outness was not associated with moral foundations. These results suggest that sexual minorities’ moral decision-making may play a role in their feelings about their own sexual orientation and the LGB community, but not in the disclosure of their sexual orientation. Efforts to reduce internalized sexual prejudice may need to consider individuals’ deeper underlying moral decision-making framework.

T1  - Photovoice as an Innovative Approach to Group Work with Black Youth in School Settings
AN  - 2440456475
AB  - This article proposes photovoice as an innovative approach to group work with Black (K-12) youth in school settings. More specifically, this article focuses on how school counselors can use photovoice as a tool to address the race-related struggles (e.g., racial prejudice and discrimination) that Black students experience both inside and outside of school. Photovoice empowers students to take photos capturing issues of shared concern in and around their school and use as the basis of critical dialogue and collective action plans. The key features and stages of this approach are outlined. Implication for practice and future research are discussed.

T1  - The “Refugee Crisis,” Immigration Attitudes, and Euroscepticism: IMR
AN  - 2439232143
AB  - Between 2015 and 2017, the European Union (EU) was confronted with a major crisis in its history, the so-called “European refugee crisis.” Since the multifaceted crisis has provoked many different responses, it is also likely to have influenced individuals’ assessments of immigrants and European integration. Using data from three waves of the European Social Survey (ESS) — the wave before the crisis in 2012, the wave at the beginning of the crisis in 2014, and the wave right after the (perceived) height of the crisis in 2016 — we test the degree to which the European refugee crisis increased Europeans’ anti-immigrant sentiment and Euroscepticism, as well as the influence of Europeans’ anti-immigrant attitudes on their level of Euroscepticism. As suggested by prior research, our results indicate that there is indeed a consistent and solid relationship between more critical attitudes toward immigrants and increased Euroscepticism. Surprisingly, however, we find that the crisis increased neither anti-immigrant sentiments nor critical attitudes toward the EU and did not reinforce the link between rejection of immigrants and rejection of the EU. These findings imply that even under a strong external shock, fundamental political attitudes remain constant.

T1  - Differences and Similarities between Perpetrators of Ethnic and Non-Ethnicity-Based Victimization
AN  - 2433032566
AB  - Immigrant and minority youth are at risk of ethnic victimization. Despite an increasing number of studies that aim to understand the consequences of such negativity, relatively little attention has been paid to understanding who the perpetrators of ethnic victimization are. To address this gap in knowledge, the present study examined whether youth who victimize their peers due to their ethnic background are also those who engage in non-ethnicity-based victimization. The study also investigated the underlying factors, i.e., impulsivity, empathy, moral disengagement, and attitudes toward immigrants, that are common or specific to groups of youth. The sample included 949 adolescents residing in Sweden (Mage = 13.11, SD = 0.41; range: 12–15; 46% girls). Cluster analysis revealed four distinct groups of adolescents, based on their reports of ethnic and non-ethnicity-based victimization: (1) low on both forms of victimization, (2) high on ethnic victimization only, (3) high on non-ethnicity-based victimization only, and (4) high on both forms of victimization. The results showed that being morally disengaged is a common denominator of ethnic and non-ethnicity-based victimizers. Difficulties in regulating impulses and lack of perspective-taking skills trigger youth’s engagement in non-ethnicity-based victimization. Lack of empathic concerns and low levels of positive attitudes toward immigrants are the bases of ethnic victimization. Together, these findings suggest that the precursors of ethnic and non-ethnicity-based victimization have similarities as well as differences, which require further attention in developing programs aimed at preventing different forms of peer victimization.

T1  - Validation of the Beliefs about Children’s Adjustment in Same-Sex Families Scale in Italian University Students
AN  - 2425644339
AB  - Assessing attitudes toward same-sex parenting has important implications for both intervention and prevention programs designed to foster the tolerance and normality of sexual and family diversity. Few empirically validated measures of rejection of same-sex parenting have been developed. The current study examined the psychometric properties of an Italian translation of the Beliefs about Children’s Adjustment in Same-Sex Families Scale, a 14-item scale distributed in two subscales that measure direct and subtle rejection toward same-sex parenting, for its use in assessing heterosexual people’s attitudes toward same-sex parents in Italy. The sample consisted of 344 Italian heterosexual university students (113 men) with a mean age of 20.48 years (SD = 1.60). The results showed that the scale has a good factor structure (via confirmatory factor analysis) and satisfactory reliability and acceptable criterion-related validity. Therefore, the BCASSFS can be used to measure opposition toward gay and lesbian parenting in the Italian context.

T1  - Prejudice Against Gender and Sexual Diversity in Brazilian Public High Schools
AN  - 2421635755
AB  - This paper is the result of a research that evaluated the levels of prejudice against sexual and gender minorities within 28 Brazilian public schools. The research considered a sample of 413 teachers, 97 employees, and 1829 students from 28 public high schools, located in four Brazilian states: Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais, Ceará, and Pernambuco. All of them answered a questionnaire on sociodemographic data, the revised version of the Prejudice Against Sexual and Gender Diversity scale. The resulting analysis highlighted that religious individuals and followers of the Neo-Pentecostal church in the three study groups presented higher levels of prejudice than the other groups involved. All groups that have done previous training in the subject of prejudice presented inferior scores to those that had not done. Individuals that stated they have gay man, lesbian woman, travestis persons, or transsexual persons as friends, relatives, and acquaintances in the groups of teachers and students presented a lower level of prejudice compared to those who did not have relationships with people with these characteristics. Our results suggest the need for methodological changes in schools so that institutions can prepare their curriculum and their pedagogical practices considering the current multiple existing sexual and gender orientations.

T1  - Psychological sense of community and values: Understanding attitudes towards people seeking asylum and Australia's First Nations People
AN  - 2424816600
AB  - ObjectiveDiscrimination and prejudice have significant implications for individuals and communities and are prevalent throughout the world towards marginalised groups. This study investigated the role of psychological sense of community (PSOC), values of self‐transcendence and openness‐to‐change, and demographic variables, with attitudes towards two different groups in Australia.MethodA convenience sample of adults living in Australia (N = 396) was randomly assigned to complete one of two online surveys; reporting on their attitudes towards Australia's First Nations People (N = 198), or towards people seeking asylum (N = 198). The study assessed the extent to which a PSOC (in reference to local, national, and global communities), self‐transcendence, and openness‐to‐change, predicted attitudes towards the two groups.ResultsSelf‐transcendence and psychological sense of global community consistently predicted attitudes towards both groups, with psychological sense of global community partially mediating the relationship between self‐transcendence and attitudes. Bivariately, those holding a stronger local psychological sense of community reported more positive attitudes towards people seeking asylum, whereas those holding a stronger psychological sense of national community reported more positive attitudes towards Australia's First Nations People. However, in multivariable regression models with self‐transcendence and demographic characteristics, only a higher psychological sense of national community significantly predicted more negative attitudes towards people seeking asylum.ConclusionsThis research suggests that where people have a strong sense they are part of a global community they hold more positive attitudes towards people from various cultures both near and far. The research has implications for social cohesion and social policy.

T1  - Are There Differences in Anti-Gay Beliefs Among U.S. Veterans and Non-Veterans? Results from the General Social Survey
AN  - 2419908743
AB  - Only since 2011 have sexual minorities been able to serve openly in the U.S. military. The previous anti-gay policies and culture of the military may have increased anti-gay beliefs among veterans. Using data from the 2010–2016 General Social Survey, we tested whether veterans more frequently endorsed anti-gay beliefs than their non-veteran peers. Adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics with multiple logistic regression, we tested the associations of veteran status with five anti-gay beliefs (i.e., disallowing a gay person (1) from publicly speaking or (2) teaching at a university, (3) removing a gay-supportive book from a library, (4) whether same-sex sexual relations are wrong, and (5) support of same-sex marriage. Veteran status was associated with greater disagreement with same-sex marriage (B = 0.16, p = 0.033) but not with other anti-gay beliefs. Most anti-gay beliefs among veterans were explained by other sociodemographic factors and may not be inherent to veteran status.

T1  - Past Place, Present Prejudice: The Impact of Adolescent Racial Context on White Racial Attitudes
AN  - 2394485161
AB  - Extensive research on racial contexts suggests that white Americans living near black Americans adopt more negative racial attitudes. Theoretically, local intergroup exposure has been conceptualized as acting contemporaneously through various mechanisms. However, a separate body of research on political socialization indicates that adolescent experiences are often especially influential. We hypothesize that whites’ racial contexts during adolescence produce prejudiced responses. We then test this hypothesis using two complementary data sets, a population-based panel conducted 2007–13 and the Youth-Parent Socialization Panel Survey (1965–97). Our analyses demonstrate the enduring influence of adolescent contexts at larger levels of aggregation: while the racial composition of whites’ current counties is not a consistent predictor of racial prejudice, the racial composition of their county during high school is. Proximity during one’s formative years increases racial prejudice years later, providing new insights about local contextual effects and the roots of racial prejudice.

T1  - Acculturation and school adjustment of children and youth from culturally diverse backgrounds: Predictors and interventions for school psychology
AN  - 2299158254
AB  - In recent decades, classrooms in many countries have become more culturally diverse. However, students from ethnic minorities and students with immigrant backgrounds are at greater risk of lower social, psychological, and academic adjustment than their native peers. Therefore, schools all over the world are challenged by the question of how to help diverse students adjust to school independent of their ethnic background and family resources. The current special issue focuses on how schools and school psychologists can support positive interethnic attitudes and positive relationships in ethnically diverse classrooms as well as individual well-being, belonging, and academic achievement as different facets of school adjustment. The special issue includes three studies with empirical findings on the role of contextual and individual factors for school adjustment among minority and majority youth in diverse school contexts: Geerlings, Thjis, and Verkuyten study the modeling of outgroup attitudes via teachers' attitudes and more or less consistent behavior, Guerra, Rodrigues, Aguiar, Carmona, Alexandre, and Costa Lopes focus on the interplay of acculturation strategies and of perceived discrimination with school achievement and well-being. Caravita, Strohmeier, Salmivalli, and Di Blasio compare bullying and moral disengagement processes in majority and minority children. Five other studies report evaluations of evidence-based interventions that were tested among ethnically diverse youth in different school settings in two European countries, in Israel, and in the US – two on prejudice reduction (Brenick, Lawrence, Carvalheiro & Berger; Mäkinen, Liebkind, Jasinskaja-Lahti, & Renvik), and three on the effects of 'wise interventions' - self-affirmation and belonging interventions - on trust in teachers and behavioral conduct (Binning et al.), on students' sense of belonging and academic outcomes (Marksteiner, Janke, & Dickhäuser), and on math performance of students (Lokhande & Müller). The evaluation studies show differential effects across contexts and samples that point toward important mechanisms and moderators that may help practitioners adjust these programs to specific contexts.

T1  - Same-Sex Parents and Children’s School Progress: An Association That Disappeared Over Time
AN  - 2170093285
AB  - Research is divided as to whether children living in same-sex parent families achieve different outcomes compared with their peers. In this article, we improve on earlier estimates of such differences and subsequently study whether and why the association between parental union sex composition and children’s school progress changed over time. Data from the American Community Survey waves 2008–2015 (N = 1,952,490 including 7,792 children living with a same-sex couple) indicate that children living with same-sex couples were historically more likely to be behind in school but that this association disappeared over time. Changes in socioeconomic characteristics of same-sex couples played a minor role. In 2008, it was only in areas with unfavorable laws and attitudes toward same-sex couples that children living with same-sex couples were more likely to be behind in school. This was especially the case for adopted children. In more recent periods, no effect of parental union sex composition on school progress is observed within any area or among any group studied. Based on where and when these changes took place, it is suggested that changing attitudes toward same-sex couples might have played an important role in equalizing school progress across groups.

T1  - Pathways to ethnic-racial identity development and psychological adjustment: The differential associations of cultural socialization by parents and peers
AN  - 2132690516
AB  - Ethnic-racial identity (ERI) development is a central developmental process for youth of color. Although a great deal of research establishes the importance of cultural socialization by parents to the development of ERI, limited empirical work has examined peers’ role in these processes. This study uses 4 cross-sectional data sets (N = 127, 312, 257, and 238, mean age = 17.96–18.24) followed by a meta-analytic summary to test a path model of ERI development and parent and peer cultural socialization and their associations with psychological adjustment in a diverse sample of emerging adults. The final sample size adjusted meta-analytic model indicated that parent ethnic socialization predicted both ERI exploration and commitment while only peer preparation for bias predicted ERI commitment. In turn, ERI commitment and exploration predicted more positive mental health. The findings of this study highlight the importance of both parents and peers to cultural socialization processes during emerging adulthood. In particular, this study suggests that the messages peers impart about prejudice play a unique role in the development of ERI. The findings have important implications about the unique role peers play in communicating messages about prejudice as well as for ERI and the psychological adjustment of youth of color at this developmental stage. Additionally, these cross-sectional findings provide a preliminary but robust model from which researchers can frame future longitudinal work in this area.

T1  - 'You are labelled by your children's disability' - A community-based, participatory study of stigma among Somali parents of children with autism living in the United Kingdom
AN  - 2077176604
AB  - Objectives: Social stigma is commonly experienced by parents of children with autism. Our aim was to understand the nature of stigma experienced by Somali parents of children with autism in the United Kingdom (UK), and to consider how they coped with or resisted such stigma.Design: We used a community-based participatory research approach, collaborating with a community organisation of Somali parents. In-depth interviews with simultaneous translation were conducted with 15 Somali parents of children with autism living in Bristol, UK, in 2015. Parents were sampled purposively to capture diversity in children's age, severity of autism and time since diagnosis. Directed thematic analysis used Link and Phelan's model of stigma.Results: Of the 15 participants, 12 were mothers (mean age 36). The 17 children with autism they cared for were 4-13 years' old, and five were girls. Two main themes with sub-themes were identified: the nature of stigma (labelling and stereotyping; separation; emotional reactions, discrimination and power), and coping and resistance (the power of language; faith as a resource; learning, peer support and community relationships). Children with autism were labelled and stereotyped (e.g. as 'sick', 'naughty', 'different') and parents blamed for not controlling them, leading to social rejection and isolation. Stigma was associated with a poor understanding of autism, a lack of vocabulary related to autism in the Somali community, and prejudice against mental illness and disability. There was evidence of enacted and felt stigma and examples of discrimination. Finding their own language to describe their child's condition and drawing on faith, learning and peer support were important resources in resisting stigma.Conclusions: Findings inform support for this community, highlighting the need to raise awareness of autism, enable parents to speak openly, and ensure appropriate professional services and interventions are available.

T1  - Peer Attitudes and the Development of Prejudice in Adolescence
AN  - 2313920933
AB  - According to a number of psychological and sociological theories, individuals are susceptible to social influence from their immediate social environment, especially during adolescence. An important social context is the network of one’s peers. However, data limitations, specifically a lack of longitudinal data with information about respondents’ social networks, have limited previous analyses of the relationship between peers and prejudice over time. In this article, we rely on a five-wave panel of adolescents, aged either 13 or 16 in wave 1 (N = 1,009). We examine the effects of this social context on prejudice by focusing on nominated friends’ attitudes, attitudes of prestigious peers, and respondents’ own positions in their networks. Results indicate that the level of prejudice among peers affects individual prejudice over time. Results also show that both prestigious and nonprestigious peers affect prejudice. Finally, adolescents’ own positions in their networks matter: Network centrality is inversely related to prejudice.

T1  - Multicultural integration in British and Dutch societies: education and citizenship
AN  - 1895242141
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to review and synthesize published studies and practice in the “integration” of ethnic and religious minorities in Britain and The Netherlands, 1965-2015, drawing out implications for current policy and practice.Design/methodology/approachThis paper is an evaluative review and report of results of work on citizenship education for young Muslims and their peers in English schools.FindingsYoung Muslims have positive attitudes to “good citizenship”, as Islamic socialization makes them particularly responsive to citizenship messages. But there is hard-core racial prejudice and Islamophobia in about 25 per cent of adults. In The Netherlands, this xenophobia has supported far-right politicians who are strongly anti-Muslim. This paper cites evidence that continued prejudice may lead to alienation and radicalization of some minorities.Research limitations/implicationsUnchecked prejudice concerning minorities can have negative implications for both majority and minority groups – this broad hypothesis deserves further research in both Dutch and British societies.Practical implicationsIn Britain, success in Muslim schools in fostering positive citizenship implies that Muslim groups can maintain “quiet dignity” in following Islamic pathways to good citizenship.Social implicationsState support for religious-foundation schools should be offered to all religious groups and should not be withheld from Muslim minorities for “security” reasons.Originality/valueThis overview by two Muslim educators offers new insights and proposals in the acceptance of Muslim minorities in Europe.

T1  - Homophobic Prejudice in Czech Youth: a Sociodemographic Analysis of Young People's Opinions on Homosexuality
AN  - 1802421355
AB  - The aims of this study are to provide momentum to research on homophobic prejudice in Czechia and to identify the significant factors influencing or mediating homophobic attitudes in Czech youth. The paper first contextualizes homophobia within the context of the Central and Eastern European countries and then refers to the role of schools and education tools in the prevention of homophobia. Results of a quantitative analysis based on original data collected during a research survey from 9th graders (N=1082) in 35 selected Czech elementary schools are presented in the empirical part of the paper. We identify demographic, socioeconomic, psychological, and environmental factors that are significantly linked with homophobic attitudes in youth. Gender differences as well as relationship satisfaction with parents or peers, psychological status, and perception of quality of the environment one lives in were found to be among the most significant factors influencing prejudicial opinions in youth. Metropolitan youth were found to be significantly less prejudiced against nonheterosexuals. By taking lessons from abroad, we propose a number of possible policy interventions mainly in the realm of curricular documents and teacher training.

T1  - Vile vigilance: An integrated theoretical framework for understanding the state of Black surveillance
AN  - 1768022945
AB  - The family is the principal source of socialization and protection against racism for many Blacks. Transmitting values, norms, morals, and beliefs (i.e., racial socialization) to successive generations is done to promote racial awareness and to prepare an individual to survive in racist environments. Further, developing a sense of security, resiliency, and cultural pride provides psychological protection against racial prejudice and discrimination. Protective socialization is even more critical when it becomes the difference between life and death at the hands of law enforcement-a fate faced by too many Black males as a result of racist policing practices, including the over-patrolling of Black communities. Because discriminatory surveillance and over-patrolling can incite a number of social, physical, and mental health issues, a holistic approach to understanding the interaction between Blacks and law enforcement is critical. This article reviews the Mundane Extreme Environmental Stress (MEES) model, racial socialization theory, and Family Stress Model in the development of a theoretical framework for understanding the patterns of interactions between Blacks and law enforcement, the immediate and long-term effects of unjustified shootings on Black families and communities, and the response of sociopolitical systems. The new theoretical framework will be used to inform the work of human service providers and practitioners by identifying targets for interventions to improve relations and trust between Black communities and law enforcement institutions.

T1  - Understanding the Selection Bias: Social Network Processes and the Effect of Prejudice on the Avoidance of Outgroup Friends
AN  - 1767328597; 201605714
AB  - Research has found that prejudiced people avoid friendships with members of ethnic outgroups. Results of this study suggest that this effect is mediated by a social network process. Longitudinal network analysis of a three-wave panel study of 12- to 13-year-olds (N = 453) found that more prejudiced majority group members formed fewer intergroup friendships than less prejudiced majority group members. This was caused indirectly by the preference to become friends of one's friends' friends (triadic closure). More prejudiced majority members did not have a preference for actively avoiding minority group members. Rather, they had the tendency to avoid friends who already had minority group friends and thus could not be introduced to potential minority group friends. Instead they became friends with the majority group friends of their friends. This research shows how a social networks perspective can further our understanding of the processes underlying intergroup contact. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Schools, Peers, and Prejudice in Adolescence
AN  - 1700674991; 201526988
AB  - Adolescents' perceptions of the prejudice in their social environments can factor into their developmental outcomes. The degree to which others in the environment perceive such prejudice-regardless of adolescents' own perceptions-also matters by shedding light on the contextual climate in which adolescents spend their daily lives. Drawing on the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study revealed that school-wide perceptions of peer prejudice, which tap into the interpersonal climate of schools, appeared to be particularly risky for adolescents' academic achievement. In contrast, adolescents' own perceptions of peer prejudice at schools were associated with their feelings of alienation in school. Importantly, these patterns did not vary substantially by several markers of vulnerability to social stigmatization. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Predicting Homophobic Behavior Among Heterosexual Youth: Domain General and Sexual Orientation-Specific Factors at the Individual and Contextual Level
AN  - 1285325607; 22956337
AB  - As a form of bias-based harassment, homophobic behavior remains prominent in schools. Yet, little attention has been given to factors that underlie it, aside from bullying and sexual prejudice. Thus, we examined multiple domain general (empathy, perspective-taking, classroom respect norms) and sexual orientation-specific factors (sexual orientation identity importance, number of sexual minority friends, parents' sexual minority attitudes, media messages). We documented support for a model in which these sets of factors converged to predict homophobic behavior, mediated through bullying and prejudice, among 581 students in grades 9-12 (55 % female). The structural equation model indicated that, with the exception of media messages, these additional factors predicted levels of prejudice and bullying, which in turn predicted the likelihood of students to engage in homophobic behavior. These findings highlight the importance of addressing multiple interrelated factors in efforts to reduce bullying, prejudice, and discrimination among youth.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ethnicity, Gender Socialization, and Children's Attitudes Toward Gay Men and Lesbian Women
AN  - 1125223607; 201240567
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess whether children's attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women differ in relation to their ethnic backgrounds and whether ethnic differences are a result of perceived differential gender socialization practices. Data were collected from children in eight Dutch elementary schools by means of a paper-and-pencil questionnaire administered in the classroom. All children (mean age 11.47; N = 229) lived in the Netherlands; 50.2% had non-Western and 49.8% Western ethnic backgrounds. Children with non-Western ethnic backgrounds reported more negative attitudes toward gays and lesbians. These children perceived more parental pressure to behave in accordance with their gender and showed more negative attitudes toward gender-nonconforming behavior by peers. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that cultural differences in attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women are partly mediated by differentially perceived parental pressure to behave in accordance with their gender.

T1  - Do the ideological beliefs of peers predict the prejudiced attitudes of other individuals in the group?: GPIR
AN  - 1928217053
AB  - The authors used multilevel modeling to examine whether peer group ideological beliefs (n = 109 friendship groups) predicted the homophobic and racist attitudes of other individuals within the group (n = 395 college students). Results indicated that the social dominance orientation (SDO), right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), and universal-diverse orientation (UDO) ideological beliefs of peers predicted the prejudiced attitudes of other group members, over and above individuals' own ideological views. Additionally, the strength with which individuals' own ideological beliefs predicted their prejudiced attitudes varied systematically across peer groups. Affiliations with high-RWA peers strengthened the extent to which individuals' own SDO and RWA predicted their prejudiced attitudes. Results suggest the ideological beliefs of peers are relevant to predicting the prejudiced attitudes of the individuals with whom they affiliate. Although specific peer ideologies differentially predicted forms of prejudice, the overall contribution of these peer ideology beliefs to the prediction of individuals' prejudiced attitudes was comparable for both homophobic and racist attitudes. Attention to proximal social networks and the social dynamics within these networks can contribute to better explanations of individual differences in prejudiced attitudes.
