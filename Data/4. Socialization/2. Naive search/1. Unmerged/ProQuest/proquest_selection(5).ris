T1  - Participation of People With Impairments in Seniors' Organizations: Conditions and Limitations on Inclusion
AN  - 2451553699
AB  - Background and Objectives While older adults' social participation has attracted sustained attention, the realities faced by seniors with impairments in this area are still understudied. Social representations are formed from socially constructed opinions regarding a given object and have four functions (knowledge, identity, orientation, justification). The purpose of this article is to document the social representations that exist within seniors' organizations regarding participation by older people with impairments. Research Design and Methods In this mixed-methods study, an exploratory sequential design was applied. First, a qualitative phase involved meetings with five focus groups to explore how participants would manage difficult situations in which the inclusion of an older person with impairments must be addressed. Second, a quantitative phase consisted of a questionnaire administered to 86 respondents to examine the components of social representations about the participation of older people with impairments. Results Results show that, although research participants acknowledge that all seniors have the right to participate, this right confronts a collective identity infused with aging model that demands a youthful, "un-disabled" appearance and activities. In terms of the orientation function, making participation a reality is seen as relying on the efforts of people with impairments, but when there is a failure of inclusiveness, the reasons offered to justify it concern the resources available, rather than possible prejudices. Discussion and Implications Interpretation of the results leads to recommendations for both implementing an inclusion philosophy and practices in seniors' organizations and revisiting the view of impairment in old age as otherness.

T1  - Supporting Older Homeless Persons' Positive Relocations to Long-Term Care: Service Provider Views
AN  - 2451553432
AB  - Background and Objectives This study sought to explore the challenges and opportunities associated with supporting older homeless persons' relocations to long-term care (LTC) from the perspective of service providers. It aims to inform how to improve relocation processes for this vulnerable and growing subpopulation of older persons. Research Design and Methods This cross-sectional qualitative study employed semistructured face-to-face interviews with service providers from two Health and Social Service Centres in Montreal, Quebec. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed in five stages. Results A total of eight service providers reported on their experiences supporting over 40 relocations of older homeless persons (50+) in the last year. According to participants, older homeless persons' trajectories into LTC typically included a series of neglected medical issues followed by hospitalization and eventual relocation to LTC. Systemic barriers such as limited-time for proper planning, insufficient housing options for persons with minor functional limitations, disregard for preferred geographic location, multiple moves, and staff prejudices worked together to expedite premature relocation and challenge relocation processes. Discussion and Implications Older homeless persons appear to be at heightened risk of premature and challenging relocation processes. Expanding housing stock for persons with functional limitations, strengthening intersectoral collaborations, providing education and training to staff, and ensuring flexibility around rules and regulations in receiving LTC homes would both improve access to aging in place for this marginalized group of older persons and ensure conditions are in place to support positive relocations to LTC for those who require it.

T1  - Interethnic Prejudice Against Muslims Among White Dutch Children
AN  - 2401694803
AB  - Interethnic prejudice in children has been studied mostly in the United States, but less often in Europe, where the public discourse is increasingly negative about ethnic minorities, especially the Muslim minority. This study examined in-group favoritism (White preference) and out-group rejection of children of Middle Eastern descent (representing the Muslim minority) among White children in the Netherlands. Social preference for and rejection of children of Middle Eastern descent are compared with preference for and rejection of Black children. Social preference and rejection were measured using a task in which participants were presented with pictures of children with different ethnic appearances, and asked to select who they wanted to (not) play with, (not) sit next to, and invite for their birthday party. In addition, maternal implicit prejudice against people of Middle Eastern descent and explicit attitudes toward their children’s interethnic contact were assessed. The study included 140 children aged 6 to 8 years (M = 7.26, SD = 0.77) and their mothers. The results reveal both in-group favoritism and out-group rejection. The Middle Eastern out-group was preferred less than the Black out-group. Reporting absolutely no reservations about children’s interethnic contact by mothers was associated with less rejection of children of Middle Eastern descent. Findings reveal that young children already show interethnic prejudice and that particularly people of Middle Eastern descent are devalued. The results show that maternal acceptance of child interethnic contact seems to play a role, and provide starting points for further investigation of the relation between parental and child interethnic attitudes.

T1  - The Perils and Penalties of Meritocracy: Sanctioning Inequalities and Legitimating Prejudice
AN  - 2509307928
AB  - This article deploys insights from Michael Young’s 1958 satire The Rise of the Meritocracy to challenge the dominant ideology of meritocracy in contemporary British society. It draws on ethnographic research in schools over a twenty‐five year period to illustrate the damage the illusion of meritocracy inflicts on children and young people, but particularly those from working class backgrounds. It argues that the consequences of the pretence of meritocracy are to be found in everyday practices of testing, hyper‐competition and setting, and beyond the classroom in the designation of predominantly working class schools as ‘rubbish schools for rubbish learners’. It concludes that, beyond the negative consequences for working class learners, there are wider consequences for British society, exacerbating social divisions and encouraging the growth of distrust, prejudice, envy, resentment, and contempt between different social groups.

T1  - No integration paradox among adolescents
AN  - 2400028859
AB  - Previous studies have discovered a somewhat paradoxical empirical pattern whereby members of some higher educated first- and second-generation migrant groups in the Netherlands, who are structurally better integrated, harbour more negative attitudes toward natives than their lower educated counterparts, a.k.a. ‘the integration paradox’. This finding goes against intergroup contact theory which predicts that the greater contact with natives among highly educated migrants should improve their attitudes toward natives. Here we ask whether this negative relationship between education and attitudes toward natives can already be observed at an earlier stage in the lives of immigrants, in adolescence. In survey data on Dutch first- and second-generation immigrant adolescents, we find no integration paradox: Instead, education positively predicts attitudes toward natives. This positive relationship can largely be attributed to the greater opportunity for befriending native peers in higher educational tracks, which in turn produces more favourable attitudes toward natives, consistent with contact theory. We conclude that if the integration paradox is a robust phenomenon in adulthood, it is either restricted to migrants who do not grow up in the Netherlands, or the attitudes of immigrants radically change after they finish high school.

T1  - Do People Really Become More Conservative as They Age?
AN  - 2394485382
AB  - Folk wisdom has long held that people become more politically conservative as they grow older, although several empirical studies suggest political attitudes are stable across time. Using data from the Michigan Youth-Parent Socialization Panel Study, we analyze attitudinal change over a major portion of the adult life span. We document changes in party identification, self-reported ideology, and selected issue positions over this time period and place these changes in context by comparing them with contemporaneous national averages. Consistent with previous research but contrary to folk wisdom, our results indicate that political attitudes are remarkably stable over the long term. In contrast to previous research, however, we also find support for folk wisdom: on those occasions when political attitudes do shift across the life span, liberals are more likely to become conservatives than conservatives are to become liberals, suggesting that folk wisdom has some empirical basis even as it overstates the degree of change.

T1  - PARENTS AND CONNECTEDNESS PROTECTIVE FOR EARLY SEXUAL INITIATION IN RURAL MIDDLE YOUTH
AN  - 2375484701
AB  - Purpose: Rural adolescents are disproportionately affected by unintended pregnancy, yet little data address early sexual initiation among rural youth. We examine protective and risk factors associated with early sexual initiation among rural middle school youth. Methods: 6th to 8th grade students in a rural Midwestern, low-to-middle income school district (77% free/reduced lunch) completed surveys in health classes prior to a pregnancy prevention program. Demographic data included ethnicity, language acculturation, grade and gender. Our outcome variable was self-report of vaginal sexual intercourse. Protective factors included school connectedness (5 items, α=0.803, "feel close to people at my school"), parent connectedness (5 items, α=0.0925, "how loved do you feel by..."), parent communication about sex (10 items, α=0.892, "talked about STIs"), positive attitudes toward abstinence (5 items, 0=0.774, "important not to have sex before 1 get married"), and negative attitudes towards pregnancy. Risk factors included adverse childhood experiences (ACEs, 8 items additive score), alcohol and marijuana use (ever/never). Significant bivariate factors were included in multivariate logistic-regression model. Results: 1,946 students (36% 6th, 33% 7th, 30% 8th) completed surveys. Participants were 50% male, 2% gender minority, 47% Hispanic, 36% White Non-Hispanic, 14% other or mixed race, 2.4% Native American and 1.1% Black or African American. In bivariate models, early sexual initiation was uncommon among rural 6th graders but increased rapidly (2% 6th grade, 4% 7th grade, 6% 8th grade, p<.01). Gender, grade, pregnancy attitudes, abstinence attitudes, parent connectedness, school connectedness, parent communication, ACEs, alcohol and marijuana use predicted sexual initiation (all p<.05). In multivariate models, controlling for gender, being in 6th grade (OR=0.41, 95%CI=0.18-0.95), parent connectedness (OR=0.94, 95% CI=0.89-0.99) and positive attitudes towards abstinence (OR=0.60, 95% CI=0.53-0.68) decreased the odds of early sexual experience, while parent communication (OR=1.08, 95% 0=1.01-1.16), ACEs (OR=1.19. 95% CI=1.01-1.39) and alcohol use (OR=2.98,95% CI=1.41-6.30) increased these odds. Conclusions: Family and home environment were important predictors of sexual initiation of rural youth. Together these results suggest that prevention programs should target sarly middle school, address concomitant alcohol use, use a trauma informed approach, and involve parents.

AN  - 2403818333
AB  - The aim of the article is to show the socio-cultural conditions influencing the ways of expressing emotions and feelings by mothers. It presents the results of the analysis of the Internet discourse on negative attitudes towards motherhood and/or a child/children. The text is built on the author’s research on the issue of “regretting motherhood” and is based on a qualitative analysis of the content—blog entries/posts: nieperfekcyjnie.pl [notperfect.pl], matkawygodna.pl [slackermom. pl], mamwatpliwosc.pl [ihaveadoubt.pl], and in the group—Internet forum—Żałuję rodzicielstwa [I regret parenthood]. The theoretical basis were the concepts included in the sociology of symbolic interactionism.

T1  - Imagining contact reduces prejudice in preschool children
AN  - 2307985094
AB  - We examined the effectiveness of an imagery‐based strategy designed to reduce prejudice in preschoolers in Italy. Three studies involving different target groups (disabled children, Black children) were conducted within Italian preschools. Children (4–6 years) were asked to imagine and draw meeting an outgroup member (Studies 1 and 2) or to imagine writing a letter to an outgroup member (Study 3). Results revealed that preschoolers in the experimental condition, relative to a control group, reported less intergroup bias in the form of contact intentions and resource allocation as well as greater behavioral inclusiveness; effects were mediated by improved intergroup attitudes. Our findings are important in understanding ways that promote positive intergroup relations in ways that align with the interests of young children.

T1  - Reclaiming Parent–Child Relationships: Outcomes of Family Bridges with Alienated Children
AN  - 2300105446
AB  - A sample of 83 severely alienated children and adolescents were enrolled with the parents whom they had rejected in a 4-day Family Bridges educational workshop. The program was conducted after court orders had placed the children in the custody of their rejected parent. The parents who participated with the children in the workshop, and the professional workshop leaders, reported large improvements in the children’s alienated behavior, changes that reflected statistically significant and large effects. The children’s contact refusal with the rejected parent dropped from a pre-workshop rate of 85% to a post-workshop rate of 6%. Depending on the outcome measure, between 75% and 96% of the children overcame their alienation. The parents and children credited the workshop with improving their relationships and teaching them better relationship skills. Despite the children’s negative initial expectations, most children felt positively about their workshop experience, regarded the workshop more like education than counseling, and reported that the professionals who led the program treated them with kindness and respect. All the parent participants and two-thirds of the children rated the workshop as excellent or good, but 8% of children retained their initial negative attitudes about the workshop and rated the workshop as poor. In sum, a significant number of intractable and severely alienated children and adolescents who participated in the Family Bridges workshop repaired their damaged relationship with a parent whom they had previously rejected for an average of 3–4 years.

T1  - Mistaken Identities: The Media and Parental Ethno-Religious Socialization in a Midwestern Sikh Community
AN  - 2328400508
AB  - The role of the media in constructing the stereotypical portrayal of Muslims and the effects of that image on Muslim communities in the United States have been well reported (Abbas 2004).

[...]the portrayal of Muslims in popular media has intensified stereotypical images of several other ethno-religious groups in the United States, among them Sikhs (Ahluwalia and Pellettiere 2010; Kromidas 2004; Kumar 2016).

Since boys and men are more vulnerable to bullying and discrimination due to their outward identity markers, the focus of this study was ethno-religious socialization of boys. 1.1.

According to the American Sikh Organization, this number could, in fact, be as large as 500,000 (Pew Forum 2012).

[...]of the ensuing problem of misidentification, Sikh communities have found support in collective practices that serve as antidotes to negative stereotypes (Ahluwalia and Pellettiere 2010; Kurien 2014).

T1  - An online experiment on the influence of online user comments on attitudes toward a minority group
AN  - 2318594529
AB  - In recent years, there is interest in examining the effects of user comments on online content consumers' attitudes and perceptions. Building on theoretical foundations from social psychology and using an online experimental design, we investigated whether exposure to online comments attached to news content affects attitudes toward refugees. We recruited students from a public university in the Mediterranean region and, after administering a printed pretest on their attitudes toward refugees, we assigned them into three groups: one that read a series of positive comments about refugees (positive experimental group), one that read a series of negative comments about refugees (negative experimental group) and one that did not read comments (control group). The comments and a neutral reference news video were communicated to the participants via email during a five-day period after the pretest. After the implementation of the experimental stimuli, we administered a modified version of the pretest as a posttest. We found that exposure to positive comments reduced prejudice and that the intensity of prior prejudice was positively associated with the magnitude of prejudice reduction. Exposure to negative comments did not affect prejudice. A repeat posttest, administered one week after the posttest, showed stability of the observed attitude change.

T1  - Using intercultural videos of direct contact to implement vicarious contact: A school-based intervention that improves intergroup attitudes: GPIR
AN  - 2302360342
AB  - We aimed to create an engaging and dynamic intervention for schools that uses videos of direct school peer contact to implement a vicarious contact intervention. Participants were ethnic majority (Italian) and minority (immigrant) high school students (N = 485; age ranging from 14 to 22 years old, Mage = 17.24 years), who were asked to watch and evaluate videos created by peers from their school for a competition for the best video on intercultural friendships. Results revealed that vicarious contact, relative to a control condition where participants were not shown any videos, improved outgroup attitudes, reduced negative outgroup stereotypes, and increased willingness to engage in contact with the outgroup. These effects only emerged when intercultural friendships in the videos were salient. Inclusion of the other in the self, but neither intergroup anxiety nor fear of rejection by the outgroup, significantly mediated the effect of the videos on outcomes. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of the findings.

T1  - Family Communication and Messages about Race and Identity in Black Families in the United States
AN  - 2283393895
AB  - Racial minority families engage in "racial socialization," the process by which individuals develop meaning and understanding of what race is, and its implications. While parents are often seen as the site of this socialization, we wanted to explore which racial socialization messages were salient for young adults, and from whom they received these messages. This paper utilized focus groups to explore messages that young Black adults received about race, and what this means for their racial identity. We identified three dominant themes in our analyses: (a) the content of familial messages regarding race, identity, and prejudice, (b) critical incidents that shaped individuals' understandings of Black racial identity, and (c) familial sources. Each of these themes is constituted by various experiences and examples that shed light on racial socialization in today's social climate. Overall, parents, extended family members, and community members were sources of socializing what race meant to young Black adults. We discuss implications for research on racial socialization and family communication.

T1  - Do international institutions matter? Socialization and international bureaucrats
AN  - 2269915335
AB  - A key component of (neo-)functionalist and constructivist approaches to the study of international organizations concerns staff socialization. Existing analyses of how, or indeed whether, staff develop more pro-internationalist attitudes over time draw predominantly on cross-sectional data. Yet, such data cannot address (self-)selection issues or capture the inherently temporal nature of attitude change. This article proposes an innovative approach to the study of international socialization using an explicitly longitudinal design. Analysing two waves of a large-scale survey conducted within the European Commission in 2008 and 2014, it examines the beliefs and values of the same individuals over time and exploits exogenous organizational changes to identify causal effects. Furthermore, the article theorizes and assesses specified scope conditions affecting socialization processes. Showing that international institutions do, in fact, influence value acquisition by individual bureaucrats, our results contest the widely held view that international organizations are not a socializing environment. Our analysis also demonstrates that age at entry and gender significantly affect the intensity of such value change.

T1  - Contextual factors and prejudice at the beginning of the migrant influx: The Moroccan case in Seville, Spain
AN  - 2296289427
AB  - Studies addressing contextual factors associated with anti‐immigrant prejudice have focused on out‐group size and rapid demographic changes in receiving locations. However, the territorial concentration and distribution of ethnic minorities at a local and intraurban level has received little attention. We analyse the relationship between emerging territorial concentration points—alongside other contextual variables—by Moroccans and receiving society's growing prejudice towards them in a city experiencing the start of a migrant influx. We combine survey and census data from five Seville districts (southern Spain). Our results show how rapid changes in the general population's ethnic composition, coupled with Moroccan and economic migrants' territorial concentration, correlate strongly with negative attitudes towards Moroccans at this early stage. However, a weaker relationship between the immigrant percentage and degree of prejudice by the receiving group is observed. We also discuss guidelines for ensuring good, local diversity management to prevent socioterritorial fragmentation in multicultural cities.

T1  - Incoming Medical Students' Political Orientation Affects Outcomes Related to Care of Marginalized Groups: Results from the Medical Student CHANGES Study
AN  - 2173843723
AB  - This article characterizes the political ideology of first-year medical students and describes the extent to which their political ideology was associated with attitudes and beliefs related to the care of marginalized patients assessed during their fourth year. Analyses use data from online questionnaires administered to 3,756 medical students from a stratified random sample of forty-nine medical schools in their first and fourth years of study. The primary measure of political ideology was a five-point scale anchored by “very conservative” and “very liberal.” Mixed-effects linear regression was used to test the predictive power of political ideology at year 1 on year 4 outcomes. Among incoming medical students, 47.7% identified as liberal, 33.3% as moderate, and 19.0% as conservative. More conservative ideology was associated at year 4 with greater implicit bias against black and gay individuals, more negative explicit attitudes toward stigmatized groups, lower internal motivation to control racial prejudice, lower levels of trait empathy and empathy toward patients, and lower levels of patient-centered attitudes. Future research is needed to inform and develop interventions to improve care of patients from marginalized groups that are effective for medical students and health care providers across the political spectrum.

T1  - Through the Lens of Sexual Stigma: Attitudes Toward Lesbian and Gay Parenting
AN  - 2204269790
AB  - Drawing from the literature on sexual stigma, the principal aim of this study was to investigate predictors of heterosexual's internalization of negative attitudes regarding lesbian and gay parenting and the mediating role of beliefs in the controllability of homosexuality. A Portuguese sample of 1,430 heterosexual women and 502 heterosexual men responded to an online questionnaire about attitudes toward lesbian and gay parenting. Structural equation modeling was used to explore attitudinal predictors and mediation analysis. Mediation analyses revealed that sexual prejudice toward same-gender-parented families was predicted by gender, age, education, and religiosity, in that heterosexual men, those who were older, had less education, and were more religious held significantly more negative beliefs about lesbian and gay parenting, as well as lower perception of benefits associated with lesbian and gay parenting. Further, etiological beliefs mediated the effects of gender, age, and religiosity on sexual attitudes, highlighting the importance of the perception of controllability of homosexuality in justifying sexual prejudice.

T1  - Justification-Suppression and Normative Window of Prejudice as Determinants of Bias Toward Lesbians, Gays, and Bisexual Adoption Applicants
AN  - 2172269362
AB  - Despite gains in equality for lesbians, gays, and bisexuals (LGB), these couples still face discrimination in adoption scenarios. Guided by the normative window of prejudice and the justification-suppression model, participants read about a suitable or unsuitable couple applying to adopt a child. Participants indicated whether the couple should be allowed to adopt the child and how committed the couple is to being parents. Heterosexuals were perceived as less committed parents compared to LGB parents; sexual orientation was not related to adoption decisions. There was a significant interaction between sexual orientation and suitability for perceptions of commitment to parenting: in the suitable condition, heterosexuals were perceived as less committed parents compared to gays; in the unsuitable condition, heterosexuals were perceived as less committed parents compared to bisexuals. This interaction was nonsignificant for adoption decisions. Future research should determine if these findings relate to other sexual orientations or gender identities.

T1  - Exploring the Influence of Neighborhood-Level Factors on Adolescent Birth Rates in California: A Social-Ecological Approach
AN  - 2137067351
AB  - This article examines neighborhood-level factors to help explain why adolescent birth rate trajectories differ in certain communities in California, with rates in some areas remaining elevated or increasing while rates in other areas with similar demographic characteristics declined. Researchers conducted in-depth interviews with 94 community stakeholders and 22 focus groups with 186 adolescents from five “promising” communities (with declining adolescent birth rates) and five “struggling” communities (persistently elevated or increasing rates). Promising communities had more employment prospects, better neighbor interactions, and greater educational opportunities for youth. Parent–child communication around sex and youth knowledge of clinics were also more common. In contrast, struggling communities tended to have higher perceived levels of crime and poverty and more negative attitudes toward youth. These findings illustrate the complexity of factors that influence adolescents’ lives and decision-making. Synergistic community-based approaches to adolescent health and development are critical to promote positive health outcomes.

T1  - White’s Perceptions of Biracial Individuals’ Race Shift When Biracials Speak Out Against Bias
AN  - 2156314230
AB  - Previous research suggests that a person’s racial identity shapes the way others respond when that person speaks out against racial prejudice. In the present research, we consider instead how speaking out against racial prejudice shapes people’s impressions of a confronter’s racial identity, such as experiences with discrimination, stereotype enactment, and even phenotype. Two experiments found that White perceivers evaluated a Black/White biracial person who spoke out against (vs. remained silent to) racial prejudice as more stigmatized and Black identified and as having more stereotypically Black (vs. White) preferences and Black (vs. White) ancestry when they confronted. The faces of biracial confronters (vs. nonconfronters) were also recalled as more phenotypically Black (vs. White; S2). This evidence suggests that speaking out against bias colors Whites’ impressions of a biracial target across both subjective and objective measures of racial identity. Implications for interracial interactions and interpersonal perception are discussed.

T1  - Action Research at the Intersection of Structural and Family Violence in an Immigrant Latino Community: a Youth-Led Study
AN  - 2089013902
AB  - The current study addresses the lack of research exploring the social and emotional impact of anti-immigrant policy on Latino communities, and the intersection of anti-immigrant climates with other family stressors, like domestic violence (DV). In this paper we describe a qualitative study led by the participatory action research group La Voz Juvenile de Caminar Latino. Youth researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with Latino men, women, and youth participating in a domestic violence program. Using an inductive approach to thematic analysis, researchers identified themes that reflect how Latino families with histories of DV experience an increasingly anti-immigrant climate. All participants in this study described emotional stress, fear, and restrictions in their day-to-day life attributed to the anti-immigrant sociopolitical climate, and adults also spoke to work-related stress and economic insecurity. Both adults and children described harassment by strangers, coworkers, and/or peers. With regard to DV, women tended to describe immigration stress as exasperating family conflict, while men viewed these external stressors as discouraging DV. Distrust of police and other formal supports was a key theme underlying adult and youth perceptions of help-seeking for DV. The findings of this study suggest that anti-immigrant sentiment and policy creates undue stress for Latino families and barriers to formal help-seeking for DV. The participatory research process provided a corrective experience for youth witnesses of DV and prioritizes the voices of those most affected by immigration policies and violence.

T1  - Doddering but dear … even in the eyes of young children? Age stereotyping and prejudice in childhood and adolescence
AN  - 2110222165
AB  - This study aims to explore age prejudice, and to examine age stereotyping in children and adolescents by adopting the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) as a theoretical framework. It was hypothesised that children are socialised into adopting an ambivalent representation of old age (socialisation hypothesis) and that this cognitive bias becomes weaker in adolescence due to greater cognitive maturity (developmental hypothesis). By analysing representative data from Portugal (European Social Survey; N = 2367), it was ascertained that the ambivalent age stereotype (higher evaluations of warmth than competence for older people) is indeed a shared social representation of older people in Portuguese society. A total of 103 Portuguese children (6–10 year olds) and adolescents (11–15 year olds) were then sampled from a local school and responded to age‐appropriate measures assessing age prejudice as well as age stereotypes. Contrary to previous studies, the findings do not provide evidence for the existence of age prejudice because both children and adolescents reported positive feelings towards older people. However, the socialisation hypothesis was corroborated by showing that the ambivalent old age stereotype was already present in childhood. Contrary to the stipulated developmental hypothesis, the magnitude of this cognitive bias was very similar in adolescence.

T1  - Notifying Neglect: Child Protection as an Application of Bureaucratic Power against Marginalized Parents
AN  - 2058267390
AB  - The goal of this contribution is to bring to light some systemic applications of organizational power that occur within the child protection system in Iceland. The specific focus is on the ways in which notifications are made to the child protection system concerning allegations of parental neglect on the part of parents with disabilities and a criticism of some specific mechanisms by which these notifications may contribute to unjust custody deprivation proceedings. We suggest that accusations of bias or prejudice within the child protection system need to be grounded upon the demonstration of concrete mechanisms which illustrate this bias in practice. In this contribution, we chose to focus on the power of notifications and to explore the institutional logic and practices that can result in unjust custody deprivation decisions. A critical analysis of the knowledge production of custody deprivation is required to fully understand these process as systematic applications of power and to recognize the problematic nature of child protection work that weighs heavily against marginalized parents.

T1  - The experience of ethnic prejudice of Turkish ethnic minorities in Flanders: Does it affect parental preferences about partner selection?
AN  - 2098784061
AB  - The aim of the present study is twofold. First, we evaluate to what extent Turkish ethnic minority members experience ethnic prejudice in the Flemish society. Experiencing ethnic prejudice could affect the orientation of minority members towards the majority group, their own (migrant) community and towards the country of origin (of their parents). Therefore, in the second part we assess the effect ethnic prejudice has on a specific type of interethnic social contact: partner selection. To what extent Turkish parents prefer a Turkish partner (living in Turkey) for their children, or do they show openness towards Belgian partners? We apply linear and multinomial logistic regression models on data retrieved form a representative survey in the Turkish ethnic minority in Flanders (n = 430). First, we find that ethnic prejudice is very common in the lives of Turkish minorities in Flanders. Men, respondents with a lower socioeconomic status, and partner migrants are especially at risk of experiencing prejudice. Second, we conclude that although the majority of the parents prefers ethnically homogeneous partnerships, openness towards mixed is found among more than 25% of the parents. Experiencing ethnic prejudice and having a lower educational attainment lowers that likelihood of being open towards mixed partnerships with Belgian partners.

T1  - Social rejection during school years and the development of negative attitudes toward minority groups in adulthood
AN  - 2088799303
AB  - Gross and Maor present a study that examines the correlation between social rejection during school years and rejection of minority groups as adults. In focusing on the relatively unexplored aspect of the impact of social rejection at school on attitudes to minority groups, the study draws on and integrates a number of different theoretical constructs. These are the General Strain Theory, which posits that stressful life events can elicit a violent response; the Social Identity Theory, which explains the immediate contribution of social rejection to negative attitudes toward outgroups; the Authoritarian Personality Theory and the Generational Theory of Abuse, which link childhood experiences of rejection and parental violence with attitudes toward weaker and rejected groups; and Contact Theory, which explains the contribution of minimal relations with minority groups to the development of negative attitudes toward these groups.

T1  - Sexism and Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Parenting in a Sample of Heterosexuals and Sexual Minorities: the Mediation Effect of Sexual Stigma
AN  - 2023984942
AB  - The present study aimed to: (a) investigate the relationship between attitudes toward same-sex parenting and sexism both in heterosexuals and sexual minorities; (b) verify whether sexism predicted negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting via the mediating role of sexual stigma (sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and internalized sexual stigma [ISS] in lesbians and gay men [LG]). An Italian sample of 477 participants (65.6% heterosexual people and 34.4% LG people) was used to verify three hypotheses: (a) heterosexual men showed higher levels of sexism than heterosexual women and LG people; (b) heterosexual men reported more negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting than those of heterosexual women and LG people; and (c) sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and ISS in LG people mediated the relationship between sexism and attitudes toward same-sex parenting. Overall, men and heterosexual people showed stronger sexist tendencies and more negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting. Moreover, sexism affected attitudes toward same-sex parenting via sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and ISS in LG people. These results suggest that negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting reflect sociocultural inequalities based on the traditional gender belief system and points to the necessity of social policies to reduce prejudice toward sexual minority groups.

T1  - Folk theories of nationality and anti-immigrant attitudes
AN  - 2370466451
AB  - Nationality governs almost every aspect of our lives, including where we may live and travel, as well as our opportunities for education, healthcare and work. It is a common-sense social category that guides us in making inferences about the social world1–4. Nationalism has been extensively studied within the social5–16 and cognitive sciences17–25, but there has been little empirical investigation into folk theories regarding what determines someone’s nationality. In experiments carried out in the United States and India (N = 2,745), we used a variant of the switched-at-birth task26–31 to investigate the extent to which people believe that nationality is determined by biology or is a malleable social identity that can be acquired32–34. We find that folk theories of nationality seem remarkably flexible. Depending on the framing of the question, people report believing that nationality is either fluid or fixed at birth. Our results demonstrate that people from different cultures with different experiences of migration and different explicit stereotypes of their own nation may share similar folk theories about nationality. Moreover, these theories may shape attitudes towards immigrants—an important public-policy issue35–37. Belief that nationality is malleable is associated with more positive attitudes towards immigrants even when holding ideology constant.In the United States and India, people's folk conceptions of nationality are flexible, seeing it as more biological and fixed at birth or cultural and fluid, depending on the scenario. Belief in fluidity predicts positive attitudes to immigration.

T1  - Modeling racial disparities in physical health via close relationship functioning: A life course approach
AN  - 2078152946
AB  - Objective The aim of the present study was to test a life course model in which racial disparities in physical health between Caucasian and African Americans are driven by disparities in close relationship functioning. This model also examined relative evidence for intergenerational transmission of relationship functioning and ongoing exposure to prejudice and discrimination as two pathways that might shape adult relationship functioning. Method A sample of 523 Caucasian and African American men and women were prospectively tracked from a birth cohort initiated in the 1960s. Reports of parental relationship functioning were obtained from participants and their mothers in adolescence. In midlife, participants completed measures of perceived discrimination (lifetime and everyday discrimination), close relationship functioning (relationship strain and support) and physical health (self-rated health, resting heart rate and systolic blood pressure). ResultsAs hypothesized, close relationship functioning was a strong predictor of physical health in adulthood. Furthermore, we observed that perceived discrimination over the life course was linked to impaired relationship functioning. Evidence for intergenerational transmission of relationship functioning was more equivocal.ConclusionRacial disparities in physical health may be maintained via social factors throughout the life course. Although such factors have sometimes been considered outside the purview of the medical field, it is vital that researchers and clinicians begin to more fully address the implications of social forces in order to remediate racial health disparities.

T1  - Ethnic composition of the school class and interethnic attitudes: a multi-group perspective
AN  - 2076977159
AB  - This study investigates the relationship between the ethnic classroom composition and interethnic attitudes of adolescents of the native majority and several ethnic minorities in the Netherlands, Germany, England and Sweden. It contributes to prior research by examining the underlying theoretical features of contact opportunities and levels of threat across multiple ethnic groups more accurately, using group-specific measures. Based on Intergroup Contact Theory and Ethnic Group Conflict Theory, contrasting hypotheses on how the ethnic classroom composition affects out-group and in-group attitudes of adolescents are tested with multilevel regression analyses. Across ethnic groups and countries, we consistently find a moderate to substantial relation between ethnic classroom composition and interethnic attitudes in line with Intergroup Contact Theory: a relatively larger out-group size, compared to the in-group, relates positively to out-group attitudes. At the same time, in several cases, a relatively larger in-group size relates to more positive in-group attitudes. The findings point to the significance of balanced ethnic classroom compositions for promoting favourable attitudes between multiple ethnic groups - benefitting especially those who face high levels of prejudice from others and those who are prejudiced towards others - without compromising positive in-group attitudes.

T1  - From Personal Experiences to Classroom Teaching: A Socio-Psychological Study of Social Inclusion and Exclusion
AN  - 2088824939
AB  - Creating an inclusive classroom environment where learners appreciate diversity and value positive interpersonal associations is a challenge faced by the teachers worldwide. This is particularly so in the Indian context, where the complex phenomena of social categorization impacts the individual in manifold ways from a tender age. In the context of student-teacher relationship, the personal experiences of the teacher have a trickle-down effect on student socialization patterns. This paper explores the teachers' personal experiences of social inclusion and exclusion and its impact on his/her classroom interactions with students. Our sample consisted of 23 teachers (18 females and 5 males) working in low-income schools in Delhi. Extensive narratives were undertaken and subject to thematic analysis. Teachers expansively described their experiences of facing social exclusion. Although the staff maintained an outward semblance of inclusivity, the undercurrents of exclusion and marginalization were noted. The need for social approval and maintenance of a politically correct façade was the guiding force for many teachers. Yet many of them expressed their own prejudices and biased thoughts about social groups. The findings are discussed in the light of current theorization in the area.

T1  - Spies and security: Assessing the impact of animated videos on intelligence services in school children
TT  - Espías y seguridad: Evaluación del impacto de vídeos animados sobre los servicios de inteligencia en escolares
AN  - 2063292907
AB  - Making the work of security organizations known to school children is a means of mitigating feelings of insecurity provoked by the diffusion of information on terrorist attacks in communications media and through social media. Whilst there is a longer tradition of projects to educate school children on the police and the armed forces, no comparable projects have been found on the intelligence services. With the objective of filling this gap, the authors designed and produced two animated educational videos for Spanish school children on the Spanish intelligence service: The National Intelligence Center (CNI). In this paper, the impact of the videos is measured in relation to the knowledge, the stereotypes, and the attitudes of school children towards the CNI. To do so, two questionnaires were administered to 1,092 school children aged 8 and 12, before and after viewing the videos. The results of the questionnaire prior to screening the videos showed that the school children held no knowledge of the intelligence services, and expressed highly developed stereotypes, and moderately negative attitudes towards them. Student-t tests for related samples were used to confirm the responses, on the basis of which it was found that the videos modified both knowledge and stereotyping, as well as attitudes towards the CNI. Specifically, following the screenings the knowledge of the school children improved, stereotyping diminished, and positive attitudes increased.Alternate abstract:Dar a conocer a los escolares las organizaciones de seguridad es un medio para reducir la inseguridad generada por la difusión de los atentados terroristas en los medios de comunicación y redes sociales. Mientras que hay una mayor tradición en proyectos para educar a los escolares sobre la policía y los militares, no se han encontrado proyectos análogos sobre los servicios de inteligencia. Con el objetivo de suplir esta carencia, los autores diseñaron y produjeron dos vídeos animados educativos destinados a escolares españoles sobre el servicio de inteligencia español, el Centro Nacional de Inteligencia (CNI). Este artículo mide cuál es el impacto de los vídeos en el conocimiento, los estereotipos y las actitudes de los escolares hacia el CNI. Para ello, se aplicaron dos cuestionarios a 1.092 escolares de 8 a 16 años, antes y después de la visualización de los vídeos. Los resultados previos a la visualización mostraron un conocimiento nulo, alto grado de estereotipos y actitudes moderadamente negativas hacia los servicios de inteligencia. Se comprobaron las respuestas mediante pruebas T para muestras relacionadas, a partir de las cuales se obtuvo que los vídeos modificaban el conocimiento, los estereotipos y las actitudes hacia el CNI. Específicamente, tras la visualización mejoró el conocimiento de los escolares, disminuyó el grado de estereotipos y aumentaron las actitudes positivas.

T1  - Do We Think Children Need a Mom and Dad?: Understanding How Gender Ideology Impact Attitudes Toward Same-Gender Parent Family Rights
AN  - 2057211174
AB  - Research and opinion polls demonstrate that attitudes toward same-gender parent families have been improving in recent years among Western countries; however, the history of oppression toward, and misconceptions about, same-gender parent families continue to be demonstrated in Australian family rights policies. Common misconceptions include the belief that children need both male and female role models, and this could be influencing peoples' support for same-gender family rights and having a wider impact on legislation change. Yet a dearth of research exists exploring a connection between gender role beliefs and support for same-gender family rights using a broad international sample, including Australia. To investigate this connection, a sample (N = 615) from 18 English-speaking countries responded to a series of questions to determine the importance of gender norm beliefs on same-gender family prejudice. Regression analysis demonstrated that people with traditional beliefs about gender norms were more likely to endorse a negative attitude toward same-gender marriage and same-gender parenting. Findings suggest a link between socially prescribed gender norms and prejudice toward same-gender parent families that may be fueling arguments against same-gender family rights policies. The implications of these findings on same-gender parent families and their rights require future investigation.

T1  - Parental Perspectives on Parent–Child Conflict and Acculturation in Iranian Immigrants in California
AN  - 2017556674
AB  - Iranians have settled in a number of areas in the United States, especially Southern California and Texas, and experience substantial prejudice as a result of perceptions of their religion and national origin. This study explored the relationship between Iranian immigrant parents’ acculturation and the level of conflict they experience with their U.S.-born children. A survey was used to collect data from a sample of 100 first-generation Iranian immigrant parents living in Orange County, CA, with children aged 11–22 years. Parent-acculturation levels were expected to predict parent–child conflicts (PCCs) resulting from potential acculturation gaps between children and parents. Results demonstrated a moderate positive relationship between Iranian cultural involvement and PCC and a weak negative relationship between American cultural involvement and PCC. The effects of various demographic variables were also considered. Results show higher PCC levels among lower income families, suggesting a need for support from schools, counselors, or other institutions.

T1  - Out‐group peer involvement in youth alcohol consumption
AN  - 1989861714
AB  - Recent studies of alcohol consumption among students have consistently linked in‐group influence with excessive drinking. Concurrently, these studies have largely overlooked the influence of non‐alcohol‐consuming peers (the out‐group) on the in‐group's decisions to consume alcohol. However, out‐groups can have a significant impact on in‐group members' decisions regarding publicly consumed products (White, Simpson, & Argo, ), such as is the case of alcohol. In light of this, our study aims to explore how in‐group members' views of their consumption of alcohol are influenced by their out‐group. This study uses Social Identity Theory as the theoretical lens to explain consumer interaction with the out‐group (abstainers) and subsequent views of in‐group members (alcohol consumers). A social constructivist approach is adopted to enable this exploration of meaning, with concomitant use of the qualitative narrative methodology. A sample of 18 postgraduate students studying in the UK was selected. Narratives were collected and analysed using thematic analysis. Although the widely accepted view is that people tend to avoid products or behaviours that are linked with an out‐group, this paper demonstrates conditions in which alcohol consumers appreciate the out‐group. Furthermore, it reveals how drinkers' interaction with their out‐group can lead to negative attitudes towards their in‐group and their own consumption of alcohol. Based on their views of out‐groups, we propose a categorisation of alcohol consumers into 3 groups: avoiders, open admirers, and covert admirers. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical implications for social marketers and policy makers.

T1  - Power, privilege and justice: intersectionality as human rights?
AN  - 1972464008
AB  - How can we best connect and understand issues of power, privilege and justice in a human rights framework? One approach is to explicitly position intersectionality as a theoretical lens that can assist a critical understanding of the connections between these concepts and realities. The paper does this through an examination of the situation in Scotland via Show Racism the Red Card, an anti-racist non-governmental organisation that works with school-age children to raise awareness on the power of prejudice and discrimination in everyday, interrelated lives. It is shown that despite its complexities, intersectionality can work both conceptually and methodologically in complex environments such as classrooms. The realisation of rights is foregrounded and an appreciation of context, politics, social divisions and outcomes vis-à-vis inclusive equalities needs to be fully grasped. The case study of Show Racism the Red Card situates the nuances of intersectionality as both theory and method, illustrating the need for human rights to be mindful of past, present and future. Overall, it is argued that the example of Scotland offers opportunities to witness a critique of how power, privilege and justice are connected and challenged in a human rights context and how rights can be realised in everyday settings.

T1  - The Intergenerational Effect of Maternal Multicultural Experience on Children's Tolerance: An Example From Palestinians and Jews in Israel
AN  - 1941843109
AB  - Although recent research has demonstrated the benefits of multicultural experience for reducing personal levels of intergroup bias, the potential for an intergenerational effect has yet to be explored. Using samples of Jewish-Israeli (Study 1a) and Palestinian-Israeli (Study 1b) mother-child dyads, we found that maternal multicultural experience was indirectly related to greater social tolerance among children via lower levels of maternal need for cognitive closure which, in turn, triggered higher levels of maternal social tolerance. These results show that when it comes to multicultural experience, its impact can extend beyond the self to also affect the next generation. Implications for developmental theories of prejudice acquisition and prejudice interventions are discussed.

T1  - Inclusion of Homoaffective Families in Education Services and Schools in Italy: A Pedagogical Issue
AN  - 1951872136
AB  - For some time now, pedagogy of the family has been dealing with so-called 'plural families', but the interest for LGBT (homoaffective) parenting officially began in Italy in 2010. Since then, the major efforts have been carried out in order to enhance professional training to offer theoretical guidance and operational tools to support appropriate educational actions. The article analyzes some specifics goal of pedagogical science and some basic concepts, which should be indispensable contents in education programmes for education workers in order to including children from LGBT families in nurseries and schools and reduce the risk of teachers, educators, heads teacher, pedagogists basing their own attitudes towards 'Rainbow Families' on prejudice and individual beliefs, unsupported by scientific data or concrete experience.

T1  - The Roles of Politics, Feminism, and Religion in Attitudes Toward LGBT Individuals: A Cross-Cultural Study of College Students in the USA, Italy, and Spain
AN  - 1926843650
AB  - While it is clear that there are existing prejudices directed toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people across the globe, very few studies have provided in-depth investigations of such attitudes from an international comparative perspective, and no cross-cultural studies to date have investigated attitudes toward bisexual and transgender individuals. Without understanding how correlates of attitudes toward LGBT individuals are both similar and different across multiple international locations, it is unclear how we can learn to counteract negative prejudices toward these groups. In the current study, we explore how measures of politics, feminism, and religion affect attitudes toward LGBT individuals using Worthen's (2012) Attitudes Toward LGBT People Scales and data from four college student samples in Oklahoma, Texas, Italy, and Spain (N=1311). Results suggest three trends: (1) negative attitudes toward LGBT individuals are more pervasive in Oklahoma than in any of the other university samples and are most positive among Spanish students; (2) negative attitudes toward LGBT individuals are related to the individual and multiplicative effects of political beliefs, feminism, and religiosity across all four samples; and (3) constructs related to attitudes toward gays/lesbians differ from those that relate to attitudes toward bisexual and transgender individuals. Such findings indicate that there are important similarities and differences in prejudices toward LGBT individuals and that attitudes toward bisexual and transgender individuals should be included in future international comparative research.

T1  - Autonomy Support Fosters Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Identity Disclosure and Wellness, Especially for Those with Internalized Homophobia
AN  - 1910720675
AB  - Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals experience disparities in psychological well-being, including greater symptoms of depression and anxiety, relative to their heterosexual peers. One group of LGB individuals is particularly vulnerable--those with high levels of internalized homophobia, or sexual prejudice directed toward the self. The current research explored whether a supportive social environment might be especially beneficial for this group. Specifically, we tested whether autonomy support within a given social environment (e.g., with family, friends, and peers or coworkers) is associated with greater identity disclosure and well-being in that environment, especially for those high in internalized homophobia. Using within-person analyses, we found support for this: perceptions of autonomy support predicted greater disclosure (outness) and well-being, and this relation was particularly strong for those high in internalized homophobia. Implications of these findings for promoting well-being among LGB individuals, a critical social issue, are discussed.

T1  - Evidence of Validity of the Beliefs About Children's Adjustment in Same-Sex Families Scale
AN  - 1883505343
AB  - The aim of the study is to provide evidence about the validity and reliability of the Beliefs about Children's Adjustment in Same-Sex Families Scale. The scale identifies two types of rejection of same-sex parenting: individual opposition and normative opposition. Individual opposition identifies opinions involving open and more aggressive rejection toward the effects of the child-rearing and educational practices of same-sex parents. The attribution of the children's possible psychological difficulties and maladjustments is directly linked to the sexual orientation of the same-sex parents. Normative opposition identifies beliefs and opinions linked to everyday heterosexism that are present in our society and represent a subtle form of heterosexism. The scale was administrated to 326 Spanish heterosexual university students. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a two-factor structure. The findings showed that personal contact inversely correlates with the rejection of same-sex parents, the etiology of the homosexual orientation correlates with rejection of same-sex parents when the belief is that homosexuality is learned, and supporting the civil rights of gay people also correlates with rejection of same-sex parents. These findings can be useful in planning variables for intervention programs designed to foster the tolerance and normality of sexual and family diversity.

T1  - Social cognitive processes and attitudes toward legal actions: Does receiving information affect community sentiment?
AN  - 1949784414
AB  - Voters influence laws, often without being fully informed. Justice Thurgood Marshall proposed that, if American citizens were fully informed of the goals and consequences of the death penalty, they would not support its use. The present studies demonstrated --this principle applied to laws other than the death penalty, specifically, laws regulating the behavior of pregnant women (e.g., drug use, cesarean section). Four studies expanded existing attitude change research and determined whether support for such laws was related to: 1) "first thoughts" about the laws; 2) information received about the laws; 3) valence of information; and 4) source of information (i.e., self, peers, researcher). In the first experiment, receiving information produced more negative attitudes than a no-information, control group, perhaps because most participants' first thoughts about the laws concerned the health of the fetus (rather than the mother's rights). The second study confirmed this through factor analysis of responses to a thought-listing task and determined that type of first thought (e.g., about the fetus, mother) predicted attitude. In a third study, a mixed method design, attitudes changed based on the type of information (e.g., negative, positive) given by the researcher, though a fourth study indicated that attitudes did not change after debate with peers. Finally, Need for Cognition and Legal Authoritarianism related to support for the laws. Results have implications for community sentiment research, policy regarding the health and behavior of pregnant women, and psychology research on social cognitive processes and attitude theory.

T1  - It's More Than the Code: Exploring the Factors that Moderate the Street Code's Relationship with Violence
AN  - 1869167636
AB  - The paper explores the conditions under which the code of the street is more likely to lead to violence. Utilizing a sample of 400 homeless youths the paper examines how anger, self-centeredness, nerve, parental warmth, physical abuse, homelessness, negative attitudes toward the police, violent peers, and violent victimization moderate the relationship between the street code and violence. Findings suggest that the street code has a stronger relationship with violence under conditions where individuals have higher levels of anger, self-centeredness and nerve, less experience of parental warmth, more experience with physical abuse, longer periods of homelessness and more negative orientations toward the police. The street code, anger, self-centeredness, nerve, physical abuse, homelessness, negative attitudes toward the police, violent peers, and violent victimization also have significant lower order relationships with violence. Avenues for future research are discussed.

T1  - The Social Determinants of Polymorphous Prejudice Against Lesbian and Gay Individuals: the Case of Portugal
AN  - 1858002074
AB  - In the present article, we analyze polymorphous prejudice against lesbians and gays according to a sample of Portuguese heterosexual individuals. We tested the differential importance of demographic-, ideological-, and psychological-level variables to predicting this phenomenon. Our results show that male, Catholic, right-wing respondents with fewer lesbian and gay (LG) friends prove the group exhibiting the highest levels of polymorphous prejudice. Furthermore, the introduction of psychological-level variables into the regression models increased the explained variance in polymorphous prejudice, above and beyond the remaining predictors. Additionally, we report different patterns of results when deploying regression analyses at the level of the sub-scales of polymorphous prejudice. We discuss our results within the light of contemporary sexual prejudice frameworks before reviewing the utility of results to interventions targeting discriminated LG individuals.

T1  - Manager attitudes concerning flexible work arrangements: fixed or changeable?
AN  - 1867533152
AB  - Flexible work arrangements (FWAs) present a vehicle for supporting caregiving responsibilities, but have yet to be widely implemented, in part, because of limited support from managers. This study examines transformation of manager attitudes toward FWAs in the context of a change initiative. Panel surveys of 721 managers revealed positive and negative attitudes concerning the use of FWAs and predictors of changes in these attitudes. Over the course of one year, the attitudes shifted in positive and negative directions consistent with conservation of resources and symbolic interactionism theory. Experience in supervising workers in FWAs, exposure to training, and perceived career rewards predicted favorable changes in attitudes. Findings offer support for advocacy for FWAs on the basis of a positive spiral of affirmation that connects experience and attitudes toward FWAs. The viewing of a personalized report on support of flexible work use by peers predicted development of more favorable attitudes in the merits of schedule flexibility. Findings indicate that manager attitudes about FWAs can be influenced, which in turn has potential to enhance family responsive employment practices.

T1  - Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Parenting: An Effect of Gender
AN  - 1923040587
AB  - The definition of family in Australia has been continuously changing over the past four decades. The 21st century has brought with it various images of family, with an increase of awareness to same-sex families; however, the acceptance of such family structures does not appear to be widespread and is often determined by sex. Substantive literature demonstrates differences between men and women in attitudes toward same-sex parenting, with theory suggesting that gender role norms may explain this. Despite large efforts to determine sex differences in attitudes toward same-sex parenting, little research, and even less in Australia, has been done to investigate whether there are differences in reasons behind negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting between men and women. To further this understanding, an Australian sample (N= 790) ranging in age from 18-78 completed a survey regrading attitudes toward same-sex parenting, in addition to relevant demographic information. Participants reported more positive attitudes about parenting by lesbians as compared to parenting by gay men. Reasons behind attitudes toward same-sex parenting also differed between males and females. Results suggested that the impact of socially prescribed gender norms may affect prejudice toward same-sex families. Despite an increase in tolerance for sexual minorities recently, policies that continue to discriminate against same-sex parenting rights demonstrates the importance of continuing to identify potential influences of same-sex family prejudice to reduce the potentially negative impacts associated with the prejudice.

T1  - Interethnic dating preferences of Roma and non-Roma secondary school students
AN  - 2076973767
AB  - Integrated schooling is known to induce interethnic friendship relations; however, it also creates the opportunity of interethnic dating. Interethnic personal relationships or long-term exposure decreases ethnic prejudice, thus it is proposed that willingness to date between ethnic groups may also increase. The question arises, whether in the school context exposure is enough for this mechanism to emerge, or personal contact is necessary. It must also be taken into account that romantic relationships are embedded in status relations within schools. Based on a 'social exchange' mechanism, it is assumed that the less popular members of the majority groups are those who are more willing to form interethnic dating relations. To address the above questions empirically, the data of 1213 Hungarian 9th grade students in 43 classes were analysed. Preferences of Roma and non-Roma students were measured by dyadic attribution of physical attractiveness and nominations of willingness to date. Results of multilevel p2 models suggest that mixed groups are not sufficient, but personal contacts are necessary to decrease same-ethnicity preferences in dating. An additional tendency is salient: among majority students, those who are isolated from the friendship networks are the ones who are more willing to date members of the minority group.

T1  - The Burden of Geopolitical Stigma: Iranian Immigrants and Their Adult Children in the USA
AN  - 1830616562
AB  - The overall aim of this paper is to add several dimensions missing from current debates and scholarship on Iranian immigrants, migration, and belonging: The power of global political dynamics in stigmatizing migrants' identities, the impact of geopolitics on migrants' quality of life, and the disruptions to belonging and membership as a result of anti-Iranian prejudice. Through the use of in-depth interviews, I examine the experiences of 32 immigrant and second-generation Iranians residing in northern and southern California. The findings of this research demonstrate that the geopolitical relationship between the Iranian government and the USA powerfully impacts the lives of Iranians in the USA. Specifically, global politics facilitate a context that helps stigmatize Iranians' identities and makes them more prone to experiencing social marginality, anti-Iranian prejudice, racial/ethnic profiling, and discrimination. Ultimately, these experiences put an effective cap on Iranians' abilities to access opportunity structures and limit their access to belonging and social membership in the USA. An examination of the lived experiences of Iranian immigrants and their adult children offers important empirical and theoretical insight for the impact of contentious global political context on immigrant belonging and membership.

T1  - Interethnic dating preferences of Roma and non-Roma secondary school students
AN  - 1820665838
AB  - Integrated schooling is known to induce interethnic friendship relations; however, it also creates the opportunity of interethnic dating. Interethnic personal relationships or long-term exposure decreases ethnic prejudice, thus it is proposed that willingness to date between ethnic groups may also increase. The question arises, whether in the school context exposure is enough for this mechanism to emerge, or personal contact is necessary. It must also be taken into account that romantic relationships are embedded in status relations within schools. Based on a 'social exchange' mechanism, it is assumed that the less popular members of the majority groups are those who are more willing to form interethnic dating relations. To address the above questions empirically, the data of 1213 Hungarian 9th grade students in 43 classes were analysed. Preferences of Roma and non-Roma students were measured by dyadic attribution of physical attractiveness and nominations of willingness to date. Results of multilevel p2 models suggest that mixed groups are not sufficient, but personal contacts are necessary to decrease same-ethnicity preferences in dating. An additional tendency is salient: among majority students, those who are isolated from the friendship networks are the ones who are more willing to date members of the minority group.

T1  - "Boys Don't Cry"--or Do They? Adult Attitudes Toward and Beliefs About Transgender Youth
AN  - 1811906108
AB  - The present survey study examined the attitudes of U.S. adults toward transgender children and adolescents, as well as their behavioral intentions, in two hypothetical scenarios involving gender variant youth. Participants recruited online (N=281) reported generally favorable attitudes toward transgender minors, but expressed some hesitation to allow a transgender child to use the restroom aligned with their gender as opposed to their birth sex or to share a room with same gender peers on a school trip, possibly due to conflating gender identity with sexual orientation in these situations. Attitudes were less positive in respondents who reported a religious affiliation, conservative social political views, and stronger conformity to certain traditional gender norms--particularly in men. Even after controlling for these factors, stronger belief in environmental versus biological causes of transgender identity was linked to more negative attitudes. Participants' behavioral intentions were driven partly by their attitudes and causal attributions, but also by their age and, at least for women, personal connections to the transgender community. We discuss implications for the discourse surrounding transgender youth and the need for educating the public on the development of gender identity as well as the difference between gender identity and sexual orientation.

T1  - Youth experiences with multiple types of prejudice-based harassment
AN  - 1810529361
AB  - Despite prejudice-based harassment's associations with serious physical and mental health risks, research examining multiple forms of harassment among children/adolescents is lacking. This study documents the prevalence of prejudice-based harassment (i.e., harassment on the basis of gender, race/ethnicity, weight or physical appearance, sexual orientation, and disability status) among a large, statewide, school-based Midwestern U.S. sample of 162,034 adolescents. Weight-/appearance-based harassment was most prevalent among both girls (25.3%) and boys (19.8%). Adolescents from certain vulnerable groups experienced higher rates of multiple types of harassment, even when controlling for other sociodemographic characteristics. Prejudice-based harassment experiences are prevalent among adolescent girls and boys. Differential rates of each type of harassment are reported across groups within the corresponding sociodemographic status (e.g., white female adolescents report a significantly lower rate of race-based harassment (4.8%), as compared to Native American (18.6%), mixed/other race (18.9%), Hispanic/Latina (21.5%), Asian/Pacific Islander (24.2%), or Black/African American (24.8%) female adolescents); but a pattern of cross-harassment also is evident, such that differences in prevalence of each harassment type emerge across a variety of statuses (e.g., disability-based harassment was statistically significantly higher among discordant heterosexual (12.7%), gay (13.0%), bisexual (15.3%), and unsure (15.3%) male adolescents than among heterosexual male (7.2%) adolescents). Adolescents from specific sociodemographic groups are particularly vulnerable to certain types of harassment.

T1  - Escaping oppositional thinking in the teaching of pleasure and danger in sexuality education
AN  - 1797558958
AB  - Sexuality education and preventative sexual abuse education are often taught as separate subjects in secondary schools. This paper extends the argument against this separation by highlighting flaws in the logic that manifests this separation. Diffracting critical sexuality education theory with the monist logic of new materialism, I rethink sexuality as an array of intra-acting1 bodies that are always in a process of becoming anew. Realising the belonging together of dualist terms [Bergson, Henri. 1896 [1911]. Matter and Memory. Translated and edited by Nancy Margaret Paul and W. Scott Palmer. London: George Allen & Unwin Ltd.] and how the reductive structure of dualist logic affirms an original 'One', I argue that the feminist push for pleasure-based, sex-positive education affirms sex-negative attitudes. Embracing Barad's [Barad, Karen. 2007. Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning. Durham: Duke University Press.] notion of ethics as inescapable entanglement woven through all matter(ing), I suggest that rather than any particular 'aspect' of sexuality being emphasised in sexuality education it would be more useful to centre classroom discussions on ethics, as inescapable entanglement.

T1  - Perspective Taking Explains Gender Differences in Late Adolescents' Attitudes Toward Disadvantaged Groups
AN  - 1795436293
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Understanding Diversity and Inequality: Dimensions Ranging from Race, Ethnicity, Immigration and Sexual Identity to Social Class 
Adolescents' attitudes toward disadvantaged groups are surprisingly understudied. What we know from these few studies is that adolescents' attitudes tend to become more favorable over time and that adolescent girls display more favorable attitudes than do adolescent boys. However, researchers have not offered explanations for why these effects occur. We proposed that changes in social-cognitive abilities that accompany adolescent development increase perspective taking and that the increased perspective taking facilitates more favorable attitudes toward disadvantaged groups. Because girls develop social-cognitive abilities earlier than boys, girls should show greater perspective taking and thus more positive attitudes toward disadvantaged groups than should boys. Importantly, we propose that these more positive attitudes are explained better by perspective taking than by gender. Participants were late adolescents (n = 803, 53.3 % female, ages 15-19) from high schools in north-central Florida (United States) participating in an ongoing, multi-wave study. Participants completed a measure of perspective-taking and reported their attitudes toward three disadvantaged groups (Black, gay, and poor people) during their third year of high school and, again, 6 months later during their fourth year of high school. Our findings provided strong support for our theorizing. Girls generally reported warmer attitudes than did boys toward disadvantaged groups, with the gender differences in warmth tending to diminish across time. Similarly, girls were higher than boys in perspective-taking abilities at both time points, although boys increased over time whereas girls did not. Crucially, perspective taking mediated observed gender differences in attitudes, suggesting that perspective taking is a mechanism for improving attitudes toward disadvantaged groups during late adolescence.

T1  - Homonegativity in Italy: Cultural Issues, Personality Characteristics, and Demographic Correlates with Negative Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay Men
AN  - 1783663128
AB  - This study is an extension of earlier research that investigated the nature of homonegativity among Italian people (Lingiardi et al. 2005). We used the Modern Homophobia Scale (MHS), adapted to be more appropriate for the Italian social and cultural context. Associations were examined between homophobic attitudes, demographics, and personality characteristics and contact with lesbians and gay men. Gender issues were considered twice, from the viewpoint of both the agent and the target of the prejudice. The findings indicated that people at higher risk of possessing homonegative attitudes are older; less educated; more involved in religion and politically conservative; characterized by a more conforming, moralistic, and rule-bound personality, according to Cattell's personality factors; and have poor contact experience with lesbians and gay men. Males tended to have higher levels of homonegativity toward gay men but not toward lesbians. Proposals to reduce antigay bias in the Italian context will be briefly discussed.

T1  - Friends With Moral Credentials
AN  - 1816868285
AB  - People commonly reference minority friendships when expressing conceivably prejudiced attitudes. The prevalence of this strategy suggests a widespread belief that having minority friends makes one look less racist, but to date, there is little research demonstrating whether or not this is the case. White and Asian participants were presented with a Facebook profile depicting a White target who posted an anti-Asian statement. Being depicted with Asian friends (Study 1) or even verbally claiming that they had Asian friends (Study 2) reduced attributions of racism irrespective of whether they were being evaluated by White or Asian observers. Furthermore, the presence of Asian friends made the conceivably racist comments seem relatively benign, and observers were less offended and upset by them. The data suggest that minority friendships can partially offset costs associated with expressing prejudice.

T1  - Emergence of internal and external motivations to respond without prejudice in White children: GPIR
AN  - 1933575878
AB  - This research examined White U.S. children's internal and external motivations to respond without prejudice (IMS and EMS). Study 1 examined the psychometric properties of IMS and EMS scales adapted from Plant and Devine (1998) in a predominately White sample of children (N = 123, ages 7-12, M age = 9.50, SD = 1.66). Among children aged 8 and older, both scales were reliable and correlated with theoretically relevant constructs. Study 2 examined whether IMS and EMS mediate the inverse relation between age and explicit prejudice in a sample of White children (N = 145, ages 8-10, M age = 8.98, SD = 0.82). When ethnic labeling was present, EMS mediated the inverse relation between age and explicit ethnic bias. When ethnic labeling was absent, IMS mediated the inverse relation between age and explicit ethnic bias. Results indicate IMS and EMS emerge in childhood and bear implications for theories of ethnic attitude development.

T1  - Afterword: How I Use #BlackLivesMatter as an Entry Point and a Disruption Tool: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism
AN  - 1881718046
AB  - Raised as a member of the southern grandparent generation, the author was never unaware of white supremacy and racial prejudice. She knew of archetypal white supremacy like the Ku Klux Klan, but rarely imagined white supremacy as a burly man in a white sheet and pointy cap. Her run-ins with whiteness were more subtle: a white person's random glare on the street or being stopped by a smiling white woman to touch her hair and asking her grandmother how she was so clean and neat. However, the majority of her learning about how to maneuver around white people was experienced in the classroom. One particularly striking memory was in eighth grade. As a college professor at a predominantly white institution, she relies heavily on the teaching moments of her youth to curate her pedagogical approaches. Her classroom is constructed as a reclamation space for her students to engage with black literature and culture. Students are challenged to acknowledge marginalized experiences that are often outside of their own comfort zone.

T1  - School-level contextual predictors of bullying and harassment experiences among adolescents
AN  - 1751218078
AB  - Bullying and prejudice-based harassment frequently occur in school settings and have significant consequences for the health and wellbeing of young people. Yet far fewer studies have examined the role of the school environment in peer harassment than individual factors. This multilevel study examined associations between a variety of school-level risk and protective factors and student-level reports of bullying and prejudice-based harassment during adolescence. Data come from 8th, 9th, and 11th graders who completed the 2013 Minnesota Student Survey (N = 122,180 students nested in 505 schools). School-level variables were created by aggregating student report data in five areas: academic orientation to school, internal assets, teacher-student relationship quality, feelings of safety at school, and receipt of disciplinary action. Results indicated that youth attending schools with a higher proportion of students with strong internal assets had lower odds of nearly every type of bullying and prejudice-based harassment assessed when compared to youth attending schools with a lower proportion of students with strong internal assets. Additionally, the proportion of students feeling unsafe at school was a fairly consistent risk factor for most types of peer harassment. Findings support the idea that prevention programs aimed at improving school-wide internal assets and feelings of safety at school may be key prevention points.

T1  - Beyond Prejudice? Young Whites' Racial Attitudes in Post-Civil Rights America, 1976 to 2000: PROD
AN  - 1710020623
AB  - A key finding from previous research on trends in Whites' racial attitudes is that much of the decline in the expression of racial prejudice over the past seven decades can be attributed to the replacement of older, less tolerant White cohorts by younger, more tolerant cohorts of Whites in the U.S. population (i.e., cohort replacement). An implicit assumption of much of this work is that cohort replacement will continue to produce unidirectional liberalizing trends in Whites' racial attitudes because of the more tolerant attitudes of each younger cohort. In this article, we reexamine the cohort replacement hypothesis focusing on young Whites' racial attitudes and whether change is in substance or form. We develop a theoretical argument about the shifting nature of young Whites' racial attitudes and understandings in the post-civil rights era by building on Forman's concept of racial apathy and the expanding literature on color-blind racism, which posits that during the post-civil rights era, subtle forms of racial prejudice have become more prevalent than overt forms. We empirically test this argument by investigating trends in, and determinants of, young Whites' racial attitudes from 1976 to 2000, using nationally representative samples of White high school seniors. Although we find a liberalizing trend for some racial attitudes, we do not find a similar pattern for contemporary forms of prejudice, particularly racial apathy. In addition, we find that the social determinants of young Whites' social distance attitudes (traditional prejudice) and expressions of racial apathy (contemporary prejudice) have been remarkably consistent over time. Collectively, these results indicate the need for greater attention to the expression of subtle forms of prejudice among young Whites generally, and to the potentially destructive force of rising levels of racial apathy specifically.

T1  - Religion and Negative Attitudes towards Homosexuals
AN  - 1824574993
AB  - Public opinion research has repeatedly shown that religious persons report more prejudice against homosexuality when compared to their non-religious counterparts. This article contributes to a better understanding of this relationship by studying attitudes of youth in two of the three largest cities of Flanders (N : 1907). The ethnic and religious heterogeneous population of these cities allows us to empirically disentangle the relevance of both religious involvement (strong versus weak) and the specific religious conviction with respect to negative attitudes towards homosexuals. This offers us a more detailed view on the exact nature of the relationship between religiosity and the latter attitudes among youth than what has been achieved so far. For both Christian and Muslim believers, we found more negative attitudes towards homosexuality, even after controlling for authoritarianism and a more traditional view on gender roles. Although boys appeared, in general, more negative towards homosexuality than girls, the gender gap amongst young Muslims was twice as large when compared to non-Muslims.

T1  - Individual Psychological Factors and Complex Interpersonal Conditions that Predict LGBT-Affirming Behavior
AN  - 1694641946
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Genetic Influences on Peer and Family Relationships Across Development, Part II              To counter homophobic behavior in schools, research is needed on heterosexual youth who act as allies to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth by engaging in LGBT-affirming behavior (e.g., voicing support, engaging in advocacy, countering homophobia). Among 624 heterosexual high school students (M ^sub age^ = 16.11; 53 % female; 88 % white), this study found that critical thinking, self-reflection, lower sexual prejudice, having more LGBT friends, and having sexual orientation-based discussions with peers were associated with engaging in more LGBT-affirming behavior. Several factors moderated the association between having sexual orientation-based discussions and LGBT-affirming behavior: the association was stronger among youth who described the tone of these discussions as more positive, who more often used positive problem-solving strategies, and who reported low sexual prejudice. The degree to which conversations were challenging did not moderate this association. Finally, having LGBT friends was more strongly associated with affirming behavior for youth who felt more connected and had more sexual orientation-based discussions with these friends. The findings underscore the need for research to identify other factors that prompt heterosexual youth to act as allies to LGBT youth.

T1  - The Panacea and Perfidy of Cross Racial Foster Care on Children Living in Cross Racial Foster (CRF) Care Placements: Implications for Children's Needs and Rights
AN  - 1799007656
AB  - Internationally, regionally and in various national contexts, cross-racial foster care (CRFC) placement has been receiving wide debates and discourses with regards to its relevance and effectiveness as an option of custody for children in need of care and protection. The aim of this paper is, through a review of literature methodology, to discuss and debate the panacea and perfidy of the CRFC placements in the contemporary South African context with unrelenting burgeoning cases of orphans and vulnerable children in need of alternative care. The following aspects of CRFC were considered beneficial or a panacea: They offer vulnerable children (orphans) an opportunity for a second alternative care; a forum of ensuring vulnerable children get their basic needs such as food and shelter; offers an opportunity for acculturation to take roots. Contrastingly, the following aspects were considered undesirable or perfidious: possible loss of children's identity; discrimination and prejudice; loss of natural attachment; and challenges of adjusting to a new racial milieu. The paper is theoretically premised on the Systems theory. The paper recommends: training of cross racial foster care parents; as well as having the Department of Social Development to launch strong awareness campaigns to make the public understand the importance of CRFC placements in the country

T1  - When Prejudice Is Popular: Implications for Discriminatory Behavior
AN  - 1718068191; 201532549
AB  - Prejudice and popularity represent two major areas of research. Yet studies have not considered whether prejudiced adolescents actually can be popular. Among 572 high school students (Mage = 15.80 years), the current study tested the association between popularity (based on sociometric peer nominations) and sexual prejudice against gay and lesbian individuals, moderated by gender and perspective taking. As hypothesized, the association was significant for males but not females, and it was significant for adolescents lower on perspective taking but not those higher on perspective taking. Moreover, adolescents who were popular and expressed strong sexual prejudice were more likely to engage in homophobic behavior than prejudiced adolescents who were less popular. Popular adolescents with strong sexual prejudice beliefs may be more prone to use homophobic behavior as a way to maintain their dominant position. Similarly, prejudiced adolescents who are popular may face less pushback for their engagement in homophobic behavior. Continued attention to the connection between sexual prejudice and popularity is important because of the high status, influence, and visibility of popular adolescents.

T1  - Making Fun out of Difference: Ethnicity–Race and Humour in a London School
AN  - 2426561096
AB  - This article highlights the importance of humour and laughter in analyses of ethnicity and race in everyday life, and contributes to the growing anthropological engagement with the role of the ludic in social life. Focusing on pupil interaction in an ethnically and racially diverse London school, it argues that while peer classification practices can lead to reification of ethnic and racial differences, ludic interactions have cross-cutting, counter-balancing or liquefying effects. In interactions of humour, ethnic and racial differences can become the very material from which banter and laughter are created, constituting a convivial sociality that manifests closeness at the same time as difference. Such interactions enable peers to address their racial and ethnic differences, and a wider context of prejudice and racism, lightly, ‘making fun out of’ what could potentially divide and distance them.

T1  - What are they hearing? The impact of perceptions of parental communication on youth
AN  - 1667949137; 201511923
AB  - Work and family domains mutually influence one another in positive and negative ways. A fair amount of evidence supports the spillover effects between these two domains. In addition, research on crossover supports how one spouse may be influenced by another spouse's spillover. Much less evidence exists about how it affects other family members, especially children. This qualitative interpretive study explores emergent themes related to youth perceptions of how their parents' work-family spillover impacts them. Using crossover as a guiding framework, youth (N = 55) participated in a semistructured interview about their perceptions of their parents' communication regarding blending work and family and how it impacts those youth participants. The analysis of the transcribed interviews revealed several emergent themes related to youth awareness of and the impact of work-family integration issues as well as youth perceptions about their own futures. The results suggest the ways in which socialization occurs through a socially constructed view of work and family and the impact those constructions have on vocational decisions.

T1  - Mexican-American Adolescents' Gender Role Attitude Development: The Role of Adolescents' Gender and Nativity and Parents' Gender Role Attitudes
AN  - 1680152720; 201515937
AB  - Gender development has long term implications for education and career endeavors and family formation behaviors, but we know very little about the role of sociocultural factors in developmental and individual differences. In this study, we investigated one domain of gender development, gender role attitudes, in Mexican-American adolescents (N = 246; 51 % female), using four phases of longitudinal data across 8 years. Data were collected when adolescents averaged 12.51 years (SD = 0.58), 14.64 years (SD = 0.59), 17.72 years (SD = 0.57), and 19.60 years of age (SD = 0.66). Mothers' and fathers' gender role attitudes also were assessed in Phases 1, 3, and 4. Findings revealed that gender attitude development varied as a function of the interaction between adolescents' nativity and gender. Among Mexico-born adolescents, females exhibited significant declines in traditional attitudes from early to late adolescence, but males' attitudes were stable over time. U.S.-born females and males, in contrast, did not differ in their gender attitude trajectories. Examining the links between mothers', fathers', and adolescents' gender role attitudes revealed within-person associations between mothers' and adolescents' gender role attitudes: on occasions when mothers reported more traditional attitudes relative to their own cross-time average, adolescents also reported more traditional attitudes than usual. In addition, fathers' more traditional gender role attitudes were associated with daughters', but not sons', more traditional gender role attitudes at the between-person level. The discussion focuses on the interpretation of Mexican-American adolescents' gender role attitude development from a cultural ecological perspective. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Developmental Trajectories of Prejudice and Tolerance Toward Immigrants from Early to Late Adolescence
AN  - 1680155089; 201515952
AB  - Adolescence is an important period for the development of relationships between immigrants and non-immigrants, yet little is known about how problematic personality traits affect adolescents' relationships with and attitudes toward immigrants. This work identified the roles of intergroup relationships and one dimension of problematic personality traits, namely callous-unemotional traits, in the development of adolescents' tolerance and prejudice. Three annual measurements of a large community sample (N = 1,542) of non-immigrant adolescents (M age = 15.31 at first measurement; 50.2 % girls) were used to show that tolerance and prejudice toward immigrants represent two dimensions with distinct developmental trajectories from early to late adolescence. Callous-unemotional traits predicted fewer decreases in prejudice toward immigrants, yet were not directly associated with tolerance. Intergroup friendships predicted stronger increases in tolerance, which, in turn, predicted decreases in prejudice toward immigrants. Thus, tolerance and prejudice toward immigrants seem to be differentially influenced by social experiences and problematic personality traits. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Adoption meanings cultural construction: a semiotic process
AN  - 1728662189; 201535917
AB  - We searched to understand the process of meaning making about adoption, addressing a member of the extended family of a satisfactory case of adoption, using the theoretical and methodological foundations of Semiotics Cultural Psychology from idiographic orientation. We highlighted the dynamic between the meanings that exist in the collective culture, in transformation, and the personal meaning making. The construction of the meanings of adoption, even in a family whose adoption is accepted by all, is characterized by the existence of a constant tension and by the ambivalence between the collective culture - full of myths and prejudices shared in a system of redundant messages, but also reflecting a current process in which the adoption is presented as commendable and desirable - and the gradual construction of a personal culture. Some suggestions on useful directions for the work of guidance to prospective parents and adoption support groups are suggested. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Imagined contact as a prejudice-reduction intervention in schools: the underlying role of similarity and attitudes
AN  - 1552385833
AB  - The present research tested a prejudice-reduction intervention based on imagined contact. White children imagined interacting with a child from an ethnic out-group (Asian) once a week for 3 weeks, or did not take part in this activity (control group). Compared with the control group, children who engaged in imagined contact subsequently showed more positive attitudes, greater perceived similarity, and willingness for intergroup contact. The effect of the intervention on willingness for contact was mediated by positive attitude change. Implications for imagined-contact theory and the development of prejudice-reduction techniques for schools are discussed.

T1  - Gay fathers and their children: a literature review
AN  - 1728662092; 201535871
AB  - Research has mainly identified similarities between lesbian/gay parenting and heterosexual parenting, namely in what concerns parental practices and the psychosocial development of children. However, comparatively with the bulk of research with lesbian mothers, studies with gay fathers are still residual. The purpose of this work was to critically revise the psychological literature about gay fathers and their children. Firstly, we reflected about specific prejudices against gay parenting. Secondly, we revised the most important scientific studies with gay male parents, published between 1979 and 2011. Results of this body of research were organized around five themes: attitudes towards parenthood, sexual identity, relation with the contexts, parental competence and family dynamics/relationship quality, and psychosocial development of children and youngsters. Finally, we highlighted some limitations of the revised research and we drew implications for the future. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - What causes prejudice? How may we solve it? Lay beliefs and their relations with classical and modern prejudice and social dominance orientation
AN  - 1559007579; 201432163
AB  - This research aimed to examine lay beliefs about the causes of and solutions to ethnic prejudice towards immigrant populations in the Italian context. The research had two main goals: (a) to explore in Italy what non-experts think causes ethnic prejudice against immigrants, and how they suggest we combat it; (b) to assess whether lay perceptions of causes of ethnic prejudice mediate the relationship between SDO and ethnic prejudice, and whether such mediational effects would depend on the form of ethnic prejudice considered (classical vs. modern). In particular, we hypothesized that lay beliefs about the causes of (but not lay beliefs about solutions to) prejudice towards immigrants may mediate the relation between SDO and prejudice towards immigrants. 520 Italian high school students participated in the study and completed a set of questionnaires regarding these issues. Results showed that Italian respondents were especially likely to attribute the causes of ethnic prejudice towards immigrants to ignorance and close-mindedness, and to recommend as main solutions open-mindedness and tolerance of others' values. Moreover, as predicted, beliefs about causes of ethnic prejudice significantly mediated the relation between SDO and modern (but not classical) prejudice. Implications of our findings for social dominance theory were discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Should educators and parents encourage other-gender interactions? Gender segregation and sexism
AN  - 1542000360; 201428640
AB  - We investigated gender differences in the association between gender-segregated peer preferences and sexism in adolescents (15-17 years, 60 boys and 85 girls). To assess gender-segregated peer preferences, adolescents nominated peers for interaction in two contexts: 'hanging out' at home and working on a school project. The Modern Sexism Scale [Swim, J. K., K. J. Aikin, W. S. Hall, and B. A. Hunter. 1995. 'Sexism and Racism: Old-Fashioned and Modern Prejudices.' Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 68(2): 199-214] measured two dimensions of sexism: Antagonism towards Women's Demands (believing feminist issues are unimportant) and denial of continuing discrimination (believing gender discrimination no longer exists). For boys, Antagonism towards Women's Demands was associated with gender-segregated peer preferences in the school and home context. For girls, Denial of Continuing Discrimination was associated with gender-segregated peer preferences in the home context. Results are informative for educators and for other professionals interested in reducing inequality and sexism among adolescents. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Attitudes of Italian Heterosexual Older Adults Towards Lesbian and Gay Parenting
AN  - 1441795025
AB  - Several studies have examined the attitudes of heterosexuals towards lesbian and gay parenting, revealing mostly negative attitudes. Nonetheless, no research studies have examined these attitudes specifically among elderly adults. Two hundred eighty older heterosexuals adults ranged from 65 to 87 years old (women: M=74.2, SD=6.0; male M=73.9, SD=6.1) completed measures evaluating their knowledge of the existence of lesbian and gay parents, their attitudes towards lesbian and gay parenting and expected child outcomes, and opinions regarding legalization and recognition of lesbian and gay parents. As we expected, age was a relevant predictor of negative attitudes towards lesbian and gay parenting: older elders had a stronger prejudice than the others. Data revealed that the more positive evaluation was for the heterosexual and lesbian parents while the more negative evaluation was for the gay male parents. Regression analyses showed that a negative attitude towards lesbian and gay parents was predicted by older age, right-wing conservatism, and internalized sexual stigma. The expected effects on child outcomes were predicted only by the dimensions of sexual stigma.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Do Academically-Engaged Adolescents Experience Social Sanctions from the Peer Group?
AN  - 1463008550; 201347034
AB  - Existing theoretical perspectives suggest that adolescents who are characterized by high achievement may experience social sanctions from peers. The central premise is that, in many North American settings, adolescent peer groups are characterized by negative attitudes toward the school environment. To test these hypotheses, we examined associations between indicators of low social power (unpopularity and victimization by peers) and academic competence for 415 adolescents (193 boys; 222 girls) attending an urban high school. This school served neighborhoods that were characterized by a moderate degree of economic distress and the students were predominately of Hispanic American descent. A short-term longitudinal design was used, with two waves of data collected over consecutive school years. The adolescents completed a peer nomination inventory assessing relational and overt victimization by peers, unpopularity, and social rejection. In addition, we obtained math and language arts grades from school records, and we assessed behavioral engagement in school with a self-report inventory. Structural equation models did not reveal a strong pattern of longitudinal change in social standing with peers or academic functioning. However, we found positive correlations between academic achievement and problematic peer relationships in both years of the project. We also found evidence that gender moderates these associations, with the effects reaching significance only for boys. Our results provide evidence that, in some settings, high achieving adolescents can be prone to negative treatment or marginalization by peers. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Beyond the Ethnic-Civic Dichotomy: Cultural Citizenship as a New Way of Excluding Immigrants
AN  - 1429637666; 201335823
AB  - In European Union (EU) countries, public debates about immigrants and citizenship are increasingly framed in cultural terms. Yet, there is no agreement within the citizenship literature on whether a cultural citizenship representation can be distinguished from the more established ethnic and civic representations and on how its measures relate to anti-immigrant attitudes. The present study tested measures of citizenship representations among high school students (N=1476) in six EU countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Sweden). Factor analyses favored a three-factor model of citizenship representations (i.e., ethnic, cultural, and civic factors), which showed partial metric invariance. Across countries, ethnic and cultural scales correlated positively with each other and negatively with the civic scale. Moreover, ethnic and cultural scales related positively and the civic scale negatively to anti-immigrant attitudes. However, when analyzed simultaneously, relations of the ethnic scale with anti-immigrant attitudes were no longer significant, while those of the cultural and civic scales proved to be robust. Implications of these findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Corporal Punishment: Examining Attitudes Toward the Law and Factors Influencing Attitude Change
AN  - 1429630394; 201338927
AB  - There remains considerable societal support for child corporal punishment, despite much research about its ineffectiveness and potential harm to children. We examined attitudes toward Section 43 of the Canadian Criminal Code which gives parents the right to use reasonable physical force for discipline purposes. We also examined attitude change and predictors of this change. Participants (N=212) completed an on-line study, which found that 39.2 % disagreed with ending Section 43. Upon presentation of corporal punishment-related information, the majority (63.8-70.5 %) now indicated being in favor of ending Section 43. Attitude change was highest for information on the potential for child abuse. Socio-demographics (ethnicity, religion), childhood disciplinary experiences (non-punitive discipline), and discipline perceptions (parental warmth/involvement) predicted attitude change. Results indicate that providing information about corporal punishment is key to changing attitudes toward parents' legal right to its use. Also, parental background and childhood discipline characteristics may differentially influence the amount of attitude change. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Homophobic Name-Calling Among Secondary School Students and Its Implications for Mental Health
AN  - 1285325609; 23001719
AB  - Although homophobic verbal victimization has been associated with negative mental health outcomes, little actually is known about its general prevalence and relationship to mental health among adolescents. In addition, the relationship of homophobic name-calling to mental health in gender non-conforming adolescents is not well understood. This study examined the relationship between homophobic verbal victimization and mental health in adolescents, accounting for their sexual orientation and level of gender non-conformity. Survey data was collected from 513 adolescents (ages 11-17) who attended eight schools in and around Amsterdam, the Netherlands; 56.7 % of the participating adolescents were female and 11.1 % reported same-sex attractions. As hypothesized, male adolescents and those with same-sex attractions were more likely to report victimization from homophobic name-calling than were their female and non-same-sex attracted peers. Contrary to expectations, homophobic name-calling was not independently associated with psychological distress after controlling for gender, sexual attractions, gender non-conformity, and other negative treatment by peers. The hypothesis that homophobic name-calling would be more strongly associated with psychological distress in male, same-sex attracted, and gender non-conforming adolescents was also not supported. The results suggest that same-sex attracted and gender non-conforming youth are particularly vulnerable to homophobic name-calling, in the Netherlands as in other contexts, but also that other forms of peer victimization may be more strongly related to mental health.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Parental messages concerning Latino/Black interracial dating: An exploratory study among Latina/o young adults
AN  - 1073444964
AB  - Many immigrant groups have racially distanced themselves from Blacks due to anti-Black prejudice and stigma. Racial distancing can be transmitted to children through regulating intimate contact with Blacks. Few studies have examined how Latino young adults receive racialized messages from their immigrant parents about dating Blacks. In-depth interviews reveal that Latino young adults encounter messages regarding mixed race children, perceived cultural differences and the US racial hierarchy. This regulatory process is gendered with Latinas experiencing more explicit sanctioning than Latino men. This study illuminates how Latino parents create racialized and gendered boundaries between their children and Blacks. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Homophobia and the Transition to Adulthood: A Three Year Panel Study among Belgian Late Adolescents and Young Adults, 2008-2011
AN  - 1037273390; 22752949
AB  - Studies on homophobia among adolescents routinely depart from the assumption that this attitude will be continued into adulthood. However, little research has been conducted on how the transition toward adulthood actually affects homophobia. While earlier studies relied on cross-sectional observations, the present analysis makes use of the Belgian Political Panel Survey (2008-2011), tracking 2,815 respondents (52 % female, 48 % male) between the ages of 18 and 21. A conditional change model shows that while men had substantially higher levels of homophobia than women to begin with, this difference grew even larger throughout the observation period. The discrepancy between Muslim respondents and those with other religions became larger as well. Overall, the gender and religious differences already present in adolescence had become further polarized at the end of the observation period. Friendship relations with persons with a different sexual orientation, on the other hand, significantly reduced prejudice, especially among men, while the results also show that changes in the level of homophobia are related strongly to conservative views on gender roles. We conclude that groups that already display high levels of homophobia during adolescence are likely to grow even more extreme in their views in the transition to adulthood.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Individual differences in ideological attitudes and prejudice: Evidence from peer-report data
AN  - 1347782696; 201318697
AB  - Our knowledge on the personality basis of ideological attitudes and prejudice, while based on a substantial body of research, suffers from a potentially serious methodological limitation: an overreliance on the method of self-reports. Across 2 studies (Ns = 193, 424), we examined associations between the Big Five personality dimensions, Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA), Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), and generalized prejudice, using both self-report and peer-report data stemming from 1 (Study 1) or 2 (Study 2) peer rater/s. Correlational and regression analyses as well as structural equation modeling showed that (a) the associations between personality dimensions, ideological attitudes, and prejudice were largely similar to previous research for both data sources; (b) RWA and prejudice showed a similar level of self-peer agreement to personality dimensions; (c) most of the known associations between personality, ideological attitudes, and prejudice were replicated also when measured by independent methods; (d) peer reports had some incremental validity in predicting ideological attitudes and prejudice; and (e) there was evidence that Openness to Experience and Agreeableness predicted prejudice directly and not only indirectly via RWA and SDO, respectively. Implications for the status of RWA, SDO, and prejudice as individual-difference constructs and for their bases in personality dimensions are discussed.

T1  - Prejudice Awareness Through Cultural Self-Knowledge Development: Going Beyond the Contact Reduces Prejudice Hypothesis
AN  - 1283638547; 201303608
AB  - This article challenges the simplicity of Allport's contact reduces prejudice hypothesis by emphasizing the importance of addressing previously learned cultural beliefs and attitudes as a possible factor in prejudice development and reduction. These cultural beliefs and attitudes were studied through classroom assignments where this type of learning can be explored. Data were collected from students in a graduate cross-cultural course after students' completion of a cultural self-assessment paper and a paper based on interviewing an ethnic family. These data revealed that, through a process of cultural self-knowledge development and later contact with an ethnic family, prejudice awareness appeared to occur, which has the potential to reduce prejudice.

T1  - Improving implicit and explicit intergroup attitudes using imagined contact: An experimental intervention with elementary school children
AN  - 1023028882; 201223708
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of imagined intergroup contact (Crisp & Turner, 2009) on elementary school children's explicit and implicit intergroup attitudes. Italian 5th-graders participated in a 3-week intervention involving imagining meeting an unknown immigrant peer in various situations. Approximately 1 week after the last session, they completed measures of self-disclosure and behavioral intentions toward immigrants. Furthermore, they were administered a measure of implicit prejudice. Results showed that those taking part in the intervention, compared to participants in a control condition, revealed more positive behavioral intentions and implicit attitudes toward immigrants. Moreover, self-disclosure mediated the effect of imagined contact on outgroup behavioral intentions. Theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed.

T1  - Prejudice in Childhood: Validation of Two Social Distance Scales
AN  - 1015334475
AB  - The aim of this research was to study children's prejudice. We administered children's social distance scales to 311 fifth graders from 6 elementary schools in Zagreb. One of the scales measured willingness to engage in more or less distanced forms of contact (from living in the same town to forming close friendships), while the other measured willingness to spend leisure time through doing various activities with peers who had some specific characteristic. Target groups were blind children, children who use a wheelchair, obese children and Romani children. Factor analysis on both measures for every group produced meaningful one factor solutions. On both instruments children expressed the highest prejudice toward Romani children, while social distances toward the other three groups were similar. Boys constantly showed higher social distances than girls. There were also relatively high correlations between social distances toward the same groups on different instruments. The results generally indicate children's tendency to reject members of different groups and accentuate the necessity for interventions during preadolescence. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Can friendships be bipartisan? The effects of political ideology on peer relationships: GPIR
AN  - 1907332268
AB  - Although political ideology has been examined extensively as a predictor of individual differences, it has been absent in the interpersonal relationships literature. Political ideology may have strong effects on friendship patterns because of its polarizing nature. Findings among actual friendship groups (Study 1) indicated a degree of similarity in peers' political ideology alignments, but also suggested that liberals and conservatives were comfortable with some level of bipartisanship among their friends. In an experimental condition with hypothetical peers (Study 2), individuals' political ideology predicted their reported friendship potential (perceived similarity and desire for friendship) with gay-affirming and gay-disapproving peers whose ideologies were not explicitly indicated. This effect of political ideology on friendship potential was significant over and above the effect predicted by individuals' similarity or dissimilarity on sexual minority attitudes with these peers. Findings highlight the overarching relevance of political ideology as a factor that contributes to friendship patterns.

T1  - Gendered Capital: Childhood Socialization and the "Boy Crisis" in Education
AN  - 896168766; 201121939
AB  - This study examined the effect of gender socialization on kindergarten grades using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study- Kindergarten Cohort. The sample consisted of 6,394 children (3,177 girls; 3,217 boys) from across the United States. MANOVA and follow-up tests revealed that both boys and girls tend to participate in gender-typed activities. Girls are more likely to have positive school attitudes and exhibit positive social behavior; boys are more likely to have negative school attitudes. Regression analyses indicated that participation in "female" activities and positive social behavior positively affect grades; participation in "male" activities has no direct effect. Positive attitudes positively affect the grades of girls; negative attitudes negatively affect the grades of boys. Teacher evaluation practices are also considered. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Associations of Parental and Peer Characteristics with Adolescents' Social Dominance Orientation
AN  - 1037878529; 201233346
AB  - Studies with adults of social dominance orientation (SDO), a preference for inequality among social groups, have found correlations with various prejudices and support for discriminatory practices. This study explores the construct among adolescents at an age when they are beginning to recognize the social groups in their environment, particularly adolescent crowds. The relationship of SDO and perceptions of parents' responsiveness and demandingness were also investigated. Subjects were in grades 9-12 (N = 516, 53% female, 96% White). Mother's and father's responsiveness significantly predicted adolescent's SDO scores, with greater perceived responsiveness associated with lower SDO. To analyze the multiple crowd memberships of the 76% belonging to more than one crowd, two-step cluster analysis was used to identify patterns, resulting in 8 clusters of distinct, heterogeneous composition. SDO differed significantly among males in different clusters, but not females. The importance of membership was positively associated with SDO among high-status crowds and negatively associated with SDO among the academic and normal crowds. The findings have implications for prejudices that may be developing in adolescence and indicate a need for further research into the social context of SDO and its development.

T1  - Youth Attitudes Toward Dating Violence in Thailand
AN  - 1928252210
AB  - This study assessed the occurrences and intensity of psychological, physical, and sexual attitudes toward dating violence among Thai youths, and examined possible variables related to the formation of these attitudes.The random sample consisted of 1,296 male and female adolescents from high school, vocational school, and out-of-school groups. Thai youths in general reported attitudes that were supportive of dating violence. The variables more closely related to attitudes toward dating violence were personal variables. Peer influence, partner relationships, and family characteristics were related to higher support for dating violence. Females reported higher endorsement of dating violence than males. The theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed, and recommendations for policy makers are drawn.

T1  - The attitudes of primary schoolchildren in Northern Thailand towards their peers who are affected by HIV and AIDS
AN  - 868015599; 201113917
AB  - After more than a decade of the AIDS epidemic in Thailand, the number of children whose parents are living with HIV or have died from AIDS is increasing significantly and it has been reported that these children are often discriminated against by their peers. In order to better understand the current situation and to explore possible strategies to support HIV-affected children, this study examined children's attitudes towards HIV and AIDS using questionnaires and focus group discussions with children in Grades three-six in five primary schools in a northern province in Thailand. A total of 513 children (274 boys and 239 girls) answered the questionnaire and five focus groups were organised. The findings showed a strong positive correlation between children's belief that HIV could be transmitted through casual contact and their negative attitudes towards their HIV-affected peers. Most children overestimated the risk of HIV transmission through casual contact and this made their attitudes less tolerant and less supportive. After HIV prevention education (which included information on HIV transmission routes) was given in three of the study schools, the same questionnaire and focus groups were repeated and the findings showed that children's attitudes had become more supportive. These findings suggest that HIV prevention education delivered through primary schools in Thailand can be an effective way to help foster a more supportive and inclusive environment and reduce the stigma and discrimination that decrease educational access and attainment for HIV-affected schoolchildren.

T1  - Development of Ethnic, Racial, and National Prejudice in Childhood and Adolescence: A Multinational Meta-Analysis of Age Differences
AN  - 919905256; 201201718
AB  - This meta-analysis summarizes 113 research reports worldwide (121 cross-sectional and 7 longitudinal studies) on age differences in ethnic, racial, or national prejudice among children and adolescents. Overall, results indicated a peak in prejudice in middle childhood (5-7 years) followed by a slight decrease until late childhood (8-10 years). In addition to differences for the various operationalizations of prejudice, detailed findings revealed different age-related changes in prejudice toward higher versus lower status out-groups and positive effects of contact opportunities with the out-group on prejudice development. Results confirm that prejudice changes systematically with age during childhood but that no developmental trend is found in adolescence, indicating the stronger influence of the social context on prejudice with increasing age.

T1  - Teaching Children Fairness: Decreasing Gender Prejudice Among Children
AN  - 1030869572; 201230111
AB  - Elementary school children (66 girls and 55 boys, aged 10-13 years) in the Western United States participated in a program designed to teach them about fairness and to decrease their engagement in gender-prejudice behaviors. The study utilized a pretest/posttest design comparing students in the treatment group to students in a control group. Children and teachers completed measures regarding the children's engagement of gender prejudice among their classmates, and students participated in focus groups after completing the program. At posttest, students in the treatment group reported experiencing less gender-prejudice by their classmates than students in the control group. Teachers also reported fewer gender-prejudice behaviors by the students in the treatment group. Qualitative analyses of the focus groups revealed that the students reported learning to challenge gender role stereotypes and endorsed a commitment to treating boys and girls fairly.

AB  - Prejudice and hate crimes against lesbians and gay men are prevalent throughout the United States. Prejudice in public school settings is particularly problematic for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) students and LGB parents. Efforts to reduce prejudice for LGB groups have met with limited success. Creating safer and more inclusive school environments is essential. An experimental mixed methods field design tested outcomes of an intergroup dialogue intervention on public school teacher attitudes, feelings, and behaviors toward LGB students and parents. Quantitative results indicate dialogue participation resulted in statistically significant positive changes in attitudes, feelings, and behaviors. Qualitative data analysis confirmed positive changes as a result of dialogue participation. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Sexual Orientation, Parental Support, and Health During the Transition to Young Adulthood
AN  - 746772403; 20383570
AB  - Some recent studies suggest that sexual minorities may have worse health-related outcomes during adolescence because they report lower levels of family connectedness, a key protective resource. Using data from wave 3 of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n = 11,153; 50.6% female; mean age = 21.8 years), this study extends prior research on adolescents to young adults. We examine whether lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) young adults report lower levels of parental support than their heterosexual peers and whether differences in parental support help explain why LGB young adults tend to have worse health-related outcomes. We find that lesbian and bisexual women report lower levels of parental support than heterosexual women and that gay men report lower levels of parental support than bisexual and heterosexual men. Compared to heterosexual women, lesbian and bisexual women have higher odds of suicidal thoughts and recent drug use; bisexual women also have higher odds of elevated depressive symptomatology and heavy drinking. Gay men have higher odds of suicidal thoughts than heterosexual men. With the exception of heavy drinking, parental support either partially or fully mediates each of the observed associations. Even though the transition from adolescence to young adulthood is characterized by increased independence from parents, parental support remains an important correlate of health-related outcomes during this stage of life. Sexual minorities report lower levels of parental support during young adulthood, which helps explain why they have worse health-related outcomes. Interventions designed to strengthen relationships between LGB young adults and their parents could lead to a reduction in health disparities related to sexual orientation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Intergroup friendships on campus: Predicting close and casual friendships between White and African American first-year college students
AN  - 758124171; 201056728
AB  - Intergroup friendships have been linked to important outcomes such as reduced prejudice, increased empathy for outgroups, and lower intergroup anxiety. However, little is known about the factors facilitating such friendships. This longitudinal study therefore examined factors associated with the development of friendships between White and African American freshmen at a predominantly White university. African American (vs. White) and male (vs. female) students had more intergroup friendships at the end of freshman year. Friendships between African American and White freshmen were also associated with more direct and indirect intergroup contact during high school, less prejudice upon entering college, having an outgroup roommate (White or African American), having any roommate, and having more contact with outgroup members during the academic year.

T1  - Perceived Discrimination and Linguistic Adaptation of Adolescent Children of Immigrants
AN  - 650835262; 20596820
AB  - This study examines the relationship between perceived discrimination and self-reported proficiency in English and non-English languages among adolescent children of immigrants. Data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study was used. The average age of participants was 17.2 years; 1,494 were females and 1,332 were males. Among 2,826 participants, 61% reported Latin American and Caribbean national origin and 39% reported Asian national origin. Findings from probit regression analysis showed that adolescents who felt discriminated against by school peers were more likely to report speaking and reading English less than "very well". On the other hand, adolescents who felt discriminated against by teachers and counselors at school or reported perceived societal discrimination were more likely to report speaking and reading English "very well." The results suggest youth's English, as opposed to non-English language, as the primary venue in which perceived discrimination influences youth's linguistic adaptation. The findings further indicate that the direction and possible mechanisms of this influence vary depending on the source of perceived discrimination. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Prejudice in Schools: Promotion of an Inclusive Culture and Climate
AN  - 1928227078
AB  - Public schools represent the pluralism of American society. Unfortunately, many children experience their public school environment as unwelcoming or even violent. Prejudicial attitudes contribute to problematic intergroup relations in public school settings. Furthermore, teachers are often unprepared to work with the diversity of class, linguistic groups, sexual orientation, and other sociocultural backgrounds that make up the student body in their classrooms. This article discusses theories of prejudice and how they inform an understanding of bullying, conflict, and violence in schools. Evidence-based prejudice reduction approaches are presented that teachers and school administrators can use to improve school culture and climate.

T1  - Being treated differently: Stigma experiences with family, peers, and school staff among adolescents with mental health disorders
AN  - 743043624; 201029562
AB  - Stigma directed at adolescents diagnosed with emotional and behavioral disorders by individuals in their interpersonal network likely undermines their wellbeing, yet little is known about their subjective stigma experiences. In particular, the prospect of diagnosed youth experiencing prejudice and discrimination by family members has not previously been examined. This study examines adolescents' perceptions of being treated 'differently' because of mental health problems by family members, peers, and school staff. Qualitative analysis of narratives from mixed method interviews with 56 adolescents in a mid-western US city demonstrated variation in the perceived extent and nature of stigma and in contextual factors perceived as promoting or protecting from stigmatization, depending on the interpersonal domain. The greatest number of participants experienced stigmatization in relationships with peers (62%); this often led to friendship losses and transitions. Participants reporting no peer stigmatization often reported socializing with others "in the same boat" or concealing problems - methods of avoiding potentially stigmatizing interactions. Close to half (46%) described experiencing stigmatization by family members, which often took the form of unwarranted assumptions, distrust, avoidance, pity, and gossip. About one third (35%) of participants reported stigma perpetrated by school staff, who expressed fear, dislike, avoidance, and under-estimation of their abilities. Fortunately, 22% reported "different" treatment by school staff, but this treatment was interpreted as positive and supportive. Results showed that perceived stigmatization in one domain was associated with perceived stigma in other domains. The results suggest that efforts to combat stigmatization of youth with mental health disorders must help family members, peers, and school staff overcome their inclinations to make negative assumptions and discriminate against these youth.
