T1  - The role of the perceived engagement of the facilitator in a vicarious contact intervention: A school‐based field experiment in three countries
AN  - 2682780689
AB  - Indirect forms of intergroup contact have been shown to reduce prejudice. However, little is known about the factors that can contribute to implementing these methods as interventions in real‐life settings. In this study, we examined whether the students' perception of the facilitator's engagement in carrying out a school‐based vicarious contact intervention affects the effectiveness of the intervention among adolescents in Finland (N = 360), Italy (N = 113), and Slovakia (N = 216). As a result, the participants who perceived the facilitator as highly engaged held more positive intergroup attitudes after the intervention than those perceiving the facilitator less engaged. The results are discussed in relation to social and developmental psychological research on normative influences in adolescence and intergroup contact literature, in which normative support from authorities is considered to contribute to the extent to which contact reduces prejudice. By stressing the role of the facilitator, the results contribute both theoretically and practically to the understanding of the successful implementation of prejudice‐reduction programs.

T1  - Criminal Justice Students’ Perceptions and Awareness of Racism and Discrimination
AN  - 2635446142
AB  - The recent focus on the controversial deaths of minorities at the hands of police officers has led to increased attention on racial bias among the law enforcement community. However, this focus does not extend to criminal justice students. Instead, research examining undergraduates’ racial attitudes focuses on the general student body. In addition to reviewing literature related to criminal justice students’ attitudes toward a variety of criminal justice and social issues, the current study used multiple regression analyses to examine racial and gender differences in a Southwestern University’s criminal justice students’ perceptions of and sensitivity to racism. Findings from the study indicate that male criminal justice students in the sample and White criminal justice students are more likely to have lower perceptions of racism than their female and non-White counterparts, respectively. Additionally, findings for criminal justice students’ sensitivity to racism suggest that White male criminal justice students’ sensitivity to racism only statistically significantly differs from non-White females with White males more likely to be less sensitive than non-White females. Furthermore, the current research provides a benchmark for research related to criminal justice students’ perceptions of racism and discriminatory practices and their attitudes toward minorities. Results, study implications, recommendations, and future research are discussed.

T1  - Personal intergroup contact between different groups of ex‐combatants and civilians: Evidence from a behavioural experiment in Rwanda
AN  - 2654977184
AB  - Although personal intergroup contact is known to predict positive intergroup outcomes, little is known about the kind of positive personal contact that reduces prejudice in real‐world post‐conflict societies. Using a behavioural experiment, the present study examined the effect of face‐to‐face personal contact between three groups of ex‐combatants (national army, former national army and armed group) and civilians with disabilities in Rwanda. A total of 444 participants were randomly assigned to intergroup or intragroup pairs under high and low personalisation conditions, and their person preference, evaluative bias and impressions of contact partners were compared to those who had contact without personalisation. Between ex‐combatants of the national army and civilians, low personalisation generally resulted in better intergroup outcomes than high personalisation or no personalisation. The trend is reversed for personalisation between the three groups of ex‐combatants, who are former adversaries. Implications for personal contact in real‐world post‐conflict societies are discussed.

T1  - Yes, I have a disability. Does it prevent me from being a PE teacher? A qualitative approach from the point of view of future PE teachers and their families
AN  - 2620226349
AB  - Physical Education (PE) teachers are subject to a great deal of social stereotyping. The goal of the study is to analyze the main reasons and motivations of three future PE teachers (two females and one male) with motor disabilities to undertake the profession in the future. Their families and the teachers who have taught them also participate. The disabilities are an arm amputation, severe hip dysmetry and Tourette’s syndrome. These future teachers, under a reflective perspective, expose the reasons and motivations why they want to be PE teachers, specifying diversity of experiences in the past and how they would like to teach the subject in the future. The introduction discusses whether disability fits into the ideal body type of PE, delving into the theories of social identity [Tajfel & Turner, 1979. An integrative theory of intergroup conflict. In W. G. Austin & S. Worchel (Eds.), The social psychology of intergroup relations (pp. 33–47). Brooks- Cole] and social desirability (Paulhus, 2002). A qualitative approach is used in which three categories (established prior to obtaining the results) of analysis are established: (a) Motivations for being a PE teacher; (b) Limitations and obstacles exercised by society; and (c) Professional identity and conception of PE. Interviews with participants and their families, narrative journals and discussion groups are the data collection instruments used. The results show how, despite the fact that the motivation of future teachers is high (want to be physical education teachers above any other profession), the social constraints they face in order to achieve their dream are diverse. These obstacles are manifested in derogatory comments and lack of infrastructure and adapted material to be able to practice. Families and teachers agree that there is still a long way to go to achieve inclusion, especially in the area of PE. This inclusion refers to the acceptance into the subject of all students, regardless of their physical and psychological characteristics. It is essential to continue researching about disability and PE, since it allows breaking down a variety of existing barriers about the beliefs that people with disabilities have about the limitations of teaching the subject.

T1  - Unobtrusive measures of prejudice: Estimating percentages of public beliefs and behaviours
AN  - 2612711883
AB  - This study was concerned with how accurate people are in their knowledge of population norms and statistics concerning such things as the economic, health and religious status of a nation and how those estimates are related to their own demography (e.g age, sex), ideology (political and religious beliefs) and intelligence. Just over 600 adults were asked to make 25 population estimates for Great Britain, including religious (church/mosque attendance) and economic (income, state benefits, car/house ownership) factors as well as estimates like the number of gay people, immigrants, smokers etc. They were reasonably accurate for things like car ownership, criminal record, vegetarianism and voting but seriously overestimated numbers related to minorities such as the prevalence of gay people, muslims and people not born in the UK. Conversely there was a significant underestimation of people receiving state benefits, having a criminal record or a private health insurance. Correlations between select variables and magnitude and absolute accuracy showed religiousness and IQ most significant correlates. Religious people were less, and intelligent people more, accurate in their estimates. A factor analysis of the estimates revealed five interpretable factors. Regressions were calculated onto these factors and showed how these individual differences accounted for as much as 14% of the variance. Implications and limitations are acknowledged.

T1  - Roma undercount and the issue of undeclared ethnicity in the 2011 Romanian census
AN  - 2597935854
AB  - Romania is home to the largest Roma population in Europe. Exactly how large is a matter of intense debate, with estimates ranging between .62 and 1.85 million. The last Romanian census made the ethnic affiliation question unequivocally optional and it counted 1.24 million citizens with undeclared ethnicity, a huge increase from the 1941 cases recorded by the previous census round. Since the Roma are the only ethnic group expected to avoid disclosing ethnic affiliation, previous analyses of this idiosyncratic result attributed it exclusively to Roma discrimination led reticence. The current article corrects this view by analyzing the important role played by a previously ignored methodological change (i.e. recording as ‘undeclared’ the temporary absent citizens for whom their neighbors could not provide any information about ethnic affiliation) and revealing that lack of information about neighbors played a dominant role in urban municipalities.

T1  - ‘Swamped by Muslims’ and facing an ‘African gang’ problem: racialized and religious media representations in Australia: Journal of Media & Cultural Studies
AN  - 2574124522
AB  - Despite the implementation of multicultural policies since the 1970s, anxiety over cultural and religious ‘others’ continue to challenge Australia’s diversifying national identity. Problematic media representations of racial and religious minorities persist in Australia and continue to shape public perceptions and political discourses on issues of migration and intercultural relations. This paper examines how Muslims and Africans are contemporary scapegoats of Australian anxieties. These fears continue to be present in racialized rhetoric and attacks on Chinese Australians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Applying discourse analysis on two recent case studies as illustrative examples – the 2018 Bourke Street attack and the so-called ‘African gangs’ – this paper argues that despite substantial research and critique, mainstream media continue to rely on familiar and problematic tropes for framing racial and religious minorities that dehumanize them based on essentialized characteristics of crime, violence and anti-social behaviour. These characteristics tend to be exploited for political gain, with Muslims and Africans portrayed as a disruption to social cohesion and national security. A critique of the role of media and political discourses is presented, as they remain critical instruments in the pursuit of a new ethics of openness, respect and mutual understanding, which are fundamental to living well with difference.

T1  - The Migrant Other: Exclusion without Nationalism?
AN  - 2521956804
AB  - Migrants are an easy, visible Other, seeming to fall neatly into the us-versus-them framework of nationalism. Nevertheless, much of the scholarly approach to migrant identity, with the partial exception of a largely separate literature on citizenship, has eschewed overt ties to nationalism studies. When us-versus-them language is used in relation to nationalism, the focus or nodal point is the identity of the seemingly homogenous “us” of the nation. However, when migrants are othered, the focus is not always the nation, and while othering migrants always creates exclusion, it is not always exclusion from a nation or identity group. This state of the field article analyzes the literature on populism, securitization, biopolitics, and other critical scholarship related to the issue of othering migrants. In each of these bodies of work, different sets of “us” are set against migrants, some of which evoke identity and others of which do not, elucidating the links (or the lack thereof) of each approach to the study of nationalism. In each of these frameworks, the migrant Other comes up against a different frame of reference, leaving migrants themselves (or any sense of migrant identity) somewhat lost amid the analytical frameworks, at continual risk of being re-othered as victims of circumstance without agency.

T1  - Personality traits and public support of minority rights
AN  - 2487091864
AB  - This study investigates how personality relates to citizens’ willingness to extend political, social, and cultural rights for minorities, including voting rights for immigrants, religious rights for Muslims, and affirmative action measures. Moving beyond explanations centred on intergroup relations, we argue that political efficacy (i.e. beliefs about personal political competences and the responsiveness of political elites) operates as a mechanism linking personality and policy preferences on minority rights. We test these arguments using mediation models on data from a large-N survey conducted in Germany in 2016. Results show that high openness, high agreeableness, and low conscientiousness predict permissive views on minority rights. In addition to indirect effects via group-specific attitudes, we find empirical support for substantial links via political efficacy. In particular, people high in conscientiousness or high in neuroticism have lower faith in government responsiveness, which in turn is related to less willingness to approve minority rights.

T1  - Phubbing and Social Intelligence: Role-Playing Experiment on Bystander Inaccessibility
AN  - 2580969316
AB  - Smartphone use has changed patterns of online and offline interaction. Phubbing (i.e., looking at one’s phone instead of paying attention to others) is an increasingly recognized phenomenon in offline interaction. We examined whether people who phub are more likely to have lower social intelligence, whether phubbing is considered more annoying than being ignored due to reading a magazine, and if people describe smartphones and magazines differently as sources of social distraction. We collected two survey samples (N = 112, N = 108) for a cartoon-based role-playing experiment (the Bystander Inaccessibility Experiment) in which a smartphone user and a person reading a magazine ignored the respondents’ conversational initiatives. Annoyance in each scenario was measured, and written accounts were collected on why the respondents rated the scenarios the way they did. Other measures used included the Generic Scale of Phubbing, Generic Scale of Being Phubbed, and Tromsø Social Intelligence Scale. The results showed that participants in both samples were more annoyed by phubbing than by being ignored due to reading a magazine. Linear regression analyses showed that phubbing was associated with lower social intelligence, even after adjusting for confounding factors. The annoyingness of phubbing was explained with negative attitudes toward smartphones, which were assumed to be used for useless endeavors, while magazines were more appreciated and seen as more cultivating. The role of bystanders’ epistemic access to the smartphone user’s activities is discussed.

T1  - Intergroup Dialogues in the Landscape of Digital Societies: How Does the Dialogical Self Affect Intercultural Relations in Online Contexts?
AN  - 2576497584
AB  - The effects of intergroup dialogues on intercultural relations in digital societies and the growing conflict, inflammatory and hate speech phenomena characterizing these environments are receiving increasing attention in socio-psychological studies. Based on Allport’s contact theory, scholars have shown that online intercultural contact reduces ethnic prejudice and discrimination, although it is not yet clear when and how this occurs. By analyzing the role of the Dialogical Self in online intercultural dialogues, we aim to understand how individuals position themselves and others at three levels of inclusiveness—personal, social, and human—and how this process is associated with attitudes towards the interlocutor, intergroup bias and prejudice, whilst also considering the inclusion of the Other in the Self and ethnic/racial identity. An experimental procedure was administered via the Qualtrics platform, and data were collected among 118 undergraduate Italian students through an anonymous questionnaire. From ANOVA and moderation analysis, it emerged that the social level of inclusiveness was positively associated with ethnic/racial identity and intergroup bias. Furthermore, the human level of inclusiveness was associated with the inclusion of the Other in the Self and ethnic/racial identity, and unexpectedly, also with intergroup bias. We conclude that when people interact online as “human beings”, the positive effect of online dialogue fails, hindering the differentiation processes necessary to define one’s own and the interlocutor’s identities. We discuss the effects of intercultural dialogue in the landscape of digital societies and the relevance of our findings for theory, research and practice.

TT  - Situating Legal Consciousness: Experiences and Attitudes of Ordinary Citizens about Law and Street Harassment
AN  - 2519433257
AB  - La conscience du droit des citoyens ordinaires face aux propos publics offensants et à leur régulation juridique est une question qui a fait l'objet de vifs débats, mais qui a été peu analysée par des études empiriques. À partir d'observations effectuées dans les espaces publics de trois collectivités du nord de la Californie et d'entretiens approfondis avec 100 sujets recrutés dans ces lieux, nous analysons, en fonction de la race et du genre, les différences dans les expériences vécues en matière de propos publics offensants et dans les opinions exprimées sur la manière dont ils devraient être traités par le droit. Parmi les personnes interrogées, les femmes blanches et les personnes de couleur sont beaucoup plus nombreuses que les hommes blancs à déclarer être la cible de propos publics offensants. Cependant, les femmes blanches et les personnes de couleur ne sont pas significativement plus favorables que les hommes blancs à leur prise en charge par le droit. Les personnes interrogées se prononcent majoritairement contre la pénalisation des propos publics offensants, mais tiennent des discours différents pour motiver cette opposition. Les mots utilisés par les sujets eux-mêmes font ressortir quatre paradigmes relativement distincts qui mettent l'accent respectivement sur la liberté d'expression, l'autonomie, l'impraticabilité et la défiance vis-à-vis des autorités. Les discours mobilisés tendent à varier en fonction du groupe racial et du genre. Ces différences semblent indiquer que la conscience du droit des citoyens ordinaires n'est pas un phénomène unitaire, mais qu'elle est plutôt située en fonction des types de lois, des hiérarchies sociales et des rapports au droit des différents groupes.Alternate abstract:The legal consciousness of ordinary citizens concerning offensive public speech is a phenomenon whose legal status has been vigorously debated, but which has received little empirical analysis. Drawing on observations in public spaces in three northern California communities and in-depth interviews with 100 subjects recruited from these public locations, I analyze variation across race and gender groups in experiences with offensive public speech and attitudes about how such speech should be dealt with by law. Among these respondents, white women and people of color are far more likely than white men to report being the targets of offensive public speech. However, white women and people of color are not significantly more likely than white men to favor its legal regulation. Respondents generally oppose the legal regulation of offensive public speech, but they employ different discourses to explain why. Subjects' own words suggest four relatively distinct paradigms that emphasize the First Amendment, autonomy, impracticality, and distrust of authority. Members of different racial and gender groups tend to use different discourses. These differences suggest that the legal consciousness of ordinary citizens is not a unitary phenomenon, but must be situated in relation to particular types of laws, particular social hierarchies, and the experiences of different groups with the law.

T1  - The Effect of Affect: Friendship, Education and Prejudice in India
AN  - 2468581251
AB  - Intergroup relations are fundamentally based on the idea of ‘us’ and ‘them’, and this categorization has driven political loyalties and social ties in India, particularly the relations between Hindus and Muslims. Contemporary nationalist politics have often combined patriotic love for the country along with suspicion of minorities, particularly the Muslims. Given the history of tense relations between the Hindus and Muslims, the role of positive intergroup relations becomes paramount in sustaining peace among the groups. Based on Allport’s intergroup contact hypothesis, this article tests whether having a Muslim friend reduces prejudicial attitude among Hindus. Additionally, the article also tests the notion of education being a harbinger of liberal values and its role in reducing prejudice. The results indicate that having a Muslim friend is significantly correlated with a more positive outlook towards the Muslim community, but education does not reduce prejudice.

T1  - Imagined contact with strongly identified outgroup members: Do religious trappings make the man?
AN  - 2460549178
AB  - This research examined the interactive effects of imagined contact and the characteristics of the imagined person on intergroup anxiety and prejudice, among two groups in Israel: Jewish majority and Arab‐Muslim minority. In total, 128 Jewish and 128 Arab‐Muslim participants were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions. They were exposed to an outgroup person wearing either casual clothing or religious‐ethnic trappings. Then they were required to imagine either a pleasant conversation with that person at a cafeteria or a pleasant hike in which the outgroup person was just seen strolling around. Finally, participants filled out questionnaires of intergroup anxiety and prejudice. For Jewish participants in the hiking conditions, higher intergroup anxiety was found after imagining a strongly identified outgroup person rather than a weakly identified person. This effect was eliminated after imagining a pleasant conversation with the outgroup member in the cafeteria conditions. In addition, Jewish participants reported more outgroup prejudice following imagined scenarios which included the strongly identified person compared to scenarios involving the weakly identified person. For Arab‐Muslim participants, however, no effects were found. This study highlights the importance of considering the characteristics of outgroup counterparts in the field of imagined contact. Furthermore, the implications of imagined contact with individuals wearing religious‐ethnic trappings are discussed.

T1  - Islamist Terrorism, Out-Group Trust, and Motivation to Control Prejudice
AN  - 2476554908
AB  - Using Norwegian survey experiments (N = 1,541), we examined the relationship between Islamist terrorist threats and trust in out-groups, focusing on how this relationship was conditioned by the “motivation to control prejudice” (MCP) and emotions of anxiety. After exposure to a news story describing an Islamist threat scenario, the treatment group reported higher levels of trust in out-groups than the control group. High levels of MCP were linked to higher levels of trust; anxiety played an ambiguous role. Although anxiety had a strong negative effect on trust in out-groups, the positive effect of MCP increased with rising anxiety levels, thus making the people who were most scared also more trusting. Activation of social norms may, thus, bolster distrust.

T1  - “It just feels right”: Perceptions of the effects of community connectedness among trans individuals
AN  - 2448621170
AB  - Trans individuals (e.g. trans men and women, non-binary, gender fluid) are at higher risk for mental health concerns, in part due to marginalization. Previous work has documented the effects of social support and community engagement on health outcomes. However, individuals’ perceptions of community engagement effects may point to opportunities for intervention. This mixed methods study examines trans individuals’ perceived effects of participating in trans communities on health outcomes. Semi-structured in-person interviews were conducted with 20 individuals, and 60 individuals participated in cross-sectional online surveys. Perceived discrimination had a strong negative association with self-assessed mental health. Effects of participation included a) positive: contextualization and normalization of experience, self-appraisal, safety, and relief; and b) neutral/negative: energy drain and stigmatization. Effects of not participating included loneliness, depression, isolation, hiding identity, and losing resources. Both discrimination and non-participation in trans communities had negative effects on mental health. Though community participation is often discussed as positive for marginalized populations, it may be important to include possible negative effects (such as energy drain) in research.

T1  - Superficial ingroup love? Collective narcissism predicts ingroup image defense, outgroup prejudice, and lower ingroup loyalty
AN  - 2448123183
AB  - We examined the associations between the need for personal control, different types of ingroup commitment, and group‐related outcomes: (1) defensive responses to ingroup criticism, (2) ingroup disloyalty, and (3) outgroup attitudes. We assumed that collective narcissism (i.e., a belief in ingroup’s greatness which is contingent on external validation and stems from frustrated individual needs) should be concerned with defending the ingroup image and derogating outgroups, but not necessarily with being loyal to the ingroup. Secure ingroup identification (i.e., a confidently held ingroup evaluation, which stems from satisfied needs), in contrast, should predict greater ingroup loyalty and positive outgroup attitudes. We expected these effects to be especially strong once we account for the overlap between collective narcissism and group‐level self‐investment – a key component of ingroup identification. In a nationally representative sample of Polish adults (n = 1,007), collective narcissism (net of group‐level self‐investment) mediated between low personal control and ingroup image defense, lower group loyalty, and less positive outgroup attitudes. Secure ingroup identification (group‐level self‐investment net of collective narcissism) mediated between high personal control and ingroup loyalty and positive outgroup attitudes. It was not associated with ingroup image defense. Implications for understanding the role of identification in inter‐ and intra‐group relations are discussed.

T1  - Saudi Female EFL Learners and Collaborative Writing: Attitudes and Challenges
AN  - 2441885002
AB  - Writing skills are important skills that must be learned to express one's thoughts and ideas. Therefore, several strategies were used in writing classes to enhance learners' writing skills, one of which is collaborative writing. A number of studies reported many advantages for this strategy in terms of the quality of the produced texts and the improvements in students' writing skills. The present study aimed at investigating the attitude of Saudi female EFL learners toward collaborative writing and the challenges/problems that may arise during the activity. It adopted a quantitative approach in which 50 Saudi female EFL learners answered a questionnaire about their experience in writing collaboratively and the problems they encountered during the activity. The findings have shown that the learners have a positive attitude toward collaborative writing. However, there were some problems in terms of students' behavior, assessment and time management. These findings encourage writing teachers to use this strategy in their classes. In addition, the findings encourage teachers and researchers to address the problems reported in the study.

T1  - Do immigrant-origin candidates attract immigrant-origin voters in party-centred electoral systems? Evidence from Germany
AN  - 2411270326
AB  - A burgeoning literature on minority representation asks whether immigrant-origin voters are more likely to vote for candidates of immigrant-origin (CIOs) than for native candidates, thus giving parties incentives to nominate CIOs. At present, however, evidence of such a link comes exclusively from candidate-centred electoral systems. The present study intends to narrow this gap by examining the influence of CIOs on the voting behaviour of immigrant-origin citizens in Germany, a more party-centred electoral environment. An empirical analysis of opinion survey and candidate data from the 2013 Bundestag election suggests that the electoral link between voters and CIOs is considerable. This paper is thus the first one to show that CIOs are a significant factor for the electoral mobilisation of immigrant-origin citizens in a party-centred electoral system.

T1  - Fluidity, Phenotype and Afro-Latin Group Consciousness
AN  - 2408452248
AB  - Racial fluidity and mixed phenotype have been posited as critical barriers to politicized black identity in the region. Using an original, survey experiment in Panama, this paper finds that racial fluidity and phenotype significantly affect who identifies as black, but have relatively little impact on the strength of measures of black group consciousness. Rather than reducing the strength of group consciousness all together, racial fluidity and phenotype influence the salience of different measures of group consciousness. Afro-Panamanians with phenotypic features that stably predict black self-identification express stronger beliefs that racial discrimination is a problem in Panama (perceived discrimination) and greater dissatisfaction with the social standing of their in-group (polar power). In contrast, Afro-Panamanians with mixed phenotypic features express stronger in-group affect (pride), stronger belief in the efficacy of black collective mobilization (collective efficacy), and stronger linked fate.

T1  - Toward the use of approach/avoidance tendencies as attitude measures: Individual‐ and group‐level variability of the ingroup bias
AN  - 2408791012
AB  - Approach/avoidance paradigms could constitute an interesting alternative in measuring intergroup attitudes, notably if they overcome one criticism often addressed toward classic indirect tasks: Measuring attitudes beyond the influence of cultural knowledge. Using intergroup stimuli and a population likely to be exposed to a similar cultural knowledge, we observed two informative results regarding this issue: Approach/avoidance effects measured by the Visual Approach/Avoidance by the Self Task (VAAST) varied across participants (i.e., consistent with the variability of intergroup attitudes; Experiment 1) and both participants of dominant and non‐dominant groups produced an ingroup bias (Experiment 2). A last experiment (Experiment 3) showed that compatibility scores in the VAAST predict trustworthiness ratings of the ingroup/outgroup. This experiment also investigated potential differences between the VAAST and the IAT. These results suggest that approach/avoidance tasks (notably the VAAST) could be relevant to assess personal attitudes when it comes to normatively sensitive topics.

T1  - Attitudes and Beliefs of Italian Educators and Teachers Regarding Children Raised by Same-Sex Parents
AN  - 2188816958
AB  - Teachers and educators represent meaningful relationships for children, and their attitudes can have a major influence on a child’s development. This research examined the role of background characteristics, contact experiences, and sexual prejudice in determining beliefs about children’s adjustment in same-sex parent families. The sample consisted of 323 Italian teachers and educators working in nursery schools, kindergartens, and primary schools. The Scale on Beliefs about Children’s Adjustment in Same-Sex Families was used to assess adults’ beliefs about negative impacts on children raised in same-sex parent families. Hierarchical multiple regression was used to test the association between individual and normative opposition to same-sex parenting and background information, political and religious orientation, contact experiences, sexual prejudice, and beliefs about same-sex couples’ parenting abilities. Sexual prejudice, religious involvement, and negative beliefs about two-father couples emerged as strong predictors of individual and normative opposition to same-sex parenting, whereas political orientation and negative beliefs about two-mother couples predicted only the individual form of opposition. Empirical data are essential in understanding the level of prejudice and discrimination in schools in order to provide policies and programs designed to improve knowledge and competencies to deal with same-sex parent families and their children.

T1  - “A Golly was simply a toy. End of”: Inoculation, attention deflection, and attempted puzzle‐resolution in contesting racism in online discussions
AN  - 2384449210
AB  - In producing arguments against minority groups that are designed to avoid accusations of prejudice, speakers routinely deploy two discursive strategies. One strategy of “inoculation” seeks to ward off such accusations, while the other strategy of “attention deflection” directs attention away from the potential target group. Where despite use of one or both strategies accusations arise, the result is a puzzle that needs to be resolved through explanation. Here, in a discourse analysis of online discussions as to whether “blacking up” is to count as racism, we see contributors contest (a) whether absence of intention to offend inoculates individuals from accountability for potentially racist actions, (b) whether “blacking up” depicts toys/characters rather than people, and (c) whether attempted explanations of accusations of racism work to resolve the apparent puzzle that has arisen. Contributors do not reach any consensus. These findings point to the difficulties in attempting to challenge potential racism.

T1  - Perceived discrimination is associated with poorer health and well‐being outcomes among Pacific peoples in New Zealand
AN  - 2381932385
AB  - Our study investigated the association between perceived discrimination and outcomes related to health and well‐being for Pacific adults in New Zealand. We examined personal and group discrimination from the 2013 wave of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (n = 429 women and 196 men). Personal discrimination was associated with poorer health and well‐being outcomes (higher psychological distress and lower self‐esteem, subjective evaluation of health, satisfaction with life and personal well‐being). Group discrimination, in contrast, was associated with poorer well‐being but not health outcomes (lower subjective evaluation of health and personal well‐being). These findings corroborate previous research and highlight the corrosive effect of discrimination towards health and well‐being among Pacific communities in New Zealand.

T1  - Toleration and prejudice‐reduction: Two ways of improving intergroup relations
AN  - 2369759945
AB  - While a large body of social psychological research has shed light on the nature of prejudice and how to reduce it, we argue that such work does not address situations of cultural or religious outgroup beliefs and practices that are considered incompatible with one's own. The present theoretical article contrasts a prejudice‐reduction approach with a toleration‐based approach to consider the differences each have with regard to the attitude object they focus upon, the perceived reasonableness of the attitude, and the behavioral consequences each may lead to. In doing so, we consider the psychological processes involved in whether the negative attitude leads to negative actions. We conclude by arguing that a toleration‐based approach forms an important addition to the psychological thinking about cultural diversity and intergroup relations. Collectively, the present work makes a novel contribution to the social psychological literature by stimulating theory development and raising novel questions for empirical research.

T1  - Cross-cultural and Interracial Fostering in South Africa: Challenges Faced By Non-relative Foster Parents
AN  - 2583617482
AB  - In South Africa, racial prejudices and cultural insensitivity affect and define relationships. These social forces constitute enormous challenges and present immense barriers to non-relative child fostering and protection. This paper reports findings of a doctoral study that adopted a qualitative approach to explore the experiences offoster parents caring for non-relative foster children in De Deur, Gauteng Province, South Africa. A sample of 20 non-relative foster parents who fostered children from another cultural or racial group was purposively selectedfrom the caseload of Vereeniging Child and Family Welfare Society, De Deur satellite office. Data was collected using in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Thematic analysis was used for data analysis. The findings indicated that the foster parents experienced stigmatisation and discrimination; undue external interference; rejection and isolation and care scrutiny and suspicion. The study concluded that negative public perceptions and attitudes towards non-relative foster parents are pervasive. They have not been properly dealt with in the South African context and undermine the concept of'Ubuntu'. These could result in resentment and hamper relationship building between foster parents and foster children. Deliberate positive government policy intervention and social engineering is recommended for attitude and behaviour change in this regard.

T1  - The Effect of Imagined Intergroup Contact and Need for Closure on Attitudes Toward Bisexuality
AN  - 2381946998
AB  - Bisexual individuals face more negative mental health outcomes than members of both homosexual and heterosexual populations. However, there is little experimental research concerned with the reduction of binegativity. 136 participants were assigned to one of two experimental conditions or two control conditions. The experimental groups read a vignette that depicted a positive interaction with a bisexual individual, while the control groups received a similar vignette where the sexuality of the individual was not made salient. Each group completed a questionnaire regarding attitudes toward bisexuality, need for closure, and a demographic survey. A significant main effect of condition on both the tolerance and stability subscales of the ARBS-FM (F(1,114)=10.796, p<.001), (F(1,114)=3.963, p<.049) was found. The effect sizes for tolerance and stability were r2=.147 and r2=.107, respectively. Need for closure did not correlate with either subscales. Implications of these results are discussed.

T1  - The sociality of personal and collective nostalgia
AN  - 2381946208
AB  - Nostalgia, a sentimental longing for the past, is an ambivalent – albeit more positive than negative – emotion. Nostalgia is infused with sociality, as it refers to important figures from one’s past or to momentous life events that include those figures. Dispositional nostalgia is related to prejudice reduction via increases in a form of sociality, empathy. Experimentally induced nostalgia fosters sociality, operationalised as social connectedness (sense of acceptance). Social connectedness, in turn, has downstream consequences for (1) inspiration and goal-pursuit, (2) self-continuity and wellbeing, as well as (3) inclusion of an outgroup member in the self or outgroup trust and intergroup contact intentions. At the collective level, nostalgia confers sociality benefits to the ingroup (favourable attitudes, support, loyalty, collective action, barrier to collective guilt), but is also associated with negative sides of sociality such as outgroup rejection and exclusion. Collective nostalgia’s sociality is amenable to exploitation and can have controversial ramifications.

T1  - When prejudice against you hurts others and me: The case of ageism at work
AN  - 2312955844
AB  - Ageism in the workplace has documented detrimental consequences for its victims, but its effects on those who hold ageist views are rarely investigated. A cross‐sectional study and a longitudinal study examined ageism toward both younger and older workers and its relation to intergroup contact, work behaviors, organizational identification, and the well‐being of prejudiced individuals. It was hypothesized that ageism would predict prejudiced individuals’ behaviors toward co‐workers, identification with their organization, and vitality at work, indirectly through intergroup anxiety and quality of intergroup contact. Overall, 647 employees aged 24–62 years provided data on the variables of interest. Both studies suggested that ageist views worsened the quality of intergroup contact, which in turn increased counterproductive behaviors toward co‐workers and decreased identification with the organization. Moreover, ageism marginally predicted vitality at work longitudinally through the mediation of quality of intergroup contact. No support emerged for the mediational role of intergroup anxiety. Theoretical explanations for these findings and their practical implications are discussed.

T1  - Parenting Attitudes and Public Support for Political Authoritarianism in Latin America
AN  - 2432396873
AB  - Despite nearly three decades of democratic rule throughout the Latin American region, public support for authoritarian norms has persisted. These “pockets of authoritarianism” can bolster support for policies and practices that weaken democratic governance, such as allowing authorities to abuse power. We examine why some Latin Americans endorse nondemocratic governance options by testing the predictive power of a psychological measure of authoritarianism, operationalized as support for particular child-rearing practices. We find that this psychological variable explains support for several nondemocratic governance options in the region: presidential limits on the opposition, iron-fist policies, torture of suspected criminals, and a military coup. Authoritarian parenting attitudes are also correlated with perceptions that political minorities threaten the country and lower support for democracy.

T1  - A minority within a minority?: the complexity and multilocality of transnational Twelver Shia networks in Britain
AN  - 2131037256
AB  - Academic scholarship on Shia Muslim minorities in the West has described them as ‘a minority within a minority’ (Sachedina 1994: 3) or as ‘the other within the other’ (Takim 2009: 143), referring to a certain sense of double-marginalization of Shia Muslims in non-Muslim societal contexts. They need to undertake particular efforts to maintain both an Islamic as well as particular Shia identity in terms of communal activities and practices and public perception and recognition, responding to the rise of Islamophobia more generally and anti-Shia sectarianism more specifically. This article problematizes this notion of a double-marginalization of Shia minorities in the West as too simplistic. The article investigates the dynamics around the creation of transnational Shia communal spaces in north-west London, the public representation of Shia Muslim identities by networks and organizations based there to illustrate their multilocal connectivities and internal heterogeneity. The article is based on research in the borough of Brent, north-west London, and presents novel insights into Shia spaces in Britain and thereby makes an important contribution to complexifying academic discourse on Muslims in Britain which has focussed on Sunni Muslims almost exclusively. The ethnographic data is contextualized by providing background information on the historical and social formations of the networks and the centres examined in the article. To analyze the multilocal spatial manifestations and connections of these network, the article utilizes Werbner’s notion of ‘complex diasporas’ (2002, 2004, 2010) and recent contributions to the development of a spatial methodology in Religious Studies (Knott 2005; Vásquez 2010; Tweed 2006; McLoughlin and Zavos 2014). The article thereby constitutes the very first attempt to apply recent contributions on the nature of diasporic religions and their spatial multilocality to the case study of Twelver Shia networks based in London.

AB  - This study investigated the relationship between interminority contact and solidarity underconflict. The analysis of representative samples of Hungarian (N = 604) and Roma (N = 602) ethnics from Romania revealed restricted positivity among the high-status minority (i.e., positive associations of interminority contact with outgroup attitudes and support for nonspecific pro-outgroup policies, but negative associations with support for tangible actions helping the outgroup) and toxic positivity among the low-status minority (i.e., improved attitudes toward the Hungarians but decreased support for specific pro-ingroup policies). Moreover, for both minority groups, contact with the majority was associated with diminished support for specific pro-ingroup and pro-outgroup policies.

T1  - Social Desirability Bias among Prejudice Instruments: An Integrated Threat
AN  - 2334197657
AB  - A considerable amount of research has examined the extent to which members of dominant cultures perceive minority groups as threatening their way of life. While various instruments measure these perceptions of threat, few researchers have empirically analysed the statistical properties of these scales. Specifically, studies have not adequately explored social desirability of threat scales. The current study investigates the extent to which one set of threat scales is internally consistent or reliable (González et al., 2008), and explores social desirability within the González et al. (2008) integrated threat instruments by comparing self-reports to other reports (intimate other and friend reports). Results indicate the instruments are internally consistent and that self-reports and other reports of threat do not differ on most indices of threat.

T1  - "There's a difference between Black people and n******": A cultural contracts exploration of interracial communication barriers
AN  - 2238258486
AB  - Fear, prejudice, and racism create communication barriers between Black and White individuals which complicates interracial communication (Hopson, 2011). This qualitative, interpretive analysis is framed by cultural contracts theory (Jackson, 2002, 2009) and informed by 31 interviews with White participants as co-researchers. Thematic analysis (Braun & Clark, 2006; Owen, 1984) revealed White interviewees held ready-to-sign cultural contracts about Black community members, with no room for (re)negotiation. Specifically, interview narratives exposed the follow dominant group members' fears: having an affinity for or against particular types of Black people; fearing predominantly Black geographic locations; preferring not to be the only White person in the room; the belief that Black people are responsible for White's pejorative ascriptions about them, and the claim that Black people hinder themselves.

T1  - Understanding Appalachian Microaggression from the Perspective of Community College Students in Southern West Virginia
AN  - 2339037811
AB  - The term "Appalachian" is wrongly understood to represent a single culture of rural White poverty (Keefe, 2005). This conception contains stereotypical images that obscure hardships many rural White Central Appalachians face. Similar to other oppressed minorities in the U.S., what it means to be Appalachian is a social construction based on what differs them from the White hegemony. Recent scholarship on discrimination recognizes the importance of microaggression, small insults and slights experienced frequently by people from minority groups (Sue, et. al., 2007). Microaggression may be an especially insidious mechanism in the oppression of Appalachian people, since the derogatory stereotypes are broadly accepted while their oppressed status tends to not be acknowledged. This study applied qualitative focus group methodology to understand perceptions of microaggression and oppression among a sample of college students living in rural Central Appalachia. Results reveal themes of microaggression. Identifying Appalachian microaggression provides evidence of marginalized status and offers a framework for understanding how the social construction of White Appalachian perpetuates reduced status, stereotypes, and prejudice. Implications are discussed to consider how to foster resilience to oppression among rural White Central Appalachian people.

T1  - When friendship is stronger than prejudice. Role of intergroup friendships among adolescents in two distinct socio-cultural contexts of immigration
AN  - 2230253866
AB  - Despite the structural characteristics of international migration in most European countries, the persistence of prejudice and negative attitudes towards immigrants represents an unsolved problem that erodes social cohesion. European institutions continue to be concerned about the spread of xenophobia, especially among young generations. This article aims to shed light on the crucial role of intergroup friendships, considered a key factor in reducing the hostility toward immigrant groups. In particular, the aim is to verify the effects of intergroup friendships on prejudice, using data derived from an international survey carried out in France and Italy, two emblematic European countries as regarding the experience of international migration. 1,642 French and Italian adolescents, selected by a rationale choice sample, were involved: multivariate analysis confirmed the hypothesis that adolescents who hold intergroup friendships show lower levels of prejudice. The influence of the intergroup friendships on the decrease of intolerance is evident especially on socioeconomic and security issues while for the identity matters its effects are moderated by the country of residence of the participants. Considering these results, positive contacts among local and immigrant populations are recommended in order to reduce social fragmentation and foster social cohesion.

T1  - Respect and political disagreement: Can intergroup respect reduce the biased evaluation of outgroup arguments?
AN  - 2199461071
AB  - Past research indicates that in political debates the same arguments are judged very differently depending on the perceiver’s own position on the issue, because positions on controversial issues are often tied to collective identities. In this article, we test the assumption that equality-based respect from an opposing opinion-based group can reduce such biases. Results confirmed that identification as an opponent or proponent of a contested issue was negatively related to evaluations of outgroup arguments (Study 1) and that this negative link was no longer significant when intergroup respect was experimentally induced (Study 2). Results support the notion that disagreements over political issues are intergroup conflicts, in which different socio-political groups struggle for recognition, and that approaches that protect collective identities and improve intergroup relations should be employed to de-escalate them.

T1  - Using Media Literacy to Counter Stereotypical Images of Blacks and Latinos at a Predominantly White University
AN  - 2206009096
AB  - Media literacy, the critical analysis and deconstruction of media messages, has the potential to promote favorable attitudes toward members of racial minority groups. This study reports on the development and implementation of two types of media literacy interventions (i.e., critical and stereotype) aimed at enhancing college students' attitudes toward Blacks and Latinos. Students from 5 sections of the same course took part in a quasi-experiment and were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 interventions or to a control group. Students' attitudes were measured at 3 different times during the study: 6 weeks before the intervention, immediately following the intervention, and 6 weeks after the intervention. Both interventions enhanced students' attitudes toward Blacks and Latinos but the stereotype intervention was more effective than the critical one, both for short- and long-term effects, as the latter disappeared in the critical condition. Attitudes of students in the control group remained the same throughout the study. Implications address how to use media literacy to enhance conversation about race relations.

T1  - Black Female Pilot Communicative Experiences: Applications and Extensions of Co-Cultural Theory
AN  - 2206006412
AB  - The study investigates the ways in which Black female pilots experience and manage their elite status as airline transport pilots (ATPs) and as co-cultural group members. Accordingly, Orbe's (1998b) co-cultural theory is used as a frame to understand how women of color negotiate workplaces where White male cultural norms are omnipresent. Using a phenomenological approach, the communicative lived experiences of two Black female ATPs are analyzed to reveal specific co-cultural communication practices enacted. The study is offered here as a testament to engaged research-that which advances theory (i.e., extending co-cultural theorizing in a new setting) and provides pragmatic insight into important contemporary issues (i.e., increased diversity in a historically White male profession).

AN  - 2430088094
AB  - This study investigates the indirect effect of political identity salience on voting intention through in-group-out-group difference in the perceived influence of polling reports. A moderated mediation model in which political identity salience is linked to voting intention through group difference of perceived influence of polling reports only for supporters of a losing candidate was established. To test the model, a survey experiment using a nationally representative sample of general voters was conducted before the 2012 presidential election in South Korea (N = 523). Results of the conditional process analysis show that the moderated mediation is statistically significant. Implications of the findings are discussed.

T1  - Public health as an agent of internal colonialism in interwar Czechoslovakia: shaping the discourse about the nation's children
AN  - 2081349434
AB  - Shmidt's text discusses the specifics of internal colonialism in the discourses and practices of the dominant group (Czechs) concerning Slovaks and Rusyns, ethnic groups from the peripheral, eastern areas of interwar Czechoslovakia. By targeting the reproductive patterns of these groups, seen as undesirable by the authorities, internal colonialism shaped the discourse about children by consistently opposing the normalized childhood inside the nation to the supposedly abnormal child development outside the civilizing process. Shmidt focuses on three interwar projects aimed at introducing new public health practices as an 'infrastructure of dependence' with regard to the peripheral groups. Being directly supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, these projects contributed to building the new Czechoslovak nation and securing its international legitimacy.

T1  - Ethnic solidarity and the vote: Mapuche candidates and voters in Chile
AN  - 2071272714
AB  - In this article, we evaluate ethnic solidarity and the vote in Chile with reference to the Mapuche, the largest and most traditional ethnic group in the country. We use electoral data from the mayoral elections of 2012, drawn from all the municipalities of the Araucanía, the region with the largest percentage of Mapuche population. Using a multi-level linear regression model and controlling for poverty and rurality, we found that Mapuche candidates, regardless of their political orientation, were indeed more successful than non-Mapuche candidates in areas with the greatest concentration of Mapuche voters. Additionally, we used results from an unpublished opinion survey conducted in three municipalities of the Araucanía. We concluded that after controlling for other variables ethnic solidarity prevails as a robust predictor of electoral behaviour, albeit more strongly in rural areas than urban ones. The Chilean case, moreover, is useful for studying the strategies used by the traditional parties that promote this solidarity - that is, by presenting candidates with Mapuche surnames in their lists.

T1  - Reducing gender identity bias through imagined intergroup contact
AN  - 2091600939
AB  - Transgender individuals face high levels of stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination, and violence. However, there is a paucity of research (particularly experimental work) investigating the magnitude of gender identity bias (GIB) targeting transgender individuals, as well as interventions designed to ameliorate it. To address this gap, we conducted experimental investigations of reactions to identical, highly qualified men or women job applicants described as either transgender or cisgender (Experiments 1a, 1b), and tested the efficacy of an imagined intergroup contact (IIC) intervention (relative to a control condition) in ameliorating GIB against transgender women (Experiment 2). As expected, all applicants were perceived as equally highly competent, adding to the literature suggesting that clearly demonstrating excellent qualifications can prevent biased judgments of candidate competence. However, revealing GIB, transgender men and women were rated as less likeable and hirable than the identical cisgender applicants, despite the fact that they were viewed as equally competent (Experiments 1a, 1b). Providing additional evidence of GIB, in the absence of IIC, participants rated a transgender female applicant as less likeable and hirable than the identical cisgender applicant, and also reported less self‐other overlap and perspective taking for the transgender applicant (Experiment 2). However, these target gender identity differences were reduced (for likeability) or fully eliminated (for the remaining outcomes) in the IIC condition. Put another way, while reactions to the cisgender applicant were unaffected by intervention condition, IIC elevated perceptions of the transgender applicant, suggesting that it may function as an effective GIB intervention.

T1  - Converging or Diverging: Shifting Ethnoracial Composition and the Urban-suburban Distinction in Attitudes toward Immigrants in Houston, 1995–2016
AN  - 2067681536
AB  - We examine the political position of the suburbs relative to the city by focusing on attitudes toward immigrants. Using 22 years of survey data for the Houston area, this paper addresses three questions. First, how has the attitudinal position of the suburbs relative to the city changed over time? Second, does the city-suburb distinction differ depending on the respondent’s race/ethnicity? Finally, do these results differ depending on the content of the question? Multivariate results indicate an overall increase in positive attitudes, but the increase is slower in the suburbs relative to the city. The resulting divergence is driven exclusively by non-Hispanic whites and is only evident when focusing on more contentious questions regarding immigrants in the United States. Our results suggest a persistent suburban cultural context despite recent demographic shifts, and they highlight the multidimensional nature of the (racialized) attitudes toward immigrants held by non-Hispanic whites in the United States.

T1  - The Diversity Challenge for High and Low Authoritarians: Multilevel and Longitudinal Effects Through Intergroup Contact and Threat
AN  - 2067649056
AB  - The current studies integrate different frameworks on the positive and negative consequences of ethnic diversity for intergroup relations. Using a nationally stratified sample of Dutch majority members (N = 680) from 50 cities in the Netherlands, Study 1 demonstrated that objective diversity was indirectly related to prejudice and to generalized, ingroup, and outgroup trust, through more positive and more negative contact. These indirect effects tended to be stronger for high versus low authoritarians. Furthermore, perceived diversity was indirectly related to less trust and greater prejudice, via more negative contact and threat. Again, these associations were more pronounced among high authoritarians. Study 2, using a representative sample of German majority members (N = 412) nested within 237 districts, replicated the cross-sectional results regarding objective diversity and prejudice. In addition, longitudinal analyses indicated that objective diversity predicted more positive and more negative contact 2 years later, though only among moderate and high authoritarians.

T1  - Perceived peer and school norm effects on youth antisocial and prosocial behaviours through intergroup contact in Northern Ireland
AN  - 2064683544
AB  - In adolescence, youth spend a high proportion of their time with their peers and in school; it is hardly surprising therefore that perceptions of peer and school norms have a strong influence on their attitudes and behaviours. These norms, however, do not always influence youth in the same way. Building on past research, the present study examines the role of peer norms and school norms in influencing the quantity and quality of intergroup contact, as well as the impact of such contact on positive and negative intergroup behaviours. Youth (aged 14–16) living in Northern Ireland (N = 466, evenly split by religion and gender) were recruited through their school as part of a two‐wave study and completed a series of survey measures including intergroup contact (quality and quantity), norms (peer and school), and participation in sectarian antisocial behaviour and outgroup prosocial behaviour. Mediation analysis was conducted in Mplus. Controlling for wave 1 responses on contact and behavioural outcomes, findings demonstrate that more positive peer norms are associated with less participation in antisocial behaviour and more participation in prosocial outgroup behaviours through increased and better quality intergroup contact. Positive school norms were also associated with increased prosocial behaviour, but only though better quality contact. Findings demonstrate the relative importance of peer norms compared to school norms for this age group. The results have implications for school‐based interventions that aim to improve intergroup relations and highlight the importance of peer networks to promote more positive outgroup behaviours in divided societies such as Northern Ireland.

T1  - Reaffirming King's Vision: The Power of Participation in Inclusive Diversity Efforts to Benefit Intergroup Outcomes
AN  - 2058558195
AB  - In 1967, Martin Luther King, Jr. reaffirmed a vision of integration as “an opportunity to participate in the beauty of diversity.” Drawing inspiration from King's vision, across two datasets with White and Asian college students (N = 1,957, N = 1,324), this article finds support for the power of participation in inclusive diversity efforts associated with underrepresented groups (i.e., Latina/o and African Americans) to benefit intergroup attitudes. Specifically, participating in an academic course or activity that involves Latina/o/x or African American culture is related to greater outgroup closeness and more supportive perceptions of policies that address inequality. Perceptions of policies included attitudes toward the merits of affirmative action, use of multicultural (vs. colorblind) approaches to diversity, and endorsement of structural (vs. individual) explanations for inequality. These results held controlling for other types of contact (i.e., outgroup friendships, roommates, interactions), college‐level demographic diversity, and prior intergroup attitudes and diversity exposure. The importance of engagement in inclusive diversity efforts for achieving integration is discussed.

T1  - From segregation to intergroup contact and back: Using experiments and simulation to understand the bidirectional link
AN  - 1993908771
AB  - Research on intergroup contact has mostly viewed desegregation as a necessary condition for contact to unfold its power to reduce prejudice. Through residential and school choices, however, prejudice also contributes to segregation. To shed light on this bidirectional link, we conducted two survey-based experiments with stratified quota samples of German adults. In Study 1, respondents with less contact and more prejudice indicated a lower likelihood of renting an apartment in a neighborhood with a larger proportion of minority members, although housing quality and crime rate were held constant. In Study 2, similar results were obtained for the likelihood of enrolling their child at a school with a larger proportion of minority students. Building on these results in a computer simulation, we find that because contact only reduces prejudice, but does not produce pro-minority preferences, spontaneous desegregation is unlikely to occur even under the most favorable structural and economic conditions.

T1  - Profiles of Minority Stressors and Identity Centrality Among Sexual Minority Latinx Youth
AN  - 2090486341
AB  - Few studies have examined how the amalgamation of minority stressors for youth with multiple marginalized identities is associated with well-being. Additionally, among youth with multiple marginalized identities, identity centrality may clarify the associations between specific types of minority stressors (i.e., bias-based peer victimization, perceived discrimination) and adjustment. This study sought to identify intersectional profiles of perceived peer victimization, perceived discrimination, and identity centrality, specific to either Latinx ethnicity or sexual minority identity in the United States. Demographic characteristics associated with each profile (i.e., age, socioeconomic status, gender nonconformity, survey language, gender, rurality) were examined, as well as associations between profiles and grade point average, self-esteem, and depression. In a sample of 219 in-school Latinx sexual minority youth (47% secondary, 53% postsecondary; Mage = 19 years, SD = 2.3), four profiles of intersectional minority stress (perceived victimization, discrimination) and identity centrality were identified: (a) low stress, low centrality; (b) low stress, high centrality; (c) moderate stress, moderate centrality, and (d) high stress, moderate centrality. Men, youth who were relatively older, socioeconomically advantaged, gender nonconforming, and those living in urban areas had higher probabilities of membership in profiles with moderate and high stress. Compared to the low stress, low centrality profile, profiles with higher levels of intersectional stress were associated with maladjustment, whereas the profile characterized by low stress, high centrality had higher levels of self-esteem.

AB  - This research extends our work on the conceptualization and measurement of cultural competencies with a revised bifactor measurement model of sociocultural adaptation (the Revised Sociocultural Adaptation Scale [SCAS-R]). Study 1 describes the initial development and validation of the SCAS-R with its Social Interaction, Community Engagement, and Ecological Adaptability domains of cultural competencies based on a mixed sample of short- and long-term migrants (N = 316). The construct validity of the revised scale was supported by significant correlations with social difficulties as assessed by the original Sociocultural Adaptation Scale; generic social skills; cultural intelligence; cultural engagement; international adjustment; and psychological adaptation: life satisfaction and depression. The bifactor model was confirmed in Study 2 with a sample of international students (N = 1,527). Results converged with previously established links between sociocultural adaptation and background variables (e.g., language proficiency), psychological adaptation, and situational factors such as cultural distance and perceived discrimination. Study 3 confirmed the predictive and incremental validity of the SCAS-R by investigating the influence of cultural competence on migration decision making in a varied sample of newly arrived migrants in New Zealand (N = 184). Cultural competence as assessed by the SCAS-R significantly explained additional variance in immigrants' intention to settle permanently in New Zealand over and above migration motivations, social connectedness, life satisfaction, and language proficiency. Our findings address the limitations of the original SCAS measure, and offer initial validation of an improved measure for assessing the culturally competent behaviors required for appropriate, effective, and adaptive functioning in new cultural settings.

T1  - Studying Positive and Negative Direct and Extended Contact: Complementing Self-Reports With Social Network Analysis
AN  - 1947371399
AB  - Traditionally, studies of intergroup contact have primarily relied on self-reports, which constitute a valid method for studying intergroup contact, but has limitations, especially if researchers are interested in negative or extended contact. In three studies, we apply social network analyses to generate alternative contact parameters. Studies 1 and 2 examine self-reported and network-based parameters of positive and negative contact using cross-sectional datasets (N = 291, N = 258), indicating that both methods help explain intergroup relations. Study 3 examines positive and negative direct and extended contact using the previously validated network-based contact parameters in a large-scale, international, and longitudinal dataset (N = 12,988), demonstrating that positive and negative direct and extended contact all uniquely predict intergroup relations (i.e., intergroup attitudes and future outgroup contact). Findings highlight the value of social network analysis for examining the full complexity of contact including positive and negative forms of direct and extended contact.

T1  - The Existential Underpinnings of Intergroup Helping: When Normative and Defensive Motivations Collide
AN  - 1936058768
AB  - Five studies examined defensive intergroup helping
--when responsibility for an out-group victim's injury decreases helping, whereas lack of responsibility increases helping when death is salient. In Study 1 (N
 = 350), implicit death primes increased petition signings to allow a Palestinian child to receive medical treatment in Israel, when the child was a victim of Palestinian fire. When the child was a victim of Israeli fire, however, death primes decreased petition signings. Study 2 (N
 = 200) partially replicated these effects on commitment to donate blood to an injured Palestinian child. Study 3 (N
 = 162) found that moral affirmation primes moderate defensive helping effects. Study 4 (N
 = 372) replicated defensive helping, but failed to replicate the moral affirmation effect found in Study 3. Study 5 (N
 = 243) partially replicated defensive helping and found that different framings of existential threat moderate the effect. Overall, results indicate that self-protective concerns underlie prosocial responses to out-group members in need.

T1  - “I have struggled really hard to learn Sami”: Claiming and regaining a minority language
AN  - 1947604998
AB  - This article sheds light on the issue of new speakerness via a case study focusing on one adolescent - “Elle” - and her efforts to claim and regain Sami, a national minority language in Sweden. Elle did not acquire Sami at home, but attended Sami school from first grade to sixth grade, where she learned to understand, read, and write the language. Ever since childhood, Elle has “struggled” to learn more Sami and to be acknowledged as a Sami speaker. It was only recently that Elle started using Sami actively in speech, reclaiming her Sami voice and breaking a silence to which she had been involuntarily submitted. A condition that for Elle could have resulted in language loss was, thus, by her efforts to regain the language, turned into a condition of language revitalization. This article shows how Elle’s narratives are linked to language ideologies and language policies in Swedish society, to negative attitudes towards Sami culture, and to discrimination. By learning and actively using Sami in writing and in speech, Elle exercises agency, and by taking the important step to start speaking, Elle proclaims her right to speak Sami and to her representation. The agency that Elle exercises by using Sami is beneficial for her own language development, but could also potentially contribute to the language revitalization of Sami and to the linguistic empowerment of other speakers/learners of Sami.

T1  - Race, partisanship, and perceptions of inter-minority commonality
AN  - 2571078996
AB  - Feelings of commonality are central to the formation of multiracial political coalitions. Despite a fairly voluminous literature on where these feelings come from, however, relatively little is known about how elite messages influence individual-level perceptions of intergroup relations. This oversight is surprising given that so-called “elite opinion” theory has become “virtually orthodoxy” within political science. In order to explore the potential for opinion leadership on perceptions of commonality, this paper employs a survey experiment embedded in the 2010 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. Testing hypotheses derived from elite opinion theory, this paper finds that no one interpretation of elite opinion theory can fully account for perceptions of commonality across racial groups. Scholars of race and ethnic politics would do well in the future, therefore, to acknowledge the complex ways that racial and partisan characteristics condition an individual’s response to elite messages.

T1  - Gender differences among Czech youth in prejudice towards minorities
AN  - 1886293218
AB  - Using a large survey of Czech high school students (n = 1103), aged 15-20 years, this paper explores youth prejudice to a wide range of minority groups (n = 21) where family, school, and community contexts are taken into account. General Structural Equation Models are used to explore the determinants of prejudice for 21 minorities using a comparative explanatory framework where the focus is gender differences in prejudice to minorities are examined using three social theories: Social Dominance Theory (SDT), the Theory of Gendered Prejudice (TGP), and Gender Role Beliefs (GRB). This research shows that gender plays a strong role in expressing prejudiced attitudes where females express (a) less prejudiced attitudes toward the Roma, black Africans, Gays and those with mental or physical disabilities, and (b) more prejudiced attitudes towards the homeless, Vietnamese, Muslims, and lesbians. This gendered pattern is explained in terms of insights from SDT, TGP, and GRB.

T1  - Not My Horse: Voter Preferences, Media Sources, and Hostile Poll Reports in Election Campaigns
AN  - 2502814210
AB  - The interplay between news coverage of preelection polls and voters’ assessments of bias has been well documented. Less known, but theoretically more important, is how it may play out in a media context that highly parallels political camps. The 2012 Taiwanese presidential election provides an ideal case to observe how voters’ perception of hostile poll coverage might be affected by media partisanship in election campaigns. Against this backdrop, we first confirmed that voters reported greater perceptions of hostile bias when seeing disagreeable poll results. The polarized and divided media setting further shaped voters’ reactions to poll coverage. Voters saw greater hostile poll bias in out-group media than in in-group media. Consequences of such perceived hostility, however, appeared inconsistent and mixed.

T1  - EXPERIENCING EUROPEAN INTEGRATION. TRANSNATIONAL LIVES AND EUROPEAN IDENTITY
AN  - 1883572018
AB  - Against the backdrop of multiple current European crises, the first monograph of Theresa Kuhn sheds light on mechanisms underlying the transnational identity formation among European citizens. Using data from, at the time, all 27 countries of the EU, the author aims to answer a question as to why do we not observe more public support for European integration and a stronger collective identity in Europe in the face of increased transnational interactions and networks across Europe. The research interest of Theresa Kuhn, currently an Assistant Professor in Political Science at the University of Amsterdam, lies in political sociology, cleavages, collective identities and globalisation. The findings confirm the main hypothesis that people who regularly interact across borders in the EU are indeed more likely to support EU membership and to identify themselves as European.

T1  - Race, prejudice and attitudes toward redistribution: A comparative experimental approach
AN  - 1910696930
AB  - Past work suggests that support for welfare in the United States is heavily influenced by citizens' racial attitudes. Indeed, the idea that many Americans think of welfare recipients as poor Blacks (and especially as poor Black women) has been a common explanation for Americans' lukewarm support for redistribution. This article draws on a new online survey experiment conducted with national samples in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, designed to extend research on how racialised portrayals of policy beneficiaries affect attitudes toward redistribution. A series of innovative survey vignettes has been designed that experimentally manipulate the ethno-racial background of beneficiaries for various redistributive programmes. The findings provide, for the first time, cross-national, cross-domain and cross-ethno-racial extensions of the American literature on the impact of racial cues on support for redistributive policy. The results also demonstrate that race clearly matters for policy support, although its impact varies by context and by the racial group under consideration.

T1  - Race, prejudice and attitudes toward redistribution: A comparative experimental approach
AN  - 1827231461
AB  - Past work suggests that support for welfare in the United States is heavily influenced by citizens' racial attitudes. Indeed, the idea that many Americans think of welfare recipients as poor Blacks (and especially as poor Black women) has been a common explanation for Americans' lukewarm support for redistribution. This article draws on a new online survey experiment conducted with national samples in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, designed to extend research on how racialised portrayals of policy beneficiaries affect attitudes toward redistribution. A series of innovative survey vignettes has been designed that experimentally manipulate the ethno-racial background of beneficiaries for various redistributive programmes. The findings provide, for the first time, cross-national, cross-domain and cross-ethno-racial extensions of the American literature on the impact of racial cues on support for redistributive policy. The results also demonstrate that race clearly matters for policy support, although its impact varies by context and by the racial group under consideration.

T1  - When are Stereotypes about Black Candidates Applied? An Experimental Test
AN  - 1951415540
AB  - Past research shows that candidates' racial identities influence the assumptions that voters draw about how they will behave in office. In a national survey experiment examining televised candidate advertisements, we find evidence that stereotypes differ both in their potency and how vulnerable they are to disconfirmation. Consistent with previous work, black candidates are broadly assumed to be more liberal than white candidates, although the effect is notably small in magnitude. Yet when it comes to more specific stereotypes--how black candidates will behave on individual issues--effects are not only much larger, but also more contingent on what information is available. We find that by providing a small bit of ideological information, black candidates can overcome the assumption that they will enact liberal policies as concerns taxation and non-racialized aspects of social welfare policy. But it is much more difficult for them to overturn the assumption that they will prioritize aid to minorities while in office.

T1  - Meaning threat can promote peaceful, not only military-based approaches to intergroup conflict: The moderating role of ingroup glorification
AN  - 1833135514
AB  - Most research on threat documents its negative consequences. Similarly, most research on intergroup contexts has emphasized their negative behavioral effects. Drawing on the Meaning Maintenance Model and recent perspectives on the potential for positivity in intergroup conflict, we predicted that meaning threat can produce both antisocial and prosocial responses to intergroup conflict, depending on people's preexisting meaning frameworks. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that under meaning threat, low ingroup glorifiers strengthened their support for peaceful conflict resolution, whereas high ingroup glorifiers strengthened their support for military-based conflict resolution. In the context of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, Study 3 found that low glorification was associated with greater support for peace during "hot" (but not "cold") conflict, because hot conflict reduced their meaning in life. These findings are consistent with the notion that when meaning is threatened, people affirm their preexisting values--whether prosocial or antisocial--even in the context of intergroup conflict.

T1  - Perceived moral responsibility for attitude-based discrimination
AN  - 1796451720
AB  - This research investigated judgements of moral responsibility for attitude-based discrimination, testing whether a wrongdoer's mental states - awareness and foresight - are central determinants of culpability. Participants read about and judged a target person who was described as consciously egalitarian, but harbouring negative attitudes that lead him to treat African Americans unfairly. Two studies showed that participants ascribed greater moral responsibility for discrimination when the target was aware of having negative attitudes than when he was unaware. Surprisingly, moral judgements were equally harsh towards a target who was explicitly aware that his bias could influence his behaviour as a target who was not. To explain this result, a second study showed that the path from awareness to moral responsibility was mediated by perceptions that the target had an obligation to foresee his discriminatory behaviour, but not by perceptions of the target's actual foresight. These results suggest that bias awareness influences moral judgements of those who engage in attitude-based discrimination because it obligates them to foresee harmful consequences. The current findings demonstrate that moral judges consider not just descriptive facts, but also normative standards regarding a wrongdoer's mental states.

T1  - How ordinary people view Muslim group rights in Britain, the Netherlands, France and Germany: significant 'gaps' between majorities and Muslims?
AN  - 2076967975
AB  - Taking four countries-Britain, the Netherlands, France and Germany-with distinct state approaches and public debates over accommodating Muslims, we study the views of ordinary people from the majority and Muslim populations on Muslim group rights. We compare their responses to questions on mosque-building, teachers wearing religious symbols, and religious classes in schools, to determine whether there is a significant 'gap' between the majority and Muslim minorities. We find highly significant 'gaps' between the majorities and Muslims over Muslim group rights in all countries, with the majorities less supportive. Importantly, it is a shift by the majority population against Muslim group rights that produces this 'gap' as the question moves from provision for Christians to Muslims, while Muslims hold similar views over rights for Christians and their own religion. In Britain and Germany, the two countries where church/state relations privilege Christianity over other religions, majorities especially support Christian over Muslim group rights. The British findings are remarkable, because a country which substantially grants and has the most supportive public debate for Muslim group rights, produces the largest 'gaps' between its majority and Muslims. We think this is due to political context, where in contrast to the Netherlands, there is no outlet for political opposition to Muslim group rights.

T1  - Do Religious Skeptics Differ from Religious Believers in their Interest in Celebrities?
AN  - 1848081715
AB  - Given the prejudice directed toward religious skeptics, it is imperative that we learn as much as we can about this minority group. We administered the Celebrity Attitude Scale (CAS), and some brief additional measures of attitudes about celebrities to a sample of 91 religious believers and 92 skeptics recruited throughout the US from Mechanical Turk. We predicted that skeptics would have less favorable attitudes toward celebrities in general and feel less strongly attached to their own favorite celebrity, as compared to the believers. The first prediction was confirmed but not the second. We also compared believers with skeptics on choices of an "entertainer" vs. "non-entertainer" favorite celebrity, and found no significant difference. The results are discussed in light of current research on religious skeptics and celebrity worshipers.

T1  - From Mecca with tolerance: religion, social recategorisation and social capital
AN  - 2400048713
AB  - Does participation in mass religious rituals promote intergroup conflict or does it promote intergroup tolerance? We assess these claims by examining the effects of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca (the hajj) on sociopolitical views of Muslims in Russia’s North Caucasus. Participant observation during the hajj and a quasi-experimental focus group study of pilgrims and non-pilgrims produced paradoxical findings. While the hajj strengthened their ingroup pride as Muslims, the pilgrims came through as more outgroup-tolerant and prosocial than the non-pilgrims. We develop a synthetic theoretical solution: in high-identity-value, high-diversity common group settings social recategorisation and social capital become transitive – that is, inclusive views and social capital effects within an ingroup extend to outgroups. This means that intergroup conflict could be reduced by not only maximising contact across conflicting groups, but also by bringing together as many subgroups as possible within each conflicting group in settings where their common identity is positively affirmed in a non-discriminatory fashion.

T1  - Diversity within Women of Color: Why Experiences Change Felt Stigma
AN  - 1719468129
AB  - This commentary offers additional considerations for better understanding and studying how women of color detect and respond to prejudice in the United States. Building on the thoughts raised by Remedios and Snyder ( 2015 ), we highlight the importance of considering the socio-cultural and historic factors that differentially impact how sub-groups of women of color are perceived. Rather than generalizing work on stigma and discrimination across the diverse group of women of color, we discuss the importance and benefits of examining subgroups individually. In this commentary therefore, we pose research questions about three additional bodies of literature that add to Remedios and Snyder's ( 2015 ) ideas regarding experiencing stigma. First, we examine how stereotypes of subgroups of women of color differ. Next, we introduce other work in the field of intersectionality, e.g. gendered race, to argue that differences in the ways women of color are perceived may affect how they experience identity centrality, discrimination, and other identity-related processes. Finally, we provide empirical evidence highlighting the concept of intersectional invisibility as an additional form of felt discrimination.

T1  - Achieving Social Change: A Matter of All for One?
AN  - 1710569040
AB  - Recently, there has been a growing interest in not only understanding the processes underlying responses to disadvantage, and ways of reducing prejudice, but also to gain insight into how experiences of prejudice and social disadvantage affect the need to address one's disadvantage. Our goal in this issue is to discuss how and when low status group members move from experiences of individual versus collective disadvantage to social change. In this article, we consider the individual coping and social change literature, departing from the analyses of individual-level responses to disadvantage, to those at the collective level, to discuss how both strands of research relate to social change. Throughout this article, we introduce the contributions to this special issue and discuss the caveats and paradoxes they raise with regard to the existent literature.

T1  - Divide and Rule, Unite and Resist: Contact, Collective Action and Policy Attitudes among Historically Disadvantaged Groups
AN  - 1710568945
AB  - Racial segregation encourages members of historically advantaged groups to form negative intergroup attitudes, which then motivate practices of discrimination that sustain inequality and disadvantage. By implication, interventions designed to increase intergroup contact have been proposed as a means of reducing dominant group prejudices and promoting social change. In this article, we highlight another mechanism through which segregation shapes intergroup relations, namely, by inhibiting political solidarity between historically disadvantaged groups. Building on a field survey conducted in postapartheid South Africa, we demonstrate how challenging this form of segregation may reveal alternative mechanisms through which intergroup contact facilitates social change. Notably, we report evidence that positive contact with Black residents of an informal settlement in Pietermaritzburg was associated with Indian residents' support for political policies and forms of collective action that might improve conditions in that settlement. In addition, we show that such support was partly mediated by perceptions of collective discrimination.

T1  - I Don't Think You Like Me Very Much: Child Minority Status and Disadvantage Predict Relationship Quality With Teachers
AN  - 1703407761
AB  - Even when accounting for past performance, academic achievement can be influenced by teacher expectations, which are lower for disadvantaged and visible ethnic minority children. We use a Quebec (Canada) population-based sample (N = 1,311) to examine whether ethnicity and teacher-perceived signs of disadvantage in kindergarten predict child reports of their relationship with teachers in fourth grade. Results suggest that visible minority children were 50% less likely and perceived disadvantaged children were 32% less likely to report having a positive relationship with their teacher. The findings are discussed in terms of directing efforts toward reducing teacher prejudice and improving child academic success.

T1  - Exiles in a Foreign Land
AN  - 1698544858
AB  - Despite documentation of intergroup conflict between African Americans and Irish immigrants during the mid-nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries, few studies have comparatively considered the beneficence of religion as an adaptive, conciliatory mechanism for the two ethnic groups. Yet, literature supports the historic centrality of the Black Church for the former group and the indelible influence of Catholicism for the latter. This research examines common religious themes and organized efforts associated with these faith traditions for the two historically oppressed groups. Informed by Cultural Theory, this study compares and contrasts religious cultural dynamics to illumine adaptive features and activism. Exilic themes based on nationality, race, and/or ethnicity tied to biblical symbolism; social programs and self-help; as well as appropriation of Liberation Theology are common group patterns. Yet, findings also illustrate the inability of religion to foster substantial intergroup cooperation in light of other prevailing systemic forces.

T1  - Group Position, Threat, and Immigration
AN  - 2406941859
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to move research on racial attitudes away from studying intraindividual attitudes toward studying broader structural factors that contribute to the attitudes and feelings of U.S. citizens. We focus on how interest groups and elite actors play a role in shaping the discourse on immigrants and the immigration debate in the twenty-first century. Herbert Blumer posed that over time, the dominant group develops certain feelings toward subordinate group members and that these feelings form the basis of racial prejudice. These feelings include notions of superiority, the alienation of other groups, proprietary claims over valued resources, and finally, a feeling that resources are threatened. While not dismissing the importance of interpersonal interactions, Blumer posed that elite entities within the dominant group play prominent roles in producing and managing these feelings among the masses because they have access to the public ear. To assess how the elite attempt to manage feelings toward immigration, we use qualitative data from 33 amicus briefs submitted in support of Arizona’s SB 1070 law in the Arizona v. United States case. Findings reveal that each of the feelings was prominently represented in all briefs, which supports the notion that elite entities use arguments that promote feelings Blumer associated with racial prejudice.

T1  - Individualism and sociocultural adaptation: Discrimination and social capital as moderators among rural-to-urban migrants in China
AN  - 1700676321; 201524969
AB  - This study examined the associations of sociocultural adaptation with individualism and collectivism and the moderating roles of discrimination and social capital in the associations among rural-to-urban migrants (N=641) in Beijing, China. Results indicated that individualism was associated with poorer adaptation for migrants reporting low perceived discrimination or low social capital. However, migrants reporting high perceived discrimination showed poorer adaptation, regardless of individualism; and migrants reporting high social capital showed better adaptation, regardless of individualism. Collectivism was not related to adaptation. Findings suggest that individualism may be detrimental to migrants' adjustment to a collectivistic society. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Friendships Fighting Prejudice: A Longitudinal Perspective on Adolescents' Cross-Group Friendships with Immigrants
AN  - 1679664501
AB  - Increasingly, adolescents are growing up in multiethnic multicultural societies. While intergroup prejudice can threaten the multicultural societal cohesion, intergroup friendships are strong predictors of reduced prejudice. Thus, more research is needed to fully understand the development of intergroup friendships and their relations to less prejudicial attitudes. This study addressed two major developmental research questions: first, whether longitudinal patterns of intergroup friendships of native adolescents (i.e., whether or not a native German adolescent has a friendship with an immigrant at different points in time) relate to changes in rates of prejudice about immigrants. Second, whether these friendship patterns that unfold over time can be predicted by contact opportunities, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control assessed at the beginning of the study. The sample included 372 native German adolescents (14.7 years of age at first assessment, 62.3 % girls) who showed one of four friendship trajectories over the three annual assessments: they either maintained, gained, never had, or lost a friendship with an outgroup peer. In particular, results showed that adolescents who gained an intergroup friendship over the three time points showed a significant decrease in negative prejudice over the study. All four theorized predictors contributed to explain friendship trajectory membership. Generally, adolescents with many opportunities for contact, positive attitudes about contact, perceived positive social norms for contact, and high levels of behavioral control (self-efficacy) were more likely to maintain a friendship with an outgroup member than to follow any of the three other friendship trajectories (gain, lost, or never had). The pattern of predictions differed, however, depending on the specific pairs of friendship trajectories compared.

T1  - We Are Not All the Same: Arab and Muslim Students Forging Their Own Campus Communities in a Post-9/11 America
AN  - 1674473434
AB  - The study investigates Arab and Muslim students' social relationships on 21 community college campuses in the USA (N = 753), with comparison groups of African Americans, Latinos, Asians, and Whites (N = 567). Survey findings revealed a positive relationship between campus friendships and sense of belonging, controlling for ethnic and religious identities, and perceived discrimination on campus. Individual group differences were found among Arab Christians, Arab Muslims, and non-Arab Muslims, and the comparison group. As an earlier publication based on the same study revealed, 75% of Arab and Muslim students' campus friendships were either same ethnic and/or same faith, with only a quarter of campus friendships being of different ethnicity and different religion. Although such results suggest the existence of ethno-religious enclaves, this paper concludes that Arab and Muslim students are not purposely enacting their own ethno-religious balkanization, but -- like other ethnic groups -- forging their own campus communities within the larger campus community.

T1  - Asian American Attitudes towards a US Citizenship Path for Illegal Immigrants: Immigration Reform as Racialised Politics
AN  - 2076975458
AB  - Do Asian Americans view a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the USA as related to perceptions of shared interests with other ethnoracial groups? I utilise the National Asian American Survey to test this possibility. Ordinal logistic regressions reveal that higher levels of perceived political commonality with Latinos relate to increased support for the provision of a citizenship path. Similarly, higher perceived political commonality with blacks is positively related to support for a citizenship pathway, suggesting that a civil rights frame, rather than a group competition frame, links immigration reform and black political interests in the minds of Asian Americans. On the other hand, higher levels of perceived political commonality with whites relate to increased opposition to such a pathway. These results indicate that Asian Americans' racial attitudes, in particular their perceptions of political commonality with other racial groups, relate to their opinions on a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants in the USA.

T1  - ALCOHOL-RELATED ATTITUDES OF HEAVY DRINKERS: EFFECTS OF AROUSAL AND VALENCE IN EVALUATIVE CONDITIONING
AN  - 1767330979; 201605429
AB  - We investigated the effects of 2 dimensions of affect in evaluative conditioning (EC) on changing alcohol-related attitudes in a sample of students whom we had identified as fitting set criteria to be classified as heavy drinkers. We divided participants into 2 EC groups (high-arousal EC condition, n = 18; low-arousal EC condition, n = 18) and measured their explicit and implicit attitudes toward alcohol. Comparison of results before and after EC indicated that participants reported a greater decrease in both explicit attitudes about positive alcohol expectancies and explicit cravings. However, in regard to implicit attitudes, the results showed that the high-arousal EC condition was associated with a stronger positive attitude toward alcohol after, rather than before, EC, whereas in the low-arousal EC group, implicit attitudes toward alcohol did not change. These results imply that high levels of affect arousal during EC can positively strengthen the implicit evaluation of alcohol in a student sample of heavy drinkers, while decreasing explicit attitudes about cravings and positive expectancies. Thus, based on attitude conditioning, it is important to consider the arousal as well as the valence of affect in treatment of alcohol addiction in order to change alcohol-related attitudes in heavy drinkers.

T1  - THE ROLE OF INTERGROUP PERMEABILITY ON CHINESE MIGRANT CHILDREN'S SOCIAL INTEGRATION
AN  - 1767330080; 201605519
AB  - We used structural equation modeling to examine the influencing factors and mediating mechanism in the process of migrant children's social integration. Participants were 437 migrant children in Shanghai. The results showed that as a risk factor, perceived discrimination had a significant negative effect on the migrant children's social integration. Intergroup permeability had a mediation effect in the relationship between migrant children's perceived discrimination and social integration. Self-esteem moderated the mediation effect of intergroup permeability, and the strength of this mediation impact increased as the level of self-esteem did. Thus, intergroup permeability had a moderating mediation effect on the social integration of migrant children. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Predictors of intergroup bias in Turkish Cypriots
AN  - 1735656998; 201536984
AB  - We investigated the role of certain individual and group processes on intergroup bias in the context of Cyprus, an island that has endured over 40 years of interethnic tension. One hundred and fifty Turkish Cypriots were asked to complete a survey which assessed intergroup contact and intergroup bias toward Greek Cypriots. Political affiliation, ingroup favoritism and intergroup contact played a role in predicting prejudice toward Greek Cypriots. Path analysis showed the relationship between ingroup favoritism and outgroup prejudice was partially mediated by low intergroup contact. The findings highlight the theoretical and practical implications for prejudice reduction techniques in Cyprus. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - A sociofunctional approach to prejudice at the polls: are atheists more politically disadvantaged than gays and Blacks?
AN  - 1566612531
AB  - Prejudice against atheists is pervasive in the United States. Atheists lag behind virtually all other minority groups on measures of social acceptance. The sociofunctional approach suggests that distrust is at the core of anti-atheist prejudice, thus making it qualitatively different than prejudice against other disadvantaged groups. Accordingly, this research examined political bias against atheists, gays, and Blacks and the affective content accompanying such biases. Results indicated that atheists suffered the largest deficit in voting intentions from Christian participants, and this deficit was accompanied by distrust, disgust, and fear, thereby suggesting that the affective content of anti-atheist prejudice is both broader and more extreme than prejudice against other historically disadvantaged groups. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed.

T1  - IMPACT OF USE OF TECHNOLOGY IN MATHEMATICS LESSONS ON STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT AND ATTITUDES
AN  - 1551001755; 201428807
AB  - Technology use in classrooms in today's world is believed to have a positive impact on students' success and their attitudes towards lessons. In this study, the authors have investigated students' attitudes towards technology use in class and whether the use of technology improved their academic achievement. A quasiexperimental research design was used and they assigned 3 groups as experimental groups (n = 41) and 2 as control groups (n = 41). Mathematics was selected as the subject to be studied. All groups completed a pretest and a posttest. For the experimental groups, lessons were designed using several technological tools, whereas lessons for control groups were taught using traditional teaching methods. At the end of the study, the experimental groups completed a scale to investigate the preferences and attitudes of the students in regard to technology-based instruction. Results showed that, students had a positive attitude towards technology use. The implications for curriculum designers and teachers are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Inter-group contact at school and social attitudes: evidence from Northern Ireland
AN  - 1512219979; 201410075
AB  - Debate continues about the relationship between schools divided on ethno-religious lines and their implications for social cohesion. One argument against the existence of separate schools is that they limit opportunities for children from different groups to engage with each other, promoting intergroup suspicion and sectarianism. Using intergroup contact theory we examine the impact on outgroup attitudes of pupils attending mixed and separate post-primary schools in Northern Ireland. Data were collected through a survey of more than 3,500 pupils and analyses show that, irrespective of school type, intergroup contact at school is strongly associated with more positive orientations to the ethno-religious outgroup. The policy implications of these findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Relocating Prejudice: A Transnational Approach to Understanding Immigrants’ Racial Attitudes: IMR
AN  - 2558416069
AB  - Immigration is changing the racial composition of many societies. Yet leading theories of racial prejudice, even in a multiracial context, focus on dynamics in a single nation-state and fail to account for the experiences of the foreign-born. We adopt a transnational approach that incorporates processes creating prejudice from both inside and outside the receiving society and that shows how attitudes move across borders through immigration, transnationalism, and globalization. We draw upon two in-depth studies of immigrants and those who stay in the home countries, focusing on Koreans’ and Dominicans’ attitudes toward Black Americans. By situating existing theories of racial prejudice within a transnational framework, we illustrate how models of transnationalism are relevant not just within immigration scholarship, but to more general processes of social change.

T1  - Discrimination between the rich and the poor under contrasting conditions of wealth stratification
AN  - 1433108663
AB  - Using minimal group procedures, 2 studies investigated money allocations made by rich/poor group members in wealth stratifications based on group chance, group merit, and individual merit. Study 1 participants were assigned to rich or poor groups based on a coin toss (group-chance) or on performance of each group on a test (group-merit). Study 2 participants completed a test ostensibly distinguishing between high/low effortful individuals. High-effort individuals were assigned to the rich group, low-effort individuals were assigned to the poor group (individual-merit). After personally receiving play money, participants distributed their money to the rich and the poor. Results show that wealth based on group chance, group merit, and individual merit yielded contrasting patterns of parity and discriminatory behaviors.

T1  - The attitudinal consequences of thought suppression: A focus on thinness thoughts
AN  - 1417527385; 201331779
AB  - Four studies examined whether thought suppression could enhance attitude accessibility and whether behaviours that are consistent with the more accessible attitudes would follow. Thinness was examined as the attitude object. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that suppression of positive thoughts about thinness increased the accessibility of the positive attitudes associated with thinness. Experiments 3 and 4 showed that suppression of positive thinness thoughts also elicited more health-promoting behaviours. The implications of the findings for attitude accessibility and the practical consequences of thought suppression are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Nouns Cut Slices: Effects of Linguistic Forms on Intergroup Bias
AN  - 1417524757; 201333313
AB  - Three studies examined the effect of nouns and adjectives for designations of nationality on intergroup bias. In Study 1, participants (N = 237) evaluated group artifacts whose authors' nationality was labeled with nouns or adjectives. Use of nouns enhanced in-group favoritism, manifested as a preference of the in-group artifact. Study 2 (N = 431) tested the effect of nouns and adjectives on attitudes toward the in-group and out-group focusing on the moderating role of in-group identification. Use of nouns led to a stronger relative preference of the in-group, pronounced especially in low identified group members. Study 3 (N = 979) examined the effect of nouns and adjectives in a more applied survey setting. Intergroup bias concerning material restitution for confiscated property was stronger when the ethnicity of the former owners was labeled with nouns. The article emphasizes that subtle variation in language use has a consistent impact on intergroup evaluation. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

AN  - 1531933043; 201422957
AB  - The authors have explored the antecedents of mobile coupon use based on acquisition-transaction utility theory, and the technology acceptance model. They have analyzed data collected from 365 mobile phone users in Taiwan and developed a theoretical and empirical model. The results indicate that, consumers with a higher degree of coupon proneness are more likely to recognize the usefulness of mobile coupons, and have more positive attitudes and behavioral intention toward coupon use. Both consumers' perceived usefulness and attitudes toward use appeared to have an equal and positive impact on their behavioral intention to use. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - TO SHARE KNOWLEDGE OR NOT: DEPENDENCE ON KNOWLEDGE-SHARING SATISFACTION
AN  - 1531931370; 201423171
AB  - Knowledge sharing behavior does not occur naturally and easily. In this study, Wu hypothesized that knowledge workers would be more likely to share knowledge if they were satisfied with knowledge-sharing behavior. This positive attitude was labeled knowledge-sharing satisfaction (KSS). Drawing upon social exchange theory and motivation theory, Wu examined the relationship between KSS and knowledge-sharing behavior. Using survey data from participants employed in research and development departments at knowledge-intensive high-technology companies in Taiwan, Wu demonstrated that satisfaction of the need for a friendly sharing environment and satisfaction of intrinsic and altruistic motivation are positively related to knowledge-sharing behavior. These findings contribute to researchers' understanding of the antecedents of employee knowledge-sharing behavior. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The challenge of diversity management: police reform and the Arab minority in Israel
AN  - 1315600790; 201309368
AB  - Diverse societies present different challenges for police forces that have to gain the trust and legitimacy of minorities. Police forces must develop the ability to engage with diversity and overcome their own biases and prejudices in order to better serve minorities. Police reforms, however, may fail to address the challenge successfully if core problems are not clearly identified. In such a case, reforms may be misdirected and fail to achieve the desired results. This paper, based on a study of the Arab minority in Israel, suggests a bottom-up approach that concentrates on identifying the attitudes of minority groups as the basis for any reform plan. A survey was conducted among Arab citizens to identify general attitudes, perceptions of over-policing and under-policing and assessment of three potential reforms; recruitment of minority members into the police, community involvement in policing, and cultural training for police officers.

T1  - Relationship closeness and control as determinants of pleasant amae
AN  - 1283639488; 201303185
AB  - Japanese often find it pleasant when someone engages in amae, defined as an inappropriate request with the expectation of acceptance. Using a random sampling survey, we examined why Japanese adults feel good when a friend or an acquaintance engages in amae and when they, themselves, engage in amae. In both situations, positive attitude toward amae predicted more positive emotions. Relationship closeness and feeling of control mediated this association, and perceiving enough resources to grant the request did so only in the friend/acquaintance amae situation. Despite its inappropriateness, amae could be an effective way to seek help and express closeness with others. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Measurement Invariance across Face-to-Face and Telephone Modes: The Case of Minority-Status Collectivistic-oriented Groups
AN  - 1125220996; 201241148
AB  - This article tests the implications of mode selection on measurement equivalence in interview-administered surveys among minorities using a Multi-Group Multiple Indicators-Multiple Causes Model. A measurement invariance test procedure comparing face-to-face and telephone modes was performed on an attitude scale concerning social integration between Arabs and Jews. The scale was measured in two surveys conducted simultaneously among the Arab minority in Israel. Hypotheses regarding mode effect on the measurement model parameters (mean, intercept, loading, and error variance) were formulated, with reference to three mediators: Cognitive burden, motivation, and threat of disclosure. The results partially supported the hypotheses: Face-to-face mode was fully superior with regard to item random error (reliability), was partially superior with regard to item systematic error, but was not superior with regard to item validity. The configural, metric, partial scalar, and latent factor mean invariance found in this study are an indication that such data sets may be combined cautiously. Implications are discussed for researchers using telephone or mixed modes for data collection in surveys dealing with sensitive topics among collectivistic-oriented minority-status groups.

T1  - Self-Interest Masquerading as Ingroup Beneficence: Altruistic Rationalization and Interindividual-Intergroup Discontinuity
AN  - 1018343084; 201212749
AB  - An altruistic rationalization explanation of the interindividual-intergroup discontinuity effect proposes that intergroup interactions are more competitive than interactions between individuals because group membership creates an opportunity to rationalize selfishly motivated competitiveness as being enacted for the ingroup's sake. To test this explanation, we compared participants whose decisions did not influence the earnings of other participants, and who therefore had no opportunity for altruistic rationalization of competitiveness, with participants whose decisions did influence the earnings of other participants, and who therefore did have an opportunity for altruistic rationalization. Competition in a prisoner's dilemma game was greater when opportunities for altruistic rationalization were present, but this effect was significant only for participants who were low in dispositional proneness to guilt, a trait that motivates prosocial behavior. In other words, we found that dispositionally selfish individuals were most likely to become more competitive when opportunities for altruistic rationalization were present. These findings provide evidence for an additional mechanism driving the discontinuity effect. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Nationalism versus multiculturalism: the minority issue in twenty-first-century Bulgaria
AN  - 1002672523
AB  - The paper negotiates ideas, views and beliefs of Bulgarians towards the ethnic minorities of their country published in the Bulgarian press during the period of 2005-2009. Through these aspects it becomes clear that three years after Bulgaria's accession to the European Union and despite various state attempts to integrate minorities -- mostly initiated and funded by the EU and various governmental and non-governmental organizations -- prejudice and racism have not been overcome, the Other is still differentiated and the way to multiculturalism is very long. The research field is limited to the Turkish and the Roma minorities, which are "visible" in the sense that they are officially recognized. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Forbidden Fruit: Inattention to Attractive Alternatives Provokes Implicit Relationship Reactance
AN  - 919903937; 201201510
AB  - Being inattentive to attractive relationship alternatives can enhance relationship well-being. The current investigation, however, demonstrates that implicitly preventing people from attending to desirable relationship alternatives may undermine, rather than bolster, the strength of that person's romantic relationship. Consistent with the notion of "forbidden fruit," we found that subtly limiting people's attention to attractive alternatives reduced relationship satisfaction and commitment and increased positive attitudes toward infidelity (Experiment 1), increased memory for attractive relationship alternatives (Experiment 2), and increased attention to attractive alternatives (Experiment 3). Findings suggest that although attention to attractive alternatives can harm one's relationship, situations that implicitly limit one's attention to alternatives can, rather ironically, increase the temptation of alternatives and undermine relationship well-being.

T1  - Beyond social exchange theory
AN  - 964196192; 201208265
AB  - Although social exchange theory has been used to predict and explain attitudes toward tourists, it has been criticized for lacking theoretical sophistication. This research goes beyond social exchange theory to test a predictive model of attitudes toward tourists, incorporating the contact hypothesis and Integrated Threat Theory. It was hypothesized that positive attitudes toward tourism would be predicted by employment in industry, country of residence, and positive perceptions of tourism impacts. It was further hypothesized that more frequent and satisfying intercultural contact, lower perceptions of threat, more positive stereotypes and less intergroup anxiety would predict positive attitudes. Hierarchical regression analysis supported all hypotheses. The utility of Integrated Threat Theory in predicting attitudes is discussed, and recommendations for future research proposed.

T1  - Product Involvement In The Link Between Skepticism Toward Advertising And Its Effects
AN  - 887494735; 201118014
AB  - Each year businesses spend millions of dollars on advertising to engender a positive attitude among consumers about a specific brand, eliminate any mistrust and suspicion about advertising, and rectify wrong attributions about products. In this research we focused on how doubt about advertisements impacts on their effectiveness, in regard to brand attitude and purchasing intention. We adopted the seemingly unrelated regression model to estimate the parameter, and the mutual relationships among several regression equations are taken into consideration. There were 337 participants in this experiment, and as indicated by the result, doubt about advertisements had a negative effect on brand attitude and purchasing intention. This negative effect will disrupt product involvement. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Happiness in a Flux? The Instability Problem
AN  - 818797492; 201068699
AB  - In the recent discussion of happiness it has become popular to claim that being happy means having a certain positive attitude towards your life. This attitude involves both a judgement that your life measures up to your standards and a feeling of satisfaction with your life. In this paper, I am going to discuss a serious problem inherent in this account that has important ramifications for the normative question of how we ought to pursue happiness. If happiness is in part determined by your standards, how shall we determine whether you are happier in one life than in another when your standards change across these lives? Perhaps you will judge a life as a parent as better than a childless life, if you were to become a parent, but judge a childless life as better than a parenting life, if you were to remain childless. Which standard should determine the comparative happiness of the two lives? In this paper, I shall argue that some innocent-looking answers to this question will generate inconsistencies. To find an acceptable resolution, we need to make a difficult choice between what on the face of it look like two equally valid principles of happiness. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - When Biased Language Use is Associated With Bullying and Dominance Behavior: The Moderating Effect of Prejudice
AN  - 746773047; 20582564
AB  - Biased language related to sexual orientation is used frequently among students and is related to prominent social concerns such as bullying. Prejudice toward gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender individuals also has been examined among adolescents, but separately from these behaviors. This study tested whether biased language use was associated with bullying and dominance irrespective of sexual prejudice or if sexual prejudice moderated these associations among 290 high school students (50% female; 56% White). Sexual prejudice was associated with biased language use among boys only. Biased language was associated with bullying regardless of levels of sexual prejudice for boys. However, this association was dependent on sexual prejudice for girls. For dominance behavior, its association with biased language was moderated by sexual prejudice for boys, but not girls. However, girls' engagement in all behaviors was significantly less than boys. These results indicate nuanced ways in which multiple factors contribute to the use of sexual orientation biased language. Also, they underscore the need to address biased language and prejudice as part of anti-bullying programs. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Gay Mexican Pornography at the Intersection of Ethnic and National Identity in Jorge Diestra's La Putiza
AN  - 749354374
AB  - This article aims to offer an analysis of the way that issues of national and ethnic self identity are structured and constructed in Mexican gay pornography. Unlike theorists who regard pornography as a matter of sex discrimination and argue that it simply undermines any positive attitudes towards homosexuality, this article argues that Mexican gay male pornography has served as a point of self reference for homosexual men in the country, while it has also helped to foster a degree of visibility for the gay community in mainstream culture. Through an analysis of the film La Putiza (2006), made by the emerging porn house Mecos Films, it will be demonstrated that Mexican male homosexuals do not regard pornography as a cultural product intended to the objectification of the gay community and its members. This film clearly stresses ethnic and national identity as the basis to contest the hegemony of Anglo-European gay pornography in which notions of Latin(o) identity have been caricaturised and heavily troped. This film borrows elements that are pertinent to the specificity of the national gay imagery, as well as film genres that are regarded as quintessentially Mexican. Therefore, the combination of Aztec heritage narrative and wrestling subtexts permit to posit this film as an alternative to the kind of images of Latin(o) homosexuality that are portrayed in Western pornography, while it also stresses national identity by using themes that circulate in the national imaginary as exclusively Mexican. In short, the emerging Mexican gay pornographic industry and the film that it produces prove to be a site of contestation of the hegemony of "Latinised" images that have been offered in foreign pornographic accounts, while they also become a site of validation for gay men whose physicality or ethnic heritage has been rejected within the politics of the erotic.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Secondary Transfer Effects of Intergroup Contact: Alternative Accounts and Underlying Processes
AN  - 764417429; 201064651
AB  - Although intergroup contact is one of the most prominent interventions to reduce prejudice, the generalization of contact effects is still a contentious issue. This research further examined the rarely studied secondary transfer effect (STE; Pettigrew, 2009), by which contact with a primary outgroup reduces prejudice toward secondary groups that are not directly involved in the contact. Across 3 cross-sectional studies conducted in Cyprus (N = 1,653), Northern Ireland (N = 1,973), and Texas (N = 275) and 1 longitudinal study conducted in Northern Ireland (N = 411), the present research sought to systematically rule out alternative accounts of the STE and to investigate 2 potential mediating mechanisms (ingroup reappraisal and attitude generalization). Results indicated that, consistent with the STE, contact with a primary outgroup predicts attitudes toward secondary outgroups, over and above contact with the secondary outgroup, socially desirable responding, and prior attitudes. Mediation analyses found strong evidence for attitude generalization but only limited evidence for ingroup reappraisal as an underlying process. Two out of 3 tests of a reverse model, where contact with the secondary outgroup predicts attitudes toward the primary outgroup, provide further evidence for an indirect effect through attitude generalization. Theoretical and practical implications of these results are discussed, and directions for future research are identified. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - The Relationship of Ethnicity-Related Stressors and Latino Ethnic Identity to Well-Being
AN  - 1928200314
AB  - Based on the risk and resilience model, the current study examined the effect of ethnicity-related stressors (perceived discrimination, stereotype confirmation concern, and own-group conformity pressure) and ethnic identity (centrality, private regard, public regard, and other-group orientation) on the well-being of 171 Latino American college students. The study also examined the moderating role of ethnic identity on the relationship between ethnicity-related stressors and well-being. Findings showed that stereotype confirmation concern significantly predicted less well-being, whereas a positive ethnic identity predicted greater well-being. Ethnic identity also moderated the effect of ethnicity-related stressors on well-being. Different patterns emerged for the moderating effect of different ethnic identity dimensions and different ethnicity-related stressors. Findings are discussed in terms of the acculturative and ethnic diversity context of the college students.
