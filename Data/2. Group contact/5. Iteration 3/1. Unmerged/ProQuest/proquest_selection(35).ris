T1  - Fez as a locus of migration processes on the move: integration and mutation of citizenship
AN  - 2691266643
AB  - This article aims to define the main facets and challenges of undocumented migrants on the move in Fez city (Morocco) and their impact on neighbourhoods and on society at large. It seeks to measure the integration of sub-Saharan migrants in the host community through the metrics of their participation in economic and social activities in urban space and discusses the main hurdles impeding their integration. The data show that there is, on the one hand, a quite low degree of acceptance by the local population, which in general tolerates their presence although signs of discrimination and prejudice in certain neighbourhoods are observed. On the other hand, the sample shows that some sort of partial integration occurs through forms of micro-entrepreneurial activities and use of city services. Further, the article proposes the idea of rethinking the concept of citizenship in order to understand the new flows of migration. It shows that the concept of citizenship needs to be re-considered beyond the formal and legal dimension, in order to include informal dimensions for a more realistic rendering of the interaction between migrants and the city. Unlike Isin (2017. “Performative Citizenship.” In The Oxford Handbook of Citizenship, edited by Ayelet Shachar, Rainer Bauböck, Irene Bloemraad, and Maarten Vink, 500–523. Oxford: Oxford University Press) and others who focus mainly on acts of citizenship as political, the article reveals that migrants perform their own acts of citizenship through social interaction, in line with Ong's (2007) theory of mutations of citizenship.

T1  - Navigating diversity: Maternal ideologies and associations with child interethnic prejudice in the Netherlands
AN  - 2688508724
AB  - Parental diversity ideologies are linked to their own interethnic prejudice, but how do they relate to children's prejudice? This study examined self‐reported endorsement of colorblind ideology and multiculturalism among mothers (138 White Dutch, 65 Turkish‐Dutch, and 45 Afro‐Dutch) of 6‐to 10‐year old children (55% girls), and its association with child interethnic prejudice. Endorsement of multiculturalism was lowest among White Dutch mothers, and endorsement of colorblind ideology was lowest among Afro‐Dutch mothers. Maternal endorsement of multiculturalism was negatively related to child outgroup prejudice among White Dutch families and among Turkish‐Dutch families in the context of underrepresented outgroups, and results suggest no or opposite associations for colorblind ideology. Future research should explore what parenting based on these ideologies looks like, but the present study points parents in the direction of a multicultural, rather than colorblind, approach.

T1  - Racist views in contemporary European societies
AN  - 2670390286
AB  - This attitudinal study examines racism – conceptualized as a general belief in a hierarchical order of racial/ethnic groups – from a comparative cross-national perspective. The study develops theoretical arguments regarding individual and country-level explanations of racist views and tests them using ESS data. It demonstrates that racist views are not rare in Europe, yet their extent varies substantially across countries. In societies with lower levels of social cohesion, citizens are more likely to adopt racist views, as compared to societies with higher levels of social cohesion. Although a country’s economic inequality is not associated with the prevalence of racist views, inequality does seem to condition the impact of gender on such views. In more economically unequal countries, the gender gap in racist views – where men express higher levels of racist views – is greater than in more economically equal countries. No association between ethnic diversity and levels of racist views was found.

T1  - Perceived Immigrant Threat and Punitive Attitudes: The Moderating Effect of Economic Insecurity
AN  - 2644792360
AB  - One of the strongest predictors of punitive attitudes is out-group prejudice. Two limitations of this literature are a relative lack of research examining (a) these relationships outside the United States and (b) the theoretical mechanisms involved. The current study tests the direct and moderating effects of group threat and economic insecurity on punitive attitudes among German citizens. Findings show the direct effect of group threat on punitive attitudes was significant and positive in three OLS regression models measuring different perceptions of threat by immigrants. The direct effect of economic insecurity on punitive attitudes was non-significant, but economic insecurity had a significant moderating effect on out-group prejudice and punitiveness in all three models.

T1  - Who Wants to Know? White Racial Attitudes and Survey Item Refusal on Gun Ownership Questions
AN  - 2618150249
AB  - Research has long documented the fact that sensitive items on surveys are subject to relatively high levels of item response refusal, but the role played by respondent characteristics in shaping who refuses is underexplored. The present study integrates this methodological literature with a growing body of research concerned with the racialization of attitudes about gun ownership and policy among Whites in order to address this question. Specifically, this project investigates how racial attitudes influence survey item response refusal on items about gun ownership. Analyses of four distinct nationally representative samples suggest that racially conservative White respondents are more likely to refuse to respond to items concerned with gun ownership net of a host of relevant controls. Implications for the measurement of racial attitudes and gun‐related survey questions are discussed.

T1  - Labeling, causal attributions, and social network ties to people with mental illness
AN  - 2672382849
AB  - Evidence supports Allport's (1954) contention that social contact reduces mental illness stigma and promotes symptom recognition. However, an important limitation of existing research is that it typically relies on relatively simplistic measures of contact (e.g., any contact, number of contacts). Here, we build on prior work by examining how contact with persons with mental illness within social networks shapes labeling processes and beliefs about the causes of mental illness. Using egocentric network methods and vignette data from the 2018 General Social Survey (N = 1173), findings reveal that connections to valued ties (e.g., friends, family) that disconfirm commonly held stereotypes about people with mental illness contribute to improved recognition of mental illness and reduce the likelihood of endorsing stigmatizing beliefs about causes of mental illness. By using network theory and methods, this research extends current understanding of the role of contact by revealing not only whether contact matters, but how it matters and under what circumstances it may reduce prejudice and discrimination attached to mental illness in contemporary society.

T1  - Feelings of closeness toward Asian Americans: an analysis of African Americans and Black Caribbeans
AN  - 2659839088
AB  - Using data from a national sample, I examine Blacks’ feelings of closeness toward Asians in the United States. More specifically, I explore the following: (1) perceived closeness toward Asians, (2) correlates of perceived closeness, and (3) ethnic and national/cultural origin differences in perceived closeness. Results show that feelings of closeness toward Asians are rather similar between African Americans, Jamaicans, Haitians, Spanish-speaking Caribbeans, Trinidadians, and other English-speaking Caribbeans. Ethnic subgroup regression analyses reveal several interesting findings. Only among African Americans, everyday discrimination was negatively associated with feelings of closeness toward Asians. Living in the Northeast was positively correlated with perceived closeness toward Asians. Living in the Midwest, being married, financial strain, and higher educational attainment were correlates of closeness toward Asians only among Black Caribbeans. For Blacks overall, having immigrated to the United States more than 20 years ago was positively correlated with feelings of closeness toward Asians compared to native-born Blacks. While being female and everyday discrimination decreased feelings of closeness, positive Black group evaluation and higher religiosity levels increased feelings of closeness. Considering the growing diversity within the Black population in the United States to assess Black-Asian relations, these findings identify several correlates of their felt closeness toward Asians. These results can improve our understanding of Black-Asian relations more broadly, which is especially crucial given the unique dynamic between these two racial groups and ongoing perception of Black-Asian conflict.

T1  - Intergroup biologization and outgroup prejudice in the time of COVID‐19
AN  - 2618401647
AB  - Through two studies (N = 602) conducted in Italy between February and March 2020, we examined the impact of the COVID‐19 emergency on biologization—a form of dehumanization that involves the perception of others as contagious entities—and outgroup prejudice. Overall, results showed that higher emergency perception was associated with greater biologization toward the groups most affected by the virus, namely the Chinese outgroup and the Italian ingroup. In turn, biologization toward the outgroup increased prejudice against that group. We also found that when the pandemic hit Italy, the greater emergency perception was associated with increased emotional closeness with Chinese people, resulting in reduced biologization and prejudice toward them. However, these results held true only for Italian respondents who reported higher levels of ingroup biologization. Taken together, our findings contribute to the knowledge gaps of biologization and prejudice by also providing relevant insights into the ongoing health emergency.

T1  - Seeking and avoiding contact with Muslims at a Hijab Stall: Evidence for multilayer, multi‐determined solidarity, courage, apathy, and moral outrage
AN  - 2617654630
AB  - Intergroup contact is key to social cohesion, yet psychological barriers block engagement with diversity even when contact opportunities are abundant. We lack an advanced understanding of contact seeking because intergroup contact is often an independent variable in research, and studies on contact seeking have favoured experimental probing of selected factors or measured only broad behavioural intentions. This research carried out the first ecological tests of a novel multilayer‐multivariate framework to contact seeking/avoiding. These tests were centred on a Muslim‐led community contact‐based initiative with visible support from local authorities following a terrorist attack. Non‐Muslim Australian women (N = 1,347) contributed field data on their situated contact motivations, choices, and attendance at an intercultural educational stall; many (N = 559) completed a profiling test battery. Among those who responded to the initiative invite, the rate of taking up the high‐salience contact opportunity in this heated setting was high and reflected multiple approach/avoidance motivations. Contact seeking/avoiding was not just allophilia/prejudice; it presented as new typologies of politicized solidarity, courage, apathy, and moral outrage. While intergroup predictors were significant across all profiling analyses, intrapersonal and interpersonal predictors also regularly contributed to explain variance in non‐Muslims’ contact motivations and choices, confirming their multilayer‐multivariate nature.

T1  - Individuals in Default or the System? Race and Ethnicity, Stratification Views on Legal Debt, and Desire for Escalating Punishment
AN  - 2616575361
AB  - How do members of racial and ethnic groups explain the origins of unpaid legal debt from monetary sanctions, and how do such attributions undergird group differences in support for policy responses that escalate punishment? Using data from the Chicago Area Finances Survey, 2019, we apply an attributional typology of stratification beliefs to account for why legal debt from fines, fees, and tickets goes unpaid. We find differences in attribution types along key measures of socio-demographics and political values, and we identify racial differences in these attributions when other measures are held constant. How people understand why legal debt goes unpaid shapes their policy preferences as well, and they explain a small but significant fraction of racial and ethnic differences in the desire for punitive recourse.

T1  - Language, Discrimination and Employability: Employers’ Othering and Racist Representations of Domestic Migrant Workers on Social Media
AN  - 2608408624
AB  - Discursive othering deals with the many ways in which language is used to express prejudice against minorities, and it outlines the processes and conditions that promote group-based inequality and marginalization. This article focuses on online othering, and it analyzes a corpus of 615 comments posted by Hong Kong employers of domestic migrant workers (DMWs) on social media. First, a quantitative analysis of the corpus outlines the content categories found in the posts, and second, a discourse analysis of representative excerpts illustrates the claims made about DMWs. Employers engage in othering of their helpers, and the analysis shows how demeaning racist comments function to publicly shame them and warn others not to employ them. The article uses Language and Social Psychology frameworks to analyze the posts, and it discusses the functions of using racist derogatory language. The paper concludes by discussing how research may be used to address pressing social issues.

T1  - Why Do Immigrants Make Us More Authoritarian? The Impact of Direct and Normative Threat to Social Order from Outgroupers on Ingroup Authoritarianism
AN  - 2585642492
AB  - Inspired by the well-documented relationship between authoritarianism and prejudices, we tested whether a massive influx of immigrants can constitute social threats - direct (crimes, riots, violence) and normative (different norms, customs, values) - that increase ingroup authoritarian attitudes. Across two experimental studies (n1=251 and n2=230), we were able to show that both direct and normative threat to social order, originating from immigrants, lead to an increase in ingroup authoritarianism attitudes (Cohen’s d = 0.45–0.57), but do not impact the right-wing authoritarianism and cultural conservatism. The effect of threat on the rise of authoritarian attitudes was only partially and in a small degree mediated by collective security motivation. Implications for the authoritarianism-prejudices relationship and the functions of authoritarianism are discussed.

T1  - Integration policies and threat perceptions following the European migration crisis: New insights into the policy-threat nexus
AN  - 2616241282
AB  - The link between integration policies and intergroup attitudes or threat perceptions has received considerable attention. However, no studies so far have been able to explore how this relationship changed following the European migration crisis due to a lack of recent comparative policy data. Using new MIPEX data, this is the first study to examine mechanisms underlying the policy-threat nexus following the European migration crisis, distinguishing between several strands of integration policies, and realistic and symbolic threat. To do so, we combine 2017 Eurobarometer data with 2017 Migrant Integration Policy data, resulting in a sample of 28,080 respondents nested in 28 countries. The analyses also control for economic conditions, outgroup size, and media freedom. Multilevel analyses indicate that respondents living in countries with more inclusive integration policies in general report lower realistic and symbolic threat. When investigating different policy strands, we find that inclusive policies regarding political participation and access to nationality for immigrants are associated with lower realistic and symbolic threat. We compare our findings to those from prior to the European migration crisis and discuss the potential role of this crisis in the policy-threat nexus.

T1  - Sustaining peace through better resource governance: Three potential mechanisms for environmental peacebuilding
AN  - 2562923786
AB  - For international and domestic actors, post-conflict peacebuilding is one of the most difficult policy arenas to understand and in which to operate. Environmental and natural resource governance have the potential to facilitate peacebuilding in such contexts, but existing research has not yet produced a cohesive theoretical understanding of the pathways by which natural resource management strategies can facilitate positive peace. This paper explores the wider benefits of natural resource management and discusses their potential for reducing political fragility in affected states and helping to build positive peace. The paper outlines three mechanisms through which improved natural resource governance in post-conflict contexts is theorized to have positive effects on peace: (a) the contact hypothesis, whereby the facilitation of intergroup cooperation reduces bias and prejudice; (b) the diffusion of transnational norms, where the introduction of environmental and other good governance norms supports human empowerment and strengthens civil society; and (c) state service provision, where the provision of access to public services addresses the instrumental needs of communities, thereby strengthening their belief in the state. Guided by an interest in the opportunities presented by natural resource management to support peacebuilding processes in post-conflict states, the paper seeks to revise and advance the current environmental peacebuilding research agenda.

T1  - Predictors of Attitudes toward Lesbian and Gay Parenting in an Ecuadorian Sample
AN  - 2546813749
AB  - In the past few years, Ecuador has experienced legal changes toward the recognition of sexual minority rights. However, lesbian and gay (LG) individuals and couples still face legal obstacles to become parents and social barriers that place their families in disadvantage compared to their heterosexual counterparts. To date, it is not known whether the legal changes reflect society’s move toward a more progressive and accepting climate. This study analyzed the attitudes toward LG parenting in an Ecuadorian online-recruited sample. Three hundred thirty-eight (338) participants answered an online questionnaire about the negative effects and the benefits of having LG parents. The strongest belief among participants was that children of LG parents would be victimized because of their parents’ sexual orientation. Analyses indicated differences in attitudes based on age, sexual orientation, marital status, education level, as well as religiosity. Finally, regression models suggested that beliefs about the origins of sexual orientation and contact with LG people predicted attitude scores. Implications of these findings are discussed.

T1  - (De)humanization and (dis)trust: Representations of Muslims in the UK newspapers following the 7/7 London bombings
AN  - 2547612300
AB  - Dehumanization and distrust can have devastating consequences for intergroup relations. Until now, few studies have examined the ways in which both (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful discourse are presented in popular media. Recognizing the detrimental effects of terrorism on intergroup attitudes and the power of media in influencing social and political attitudes, the present research examined the frequency of (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful statements in newspaper coverage of the July 7, 2005, London bombings in the aftermath and at the 10-year anniversary of the attack. Drawing from theoretical work on dehumanization, it was expected that (de)humanizing content in media coverage about a stereotyped outgroup would be linked to (dis)trust of that group, and would also be linked to political orientation of the media source. Primary analyses were conducted using an existing manual coding framework for frequency of (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful statements. Results from the coding show that dehumanizing and distrusting discourse was more frequent than humanizing and trusting discourse. Whereas dehumanization was significantly correlated with distrust only in the right-wing source, humanization was significantly correlated with trust only in the left-wing source. The findings advance theoretical understandings of (de)humanization and humanization as they manifest in media discourse following a terrorist event, and how these relate to outgroup (dis)trust.

T1  - Intercultural Relations Among Guinean Immigrants Living in Portugal: Testing Multiculturalism, Contact, and Integration Hypotheses
AN  - 2538435180
AB  - This study tests several specific predictions derived from three general core hypotheses of intercultural relations (multiculturalism, contact, and integration hypotheses). The participants were 405 migrants from Guinea-Bissau (51 percent women). Their average age was 38 years. The average length of stay in Portugal was 18 years. Data collection involved the completion of questionnaires to measure multicultural ideology, security, cultural identity, contact, perceived discrimination, acculturation strategies, mental health problems, sociocultural adaptation, and tolerance. In concert with the multiculturalism hypothesis, security and cultural identity positively predicted multicultural ideology. The contact hypothesis was partially confirmed given that intercultural contact did not predict perceived discrimination, although contact predicted national identity. Regarding the integration hypothesis, integration strategy predicted psychological and intercultural adaptations, while the predictors of sociocultural adaptation were assimilation and marginalization. Hence, the integration hypothesis obtained partial support for migrants from Guinea-Bissau residing in Portugal. Finally, some implications of the findings are discussed. This study contributes to extending the integration hypothesis to a recently suggested new form of adaptation, intercultural adaptation. Feelings of being secure in the larger society and one's identity contributes to higher acceptance of diversity.

T1  - The impact of symbolic boundaries on perceptions of relations between Japan and South Korea
AN  - 2494717354
AB  - This paper argues the perceptions of relations between two nations involve not only the institutionalized national-boundary but also the perspectives of multiple symbolic boundaries. Based on a qualitative study, this paper aims to explain how different symbolic boundaries impact Japanese experts’ perception of interrelations between Japan and the Republic of Korea (South Korea). The paper includes an analysis of opinion surveys, 20 semi-structured interviews with experts, and three focus group interviews with university students of Peace Studies Departments conducted throughout June and July of 2018 in Tokyo, Japan. These results advance existing scholarship by showing that Japanese experts use the following four symbolic boundaries to comprehend relations between Japan and South Korea: boundaries between (1) victims and perpetrators; (2) ‘the West’ and the Asian cultural and political space; (3) nationalistic and peaceful countries; and (4) a state and people.

T1  - Justice: The Racial Motive We All Have and Need
AN  - 2492207568
AB  - This essay posits that justice is the core value epitomizing our moment. Justice is violated when positive outcomes are undeserved, and the felt sense of injustice motivates a need for retribution. Because politics involves allocation (distribution and redistribution), deservingness is a core appraisal of “who gets what” and therefore justice is fundamental for politics. This is especially germane to race, ethnicity, and politics scholars. I present a few core tenets of justice theory, and argue that political science can take advantage of the moment to engage the concept of justice; especially as it relates to the study of racial attitudes and the identification of racial enablers—those ostensible non-racists who facilitate the status quo. Summarily, I propose that justice can unify debates over prejudice and politics, and advance our scholarly understanding of how well-intentioned people—regardless of their identities, or ideological or partisan labels—can facilitate racism, racial inequality, and injustice.

T1  - Re-envisioning Caribbean Costa Rica: Chinese-West Indian Interaction in Limón during the Late Nineteenth and Early Twentieth Centuries
AN  - 2541405200
AB  - While West Indians constituted a much larger immigrant group in the port of Limón, Costa Rica and its environs, Chinese also migrated there during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In hopes of maintaining their culture and in response to the prejudice they faced, both groups formed their own tightknit transnational sub-communities. Nevertheless, they also interacted with each other. These interactions ranged from tension and conflict on the one hand, to routine, peaceful interaction and even collaboration on the other. In particular, class differences and the marginalization these groups experienced combined to produce this complex relationship. Tension and conflict often emerged due to both sides hoping to move up the social ladder and because of the economic power that many Chinese held as shopkeepers and lenders. Nevertheless, as groups experiencing social marginalization and living in proximity to each other, they could develop neutral or positive social and economic relationships.

T1  - Supporting immigrant cultural rights: The roles of deprovincialization and identity continuity
AN  - 2466764764
AB  - This research examines the role of deprovincialization, conceptualized in terms of a nuanced perspective on one’s in‐group culture, for majority members’ support for immigrants’ cultural practices and expressive rights. In three studies using data from samples drawn from nationally representative panels in the Netherlands (additionally analyzed in an internal meta‐analysis of N = 1,791), it was found that deprovincialization is a unique and robust predictor of support for immigrant rights, above and beyond prejudicial feelings, political orientation, level of education, gender, age, and religious affiliation. Furthermore, deprovincialization was found to be independent of national identification, which in previous research has been used as a proxy for deprovincialization. Additionally and in trying to conceptually replicate the pattern of findings (Studies 2 and 3), two different measures of perceived concern about the continuity of the in‐group culture and identity were found to weaken the deprovincialization‐support association. The findings go beyond existing research by focusing on the cultural openness understanding of deprovincialization and demonstrating the robust importance of how majority members understand their in‐group for their support of immigrants’ practices and rights.

T1  - The interplay of individual differences, norms, and group identification in predicting prejudiced behavior in online video game interactions
AN  - 2458939624
AB  - Despite the increasing popularity of video games and the diversity of people who play, prejudice remains common in online gaming. In the current study, we use structural equation modeling to test the role of social norms, individual differences, and gamer identification as predictors of how likely someone is to report engaging in prejudiced behavior while playing online video games. We also test the relative importance of these predictors to assess how likely people are to confront prejudice when it occurs in online video games. Participants (N = 384) completed a series of questionnaires to assess their attitudes and perceptions of online gaming norms, as well as to report their own prejudiced and confrontation behavior in video games. We found that both social norms and individual differences are significant predictors of behavior in online gaming. The more normative people report prejudice to be, the more they report making prejudiced comments. Similarly, the more normative confrontation of prejudice is reported to be, the more likely people are to report confronting prejudice. The more people endorsed generally prejudiced attitudes, the more likely they were to report making prejudiced remakes in online gaming and the less likely they were to report confronting prejudiced remarks. These results provide a foundation to inform interventions to reduce prejudice in gaming and indicate that both individual differences and norms are important to consider when designing interventions.

T1  - Prejudice Against Gender and Sexual Diversity in Brazilian Public High Schools
AN  - 2421635755
AB  - This paper is the result of a research that evaluated the levels of prejudice against sexual and gender minorities within 28 Brazilian public schools. The research considered a sample of 413 teachers, 97 employees, and 1829 students from 28 public high schools, located in four Brazilian states: Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais, Ceará, and Pernambuco. All of them answered a questionnaire on sociodemographic data, the revised version of the Prejudice Against Sexual and Gender Diversity scale. The resulting analysis highlighted that religious individuals and followers of the Neo-Pentecostal church in the three study groups presented higher levels of prejudice than the other groups involved. All groups that have done previous training in the subject of prejudice presented inferior scores to those that had not done. Individuals that stated they have gay man, lesbian woman, travestis persons, or transsexual persons as friends, relatives, and acquaintances in the groups of teachers and students presented a lower level of prejudice compared to those who did not have relationships with people with these characteristics. Our results suggest the need for methodological changes in schools so that institutions can prepare their curriculum and their pedagogical practices considering the current multiple existing sexual and gender orientations.

T1  - Flagging difference: Identification and emotional responses to national flags
AN  - 2398195802
AB  - Flags can be thought of as representations designed to unite the national community. Emotional responses are seen as being particularly important in driving allegiances to flags. In societies affected by conflict, where the nation itself is contested, emotional responses to national symbols however, have the potential to be divisive. In this study, using a large scale sample in Northern Ireland, emotional responses to the in‐group and out‐group flags and their relationship to national identities are considered. 1,179 respondents reported their self‐categorized national identity, as well as explicit emotional responses to both in‐group and out‐group flags. The strength of identification with preferred national group, British, Irish, or Northern Irish, was also measured. Emotional responses to in‐group flags were significantly related to both strength of national identification and the type of emotion, annoyed, hopeful, satisfied, or uneasy, under consideration. Weaker emotional responses and different emotions were reported in response to out‐group flags. The results of the study are interpreted as consistent with appraisal and intergroup emotions theory which suggests the strongest emotional responses are evidenced in response to symbols of one's own group. The importance of emotions to understanding the dynamics of intergroup conflict, and in Northern Ireland in particular, is also discussed.

T1  - Sympathy as knowledge of the other in need: An investigation into the roles of need for closure and the moral foundations on sympathy toward immigrants
AN  - 2387130371
AB  - Although sympathy is a powerful other‐focused motivation, not all individuals will experience sympathy when it is appropriate. Immigrants, as a disadvantaged out‐group, are especially in need of sympathy and, given the tensions of the immigration debate, are at‐risk for low sympathy. Indeed, past research has found that sympathy is less likely to be experienced toward disliked out‐groups. In the current research, we investigated the role of need for closure (NFC), or the general desire for epistemic certainty, on the experience of sympathy toward immigrants in Italy, a nation where the immigration debate is becoming increasingly fractious. Consistent with past research on the roles of NFC and the binding moral foundations (i.e., a concern for the well‐being of groups) on prejudice toward out‐groups, we propose that individuals with a high NFC, and who endorsed the binding moral foundations (i.e., a concern for the well‐being of groups), would be particularly likely to have decreased sympathy toward immigrants in Italy. In line with past research and our hypotheses, in three studies we found that the binding foundations mediated the NFC effect on decreased sympathy toward immigrants in Italy. Conceptually, these individuals can strongly adopt traditional cultural norms as a way to acquire stable knowledge; this can make sympathy toward immigrants less likely, as they both stand outside “traditional” morality, as well can threaten the stability of natives’ knowledge.

T1  - Infectious Disease Prevalence, Not Race Exposure, Predicts Both Implicit and Explicit Racial Prejudice Across the United States
AN  - 2385919782
AB  - What factors increase racial prejudice? Across the United States, increased exposure to Black Americans has been hypothesized to increase White Americans’ prejudicial attitudes toward Black Americans. Here we test an alternative explanation: People living in regions with higher infectious disease rates have a greater tendency to avoid out-groups because such avoidance reduces their perceived likelihood of contracting illnesses. Consistent with this parasite-stress hypothesis, we show that both White and Black individuals (N > 77,000) living in U.S. states in which disease rates are higher display increased implicit (automatic) and explicit (conscious) racial prejudice. These results survived the inclusion of several individual- and state-level controls previously used to explain variability in prejudice. Furthermore, showing disease-related primes to White individuals with strong germ aversion increased their explicit, but not implicit, anti-Black/pro-White prejudice. Domestic out-groups, not just foreigners, may therefore experience increased overt forms of prejudice when disease rates are high.

T1  - Exposure to intergroup conspiracy theories promotes prejudice which spreads across groups
AN  - 2337009014
AB  - This research experimentally examined the effects of exposure to intergroup conspiracy theories on prejudice and discrimination. Study 1 (N = 166) demonstrated that exposure to conspiracy theories concerning immigrants to Britain from the European Union (vs. anti‐conspiracy material or a control) exacerbated prejudice towards this group. Study 2 (N = 173) found the same effect in a different intergroup context – exposure to conspiracy theories about Jewish people (vs. anti‐conspiracy material or a control) increased prejudice towards this group and reduced participants’ willingness to vote for a Jewish political candidate. Finally, Study 3 (N = 114) demonstrated that exposure to conspiracy theories about Jewish people not only increased prejudice towards this group but was indirectly associated with increased prejudice towards a number of secondary outgroups (e.g., Asians, Arabs, Americans, Irish, Australians). The current research suggests that conspiracy theories may have potentially damaging and widespread consequences for intergroup relations.

T1  - Minority Stress, Parenting Styles, and Mental Health in Brazilian Homosexual Men
AN  - 2364109810
AB  - Homosexual men are constantly exposed to prejudice and violence in Brazil. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between minority stress, parenting styles, and indicators of mental health problems in a sample of homosexual men. Method: quantitative, cross-sectional, correlational, and retrospective design. Participants were 101 Brazilian men who selfidentified as homosexuals, aged between 18 and 55 years. Results: concealing sexual identity was a predictor of depression and stress. Parental responsiveness was associated with a lower incidence of enacted stigma and depression. Conclusions: the mental health of homosexual men can be negatively affected by the need to conceal their sexual orientation. Parental responsiveness is a protective factor in terms of experiencing enacted stigma and depression. The results found in the study may be useful for counselors and social workers who are working with LGBT people and their families.

T1  - Structural stigma and all-cause mortality among sexual minorities: Differences by sexual behavior?
AN  - 2355955710
AB  - Using updated data from the General Social Survey/National Death Index (GSS/NDI) study, we examined whether the relationship between structural stigma-measured by aggregating 4 items assessing prejudice towards homosexuality to the community level-and all-cause mortality is present among gay men/lesbian women. Our hypothesis is based on emerging evidence that indicators of structural stigma specific to homosexuality, such as those used in the GSS/NDI, uniquely predict health outcomes among this group. Because the GSS/NDI lacked an identity-based measure of sexual orientation, we tested our hypothesis by employing a strategy that has a relatively high degree of sensitivity and specificity for ascertaining individuals most likely to identify as gay or lesbian: restricting analyses to individuals who reported same-sex sexual partners in the past year. We compared this approach against an alternative strategy, which has weaker specificity for identifying gay men/lesbian women: restricting analyses to individuals who reported any lifetime same-sex sexual behaviors. After controlling for 6 individual-level factors and fixed effects of survey year, structural stigma was associated with mortality among individuals who reported past-year same-sex sexual partners (HR = 1.95, 95% CI: 1.14, 3.31). Further, there was a dose-response relationship with mortality in this group, such that those residing in communities in the highest quartile of structural stigma had the greatest mortality risk, controlling for these same factors (HR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.03, 4.38). In sensitivity analyses, the effect size for structural stigma ranged from 1.54 to 2.30, indicating a consistent, but small-to-moderate, effect. In contrast, no association between structural stigma and mortality was observed among respondents who reported lifetime same-sex sexual partners, nor among those reporting only opposite-sex sexual partners. This analysis therefore delimits potential boundary conditions of the association between structural stigma related to same-sex sexuality and all-cause mortality, highlighting the conditions under which this association is (and is not) observed.

T1  - In Two Minds: Similarity, Threat, and Prejudice Contribute to Worse Mindreading of Outgroups Compared With an Ingroup
AN  - 2327883887
AB  - We examined Turkish participants’ mindreading accuracy toward ingroup versus outgroup targets. Three hundred and fifty-four Turkish participants were randomly assigned to one of three target groups: Turkish, Syrian, or Norwegian. The mindreading accuracy for these targets was measured along with the perceived cultural similarity of the target to the ingroup, as well as prejudice and threat perception. Participants evidenced higher mindreading accuracy toward Turkish targets compared with Syrian and Norwegian targets. Mindreading accuracy for the Syrian and Norwegian targets did not differ, but lower perceived similarity to the Turkish ingroup significantly predicted lower mentalizing for Syrian and Norwegians. In the Syrian target group, lower perceived similarity interacted with lower education and higher prejudice, resulting in a further reduction in mindreading. For Norwegian targets, lower similarity impaired mindreading through an interaction with higher threat perception. Results indicate that even when mentalizing capacity is mature, intergroup factors are linked with the deployment of mindreading.

T1  - Family Communication and Messages about Race and Identity in Black Families in the United States
AN  - 2283393895
AB  - Racial minority families engage in "racial socialization," the process by which individuals develop meaning and understanding of what race is, and its implications. While parents are often seen as the site of this socialization, we wanted to explore which racial socialization messages were salient for young adults, and from whom they received these messages. This paper utilized focus groups to explore messages that young Black adults received about race, and what this means for their racial identity. We identified three dominant themes in our analyses: (a) the content of familial messages regarding race, identity, and prejudice, (b) critical incidents that shaped individuals' understandings of Black racial identity, and (c) familial sources. Each of these themes is constituted by various experiences and examples that shed light on racial socialization in today's social climate. Overall, parents, extended family members, and community members were sources of socializing what race meant to young Black adults. We discuss implications for research on racial socialization and family communication.

T1  - Race, Ethnicity, and the American Criminal Justice System: The Perceptions and Experiences of West Indian Men
AN  - 2274303528
AB  - Using in-depth interview data from 30 young Black men of West Indian background, we examine their experiences with and perceptions of the American criminal justice system. Their experiences lead these men to contend that the system, especially police authorities, do not differentiate between Blacks based on ethnicity and subsequently treat West Indians and African Americans in a similar manner, that is, race trumps ethnicity. These men discuss their concerns about stereotypes of minorities, especially as they are reflected in the media, as the primary reasons for their treatment. However, these men also provide nuanced accounts in which not all system actors engage in discriminatory behavior. These accounts rest on an immigrant lens regarding criminal justice, which may indicate a more favorable outlook compared to their native-born Black counterparts. Overall, though, the interview data suggest that a Black–White divide regarding such perceptions will persist in an era of substantial sociodemographic change.

T1  - Outsider Privileges Can Lead to Insider Disadvantages: Some Psychosocial Aspects of Ableism
AN  - 2295332055
AB  - People with disabilities are sometimes described as an invisible minority group, one that frequently encounters ableism in the course of daily life. Ableism entails biased ideas and assumptions, as well as prejudicial attitudes and discriminatory acts, aimed at people with disabilities. This article examines how and why ableism poses distinct social and psychological privileges for outsiders (the nondisabled) and resulting disadvantages for insiders (people with disabilities). Four theories accounting for outsiders’ ableism directed at insiders are presented: just world theory, mourning, suffering and meaning, and the fundamental negative bias. The consequences of ableism for people with disabilities are then discussed, including internalized ableism, deindividuation, stigmatization and stereotyping, and the problems posed by benign ableism. I argue that sometimes ableism represents a form of outsider privilege, one allowing nondisabled people to feel, think, and act in ways that often unknowingly promote their social and psychological interests over people with disabilities. I then conclude the article by calling for efforts to better educate nondisabled people regarding guidelines for constructively engaging people with disabilities as a matter of social policy.

T1  - Interability Contact and the Reduction of Interability Prejudice: Communication Accommodation, Intergroup Anxiety, and Relational Solidarity
AN  - 2273144440
AB  - Guided by intergroup contact and communication accommodation theories, this study tested the effects of U.S. participants’ (N = 286) communication with their most frequent contact who had a visible physical disability and its effects on attitudes toward and stereotypes of people with disabilities as a whole. As predicted, mediation analysis showed the type of interability contact (i.e., nonfamily = 1 and family = 2), and participants’ perceptions of their own communication accommodation during interability interactions with the contact had significant indirect effects on the improvement of attitudes toward and reduction of stereotypes about people with disabilities through relational solidarity and intergroup anxiety as sequential mediators. In addition, communication accommodation had significant positive direct effects on intergroup attitudes. These findings provide insights into the important role played by interability contact, especially in the family context and communication accommodation in developing positive relationships in order to reduce anxiety, prejudices, and biases toward people with disabilities.

T1  - Ethnic diversity and attitudes towards refugees
AN  - 2261189314
AB  - The recent surge in refugee arrivals to Europe has underscored the importance of identity concerns, with politicians and ordinary citizens alike expressing fear that admitting foreigners may result in unacceptable demographic and cultural change. However, scholars have not systematically examined the impact of ethnic diversity on attitudes towards refugees. Group threat theory and the contact hypothesis offer competing predictions: The former would expect diversity to be associated with opposition to refugees, while the latter would expect diversity to generate support for them. We explore individual-level attitudes in nineteen countries using the 2014 wave of the European Social Survey, combined with country-level data from the World Bank's World Development Indicators, the Manifesto Project Dataset, and five different databases of ethnic diversity measures. Crucially, we employ multiple approaches to measuring diversity, including various measures of ethnic fractionalisation, linguistic heterogeneity, polarisation, and other relevant constructs. We find that greater ethnic diversity is associated with decreased support for refugees, but this relationship is not consistent across all measures of diversity. Since the relationship between ethnic diversity and support for refugees is highly dependent on the measure of diversity used, scholars should be wary of drawing strong conclusions about the effects of ethnic diversity without comparing different measures.

T1  - The way of the world: How heterosexism shapes and distorts male same-sexuality, a thesis
AN  - 2259257024
AB  - This article develops a thesis about heterosexism and how it may function to shape and distort the sexuality of men who have sex with men. It is based on observations of cultural portrayals and beliefs regarding male same-sexual behavior, compared with research evidence on male same-sexual behavior. The impact of heterosexism on both the public's imagination of gay male sexuality and the likely effect of internalized heterosexism on gay male behavior is discussed. In brief, cultural beliefs about male same-sexual behavior are widespread, yet are not supported by the research evidence on sexual behavior. The impact has been a devaluation of certain forms of erotic expression, the perpetuation of negative stereotypes, and a presumed socio-sexual hierarchy, all of which contribute to the oppression of sexual minorities, while leaving the general public uninformed and more subject to personal assumptions and prejudices.

T1  - Are hafus 'dirty' or 'special'? Negotiating mixed-race identities among Japanese-Indonesian youths in Indonesia
AN  - 2198983133
AB  - This is one of the first papers to examine the experiences of mixed-race individuals who have one Japanese parent, commonly referred to as 'hafu', living outside of Japan. Specifically, it analyzes the experiences of Japanese-Indonesians living in Indonesia who have attended an overseas Japanese school and an Indonesian or international school in Indonesia or elsewhere. Japan's dual positioning - as inferior to the West and superior to the Rest - impacts upon the experiences of mixed-race individuals in varying ways depending on the predominant discourse operating at the school. At the Japanese school, the discourse of Japanese superiority, which draws on both the cultural legacy of Japanese imperialism and contemporary regional socio-economic hierarchy, deemed the hafus as inferior in relation to their Japanese peers for not being 'pure' Japanese. At the Indonesian school, the regional hierarchy deemed the hafus as superior in relation to their Indonesian peers. In these cases, mixed-race individuals find themselves on opposite ends of Japan's dual positioning. Finally, at the English-medium international school, the cosmopolitan discourse that privileges mixedness (and western cultural capital) at times inverted the positionality of those who were of mixed descent in relation to their Japanese peers. The paper discusses the way hafus submit to, negotiate or challenge the prevailing discourses through the use of varying strategies (sometimes depending on gender) such as performing Japaneseness or bicultural competence, constructing social distance, or physically fighting. Furthermore, the paper extends the application of methodological transnationalism to analyze the way multiple regional and global discourses intersect to simultaneously and situationally affect hafu experiences.

T1  - Ethnic diversity, ethnic threat, and social cohesion: (re)-evaluating the role of perceived out-group threat and prejudice in the relationship between community ethnic diversity and intra-community cohesion
AN  - 2166693532
AB  - Research frequently demonstrates diverse communities exhibit lower intra-community cohesion. Recent studies suggest there is little evidence perceived ethnic threat plays a role in this relationship. This paper re-examines the roles of ethnic threat and prejudice in the diversity/cohesion relationship. First, we test threat/prejudice as conceptualised in the literature: as mediators of diversity's effect. Second, we test a reformulation of the roles of threat/prejudice: as moderators of diversity's effect. Applying multi-level models to cross-sectional and longitudinal data of White British individuals across England and Oldham (a unique English town case-study) we find neighbour-trust lower in diverse communities. However, perceived-threat/prejudice does not mediate this relationship. Instead, we find perceived-threat/prejudice moderate diversity's impact on neighbour-trust. The result is diversity only reduces neighbour-trust among individuals who already viewed out-groups as threatening. Longitudinal analysis confirms the importance of out-group attitudes in the diversity/neighbour-trust relationship. In diverse communities, residents whose out-group attitudes improve, or worsen, become more, or less, trusting of their neighbours. However, in homogeneous communities, changes in out-group attitudes are not linked to changes in neighbour-trust. We therefore argue and demonstrate that perceived-threat emerges from other societal processes (such as socio-economic precariousness) and it is when individuals who already view out-groups as threatening experience diverse neighbourhoods that local cohesion declines.

T1  - The Politics of Homosexuality: Perseverance of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) Community in a Repressive Social Milieu in Afghanistan
AN  - 2239162573
AB  - In Afghanistan, minorities are subjected to harassment, intimidation and even death by Islamic fanatics and conservative leaders as they try to impose their own interpretation of religious scriptures and punish those who do not agree with their interpretation of religious precepts and follow their rulings. Application of such measures has impacted the safety and security of the gender-minority community, as its members are forced to hide their identities, and cannot speak about their sexual orientation. Government agencies and civil society organizations do not advocate for the rights of this community, and deliberately avoid any discussion about them, fearing a backlash from religious vigilantes, conservative religious leaders and clerics. A lack of public education and social awareness programs about the gender-minority community has contributed to the perpetuation of discrimination, hatred and bigotry toward them − a community that is part and parcel of the social fabric of modern Afghanistan.

T1  - A Potential Case of Linguistic Prejudice: The Expression of Identity in ‘Black and White’
AN  - 1973272696
AB  - The existence of a race-based stigma has been well documented among adolescents and young adults within higher educational settings; however, similar studies among students at historically Black universities are rare. Specifically, the ‘acting white’ accusation is a common, and yet seldom openly discussed phenomenon that exist within the African American community. This type of stigma is often relegated to certain characteristics (i.e., behaviors, preferences, etc.) that may defy individual and collective assumptions regarding African Americans. Utilizing nearly 200 student questionnaires, this study identified the extent to which speaking correct English as well as other specific behaviors are associated with being accused of acting white. This process incorporated the use of bivariate correlation and regression models. Findings suggest that speaking correct English as well as the existence of other factors (i.e., preferences in dress, associations, etc.) are significantly related to the accusation. This includes both experiential and nonexperimental student responses. In determining predictor variables, those who experience as well as how they respond to the accusation revealed statistical significance. The study concludes by offering areas of further research as well as suggested policy implications within higher educational settings. This includes an examination of complex and multilayered aspects of identity among minority groups within academic environments.

T1  - Islamophobia, war and non-Muslims as victims: an analysis of online discourse on an English Defence League message board
AN  - 2043766637
AB  - This article analyses 845 posts across 78 threads on an English Defence League message board from 20 September 2013 to 4 October 2013 that examined how online activists construct and develop their racial prejudice. Through seeing whites as blameless victims, the posts highlighted the presence of hostility towards Islam and Muslims in a clear in-group and out-group racial binary, where racist comments were never contested or challenged. Rather, they were wholeheartedly supported with social and cultural division at the centre of the prejudice, scapegoating and stereotyping directed towards Islam and Muslims. For a movement that presents itself as anti-racist, the real-life everyday narrative indicates the reality of its most ardent supporters.

T1  - Health Providers' Narratives on Intimate Partner Violence Against Roma Women in Spain
AN  - 2082950785
AB  - This qualitative study identifies health professionals' dominant, adaptive, and liberating narratives regarding inter-ethnic relations when talking about intimate partner violence (IPV) and the health system responses to the way it affects Roma women. Dominant narratives are oppressive internalized stories that shape social perceptions of members of both dominant and minority groups, adaptive narratives refer to those that acknowledge asymmetry and inequality, and liberating narratives directly challenge oppression with resistant views of stereotypes and negative interpretations. A total of 25 in-depth interviews were carried out with healthcare professionals in Spain in 2015. A discourse analysis of the interview transcriptions was conducted, showing the way in which different narratives about Roma people and IPV are combined among health providers. Dominant narratives were more salient: they were used by health providers to reflect prejudicial social perceptions in Spain that depict the Roma as a marginalized and traditional group, to construct Roma women in negative and prejudicial terms as patients, and to explain the existence of the cultural normalization of IPV among Roma women. Adaptive and liberating narratives showed a prevailing ideology in terms of the tendency to socially discriminate against Roma people. Using liberating narratives to train and raise awareness among health professionals about IPV among Roma women could facilitate a positive change in their treatment of Roma women who could be affected by IPV, helping to ameliorate the maintenance of existing prejudices.

T1  - The Pitfalls and Promise of Increasing Racial Diversity: Threat, Contact, and Race Relations in the 21st Century
AN  - 2052687203
AB  - A decades-long trend toward greater racial and ethnic diversity in the United States is expected to continue, with White Americans projected to constitute less than 50% of the national population by mid century. The present review integrates recent empirical research on the effects of making this population change salient with research on how actual diversity affects Whites Americans’ intergroup attitudes and behavior. Specifically, we offer a framework for understanding and predicting the effects of anticipated increases in racial diversity that highlights the competing influences of intergroup concerns, such as relative group status and power, and more interpersonal experiences, such as positive contact, on intergroup relations. We close with a discussion of the likely moderators of the effects of the increasing national racial diversity and consider implications of this societal change for racial equity in the 21st century.

T1  - The ironic impact of intergroup apologies on intergroup attitudes: Understanding the role of perceived power for post‐apology outgroup attitudes
AN  - 2084437556
AB  - The present research investigates how intergroup apologies, defined as apologies between two groups, affect perceived remorse and outgroup attitudes (e.g., explicit and implicit), in the context of power asymmetries. We recruited participants from two countries that differ in perceived power: South Korea and the United States. Participants read a vignette describing a violent act committed by an outgroup member (Korean or American), with or without an intergroup apology. Participants answered questions assessing perceived remorse and explicit attitudes toward the outgroup, followed by the Implicit Association Test (Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998). Results revealed that Koreans perceived less remorse following an intergroup apology from the United States, compared to when they did not read an intergroup apology. Further, a mediated moderation analysis indicated that perceived remorse mediated the relationship between apology and explicit attitudes towards the United States. However, an analogous effect for implicit attitudes was only marginally significant. In contrast, among American participants, no effect of the apology on perceived remorse, explicit attitudes, or implicit attitudes and no evidence for a mediation was found. We discuss the implications of these effects on understanding the effectiveness of intergroup apologies between countries that differ in perceived power.

T1  - Unpacking Chinese America: The Political Participation of Taiwanese Americans in the Early Twenty-First-Century United States
AN  - 2157620365
AB  - Who are (or can count as) Taiwanese Americans? To what extent and in what ways do they participate politically in the United States? This study attempts to unpack the concept of Chineseness by examining various formations of identity boundaries of Taiwanese Americans. We empirically assess their “success” in political participation and incorporation by analyzing patterns of political participation of U.S. voting-age adults who were born in or originated from Taiwan, as compared to those who were born in or originated from (Mainland) China and Asia as a whole. We argue that Taiwanese Americans occupy a distinct space in modern Asian American history and a better understanding of the experiences of this often overlooked and misunderstood community can further explicate the complexity of being Chinese in contemporary America. However, we discuss multiple sets of methodological challenges in systematically studying the population through U.S. census survey and several other types of quantitative data. Whereas we find immigrants originated from Taiwan to be generally more active in electoral politics than those from Mainland China, our findings challenge the pluralist assumptions of a linear process of political incorporation and reject an overtly simplistic characterization of Taiwanese Americans as a “model-minority” success story.

T1  - Making a difference in medical trainees' attitudes toward Latino patients: A pilot study of an intervention to modify implicit and explicit attitudes
AN  - 2070444316
AB  - Negative attitudes and discrimination against Latinos exist in the dominant U.S. culture and in healthcare systems, contributing to ongoing health disparities. This article provides findings of a pilot test of Yo Veo Salud (I See Health), an intervention designed to positively modify attitudes toward Latinos among medical trainees. The research question was: Compared to the comparison group, did the intervention group show lower levels of implicit bias against Latinos versus Whites, and higher levels of ethnocultural empathy, healthcare empathy, and patient-centeredness? We used a sequential cohort, post-test design to evaluate Yo Veo Salud with a sample of 69 medical trainees. The intervention setting was an academic medical institution in a Southeastern U.S. state with a fast-growing Latino population. The intervention was delivered, and data were collected online, between July and December of 2014. Participants in the intervention group showed greater ethnocultural empathy, healthcare empathy, and patient-centeredness, compared to the comparison group. The implicit measure assessed four attitudinal dimensions (pleasantness, responsibility, compliance, and safety). Comparisons between our intervention and comparison groups did not find any average differences in implicit anti-Latino bias between the groups. However, in a subset analysis of White participants, White participants in the intervention group demonstrated a significantly decreased level of implicit bias in terms of pleasantness. A dose response was also founded indicating that participants involved in more parts of the intervention showed more change on all measures. Our findings, while modest in size, provide proof of concept for Yo Veo Salud as a means for increasing ethno-cultural and physician empathy, and patient-centeredness among medical residents and decreasing implicit provider bias toward Latinos.

T1  - Latino Millennials—The New Diverse Workforce: Challenges and Opportunities
AN  - 2002365462
AB  - There are a variety of trends that are enabling and forcing organizational change. A crucial trend that has implications for a changing and growing demographic workforce includes Millennials and in particular Latinos/Hispanics as the world and particularly the U.S. workplace continues to have an increased aging workforce. Yet, while Latinos are members of the largest and also the fastest growing minority group in the United States, they are disproportionately underrepresented in more highly compensated professional and leadership roles across corporate America. The majority of existing career development and acculturation literature in the United States has focused narrowly on Anglo-oriented acculturation as a linear process. Unfortunately, as society has evolved so has the form of prejudices and biases. This is supported by the fact that well more than 50% of Hispanics experience discrimination through a variety of means including micro-aggressions. We believe that developing and maintaining an overlapping and compatible bicultural identity might not be enough and that we need to rethink what acculturation and biculturalism means for millennials and broaden our thinking to include cosmopolitanism as more encompassing of the millennials and their place in the world. We believe this article begins the dialogue for more research into this growing part of the U.S. workforce along with practical implications and applications.

T1  - Globalization, Ageing Process and Attitudes of Younger Generations to Ageing
TT  - GLOBALIZACIJA, PROCES STARENJA I STAVOVI MLAĐIH GENERACIJA PREMA STARENJU
AN  - 2187918351
AB  - Due to the increase of aging population in all societies, it seems important to explore this issue from different aspects in order to improve the position of the elderly and recognise their contribution to the society. The aim of this study was to examine the experiences and views of the Generation Z on the discrimination and prejudices against the elderly. There were 6 participants in the focus group, 4 girls and 2 boys, all of whom belong to the Generation Z. The data was collected in the focus group who answered open-ended questions. Results of the qualitative research indicate: 1) that there is an unfavourable attitude towards the elderly in the investigated group of children; 2) causes of discrimination against the elderly; 3) prejudice against the elderly. Encouraging the society to provide better education (especially for children and young people), direct contact with the elderly (organising exchange of experience and transfer of traditional and cultural values), as well as better presentation of ageing and old age in the media would contribute to the decrease of global ageing and improve attitude of the younger generation towards ageing animosity. Family has the main influence on young people’s views and it is necessary to motivate parents to present ageing and old age in a favourable light. Furthermore, it is important to work with the elderly in terms of empowerment and developing a more positive self-image.Alternate abstract:S obzirom na porast udjela starije populacije u većini društava, čini se važnim istražiti ovu problematiku s različitih aspekata u cilju poboljšanja položaja starijih i prepoznavanja njihovog doprinosa u društvu. Cilj istraživanja bio je ispitati iskustva i mišljenja generacije Z, o predrasudama i diskriminaciji prema starijim osobama. Ispitanici su bili mlađe životne dobi, prema starosti pripadaju generaciji Z. Podaci su prikupljeni putem fokus grupe, a koristila su se pitanja otvorenog tipa. Rezultati kvalitativnog istraživanja ukazuju na: 1) nepovoljan odnos društva prema starijim osobama, 2) uzroke diskriminacije starijih osoba, 3) predrasude prema starijim osobama. Bolja edukacija (posebno djece i mladih), neposredni kontakt sa starijim osobama (omogućavanje susreta za razmjenu iskustava te prenošenja tradicijskih i kulturnih vrijednosti), te bolja medijska prezentacija starenja i starosti doprinijela bi smanjenju globalizacije starenja i boljem odnosu mlađih generacija prema starenju. Važan utjecaj na poglede mladih ima obitelj i potrebno je motivirati roditelje da pozitivno prezentiraju starenje i starost. Također, važno je raditi i sa starijim osobama u smislu njihovog osnaživanja i razvijanja pozitivnije slike o sebi.

T1  - “<i>What do you call a Black guy who flies a plane?</i>”: The effects and understanding of disparagement and confrontational racial humor
AN  - 2067925356
AB  - AbstractWe conducted three studies to test our overarching hypothesis that racial humor may increase or decrease subsequent expressions of prejudice by setting social norms that indicate prejudice is either more or less acceptable, respectively. We selected riddles that were disparaging, confrontational, or neutral, and examined their effects on subsequent prejudiced expressions. We predicted humor that disparaged Blacks would convey that prejudiced expressions are more socially acceptable, resulting in increased expressions of prejudice toward Blacks. Conversely, we predicted humor that confronted prejudiced expressions would convey that prejudiced expressions are less socially acceptable, resulting instead in reduced expressions of prejudice toward Blacks. Our studies demonstrated that, consistent with prejudiced norm theory, disparagement humor, and confrontational humor perceived as disparaging, has the potential to disinhibit expressions of prejudice when used, even in brief social interactions. Our studies also showed that individuals often misinterpreted the subversive nature of confrontational humor, frequently perceiving the confrontation intended to challenge expressions of prejudice as instead intending to disparage Blacks. Thus, while it is possible racial humor may have the potential to tighten norms inhibiting prejudice, the perceptions of confrontational jokes as disparaging may result in jokes (created to subvert and inhibit prejudice) ironically reinforcing prejudiced responding.

T1  - Who Voted for Hillary Clinton? Sexual Identities, Gender, and Family Influences
AN  - 2025297778
AB  - Sexual identities can influence political attitudes and actions. During political elections, gay men, lesbians, and bisexual individuals (GLB) have historically aligned with Democratic candidates. In the recent presidential election of 2016, this pattern persisted, as the vast majority of GLBs voted with the Democratic candidate for president in the 2016 elections (Hillary Clinton). This study tries to explain why lesbians and gay men overwhelmingly voted for candidate Clinton through Patrick Egan's (2012) theory of political distinctiveness. In using data the American National Election Survey of 2016 (N = 2,691), this analysis determines if the tendency of sexual minorities to vote Democratic was due to three sets of variables: (a) selection, or the characteristics associated with GLB identities are also associated with political liberalism; (b) embeddedness, or increased involvement in the LGB community leads to greater liberalism; and (c) conversion, or public disclosures of LGB identities causes major changes in political outlooks and actions. Special attention is also give to the intersectional concerns of gendered heterosexism, given that voting for Hillary Clinton was the highest among lesbian women and lowest among heterosexual men.

T1  - An Integrated Developmental Model for Studying Identity Content in Context
AN  - 1979135399
AB  - Historically, identity researchers have placed greater emphasis on processes of identity development (how people develop their identities) and less on the content of identity (what the identity is). The relative neglect of identity content may reflect the lack of a comprehensive framework to guide research. In this article, we provide such a comprehensive framework for the study of the content of identity, including 4 levels of analysis. At the broadest level, we situate individual identity within historical, cultural, and political contexts, elaborating on identity development within the context of shifting cultural norms, values, and attitudes. Histories of prejudice and discrimination are relevant in shaping intersections among historically marginalized identities. Second, we examine social roles as unique and central contexts for identity development, such that relationship labels become integrated into a larger identity constellation. Third, domains of individual or personal identity content intersect to yield a sense of self in which various aspects are subjectively experienced as an integrated whole. We explore the negotiation of culturally marginalized and dominant identity labels, as well as idiosyncratic aspects of identities based on unique characteristics or group memberships. Finally, we argue that the content of identity is enacted at the level of everyday interactions, the "micro-level" of identity. The concepts of identity conflict, coherence, and compartmentalization are presented as strategies used to navigate identity content across these 4 levels. This framework serves as an organizing tool for the current literature, as well as for designing future studies on the identity development. [web URL: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-48409-002]

T1  - The sigh of the oppressed: The palliative effects of ideology are stronger for people living in highly unequal neighbourhoods
AN  - 2008938293
AB  - Ideologies that legitimize status hierarchies are associated with increased well‐being. However, which ideologies have ‘palliative effects’, why they have these effects, and whether these effects extend to low‐status groups remain unresolved issues. This study aimed to address these issues by testing the effects of the ideology of Symbolic Prejudice on well‐being among low‐ and high‐status ethnic groups (4,519 Europeans and 1,091 Māori) nested within 1,437 regions in New Zealand. Results showed that Symbolic Prejudice predicted increased well‐being for both groups, but that this relationship was stronger for those living in highly unequal neighbourhoods. This suggests that it is precisely those who have the strongest need to justify inequality that accrue the most psychological benefit from subscribing to legitimizing ideologies.

T1  - Is structural stigma's effect on the mortality of sexual minorities robust? A failure to replicate the results of a published study
AN  - 1957229605
AB  - Background The study of stigma's influence on health has surged in recent years. Hatzenbuehler et al.'s (2014) study of structural stigma's effect on mortality revealed an average of 12 years' shorter life expectancy for sexual minorities who resided in communities thought to exhibit high levels of anti-gay prejudice, using data from the 1988-2002 administrations of the US General Social Survey linked to mortality outcome data in the 2008 National Death Index. Methods In the original study, the key predictor variable (structural stigma) led to results suggesting the profound negative influence of structural stigma on the mortality of sexual minorities. Attempts to replicate the study, in order to explore alternative hypotheses, repeatedly failed to generate the original study's key finding on structural stigma. Efforts to discern the source of the disparity in results revealed complications in the multiple imputation process for missing values of the components of structural stigma. This prompted efforts at replication using 10 different imputation approaches. Results Efforts to replicate Hatzenbuehler et al.'s (2014) key finding on structural stigma's notable influence on the premature mortality of sexual minorities, including a more refined imputation strategy than described in the original study, failed. No data imputation approach yielded parameters that supported the original study's conclusions. Alternative hypotheses, which originally motivated the present study, revealed little new information. Conclusion Ten different approaches to multiple imputation of missing data yielded none in which the effect of structural stigma on the mortality of sexual minorities was statistically significant. Minimally, the original study's structural stigma variable (and hence its key result) is so sensitive to subjective measurement decisions as to be rendered unreliable.

T1  - STEREOTYPICAL GENDER REPRESENTATIONS IN CHHOTA BHEEM: KIDS' CARTOON PROGRAMME ON POGO CHANNEL
AN  - 1990432567
AB  - Cartoon watching is usually supposed to be a fun time for children; it also serves as a potential learning tool This paper is based on content analysis of a popular television cartoon series in the Hindi/Urdu languages, Chhota Bheem by Pogo, an Indian channel for young children that is televised by local and foreign T V channels. To analyse the contents of these programmes, seven dialogues are selected through purposive sampling to help understand how gender discrimination is projected through these kids' shows. Qualitative data analyses is made in the light of the model presented by Mills' (1995) and Beauvoir's (1997) notion of social construction of women as the "other" and is applied to assess societal oppression and stereotypic treatment of women as inferior to males. Analysing these cartoons with respect to gender representation by looking at the ratio of male to female characters shown, the physical characteristics of these characters, and the language of selected dialogues, this research shows that the cartoons reflect gender prejudices that exist in the psyche of adults, thereby transmitting negative messages to children during the formative stage of their brain development. The findings show that the portrayal of male and female characters in these series is stereotypical to the extent that they influence children to believe and idealize these roles in their everyday social interaction.

T1  - Welland Ontario's Springfield Plan: Post-War Canadian Citizenship Training, American Style?
AN  - 2032478903
AB  - After World War II, minority activists and their Anglo-Canadian allies convinced the Ontario Ministry of Education to bring the Springfield Plan to Welland, Ontario, as a pilot project to combat racist and religious prejudice through the public school system. Pioneered in Springfield, Massachusetts, the Plan taught children the importance of tolerance by stressing that minority groups had made important contributions to the local community, the nation, and the world beyond. In Welland, however, the Plan only lasted for a few years because many influential Canadians failed to recognize the pervasiveness of discrimination, while non-British immigrants tended to see new industrial unions as better vehicles for claiming their rights. In addition, the Plan was unsuited to the understanding of Canada as a “bi-racial” country founded by the English and French.Alternate abstract:Après la Deuxième Guerre mondiale, des militants issus des minorités et leurs alliés anglo-canadiens convainquirent le ministère de l’Éducation de l’Ontario d’introduire le Plan de Springfield à Welland (Ontario), à titre de projet pilote destiné à combattre le racisme et les préjugés religieux par l’intermédiaire du réseau d’écoles publiques. Lancé à Springfield (Massachusetts), celui-ci enseignait aux enfants l’importance de la tolérance en soulignant que les groupes minoritaires avaient apporté d’importantes contributions à la collectivité locale, au pays et au monde extérieur. À Welland, toutefois, le Plan ne dura que quelques années parce que bon nombre de Canadiens influents refusèrent de reconnaître l’omniprésence de la discrimination et que, de leur côté, les immigrants non britanniques eurent tendance à voir les nouveaux syndicats industriels comme de meilleurs outils pour faire valoir leurs droits. De plus, le Plan n’était pas conçu pour faire comprendre le Canada comme étant un pays « biracial », fondé par les Anglais et les Français.

T1  - Prejudice in interreligious context: The role of metaprejudice and majority-minority status
AN  - 1945134961
AB  - Samples of two hundred forty-five majority Sunny Muslims, 87 Ahmadiyya Muslims, and 145 Christians were used to investigate the determinants and mediators of prejudice in interreligious context in Indonesia. First, the study extends the idea of in-group and out-group metaprejudice; both of which were found to mediate the relationship between perceived quality of intergroup relationship and personal prejudice. Second, we expected that majority members are more likely to reject a minority and that a minority is more likely to more strongly reject another minority than the majority for self-serving reasons. Additionally, the Sunni majority will prejudice and reject the Ahmadiyya minority more than the Christian minority due to the strained religious relation between the two Muslim groups. The hypotheses were confirmed. The findings are discussed in the context of stereotyping, and prejudice dynamics in other intergroup conflicts and ways of coping with such conflict are suggested.

T1  - Correcting Misperceptions: An In-class Exercise for Reducing Population Innumeracy Using Student Response Systems and a Test of Its Effectiveness
AN  - 1891833450
AB  - The current analysis examines the degree to which a classroom activity using student response systems (SRS) can improve the accuracy of commonly held demographic misperceptions. Overestimation of religious, racial, and immigrant minority population sizes is pervasive in the United States and Western Europe, and such inaccuracies predict more negative intergroup attitudes. This study introduces an interactive SRS-based activity designed to teach students about demographic realities and then tests its effectiveness for correcting misperceptions. Experimental results indicate greater accuracy in students' estimates of the Jewish and Muslim population sizes five weeks after taking part in the activity. Their perceptions were improved significantly relative to peers who participated in a non-SRS version of the exercise and to those who were absent on the day of the exercise. Overall, the results indicate that the sociology classroom, aided with SRS, can be an effective arena through which to combat demographic misperceptions and improve intergroup understanding.

T1  - "Trying to Figure Out Where We Belong": Narratives of Racialized Sexual Minorities on Community, Identity, Discrimination, and Health
AN  - 1858002126
AB  - Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans, and Queer people of color (LGBTQ-POC) are regularly exposed to unique and contextual forms of prejudice and stigma, which have been linked to stress and increased likelihood of mental and physical health problems. In order to better understand the experiences of this multiply marginalized population, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 LGBTQ-POC to examine how they describe their experiences with identities, communities, discrimination, and health. Data consisted of verbatim interviews, which were guided by intersectionality theory and minority stress theory and analyzed using interpretive phenomenological analysis. Using intersectionality theory, this study addresses the simultaneity of oppressions and the ways in which having different combinations of marginalized identities may impact LGBTQ-POC well-being. Common issues discussed by respondents include disconnect from communities, relationships between identities, coming out, and stress and anxiety. The primary concepts introduced in this study include positive intersectionality and come out stress.

T1  - THE EFFECT OF MINORITY STRESS ON SUBSTANCE USE DISPARITIES AMONG SEXUAL MINORITY US HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
AN  - 1937686197
AB  - Compared to sexual nonminority youth, sexual minority youth report greater substance use and experience increased stress due to prejudice, discrimination, harassment, and victimization related to their sexual minority status. School-related minority stressors may include being bullied, harassed, and attacked at school. Non-school-related sources of stress disproportionately experienced by sexual minority youth may include early sexual debut, forced sexual intercourse, and other adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). Research suggests that increased stress may help to explain the disproportionate use of substances like alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs by sexual minority youth. This study examined the effect of school-related and non-school-related minority stress on substance use disparities among sexual minority U.S. high school students. Data from the national 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a nationally representative sample of 15,624 U.S. high school students, were analyzed to determine the effect of school-related (violent threats and physical attacks, bullying, and feeling unsafe at school) and non-school-related (early sexual debut and forced sexual intercourse) minority stress on substance use disparities among sexual minority students (defined by sexual identity and sex of sexual contacts), by comparing unadjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and adjusted (for minority stressors. age, sex, and race/ethnicity) prevalence ratios (APR). All school-related and non-school-related stressors were significantly more prevalent among sexual minority than sexual nonminority students. In unadjusted analyses, every category of substance use was significantly greater (95% confidence interval for PR did not include 1.0)* among students who identified as lesbian. gay, or bisexual than students who identified as heterosexual; and significantly greater among students who had sexual contact with only the same sex or with both sexes than students who had sexual contact with only the opposite sex. After controlling for minority stressors, disparities by sexual identity decreased substantially and were no longer statistically significant for cocaine use (PR=2.52* vs. APR= 1.25), methamphetamine use (PR=3.96* vs. APR 1.54), heroin use (PR=4.60* vs. APR= 0.90), and injection drug use (PR=4.93* vs. APR= l.38); disparities for cigarette use, alcohol use, marijuana use, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs decreased, but remained statistically significant. Disparities by sex of sexual contacts decreased substantially and were no longer statistically significant for heroin use (PR=4.08* vs. APR= 1.57) and injection drug use (PR=4.03* vs. APR= 1.34); disparities for use of other substances (except alcohol use) decreased, but remained statistically significant. These findings suggest that at least some of the disparity in substance use found among sexual minority students may occur in response to experiences of minority stress. Thus, school-based substance use prevention may benefit from inclusion of strategies to minimize minority stress by fostering environmental supports for sexual minority students, including antibullying and anti-harassment policies. and the fostering of safe spaces for sexual minority youth in the form of gay-straight alliances (GSAs) or other support groups. School- and communitybased strategies to improve access to social and mental health services may also help to reduce minority stress and substance use by preventing or mitigating the effects of physical, psychological, and sexual abuse, and other ACEs.

T1  - 'PRIMITIVE, CRUEL AND BLOOD-THIRSTY SAVAGES': STEREOTYPES IN AND ABOUT THE WESTERN BALKANS 1
AN  - 1841723051
AB  - This paper focuses on national stereotypes in the area of former Yugoslavia used by members of one ethnic community to describe members of other ethnic communities. The countries in the Balkans have a long history of ethnic fragmentation so it is no surprise that its ethnic groups are often stereotyped based on Western perceptions of the Balkans and the relationship between oppressors and the oppressed, which led to the development of stereotypes. The theoretical framework of stereotypes and prejudices and research on these topics show that stereotypes in former Yugoslavia have developed in relation to socio-political circumstances and that the stereotypes have been used for a long time, even after the potential reasons for their initial application ceased to exist.

T1  - The veil and the search for the self: From identity politics to cultural expression
AN  - 1752271562
AB  - Wagner, Sen, Permanadeli and Howarth compare the reasons for wearing the veil of Muslim women in a Muslim majority society, Indonesia and in a society with a Muslim minority, India. They conclude that particularly Muslim minority women display a variety of reasons and strategies with regards to the headscarf, which according to Wagner et al. serve in the construction of identity and as a means of opposition against stereotypes and prejudice. Taking the case of Muslim women in Western societies, I argue that the language of identity, stereotypes and prejudice is insufficient for understanding the agency of women donning the veil. Instead I propose a genetic cultural psychological approach focused on the cultivation of affect and the acquisition of durable bodily dispositions through cultural training. The veil is part of an entire expressive style and discursive accounts are only a minor part of that style. Recognizing that style -- unlike propositional accounts -- is inherently ambiguous and polysemic allows us to see how Muslim women are creating for themselves the space of an agency that is not primarily defined in terms of opposition or of other people's demands for proper reasons.

T1  - U.S.-Georgian Relations and the 2008 Conflict with Russia
AN  - 1747610091
AB  - Interest in examining the circumstances behind Russia's 2008 attack on Georgia has grown in light of recent developments in Ukraine. The international condemnation by the international community for Russia's 2008 attack on the Republic of Georgia -- as well as the concomitant assaults by Abkhazians and South Ossetians against ethnic Georgians within their territories -- was in large part appropriate. The self-righteous posturing coming out of Washington, however, should have been tempered by a sober recognition of the ways in which the US contributed to the crisis.

T1  - When collective memories of victimhood fade: Generational evolution of intergroup attitudes and political aspirations in Belgium
AN  - 1728660405; 201533978
AB  - Collective memory theories propose that groups' remembrances of their past depend upon their current social situation. In Belgium, a significant proportion of Dutch speakers share a collective memory of past victimisation by French speakers and fight for an ever-larger autonomy of their region. Yet, as the respective economic, political and social situations of the linguistic regions of Belgium recently evolved with a reversal of fortunes, the current experience of younger Dutch speakers does not fit the traditional memory anymore. We thus predicted that the collective memories of victimhood would decline amongst them, thus bringing changes in intergroup attitudes and political aspirations. Three generations were compared in a survey of 1226 French-speaking and 1457 Dutch-speaking individuals. For both groups, younger generations evidenced less regionalist and more integrative positions than older ones. However, these effects were stronger for Dutch-speaking respondents, and for them, collective memory of victimhood mediated the relation linking age and identification with Belgium, intergroup attitudes and political aspirations. We concluded that the current social context has decisive consequences for collective remembrances, which, in turn, impact intergroup relations and political attitudes and choices.

T1  - Identity and belonging: Saudi female international students and their use of social networking sites
AN  - 1661535605
AB  - This article explores the ways in which Saudi female international students (SFIS) in Australia use social networking sites (SNS) to help them form social networks and present their online identity. Based on themes derived from five in-depth interviews, findings suggest that SFIS use SNS in a way that helps them foster a sense of belonging and connectivity regardless of their location. Currently SFIS use Facebook mainly to keep in touch with friends and family that are both local and international; gain knowledge of the various social and political events happening around them; and have 'fun'. Similar to findings in the literature on social media use by students, SFIS form distinct virtual social networks made up not only of their conational Saudi friends, but also international Saudi as well as Australian and international friends whom they have face to face contact within Australia. As their main purpose of using SNS was to keep in touch with friends, SFIS reported using their real and accurate identity to make it easy for friends to find them. However, when it comes to the online sharing of personal photos SFIS showed a negative attitude towards posting their personal photos due to cultural considerations. Overall, findings of the study align with the literature in which SNS such as Facebook are instrumental for SFIS in maintaining a strong sense of connectivity and bonding while they are temporarily out of their home country.

T1  - Using Celebrity News Stories to Effectively Reduce Racial/Ethnic Prejudice
AN  - 1662632272
AB  - This article argues that exposure to admirable media celebrities from racial/ethnic outgroups is an effective, proactive, and viable strategy for prejudice reduction and intergroup harmony. It uses mediated contact and exemplification theories to demonstrate that reading news stories about likable outgroup media personalities who serve as counter-stereotypic exemplars can subtly modify racial attitudes, which are malleable and context-sensitive. Specifically, results from a between-participants experiment (N = 88) show that exposure to news stories about counter-stereotypic African American media personalities as compared to stereotypical ones reduces stereotypical perceptions and symbolic racist beliefs of White Americans about African Americans. Furthermore, these favorable attitudes translate into an increased willingness to support affirmative action policies.

T1  - Reflecting on Heterosexual and Male Privilege: Interventions to Raise Awareness
AN  - 1634405107
AB  - Gender-focused college courses seek to increase understanding of the systematic advantages associated with dominant group membership. These courses attempt to reduce prejudice and raise awareness of male and heterosexual privilege. Inclusion of privilege content within gender-focused courses has increased, but research to test interventions to increase privilege awareness and reduce prejudice remains sparse. The current studies provide experimental information about awareness of heterosexual privilege (Study 1) and male privilege (Study 2) and specific interventions for use in education, professional development, and community settings. Study 1 found the video intervention was effective in increasing heterosexual privilege awareness and internal motivation to respond without prejudice. Study 2 found that male privilege awareness was significantly increased and modern sexism was reduced by the video intervention. Findings provide information for applied practices such as pedagogical strategies when designing diversity courses and training workshops.

T1  - The moderating effect of prior attitudes on intergroup face-to-face contact
AN  - 1552385843
AB  - The present study examined cooperative contact as an antecedent to reducing negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians, as measured by Herek's Attitudes Toward Lesbians and Gay Men Scale--Short Form (ATLG). In a scripted role-play, participants were paired with a confederate who declared their character's sexual orientation as either heterosexual or homosexual. Hierarchical regression analysis demonstrated that contact with homosexual individuals affected participants' attitudes toward gay men and lesbians over and above the participants' prior ATLG scores. A moderating effect for prior ATLG scores was also found. The effect of confederate's sexual orientation was stronger for participants with more negative ATLG scores compared to those with more favorable attitudes. Implications for decreasing homophobia in organizations are discussed.

T1  - Biographical Narratives of Encounter: The Significance of Mobility and Emplacement in Shaping Attitudes towards Difference
AN  - 1708525625; 201529302
AB  - This paper is located within work in Urban Studies about the significance of contact with difference as a means for reducing prejudice and achieving social change. Recent approaches, influenced by theories of affect, have emphasised non-conscious everyday negotiations of difference in the city. In this paper it is argued that such approaches lose sight of the significance of the subject: of the reflective judgements of 'others' made by individuals; of our ability to make decisions around the control of our feelings and identifications; and of the significance of personal pasts and collective histories in shaping the ways we perceive and react to encounters. Rather, this paper uses a biographical approach focusing on interviewees' narratives of encounter. Through its attention to processes of mobility and emplacement, it contributes to debates about when contact with difference matters by highlighting the importance of everyday social normativities in the production of moral dispositions. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Following arguments made in the USA, the UK and New Zealand regarding the importance of population-level ethnicity data in understanding health and healthcare inequities, health authorities in several Canadian provinces are considering plans to collect ethnicity data from patients at the point of care with in selected healthcare organizations. The purpose of this paper is to examine the potential quality, utility and relevance of ethnicity data collected at an organizational level as a means of addressing health and healthcare inequities. We draw on findings from a recent Canadian study that examined the implications of collecting ethnicity data in healthcare contexts. Using a qualitative design, data were collected in a large city, and included interviews with 104 patients, community and healthcare leaders, and healthcare workers within diverse clinical contexts. Data were analyzed using interpretive thematic analysis. Our results are discussed in relation to discourses reflected in the current literature that require consideration in relation to the potential utility and relevancy of ethnicity data collected at the point of care within healthcare organizations. These discourses frame excerpts from the ethnographic data that are used as illustrative examples. Three key challenges to the potential relevance and utility of ethnicity data collected at the level of local healthcare organizations are identified: (a) issues pertaining to quality of the data, (b) the fact that data quality is most problematic for those with the greatest vulnerability to the negative effects of health inequities, and (c) the lack of data reflecting structural disadvantages or discrimination. The quality of ethnicity data collected within healthcare organizations is often unreliable, particularly for people from racialized or visible minority groups, who are most at risk, seriously limiting the usefulness of the data. Quality measures for collecting data reflecting ethnocultural identity in specific healthcare organizations may be warranted -- but only if mechanisms exist or are developed for linking ethnicity with measures of perceived discrimination, stigmatization, income level, and other known contributors to inequities. Methods for linking these kinds of data, however, remain underdeveloped or non-existent in most healthcare organizations. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social Cohesion Activities and Attitude Change in Cyprus
AN  - 1767329490; 201610765
AB  - Do social cohesion activities change the attitudes of the participants? This paper uses intergroup contact theory to explore attitude change resulting from contact with out-group(s) in social cohesion activities. Results from a pre-test/post-test design with fifty-five participants in two bicommunal camps in Cyprus show how attitudes change at the immediate end of these activities; an analysis of fourteen participants' comments after one, thirteen, and twenty-five months provides a medium- to long-term assessment of attitude change. Not all participants were completely positive towards the other community before they took part, as assumed by some. There is clearly space for impact in terms of attitude change. Social cohesion activities represent indispensable tools for reducing prejudice and improving relationships between former enemies in post-conflict countries. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Income Inequality, International Migration, and National Pride: A Test of Social Identification Theory
AN  - 1559005885; 201432585
AB  - Does the income inequality of a country increase the nationalistic sentiments of its citizens? If so, why do people become more nationalistic when inequality grows? This article answers these questions, which have been historically observed and theoretically suggested, but rarely answered with empirical tests. By borrowing formal models in Shayo (2009) and using a multilevel analysis method with survey data in multiple years, this article shows that income inequality increases the national pride of poor people, which is an essential aspect of nationalistic sentiments, particularly in countries whose lower class has many migrants. This result implies that the link between income inequality, income levels, and nationalistic sentiments may be shaped by other social features such as the level of migration.

T1  - The Mark of an Ex-Prisoner: Perceived Discrimination and Self-Stigma of Young Men after Prison in Hong Kong
AN  - 1438554917; 201340015
AB  - The stigma of being an ex-prisoner can lead to self-stigmatizing beliefs and hinder reintegration. For young ex-prisoners, this is particularly challenging as they need not only to transition from prison to society but from adolescence to adulthood. This study explores the experiences of discrimination and self-stigma of 16 young men recently released from Hong Kong prisons. Drawing on qualitative in-depth interviews, it reveals that participants perceived themselves as facing discrimination, mainly from prospective employers. Self-stigma was more salient with regard to lower self-worth and shame and embarrassment. Most adopted a "don't ask, don't tell" strategy in disclosing their identity as ex-prisoners. As very little research has been conducted on the experiences of returning offenders in Hong Kong, this study highlights the challenges of reentry. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The ontologization of Romani: An Italian study on the cross-categorization approach
AN  - 1448994792; 201342994
AB  - This research aims to study the ontologization process of the Romani minority in Abruzzo region (Italy), characterized by the longstanding presence of a group of sedentary Romani, and to test the cross-categorization approach using a specific dependent measure such as the ontologization of the Italian Romani target. A questionnaire was administered to 475 Italian participants, in which the respondents were asked to attribute 6 human positive, 6 human negative, 6 animal positive and 6 animal negative associates to three targets: Italians (ingroup), Italian Romani (ingroup-outgroup) and Romani (outgroup). Participants showed evidence that they used human/animal associates differently for the ingroup and for the outgroup members. Romani groups were ascribed more animal than human characteristics, while Italians were described as more human than the Romani and Italian Romani group, showing the ontologization process of the Romani minority and the superhumanization of the Italian ingroup. Moreover, the cross-categorized Italian Romani target was the most discriminated against in that it was attributed more animal negative associates than the Romani and Italian ones. Since modern racism could take the form of the denial of the humanness and the attribution of animality to outgroup members, our data emphasize the importance of taking account of the persistence of negative attitudes so deep-rooted as those felt towards the Romani.

T1  - To confront or not to confront: non-targets' evaluations of and responses to racist comments
AN  - 1433108370
AB  - The current studies explore situational and individual factors affecting non-target perceivers' reactions and behavior following a racist comment, focusing on verbal confronting behavior. Two studies were conducted in which participants reported about recent situations in which they witnessed a racist comment that was not directed specifically at their own racial group. Results indicated that only one third of participants directly confronted the commenter. Strength of verbal confrontation was predicted by affective reactions and judgments of the offensiveness of the prejudicial comment. Analyses also revealed that strength of confrontation for females was predicted by the experience of negative emotions, but that males confronted more with stronger ratings of the offensiveness of the racist remarks. Implications for theory and policy are discussed.

T1  - Predictors of intergroup concern for disaster victims of the Japan earthquake
AN  - 1417521865; 201331771
AB  - The study examined the relationships between out-group perception, perceived intergroup conflict, emotions, and concern for out-group victims in the context of the Japanese earthquake of 2011. Six hundred and eighty-six participants in China completed a questionnaire immediately after the earthquake. Results showed that the image of Japan and historical conflicts between the two nations significantly predicted intergroup emotions. A positive image of Japan enhanced Chinese respondents' perceived competence of the Japanese people, which, however, appeared to mitigate concern for the victims. Positive emotions increased participants' concern for Japanese victims. Implications of the research findings are discussed with reference to research on intergroup relations and help following disasters. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Contemporary research emphasises the dynamic intergroup nature of acculturation processes involving both immigrants and nationals. Using data from a sample of 372 U.S. national children (aged 6-9 years), we examine the relationship between acculturation attitudes, conceptualized as desire for cultural maintenance and desire for intergroup contact between immigrants and nationals, and attitudes towards Somali immigrants (intended behaviour, prejudice, perceived norms and intergroup anxiety). Prosocial behaviours were highest among children who simultaneously endorsed cultural maintenance and intergroup contact attitudes. These findings and their implications are discussed.

T1  - EFFECTS OF SOCIAL AND TEMPORAL DISTANCE ON EVALUATION OF CORPORATE AMBIVALENT BEHAVIOR
AN  - 1531931352; 201422968
AB  - Based on construal level theory and subadditivity effect, in this study, the authors examined the joint impacts of multiple dimensions of psychological distance on consumer evaluations of a company in which the behavior was ambivalent in terms of morality or competence. The findings indicated that consumers perceiving the company as both socially and temporally close evaluated it more favorably when ambivalence concerned morality. However, when 1 or more dimensions of psychological distance extended, consumers tended to evaluate the company more favorably when the source of ambivalence concerned competence. These findings suggest that consumer evaluations of a company are influenced by not only which aspect of company's behavior is ambivalent, but also by whether or not it is a single dimension or multiple dimensions of psychological distance being considered. Theoretical and practical implications are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - How Do U.S. Students Perceive Trans Persons
AN  - 1364703922; 201327807
AB  - This study explored undergraduate students' interpersonal responses, namely general feelings toward and desire for further social interaction with trans persons in a helping context. Secondarily, this study explored the relationship between participants' intrinsic empathy, interpersonal curiosity and interest in further interaction. Two hundred fifty-one undergraduates at a moderate sized university in the southeastern United States served as participants. In order to assess baseline levels of empathy and curiosity, participants in session 1 completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Scale (Davis 1983) and the Interpersonal Curiosity Scale (Litman and Pezzo 2007). One week later, during session 2, the same students assumed the role of a peer counselor and read 1 of 4 (male, female, male-to-female, female-to-male) randomly assigned versions of an intake form completed by a fictitious peer client. Each version was identical, with the exception of the gender identity of the peer client. Participants completed various measures of affect and interest in further interaction.

T1  - How Do U.S. Students Perceive Trans Persons?
AN  - 1095795026
AB  - This study explored undergraduate students' interpersonal responses, namely general feelings toward and desire for further social interaction with trans persons in a helping context. Secondarily, this study explored the relationship between participants' intrinsic empathy, interpersonal curiosity and interest in further interaction. Two hundred fifty-one undergraduates at a moderate sized university in the southeastern United States served as participants. In order to assess baseline levels of empathy and curiosity, participants in session 1 completed the Interpersonal Reactivity Scale (Davis 1983) and the Interpersonal Curiosity Scale (Litman and Pezzo 2007). One week later, during session 2, the same students assumed the role of a peer counselor and read 1 of 4 (male, female, male-to-female, female-to-male) randomly assigned versions of an intake form completed by a fictitious peer client. Each version was identical, with the exception of the gender identity of the peer client. Participants completed various measures of affect and interest in further interaction. Male participants reported less willingness to interact with, and the strongest negative feelings toward the FTM peer client. Men reported highest willingness to interact with the MTF client and showed the lowest negative reactions towards the MTF client. Female participants' scores on willingness to interact and on negative reactions were similar across all four intake form versions. Contrary to expectations, baseline levels of empathy and curiosity did not impact responses to gender expression. Further investigation is needed to elucidate the factors associated with anti-transgender prejudice particularly in the context of helping relationships.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Racing, Betting, Anti-Semitism and English Jewry 1800-1939
AN  - 1322721998; 201310614
AB  - Historiography has largely focused on more respectable Anglo-Jewish leisure life in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but this study uses the national and regional press, contemporary novels, books and magazines to explore non-Jewish representations of Jewish sports betting and related gambling involvement, and the extent to which such representations involved anti-Semitic attitudes. In part Jewish betting and gambling simply attracted similar respectable opprobrium to that of working-class gambling more generally, and prejudice was not a consistent feature. But at times, coverage suggested that Jews were greedier for money, less honest and more attracted to betting than other ethnic groups. Where Jews were involved in criminal activities, such as racecourse frauds in the 1840s, gaming room presence throughout the period, or the involvement of bookmakers in racecourse feuding in the inter-war period, such activities were sometimes deliberately foregrounded. Some rich Jews became involved in racehorse ownership, but with the exception of the Rothschild family they were excluded from Jockey Club membership. In the interwar period, the British Union of Fascists exploited any Jewish involvement in betting as part of their anti-Semitic propaganda. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Wisdom of Eve: On Differentiating the Colours of Emotion that May Be Threats to Good Life
AN  - 1017622774
AB  - Emotion's twin roles unite and divide our daily life, thus motivating the good and the worst in human behaviour. The way one feels does influence the way one acts toward others. If this reasoning is correct, then behaviour can never be without motive or motiveless. Given the importance of emotions in human communication and decision making, the context of intergroup relations, with its themes of prejudice, stereotyping and discrimination against culturally dissimilar was touched on selectively. Using the Differential Emotions Scale and building upon Boyle's (Personality 56:747-750, 1984) work, with students, the present study reports a repeated-measure multiple discriminant function analysis for items across raters. The findings further indicate that most of the DES items are sensitive indicators. The correspondence of some of the results with prior research findings makes facial emotions less the holy grail of the social behaviour field. Likely consequences of emotions are considered, and research needs are discussed vis-a-vis uplifting individual happiness, collective identity and sense of connection to others. Perhaps its implications can be extended to the literature, thus revealing how the different lenses through which human emotions are usually viewed are connected by the incipient/concept attitude and self-identification/labelling that run through each of them.

T1  - Attitudes and Decisions about Sexual Offenders: A Comparison of Laypersons and Professionals
AN  - 1023026660; 201223726
AB  - The current study examines the inherent biases about sexual offending held by 123 laypersons and 120 professionals (i.e. probation officers and therapists). In order to determine the extent of these biases, a series of brief newspaper articles were constructed to depict cases of sexual offenders. Each article comprised several combinations of key variables, including offender type, level of admission, and the presence of alcohol. Participants read a series of three fabricated articles and then completed a questionnaire regarding attitudes about the various offenders. The results indicate important differences between the lay and professional samples. Laypersons deemed sex offenders more favourably in terms of character, accountability, and risk for sexual recidivism. However, both groups showed some similar perceptions about sexual offending. Specifically, both groups evaluated child molesters more negatively than exhibitionists and in some cases, rapists. These findings highlight the need for continuing education for professionals in order to attenuate the effects of prejudicial attitudes. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Effects of the 2008 Obama Presidential Campaign on White Racial Prejudice
AN  - 1283642392; 201304257
AB  - Research on the importance of race in the 2008 presidential campaign has focused almost exclusively on how white racial prejudice influenced vote choice. Instead, I test a theory about how mass public exposure to Obama influenced white racial prejudice. This is the first study to assess the impact of exposure to Obama on individual-level changes in prejudice using nationally representative panel data collected during the campaign. Throughout the campaign, innumerable images of Obama and his family contradicted negative racial stereotypes and changed the balance of black exemplars in mass media in a positive direction, thus causing reductions in prejudice among political television viewers. Exposure to Obama caused the largest reductions in prejudice among McCain supporters, Republicans, and conservatives. Although these individuals surely resisted Obama's political message, consistent with previous research, racial exemplars influence judgments without deliberative processing, thus minimizing resistance to counter-stereotypical portrayals. Because conservatives have more negative preexisting images of blacks, exposure to Obama countered their expectations far more than those with more positive expectations. Moreover, consistent with the psychological basis for mediated intergroup contact, even exposure to conservative programs that criticized Obama's politics reduced prejudice because these programs nonetheless portrayed him as countering negative racial stereotypes. Using three waves of panel data and fixed effects analyses of within-person change, I am able to make the strongest causal argument possible outside of experiments. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Different shades of racial colorblindness: The role of prejudice
AN  - 1023028871; 201223694
AB  - Supporters of racial colorblindness are united by their opposition to racial categorization. However, we suggest that the nature of the relationship between racial colorblindness and racial policy attitudes among Whites varies based on individual differences in racial prejudice. Across two independent samples (Studies 1a and 1b), we demonstrated that colorblindness predicts opposition to affirmative action for low prejudice Whites. For high prejudice Whites, who presumably oppose affirmative action regardless of colorblind concerns, no significant relationship between colorblindness and affirmative action support was found. In Study 2, we examined the relationship between various rationales for supporting colorblindness and affirmative action attitudes, and again detected moderation by prejudice. Low prejudice Whites' evaluations of affirmative action appeared to be based upon perceptions of declining discrimination as well as a concern for balancing the interests of both Whites and minorities. The affirmative action attitudes of high prejudice Whites, in contrast, appeared to be based primarily upon defending the interests of their racial ingroup. The implications of these findings for theoreticians and social justice advocates are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Deliberating about terrorism: Prejudice and jury verdicts in a mock terrorism trial
AN  - 1883069446
AB  - Juries in many Western countries are being asked to make decisions about defendants charged with terrorist-related offences, in situations where heightened anxieties and hostility to outgroups may make a fair trial difficult. What impact can deliberation have in addressing any such prejudice? This study estimates the impact of several forms of prejudice on juror verdicts in a mock terrorism trial. The study provides a more realistic setting than most previous studies, with an authentic heritage courtroom, actual jury assembly room and jury deliberation rooms in the NSW Supreme Court, a one-hour live trial and one-hour deliberation. Strong relationships are found between conviction rates and prior attitudes before jury discussion, consistent with other literature. Deliberation significantly reduces the proportion of guilty verdicts; it also reduces the impact on verdict of two forms of prejudice - fear of terrorism and punitiveness. On the other hand it tends to increase the impact of cognitive prejudice, measured both by a modified version of the Jury Bias Scale and a terrorism-specific scale based on attitudes to Australian Guantanamo Bay detainee David Hicks.

T1  - White Attitudes toward Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action
AN  - 907928632; 201125317
AB  - White attitudes toward equal opportunity and affirmative action are explored through semi-structured interviews with 246 middle and working class respondents from three areas of the USA. Both working and middle class interviewees espouse a consistent and coherent view: that opportunity is widespread for anyone willing to take advantage of it, that facing adverse conditions or obstacles is not a sufficient excuse for lack of success, and that government help in the form of affirmative action gives women and/or minorities unfair advantage over men and/or whites. In the responses, however, we also find that whites apply standards to others about being the 'best person for the job' that they do not apply to themselves in their own career histories. Using the interviews with these respondents, we explore the implications of this inconsistency in how whites apply normative standards about what constitutes merit and fairness. This research helps elucidate the meaning of previous research on white racial attitudes. [Reprinted by permission; copyright Sage Publications Inc.]

T1  - Discrimination and Reaction: The Practical Constitution of Social Exclusion
AN  - 964190291; 201207343
AB  - This article explores and extends Blumer's work on race prejudice and discrimination by using empirical data from an ethnographic study of minority communities in Greece. Blumer explains prejudice as the result of an interactional process through which one group defines itself as superior or dominant in relation to the other. His work on race prejudice has often been misinterpreted as emphasizing the individual's subjective imaginary of the "other." Here I illustrate the importance of the intersubjective processes involved in defining a particular social situation as discriminatory. A central point of the article is to elaborate on his analysis by looking at the experience of prejudice and discrimination from the receiving end, through the participants' interpretation of their social interactions with the dominant group. Therefore I focus on how members of the subordinate group interact with the process that Blumer identifies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Indexicalities of language contact in an era of globalization: engaging with John Gumperz's legacy
AN  - 896186121; 201120836
AB  - This article engages with John Gumperz's research legacy by examining his statements regarding indexicality at different stages in his career: the "Introduction" to Directions in Sociolinguistics (1972); a framing essay in Rethinking Linguistic Relativity (Gumperz, Introduction to Part IV, Cambridge University Press, 1996); and a recent series of interviews and essays in Language and Social Interaction (2002). Situating his evolving understanding of indexicality vis-a-vis other work in linguistic anthropology (Agha, Journal of Linguistic Anthropology 15: 38-59, 2005; Silverstein, Language & Communication 23: 193-229, 2003a; Urciuoli, Exposing prejudice: Puerto Rican experiences of race, class, and language, Westview, 1996), I discuss how indexical concepts such as "ordering," when paired with concepts of spatio-temporal scale (Blommaert, Intercultural Pragmatics 4: 1-19, 2007), provide insightful ways of theorizing and analyzing the dynamics of globalization and language contact. The argument is developed via case studies of migration and multilingualism, based on fieldwork in Belgium (Blommaert et al., Language & Communication 25: 197-216, 2005a, Ethnography 6: 205-235, 2005b) and the United States (Collins and La Santa, Exploring ethnicity and class as communicative practice, 2007; Collins and Slembrouck, Goffman and globalization, Continuum, 2009).

T1  - Fertility and Intergroup Bias in Racial and Minimal-Group Contexts: Evidence for Shared Architecture
AN  - 1910822387
AB  - Recent research has shown that White women's bias against Black men increases with elevated fertility across the menstrual cycle. We demonstrate that the association between fertility and intergroup bias is not limited to groups defined by race, but extends to group categories that are minimally defined, and may depend on the extent to which women associate out-group men with physical formidability. In Study 1, Black and White women with strong associations between the racial out-group and physical formidability displayed greater bias against out-group men as conception risk increased. Study 2 replicated these results in a minimal-group paradigm. These findings are consistent with the notion that women may be endowed with a psychological system that generates intergroup bias via mechanisms that rely on categorization heuristics and perceptions of the physical formidability of out-group men, particularly when the costs of sexual coercion are high.

T1  - Seeing the Unseen: Attention to Daily Encounters With Sexism as Way to Reduce Sexist Beliefs
AN  - 1125223497; 201243544
AB  - Three experiments were conducted in the United States and Germany to test whether women and men endorse sexist beliefs because they are unaware of the prevalence of different types of sexism in their personal lives. Study 1 (N = 120) and Study 2 (N = 83) used daily diaries as a method to encourage individuals "to see the unseen." Results revealed that encouraging women to pay attention to sexism, in comparison to attention to other social interactions, led to a stronger rejection of Modern Sexist, Neosexist, and Benevolent Sexist beliefs (Studies 1 and 2) and to negative evaluations of Modern and Benevolent Sexist men described in profiles as well as to more engagement in collective action on behalf of women (Study 2). In contrast, for men, paying attention to sexism did not have these effects. Results from Study 2 suggest, and from Study 3 (N = 141) confirm, that men's endorsement of Modern and Neosexist beliefs can be reduced if attention to sexism and emotional empathy for the target of discrimination is encouraged. Finally, a follow-up survey indicated that the attitude change in women and men was stable over time. The implications of these findings for interventions to reduce women's versus men's endorsement of sexist beliefs are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Finding the Faithless: Perceived Atheist Prevalence Reduces Anti-Atheist Prejudice
AN  - 1928276555
AB  - Although prejudice is typically positively related to relative outgroup size, four studies found converging evidence that perceived atheist prevalence reduces anti-atheist prejudice. Study 1 demonstrated that anti-atheist prejudice among religious believers is reduced in countries in which atheists are especially prevalent. Study 2 demonstrated that perceived atheist prevalence is negatively associated with anti-atheist prejudice. Study 3 demonstrated a causal relationship: Reminders of atheist prevalence reduced explicit distrust of atheists. These results appeared distinct from intergroup contact effects. Study 4 demonstrated that prevalence information decreased implicit atheist distrust. The latter two experiments provide the first evidence that mere prevalence information can reduce prejudice against any outgroup. These findings offer insights about anti-atheist prejudice, a poorly understood phenomenon. Furthermore, they suggest both novel directions for future prejudice research and potential interventions that could reduce a variety of prejudices.

T1  - The Stigma of Obesity: Does Perceived Weight Discrimination Affect Identity and Physical Health?
AN  - 875716827; 201115262
AB  - Obesity is widely recognized as a health risk, but it also represents a disadvantaged social position. Viewing body weight within the framework of stigma and its effects on life chances, we examine how perceived weight-based discrimination influences identity and physical health. Using national survey data with a 10-year longitudinal follow-up, we consider whether perceptions of weight discrimination shape weight perceptions, whether perceived weight discrimination exacerbates the health risks of obesity, and whether weight perceptions are the mechanism explaining why perceived weight discrimination is damaging to health. Perceived weight discrimination is found to be harmful, increasing the health risks of obesity associated with functional disability and, to a lesser degree, self-rated health. Findings also reveal that weight-based stigma shapes weight perceptions, which mediate the relationship between perceived discrimination and health. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Moral Credentialing by Association: The Importance of Choice and Relationship Closeness
AN  - 1928318283
AB  - People express more prejudice if they have established their "moral credentials." Five studies explored the acquisition of moral credentials through associations with racial minorities, particularly close relationships that are personally chosen. Participants choosing to write about a positive experience with a Black person (Study 1) or Hispanic person (Study 2) subsequently expressed more preference for Whites and tolerance of prejudice than did other participants. In Study 3, the credentialing effect of choice was diminished when participants were given an incentive for that choice. Participants in Study 4 who wrote about a Black friend were more credentialed than those who wrote about a Black acquaintance, regardless of whether the experience was positive or negative. Study 5 suggested that participants strategically referred to close associations with minorities when warned of a future situation in which they might appear prejudiced.

T1  - Is It Better Not to Talk? Group Polarization, Extended Contact, and Perspective Taking in Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo
AN  - 1928315847
AB  - Mass media are often used to generate discussion for the purpose of conflict reduction. A yearlong field experiment in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) tested the impact of one such media program, a talk show designed to promote listener discussion about intergroup conflict and cooperation. A stratified random half of all nonoverlapping broadcast regions in eastern DRC aired the talk show, which encouraged listeners to consider tolerant opinions and outgroup perspectives, and promoted extended intergroup contact using a related soap opera. The other regions aired the soap opera only. Compared to individuals exposed to the soap opera only, talk show listeners discussed more but were more intolerant, more mindful of grievances, and less likely to aid disliked community members. These results point to some of the limits of discussion and suggest further research on ideas connecting theoretical recommendations for discussion and conflict reduction.

T1  - A Comparison of the Multicultural and Colorblind Perspectives on the Intergroup Attitudes of College Students
AN  - 758122781; 201056784
AB  - This investigation examined whether exposure to a multicultural or colorblind orientation influenced social tolerance in racially diverse students. Students were randomly assigned to a colorblind, multicultural, or control ideology. They completed group-specific measures and general measures of diversity. Results indicate that successful anti-bias interventions require focus on the particular level from which intergroup attitudes are being formed. Second, the effectiveness of these opposing theories is a factor of the history of within group socialization practices. Finally, widespread use of these prominent ideologies in different sectors of society poses a threat to social tolerance in more diverse group settings. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - European American children's and adolescents' evaluations of interracial exclusion
AN  - 743045733; 201031475
AB  - No research, to date, has investigated the role of ethnic school composition (and intergroup contact) on European American youth's use of stereotypes to explain interracial discomfort in the context of peer exclusion. In this study, European American fourth-, seventh- and 10th-grade students (N = 414), attending low and high ethnically-diverse public schools (with low and high self-reports of cross-race/ethnic friendships respectively) evaluated three contexts of interracial exclusion (at lunch time, at a school dance, and at a sleepover). In addition to age and context effects, participants enrolled in high-diversity schools were less likely to use stereotypes to explain racial discomfort, more likely to view racial exclusion as wrong, and more likely to estimate that racial exclusion occurs, than were participants enrolled in low-diversity schools. These findings have implications for the role of social experience on racial attitudes and judgments about exclusion. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - The Role of Prejudice and the Need for Closure in Religious Fundamentalism
AN  - 1928317157
AB  - Religious fundamentalism has been consistently linked to prejudice toward a variety of outgroups. This article proposes that this is partially the case because fundamentalist ideology provides a sense of consistency and closure. Outgroups that challenge the epistemic certainty that fundamentalism provides are rejected in an effort to protect this certainty. Results from two studies, including one using a nationally representative sample, found that the need for closure was related to fundamentalism and partially mediated the relationship between fundamentalism and the derogation of lesbians and gays (Study 1) and value violators in general (Study 2). Furthermore, in Study 2, it was found that only some aspects of the need for closure explain the fundamentalism--prejudice relationship. Results are discussed in relation to past need for closure and ideology research as well as what this means for the study of fundamentalism.

T1  - Prejudice in the police: On the processes underlying the effects of selection and group socialisation
AN  - 743050539; 201029019
AB  - The principal aim of this study is to determine why police officers are generally found to be more prejudiced towards disadvantaged groups than are the standard population. Two independent processes were expected to account for this effect: Selection and group socialisation. Using a cross-sectional design (N = 170), firstly, we compared, newly recruited police officers with a control population (selection effect), and secondly, police officers with 1 year of training with the newly recruited ones (group socialisation effect). Results reveal a significant effect of both selection and group socialisation, the two being underlined by distinct processes; right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) in the case of the former and internalisation of a prejudice norm in the case of the latter. Finally, the results show that group identification moderates the change in internalisation of the prejudice norm. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - United we stand: Intergroup conflict moderates the intergroup sensitivity effect
AN  - 60352462; 201017253
AB  - Ingroup members who criticize their group face much less resistance than outgroup members who say the same thing (the intergroup sensitivity effect). In the context of intergroup conflict, however, it was predicted that treatment of ingroup critics would not be so generous. Muslim Indonesians read an extract from an interview in which the speaker criticized Muslims. The comments were attributed to either another Muslim or to a Christian. Before reading the criticism, half of the participants had read an article describing intense conflict between Muslims and Christians in Indonesia, whereas the other half read a neutral article. As predicted, negativity toward the ingroup critic and the ingroup critic's comments increased in the conflict salience condition, to the point that the intergroup sensitivity effect disappeared. However, conflict salience did not have an effect on attributions of motive or on agreement with the message. Implications for our understanding of patriotic criticism are discussed.
