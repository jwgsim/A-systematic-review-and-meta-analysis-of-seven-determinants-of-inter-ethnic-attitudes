T1  - An Eye for an Eye? An Integrated Model of Attitude Change Toward Protest Violence
AN  - 2696809127
AB  - How political violence emerges, why people support it, and how authorities can address it without escalating further radicalization remain an ongoing debate. In this study, we develop a quantitative model to predict violence endorsement as a function of repression severity, group identification, and individual emotions. We situate our investigation in the context of the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement in Hong Kong, during which the public acceptance of violence increased substantially, contrasting the city’s long history of peaceful protests. Results show that violence endorsement is associated with repression severity in a U-shaped fashion. While limited repression deters violence endorsement, excessive repression crossing a proportionality threshold escalates it. Group identification is a salient moderator that amplifies the backfire effects of repression. People who are more attached to protesting groups are more vigilant about repression and more supportive of protest violence. Furthermore, we also find that individual emotions exert more significant influences than repression and group identification. Anger, disgust, and fear can result in radicalized opinions. These findings unpack the complex and multifaceted communicative processes that shape the perceptions of protest violence. In contrast to the rational, organizational, and structural models of social movements, we argue that this analytical framework can offer more insights into protest dynamics amid the increasingly personalized political participation.

T1  - Invisibly Oppressed: Individual and Ecological Correlates of Chinese American Adolescents’ Perceived Discrimination
AN  - 2672687712
AB  - Despite being portrayed as model minorities, Chinese American adolescents still face challenges of discrimination. Using data from 444 Chinese American adolescents (Mage = 13.04, 54% female), this study examined the independent and joint influence of individual cultural characteristics (adolescents’ acculturation and enculturation) and contextual factors (parental discrimination experiences, neighborhood disadvantage, and ethnic concentration) on Chinese American adolescents’ perception of discrimination experiences. Results showed that acculturation was associated with fewer discrimination experiences; yet, higher levels of neighborhood disadvantage were related to more youth discrimination. Mothers’ discrimination experiences were associated with adolescents’ discrimination experiences when adolescents retained more of their Chinese culture. The findings of the study highlight the importance of considering the interplay between contextual and individual factors in influencing adolescents’ development.

T1  - Asking about Social Circles Improves Election Predictions Even with Many Political Parties
AN  - 2650347734
AB  - Traditionally, election polls have asked for participants’ own voting intentions. In four elections, we previously found that we could improve predictions by asking participants how they thought their social circles would vote. A potential concern is that the social-circle question might predict results less well in elections with larger numbers of political options because it becomes harder to accurately track how social contacts plan to vote. However, we now find that the social-circle question performs better than the own-intention question in predicting two elections with many political parties: The Netherlands’ 2017 general election and the Swedish 2018 general election.

T1  - When homeland remains a distant dream: language attitudes and heritage language maintenance among Rohingya refugees in Saudi Arabia
AN  - 2639121049
AB  - This study investigates the sociolinguistic situation of Myanmarese (Burmese), Rohingya-speaking refugees in Saudi Arabia, specifically on the participants’ attitudes regarding their mother tongue and the country’s official language, Arabic. The paper draws on data from a questionnaire and focus group discussions with 65 Saudi-born Rohingya refugees. The respondents generally held positive attitudes toward both Rohingya and Arabic. Positive opinions of Arabic seem to fulfill a variety of social and religious needs, including integrating into Saudi society, where Arabic opens the door to educational and economic success; and gaining access to the Qur’an and to the teachings of Islam, since they are co-religionists with the members of their host society. On the other hand, positive views of Rohingya both shape and are shaped by a number of social factors, including its use in the home and ethnic community domains, as well as its relatedness to identity. The Rohingyas have successfully created their own co-ethnic and co-linguistic networks, daily activities, and patterns of living in the low-income neighborhoods where they reside. The elements that appear to operate in favor of Rohingya and its maintenance are demography, ethnic community connectedness, and shared understanding in terms of origin, native language, history, statelessness, and destiny.

T1  - Feeling the Absence of Touch: Distancing, Distress, Regulation, and Relationships in the Context of COVID-19
AN  - 2614164211
AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, physical distancing guidelines were implemented to reduce viral spread, altering typical social interactions and reducing the amount of physical contact and affectionate touch many individuals experienced. The pandemic also caused psychological distress, perhaps in part related to reductions in affectionate touch with close others. We theorized that this would be particularly problematic for individuals reliant on affectionate touch to help regulate their emotions. Using online survey data collected nationwide from married or romantically partnered adults (N = 585), we examined how physical distancing (moderated by cohabiting with spouse/partner) and affectionate touch with close others (moderated by individual differences in typical use and efficacy of touch for affect regulation [TAR]) related to individual psychological distress and romantic relationship quality. As hypothesized, more physical distancing was associated with less affectionate touch among non-cohabiters, but surprisingly with more touch among cohabiters. Also as hypothesized, participants higher in TAR and experiencing less affectionate touch reported more psychological distress than those similarly high in TAR and experiencing more affectionate touch, or than those lower in TAR. Unexpectedly, more physical distancing was associated directly with lower psychological distress and better relationship quality. Better relationship quality was linked directly to more affectionate touch and greater endorsement of TAR. Thus, for those cohabiting in satisfying romantic relationships, physical distancing may facilitate relationship-positive behaviors. Further, individual differences in TAR may influence the potency of touch effects on mood and stress.

T1  - Psychosocial stressors predict lower cardiovascular disease risk among Mexican-American adults living in a high-risk community: Findings from the Texas City Stress and Health Study
AN  - 2580000220
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the link between systemic and general psychosocial stress and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in a group of U.S. Latinos as a function of acculturation and education within the blended guiding conceptual framework of the biopsychosocial model of the stress process plus the reserve capacity model. We analyzed data from self-identifying Mexican-origin adults (n = 396, 56.9% female, Mage = 58.2 years, 55.5% < 12 years of education, 79% U.S.-born) from the Texas City Stress and Health Study. We used established measures of perceived stress (general stress), neighborhood stress and discrimination (systemic stress) to capture psychosocial stress, our primary predictor. We used the atherosclerotic CVD calculator to assess 10-year CVD risk, our primary outcome. This calculator uses demographics, cholesterol, blood pressure, and history of hypertension, smoking, and diabetes to compute CVD risk in the next 10 years. We also created an acculturation index using English-language use, childhood interaction, and preservation of cultural values. Participants reported years of education. Contrary to expectations, findings showed that higher levels of all three forms of psychosocial stress, perceived stress, neighborhood stress, and perceived discrimination, predicted lower 10-year CVD risk. Acculturation and education did not moderate the effects of psychosocial stress on 10-year CVD risk. Contextualized within the biopsychosocial and reserve capacity framework, we interpret our findings such that participants who accurately reported their stressors may have turned to their social networks to handle the stress, thereby reducing their risk for CVD. We highlight the importance of examining strengths within the sociocultural environment when considering cardiovascular inequities among Latinos.

T1  - Drinking Alone: Local Socio-Cultural Degradation and Radical Right Support—The Case of British Pub Closures
AN  - 2553204068
AB  - Little is known about how local context influences radical right voting. This paper advances the theory that the degradation of local socio-cultural hubs is linked to radical right support by contributing to loss of community and cultural identity. I examine this thesis by exploiting an original dataset on British community pub closures. I argue that the disappearance of community pubs triggers social isolation and signals the decline of the British working class condition, which is associated with UKIP support. Combining district-level data with UK panel data (2013–2016), I show that individuals living in districts that experience one additional community pub closure (relative to the total number of pubs per district) are more likely to support UKIP than any other party by 4.3 percentage points. The effect is magnified under conditions of material deprivation. This paper highlights the significance of local socio-cultural degradation as a mechanism to explain radical right support.

T1  - Resistance as a form of resilience in sexual and gender minorities: Differential moderating roles of collective action on the discrimination–depression relationship among sexual minority men and women
AN  - 2569412560
AB  - Background As a fundamental means for transforming and advancing the conditions of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals, collective action has gained increasing attention in research, policy, and practice over the past decade. While collective action is influential in driving public awareness and policy changes, less is known about its psychological effects on individuals undertaking collective action. Methods The present study developed a scale to measure collective action for LGBT rights and examined the underlying dimensions of collective action in a sample of 1050 LGBT individuals in Hong Kong. The moderating roles of collective action on the relationship between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms were also examined. Results The LGBT Collective Action Scale measured two dimensions of collective action, i.e., private and public collective action. Private collective action moderated the association between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms among sexual minority men and women; however, the moderating effect of public collective action was only found in sexual minority women. Conclusions These differential moderating effects could be attributed to gender role socialization and gender-specific coping mechanisms in response to minority stress. Although public collective action is more powerful in triggering structural changes than private collective action, individuals in less democratic societies may not necessarily have access to public collective action due to the absence of opportunity structures. Private collective action, which is able to be initiated and undertaken individually, can be directed to transform heterosexist biases in interpersonal context. For LGBT individuals in less democratic societies, private collective action may be a more manageable way to maintain mental health in the face of stigmatization.

T1  - Sport and exercise in times of self-quarantine: How Germans changed their behaviour at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic
AN  - 2512680212
AB  - Due to the massive spread of a new Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), many European governments enacted rules and legislations in order to reduce social interactions and contain the spread of the virus. German authorities put in force a lockdown of all non-essential infrastructure, starting on 22 March 2020. These policies included the closing of sports clubs, fitness centres and community sports grounds. Most federal states prohibited social gatherings of more than two people, thereby further restricting opportunities to play sport and exercise together. The paper addresses how Germans adapted their leisure time sport and exercise (LTSE) activities in this unprecedented situation. Based on survey data representing the adult population (⩾ 14 years, N=1001, data collection 27 March to 6 April 2020), the paper shows a significant decline in LTSE activities at population level. Overall, 31% of Germans reduced their LTSE, while 27% maintained and 6% intensified their LTSE level. A share of 36% was not engaged in LTSE, either before or at the beginning of the lockdown. Younger age groups were more likely to maintain LTSE levels compared with older ones. Comparisons of ‘reducers’ and ‘maintainers/ intensifiers’ indicate that the latter group increased home-based workouts and outdoor endurance sports, while ‘reducers’ did not find adequate substitutes for their sporting routines.

T1  - Intergroup contact research in the 21st century: Lessons learned and forward progress if we remain open
AN  - 2509236491
AB  - This article presents the 2021 JSI special issue on intergroup contact, which we designed to offer a fresh outlook on a rapidly expanding literature on the antecedents, dynamics, and consequences of interactions between members of opposing groups in society—or intergroup contact. We start by discussing the results of a bibliographic search of intergroup contact research between 1937 and 2021 and organizing our analysis around two distinct phases of this research, as they are demarcated in volume and quality by Pettigrew and Tropp's landmark meta‐analysis in 2006. We then turn our attention to an overview of the 12 review and commentary articles contributing to the special issue, which reflect advancements in themes, methodologies, and analytics of the last 15 years of research. We argue that this second generation of research has effectively addressed influential and legitimate critiques of the literature and, as a result, led to a more complex and nuanced understanding of intergroup contact that can now be readily harnessed by social cohesion practitioners and policy makers to increase the efficacy of contact‐based interventions in society. We conclude by calling on a third generation of research on intergroup contact that fully harnesses diversity of ideas, peoples, and minds and keeps in close check unproductive dynamics that stifle scientific progress, and pose a threat to healthy and safe research communities. Together with the 50 diverse contributors of this special issue, we commit to making the intergroup contact research community, like the topic of intergroup contact itself, diverse and inclusive.

T1  - The complex relationship between immigrants’ concentration, socioeconomic environment and attitudes towards immigrants in Europe
AN  - 2469014473
AB  - Research has shown that positive attitudes towards immigration are often associated with a higher presence of immigrants at the local level; however, this relationship might not apply everywhere. While a higher presence of immigrants might be positive for attitudes in areas with better socioeconomic resources – via the development of more cooperative intergroup contacts – it might bring no or even a negative effect on attitudes in poorer areas – due to an enhanced competition for (scarce) resources and poorer social cohesion. This article combines data from the European Social Survey with NUTS3 aggregated data of twelve European countries to study this relationship. We find that a higher concentration of immigrants is associated with more positive attitudes towards them; in line with our expectations, this effect decreases as the socioeconomic conditions of areas worsen. In the most deprived areas, however, a higher concentration of immigrants does not have an effect on attitudes.

T1  - Integrazione multietnica e organizzazione scolastica: Una prospettiva di analisi
TT  - Multi-ethnic integration and school organization. An analytical perspective
AN  - 2618809329
AB  - Il lavoro intende contribuire alla concettualizzazione e all'analisi del legame sociale multietnico, proponendo una nuova prospettiva di analisi e d'interpretazione dell'integrazione sociale multietnica. Questa prospettiva amplia la concettualizzazione della dimensione sociale dell'integrazione proposta da Cesareo e Blangiardo, ponendo l'attenzione sulla bi-direzionalità e sulla chiusura relazionale tra soggetti etnicamente diversi. In tale direzione, la prospettiva proposta individua le variabili criterio dell'integrazione sociale multietnica nel capitale sociale bridging (Putnam) e nella distanza sociale (Cesareo; Bichi), declinati in chiave multietnica, e rintraccia nella loro combinazione la definizione di quattro categorie interpretative dell'integrazione: pacifica, conflittuale, ambivalente, indifferente/silente. Guardando al legame sociale promosso dall'organizzazione scolastica, questa prospettiva è stata applicata in uno studio empirico volto alla misurazione dell'integrazione sociale multietnica nei contesti scolastici informali ed extrascolastici di studenti (italiani e non italiani) protagonisti della realtà sociale siciliana.Alternate abstract:The paper aims to contribute to the conceptualization and analysis of the multi-ethnic social bond, proposing a new perspective of analysis and interpretation of multi-ethnic social integration. This perspective expands the conceptualization of the social dimension of integration proposed by Cesareo and Blangiardo, focusing on bi-directionality and relational closeness between ethnically diverse subjects. In this sense, the perspective proposed identifies the criterion variables of multiethnic social integration in the bridging social capital (Putnam) and in the social distance (Cesareo; Bichi) declined in a multiethnic perspective, and traces in their combination the definition of four interpretative categories of integration: peaceful, conflictual, ambivalent, indifferent/silent. Looking at the social bond promoted by the school organization, the above-mentioned perspective has been applied in an empirical study aimed at measuring multiethnic social integration in informal and extracurricular school contexts of students (Italian and non-Italian) who are leading actors in the Sicilian social reality.

AN  - 2501494122
AB  - Most adults in the U.S. and worldwide claim a religious affiliation. As an element of identity and worldview, faith informs many individuals' views of science, technology, and society at large. Engagement with faith communities and religious leaders about science can improve public perceptions and trust of scientists, advance evidence-based policy, and improve diversity, equity and inclusion in science fields. This commentary outlines examples and suggests guiding principles for science engagement with faith communities.

T1  - Rise of ‘Lonely’ Consumers in the Post-COVID-19 Era: A Synthesised Review on Psychological, Commercial and Social Implications
AN  - 2476595040
AB  - Loneliness is a pervasive problem recognised as a serious social issue, and the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated loneliness to greater prominence and concern. We expect a rise of a massive group of ‘lonely’ consumers who are deeply entrenched in the social isolation caused by COVID-19. There is an urgent need to revisit the phenomenon of lonely consumers to better prepare academic researchers, public policy makers and commercial managers in the post-COVID-19 era. Thus, this study conducts a synthesised review on past studies of lonely consumers. Based on an inductive analysis of 56 articles, 74 key themes are identified. These key themes are further categorised into five major clusters by way of a co-occurrence network analysis. Respectively, the five clusters address the psychological implications related to the dynamics between nonhuman attachment and consumers’ loneliness, the commercial implications related to the paradoxical motivations of affiliation and self-affirmation in product selection and the dual information processing mechanism in response to advertisement appeals, and the social implications related to consumers’ well-being in an ageing society and the anthropomorphic companionship in a virtual world. A list of research questions is proposed that concludes the review study.

T1  - Intersectional patterns of prejudice confrontation by White, heterosexual, and cisgender allies
AN  - 2472327791
AB  - Scholarship produced by psychologists typically focuses on one area of social identity and oppression per study (e.g., only sexism) with very little intersectional analysis across systemic oppression and privilege. To better understand the intersecting patterns of ally behavior, we examined online confrontation behavior by privileged individuals in response to antigay, antitransgender, and racist comments. Study 1 explored rates and types of confrontation during encounters with anti‐Mexican and antigay comments. Study 2 used an experimental design to assess rates and types of confrontation of anti‐Arab and antitransgender comments in the presence of a second confederate who either confronted the prejudice or remained silent. When exposed to anti‐Mexican bias, men were initially more likely to speak up than women, whereas women were more likely to respond to antigay comments. In terms of anti‐Arab and antitransgender bias, social influence resulted in more direct confrontation for anti‐Arab statements and higher rates of confrontation for antitransgender bias. Applying an intersectional lens, patterns of power and privilege reveal gender socialization may impact ally responses to racism and antigay bias. For example, gender socialization and stereotypes equating femininity with gay men may both decrease ally behavior among men and increase confrontation of antigay bias among women. When another potential ally is present, social influence appears to become the most powerful predictor of both whether or not a participant confronts bias and how direct they are with the perpetrator. Intersectional examination of invisible norms for promoting ally confrontation informs development of effective equity and justice interventions.

T1  - Is microaggression an oxymoron? A mixed methods study on attitudes toward racial microaggressions among United States university students
AN  - 2466255097
AB  - To best understand the possible negative health and social consequences associated with racial microaggression, in-depth understanding of how people judge these events is needed. People of Color (POC) and White participants (N = 64) were recruited for a mixed-methods study that incorporated quantitative attitude ratings and focus group interviews. Participants read and discussed their attitudes toward five vignettes that reflected microassault, microinsult, and microinvalidation scenarios. Semantic differential ratings showed that participants judged microassaults to be most unacceptable, followed by microinsults and then microinvalidations. Using a grounded theory approach, our qualitative analysis of interview data revealed five thematic categories. First, participants judged receivers’ psychological harm to be a critical consideration for their attitudes toward microaggression scenarios; they discussed factors associated with individual differences in appraisals, prior exposures to discrimination, and sensitivity to race. Second, participants were less consistent in their opinion about the role of the deliverers’ intent on their judgment of microaggressions; many considered microaggression events to be results of deliverers’ cultural ignorance and racial insensitivity. Third, our analysis revealed the central importance of contexts that shaped participants’ attitudes toward microaggression. Fourth, participants also discussed the notion that receivers of microaggression were racist for calling attention to race issues. Finally, POC participants tended to relate to the vignettes and use their lived experiences to contextualize their opinions about racial microaggression. The current results raise concerns regarding the conceptualization and utility of the word “microaggression,” especially within the broader contexts of racism and major discrimination. Other empirical and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - Narratives of cooperative ecological science: The case of Israel and Jordan
AN  - 2453785702
AB  - As ecosystems do not follow human-made borders, cross-border environmental cooperation can be highly effective, perhaps even necessary, for both scientific insight and conservation efforts. Several environmental cooperation initiatives between Israel and Jordan emerged since the peace treaty of 1994. These initiatives had the explicit double goal of peacebuilding and enhancing regional environmental protection. However, as political relations between Israel and Jordan have been unstable and often tense during this period, cooperation toward these goals has often proved challenging. The current study investigates one such attempt at regional scientific environmental cooperation, specifically, cooperation between Jordanian and Israeli long-term socioecological research centers. Eleven in-depth interviews with Israeli and Jordanian scientists, who constitute all the participating scientists in this initiative, were conducted in order to identify the benefits and challenges of their cross-border collaboration. A thematic analysis of the interview contents was then performed to compare the results with models and theories pertaining to intergroup relations from the field of social psychology, theories that are particularly relevant to this case study because they see collaboration toward a common goal as especially productive for decreasing intergroup prejudice and hostility. Specifically, Allport's (1954) "contact theory", and its derivatives in this context, were discussed, which asserts that personal contact between members of different groups leads to less intergroup prejudice and decreases intergroup hostility. Other social psychologists have developed Allport's work and argue that de-categorization (seeing people as individuals rather than groups) and recategorization (perceiving people from both groups as belonging to the same metagroup) are 2 additional important processes that are necessary to reduce intergroup tensions and that find support in the current investigation. The study concludes by proposing a model that describes group-identity factors, as well as other factors, contributing to the success and failure of cross-border scientific environmental initiatives in areas of regional conflict.

T1  - Support for democracy and liberal sexual mores among Muslims in Western Europe
AN  - 2406161809
AB  - There is an on-going debate whether a ‘clash of civilizations’ exists between Islam and the West, in particular in relation to support for democracy and endorsement of liberal sexual mores. This study aims to explain Muslim minorities’ support for democracy and their attitude towards these mores by making a comparison with majority members and by considering the level of religiosity and sense of national belonging. Using data from four European countries (Belgium, Germany, U.K., Switzerland), we found that Muslims compared to majority members were less supportive of democracy and of liberal sexual mores. Furthermore, these differences could be explained by Muslims’ higher level of religiosity and weaker national belonging (for liberal sexual mores). These findings demonstrate that the so-called ‘clash’ is more prominent in the case of liberal sexual mores than democracy and that not only religiosity but also the development of a sense of national belonging is important.

T1  - Will you shake my hand? Factors of noncompliance with COVID-19 behavioral rules in the framework of enforced social isolation in Russia
TT  - COVID-19 behavioral rules
AN  - 2476611331
AB  - PurposeThis research paper is devoted to the investigation of reasons for not complying with behavioral rules in the context of epidemiological situation aggravation because of COVID-19 spread.Design/methodology/approachThe study was conducted within the framework of a mixed methodology: a series of semistructured interviews and an online survey. In the first stage, 15 interviews were conducted to understand the possible reasons for not following the self-isolation rules or ignoring self-precaution recommendations. In the second stage, an online survey was conducted from 10th to 20th May 2020, gathering a total of 540 responses. This paper describes existing approaches for understanding the process of making a choice for not following recommended or obligatory behavioral rules as well as the significant reasons for making this choice.FindingsAs a result of the qualitative stage, the process of choosing to perform risky physical contact with another person was analyzed. Moreover, the possible factors that influence this behavior were discovered: primarily social environment and trust in the government, Internet, media. The way of coping with emerging conflict of making a traditional physical contact or staying in distance was also discussed. As a result of the quantitative stage, a significant contribution of trust toward institutions and official statistics on the number of people infected in different aspects of precautionary behavior was discovered, as well as other factors, such as the presence of infected in a social environment of a respondent.Originality/valueThis study contains valuable information about possible reasons for following or not following all precautions in the risky epidemiological situation and about the thinking process of an individual who does not follow precautions.

T1  - Abstract Thinking Increases Support for Affirmative Action
AN  - 2252551949
AB  - Affirmative action is the proactive process of using resources to ensure that people are not discriminated against based on their group membership, such as gender or ethnicity. It is an effective way to reduce discrimination, but attitudes toward affirmative action are often negative, especially in groups implementing affirmative action. Previous research identified different influences on attitudes toward affirmative action, but mainly unchangeable ones. We focus on the influence of abstract thinking on support for affirmative action because abstract thinking is a changeable characteristic that can direct attention to the purpose of affirmative action policies. Across five studies with U.S. MTurk workers—focusing on women as the target group, but including other target groups as well—we show that thinking abstractly improves attitudes toward affirmative action. We observe this effect using correlational (Study 1, n = 251) and experimental (Studies 2–5, ns = 201–515) designs. Additionally, we test whether perceived discrimination increases the impact of abstract thinking on attitudes toward affirmation action (Studies 2–5). We report a meta-analysis across our studies. Overall, thinking abstractly about affirmative action clearly leads to more favorable attitudes toward it, and this effect is somewhat stronger when discrimination is perceived to be high. Consequently, companies and policymakers that would like to increase support for affirmative action policies could use abstract thinking to do so, for example by encouraging employees to think about and discuss why (vs. how) affirmative action policies are implemented.

T1  - VALUING THE CAUSE: A THEORY OF AUTHENTICITY IN SOCIAL MOVEMENTS
AN  - 2393599195
AB  - Scholars of contentious politics expect that social movement organizations (SMOs) are valued according to their ability to craft resonant frames or to enact displays of worthiness. We offer an alternative, relational perspective highlighting the critical role of authenticity in shaping an SMO's perceived value. Unlike frames and intentional displays, calculated efforts to proclaim authenticity often backfire. We distill two orthogonal types: grassroots (in)authenticity, based on idealized notions of civil society, and institutional (in)authenticity, rooted in culturalcognitive schemas used to judge fit with established SMO categories. Grassroots authenticity benefits an SMO's fundamental legitimacy, while lacking it entirely (i.e., "astroturfing") severely harms public support. Institutional authenticity increases resources and survival chances, intelligibility to elite observers, and clarity of collective identities; still, lacking this (via hybridity) may assist in recruitment and outreach. We build propositions that elaborate these expectations and argue that authenticity should become a more central concept in social movement research.

T1  - Prejudice and Feeling of Threat towards Syrian Refugees: The Moderating Effects of Precarious Employment and Perceived Low Outgroup Morality
AN  - 2440692579
AB  - Refugees frequently experience traumatic situations that result in the deterioration of their psychological well-being. In addition, perceived prejudice and discrimination against them by the host society can worsen their mental health. In this research study, using a Spanish sample, prejudice towards Syrian refugees is analyzed taking into account feeling of threat (realistic or symbolic), precarious employment, and perceived outgroup morality. Using a total of 365 participants, our results reveal that individuals feel more prejudice towards refugees when the former scored higher in realistic threat and symbolic threat, were in a highly precarious situation of employment and perceived refugees as being more immoral. Furthermore, it was found that persons who scored high in realistic threat and at the same time were in a situation of precarious employment, were those who displayed greater prejudice. The results likewise pointed to individuals who scored high in symbolic threat and in outgroup morality as being those who felt greater rejection towards the refugees. Accordingly, our results confirm the importance of feeling of threat in relation to prejudice, and highlight two important moderating factors: precarious employment and perceived outgroup morality.

T1  - Acculturative Stress among Arab Students in Israel: The Roles of Sense of Coherence and Coping Strategies
AN  - 2425020104
AB  - Background: In Israeli colleges and universities, many Arab students experience acculturative stress. Such stress arises from the need to learn new cultural rules, manage the overarching conflict inherent in maintaining elements of their culture of origin (i.e., Arab culture) while incorporating elements of the host culture (i.e., Jewish academic culture), and deal with experiences of prejudice and discrimination present in the host culture. Methods: This study investigated the association between acculturative stress and depressive symptoms among 170 Arab undergraduates from northern and central Israel. It also explored the roles of sense of coherence and coping strategies in the relationship between acculturative stress and depressive symptoms. Participants completed questionnaires on acculturative stress, depressive symptoms, sense of coherence, coping strategies, and demographics. Results: The findings reveal gender differences in the use of different coping strategies and in levels of depressive symptoms. However, academic-year differences were found only in levels of sense of coherence and depressive symptoms. Specifically, female students expressed higher levels of both active and avoidant coping. Moreover, female students and those in their first and second years of university studies reported higher levels of depressive symptoms. Among the male students, acculturative stress was related to depressive symptoms indirectly via sense of coherence and active coping. In contrast, among the female students, acculturative stress was related to depressive symptoms both directly and indirectly via sense of coherence and avoidant coping. Among first- and second-year students, acculturative stress was related to depressive symptoms indirectly via sense of coherence and avoidant coping. However, among third- and fourth-year students, acculturative stress was related to depressive symptoms both directly and indirectly via sense of coherence. Conclusions: This article underscores the significance of gender and academic-year differences in pathways involving acculturative stress.

T1  - Perceptions and misperceptions: actual size, perceived size and opposition to immigration in European societies
AN  - 2376775754
AB  - The present paper contributes to the literature on the formation of attitudes and public views toward out-group populations by focusing on the relations between actual versus perceived and misperceived size of immigrant population (as indicators of competitive threat) and attitudes toward immigration. The analysis is conducted in the context of 17 European societies. The data for the analysis were obtained from the 2014 European Social Survey (ESS). The main findings lead to the conclusion that misperceptions of the size of immigrant population play a more important role than factual reality in shaping public views and attitudes toward immigration. Although perceived size is not totally detached from actual size, the discrepancy between actual and perceived size is found to be a more powerful predictor of opposition to immigration than actual size. The more inflated is the misperception the more pronounced is opposition to immigration. The impact of misperceptions, when measured as a discrepancy or a ratio, on anti-immigrant attitudes is more pronounced in countries with, proportionally, a large foreign-born population. The meaning of the findings and the relevance of misperceptions and cognitive maps in shaping public views are discussed.

T1  - Public understanding of different kinds of voice-hearing experiences: Causal beliefs, perceptions of mental illness, and stigma
AN  - 2321834123
AB  - Objective: Voice-hearers tend to face a high degree of stigma that can impact subjective well-being and social functioning. However, researchers have hypothesized that the content of the voice-hearing experience and its cultural context are relevant to stigma responses. This study experimentally tested how perceptions of voice-hearing experiences change as a function of the voice's content and the perceiver's characteristics. Method: In total, 143 nonclinical participants were presented with vignettes describing people who heard voices that were attributed to either "God" or "Abraham Lincoln" and were described as either complimentary/encouraging or insulting/threatening. For each vignette, participants were asked about the likelihood that the voice-hearer had schizophrenia or mental illness. The Causal Beliefs Questionnaire was also delivered, with two new subscales added to test for belief in positive and negative religious causes for the voices. Stigma was measured by perceived dangerousness and desire for social distance. Results: Voice-hearing experiences elicited greater stigma from participants who endorsed greater likelihood that the voice-hearer was mentally ill, greater belief in biological causes of the voice-hearing, negative religious causes, psychosocial causes, socialization causes, and causes related to personal responsibility. Endorsing positive religious causes was associated with lower stigma. Participants who were more religious were more likely to attribute voice-hearing experiences to negative religious causes (possession, lack of/misguided faith), except when the target was described as hearing the voice of God saying positive things. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: The stigma of voice-hearing experiences depends upon what the voice is saying and perceptions about the cause of the voice.

T1  - Will Black Lives Matter to the Police? African Americans' Concerns about Trump's Presidency
AN  - 2309316651
AB  - Based on a 2017 national survey of 1,000 Black Americans, perceptions regarding the implications of Donald Trump's election as President on race relations, police-minority relations, and police treatment of Black citizens in the United States were examined. Findings suggest the existence of a "Trump Effect." With minor variation across demographic groups, the survey respondents expressed overall negative perceptions concerning the effects of President Trump's election. In particular, they expressed the belief that his presidency shows that the United States is a racist society, will strain police-minority relationships, and will create a climate in which African Americans are more likely to be arrested or subjected to police violence. At issue is not just African Americans' distrust of President Trump but, importantly, whether his emphasis on "law and order" and dismissal of minority-group concerns attenuates the legitimacy of law enforcement in the eyes of African Americans.

T1  - Mistaken Identities: The Media and Parental Ethno-Religious Socialization in a Midwestern Sikh Community
AN  - 2328400508
AB  - The role of the media in constructing the stereotypical portrayal of Muslims and the effects of that image on Muslim communities in the United States have been well reported (Abbas 2004).

[...]the portrayal of Muslims in popular media has intensified stereotypical images of several other ethno-religious groups in the United States, among them Sikhs (Ahluwalia and Pellettiere 2010; Kromidas 2004; Kumar 2016).

Since boys and men are more vulnerable to bullying and discrimination due to their outward identity markers, the focus of this study was ethno-religious socialization of boys. 1.1.

According to the American Sikh Organization, this number could, in fact, be as large as 500,000 (Pew Forum 2012).

[...]of the ensuing problem of misidentification, Sikh communities have found support in collective practices that serve as antidotes to negative stereotypes (Ahluwalia and Pellettiere 2010; Kurien 2014).

T1  - Ableism Special Issue Introduction
AN  - 2295332265
AB  - In this special issue, we define ableism as stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination, and social oppression toward people with disabilities—the largest minority group in the United States. People with disabilities are broadly defined as those who have conditions that are commonly perceived to be disabilities by the general public, including physical, sensory, and intellectual disabilities, in addition to invisible disabilities, chronic health conditions, psychiatric conditions, and others. Foundational work on language, stigma, models of disability, and social and rehabilitation psychology is reviewed. The issue has three areas of focus: social and individual‐level predictors of ableism, experiences and consequences of ableism, and navigating and resisting ableism.

T1  - Political inequality in America: Who loses on spending policy? When is policy less biased?
AN  - 2571083365
AB  - Rapid growth in America’s economic inequality and endemic disadvantages among racial minorities have deepened fears about unequal political influence. From separate studies, it appears that the government responds more to the wealthy and to whites. But critical questions remain unanswered. What are relative contributions of race and class to government responsiveness? Why do these inequalities exist in the first place? And under what contexts are disparities in responsiveness reduced? To answer these questions, we assess the congruence between individual-level policy preferences and policy outcomes using the General Social Survey. We match individual spending preferences in 11 policy areas with actual federal spending to see whose preferences are realized. We find that race, more regularly than class, shapes government responsiveness. We also find that Democratic Party control eliminates most of the racial bias in responsiveness. Economic growth also narrows racial inequalities.

T1  - Post‐Critical Belief Scale and Scripture as Predictors of Prejudice
AN  - 2246701115
AB  - Recent research has linked the strength of belief (transcendence) dimension of the Post‐Critical Belief Scale (PCBS) and exposure to violent Bible verses to greater prejudice toward value‐violating outgroups. Effects of exposure to specific Bible verses on attitudes toward outgroup members have not been measured in combination with the PCBS. The current study examined the two dimensions of the PCBS and exposure to scriptural endorsements of prejudice as predictors of prejudice toward value‐violating outgroups. The strength of belief dimension of the PCBS was a significant predictor of attitudes toward atheists, gay men, lesbians, Christians, and highly religious people. Conversely, exposure to scriptural endorsements of prejudice toward atheists and gay individuals did not have a significant effect on levels of prejudice. Implications are discussed in terms of intergroup bias and the religious values conflict model.

T1  - Ethnocentrism versus group-specific stereotyping in immigration opinion: cross-national evidence on the distinctiveness of immigrant groups
AN  - 2211283854
AB  - While widespread resistance to immigration is well established in advanced democracies around the world, the role of group-specific stereotyping in anti-immigration sentiment has received limited attention. We derive a novel measurement model to assess stereotyping in three Anglo-Saxon democracies - the US, Canada, and the UK - of the modal outgroup in each country (Hispanics in the US and South Asians in Canada and the UK) and Middle Easterners/Muslims. We show that considerable variation exists in degree of stereotyping against the two major immigrant groups. In the US case, we additionally document over-time variation in group stereotyping. In a final step, we demonstrate a relationship between group antipathies and immigration policy views, akin to other policy domains in which public support varies by the ethnic characteristics of policy beneficiaries. To our knowledge, this study is the first to map stereotypes of Muslims in the US in a comparative setting and over time after 09/11, and amongst the first to link views on immigration policies to group-based stereotypes.

T1  - Ideology and Deliberation: An Analysis of Public Support for Deliberative Practices in Finland
AN  - 2430088618
AB  - The introduction of deliberative practices has been proposed as a method for revitalizing representative democracies suffering from decreasing political involvement and increasing fragmentation (Dryzek, 2000; Grönlund, Bächtiger, & Setälä, 2014; Parkinson & Mansbridge, 2012). Some scholars, however, question whether citizens are willing to engage in deliberative practices (Bartels, 2003; Hibbing & Theiss-Morse, 2002; Posner, 2004). A related concern is that deliberative practices may not appeal equally to all groups of citizens, and consequently jeopardize the principle of inclusion of all relevant arguments and experiences in deliberation (Young, 2000). Whether deliberative practices can help revitalize democracy partly depends on the extent to which support for these practices is related to ideological predispositions. Previous studies suggest that ideological predispositions systematically influence individual attitudes toward public involvement in political processes (Bengtsson & Mattila, 2009; Dalton & Welzel, 2014; Inglehart, 1997; Kriesi, 2010). If a corresponding pattern were to be found for deliberative practices, the result could be detrimental to the deliberative focus on inclusiveness. An ideological bias among supporters might translate into overrepresentation of certain ideological perspectives in deliberative events. Furthermore, if support for deliberative practices depends on strong ideological predispositions, the prospective participants in deliberation are likely to behave like activists—eager to pursue their established goals by any means necessary (Mackuen, Wolak, Keele, & Marcus, 2010, p. 440)—rather than deliberative citizens, who are considerate, balanced, open-minded, and willing to compromise (Levine & Nierras, 2007; MacKuen et al., 2010). If the composition of deliberative events is ideologically unrepresentative, it can also result in harmful group composition effects that affect the final outcome (Baek, Wojcieszak, & Delli Carpini, 2012; Barabas, 2004; Gastil, Black, & Moscovitz, 2008). It is therefore important to establish how ideological predispositions shape attitudes toward the use of deliberative practices in society. Based on these considerations, we aim to study how support for deliberative practices is linked to ideological predispositions on the traditional left–right dimension and the nationalist–cosmopolitan values dimension. Jacobs, Cook, & Delli Carpini (2009) and Neblo, Esterling, Kennedy, Lazer, & Sokhey (2010) constitute a couple of pioneering studies that examine the willingness to deliberate in the United States, and show that politically marginalized groups are willing to deliberate (Neblo et al. 2010), and that self-identified liberals are more likely to engage in deliberation than people who consider themselves to be more conservatives (Jacobs et al. 2009). However, these studies are not necessarily applicable outside the American context. Moreover, Jacobs et al. (2009) restrict their analysis to a one-dimensional conceptualization of ideology that fails to capture contemporary ideological richness. We use the Finnish National Election Study from 2015 (FNES2015) to demonstrate that individuals who are left-leaning and/or adhere to cosmopolitan values support deliberative practices. In line with the work of Zaller (1992), we also find that political awareness furthers the ability to formulate opinions that are consistent with ideological predispositions.

T1  - BIAS IN VIDEO EVIDENCE: IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICE BODY CAMERAS
AN  - 2337143338
AB  - Camera perspective bias demonstrates that videos of police interrogations focusing on the suspect yield higher ratings of guilt. This bias may generalize to police body camera videos that also focus on the suspect, particularly when observers with strong implicit racial attitudes watch a video with a racial minority suspect. We tested whether focusing on the citizen, police officer, or both influenced perception of a filmed police encounter. Compared to those who watched the officer or both individuals, those who focused on the citizen rated the citizen more negatively and the officer more positively. Participants' implicit racial attitudes significantly predicted judgments of the officer and citizen for all measures.

T1  - Situating Perceived Discrimination: How Do Skin Color and Acculturation Shape Perceptions of Discrimination Among Latinos?
AN  - 2558536372
AB  - This study uses the Latino National Study to explore the relationship between skin color, acculturation, and perceived discrimination across four situations to understand how perceptions of discrimination may function depending on the situation. Broadly, acculturation predicts a greater likelihood of perceiving discrimination across all situations, yet the situation may determine the role of skin color. Darker skin color predicts perceiving discrimination in consumer situations while it has no significant relationship to perceiving discrimination in the workplace or from police. Following the uncertainty reduction theory, a potential factor driving these results is anonymity between the person perceiving discrimination and the discriminator.

T1  - Psychological Distress in Iranian International Students at an Australian University
AN  - 2034154254
AB  - This study investigated psychological distress in Iranian international students at UNSW Australia, and explored the psychosocial factors associated with high levels of distress. A total of 180 Iranian international students pursuing undergraduate and postgraduate degrees during 2012/2013 completed an email questionnaire containing socio-demographic items and five standardized and validated scales. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyse the predictors of psychological distress. Compared to domestic and international students at two other Australian universities, a significantly smaller proportion of Iranian international students scored as distressed on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10). Greater levels of psychological distress were associated with being female, poorer physical health, less social support, less religious involvement and spirituality, and negative attitudes towards seeking professional psychological help. Findings from this growing group of international students can help inform culturally competent mental health promotion and service provision in their host countries.

T1  - Toward a Social Psychological Understanding of Migration and Assimilation
AN  - 2024709922
AB  - The experience of migrating and attempting to integrate into a host society is personally and interactionally daunting. This article suggests ways social psychological perspectives may deepen our understanding of the interactional processes that shape experiences of migration and assimilation. We argue that existing migration literature highlights assimilation outcomes while undertheorizing the social psychological processes that constitute assimilation. In this article, we begin by showing how social psychological perspectives on migration relate to traditional sociological studies of assimilation by reviewing research on stereotyping and prejudice. Next, we review studies utilizing social identity theory and symbolic interactionism to explore how immigrants cast off stigma and give positive meaning to themselves. We conclude by suggesting how incorporating social psychological perspectives into research on migration and assimilation gives us important insights into the dynamic, interactive social processes that give meaning to those experiences.

T1  - When Sexism Leads to Racism: Threat, Protecting Women, and Racial Bias
AN  - 2024343845
AB  - The stated goal of protecting White women from harm has been used, historically and contemporarily, as a pretext for racial violence. Two studies explored the relationship between protective paternalism (the belief that men should protect and care for women—part of benevolent sexism; Glick and Fiske 1996) and anti-minority racial attitudes. In Study 1 (n = 474, 61% women, 61% White), survey data found that protective paternalism was related to anti-Black bias, but only for White respondents. Study 2 (n = 242, 52% women, 74% White) experimentally manipulated feelings of threat to test for increases in protective paternalism and its corresponding effect on three anti-minority racial attitudes. For male participants only, threat (i.e., reading about recent increases in violent crime) increased endorsement of protective paternalism, which was in turn associated with a more negative view of immigration, and, for White men only, less support for policies that benefit racial minority groups and greater denial of racial bias in policing. Threat did not increase protective paternalism in female participants. For White men in particular, news of crime and danger increases racial bias by first increasing the desire to protect women. Policymakers should be aware that framing policies around safety concerns or appealing to the protection of women might unintentionally bolster anti-minority racial prejudices.

T1  - Looking like a smoker, a smokescreen to racism? Maori perceived appearance linked to smoking status
AN  - 2012857311
AB  - Objectives: Maori, the indigenous peoples of Aotearoa (New Zealand), continue to exhibit the highest rate of smoking of any ethnic group in the nation. Clarifying the present day factors which perpetuate Maori smoking has become matter of some urgency.Design: We investigate links between subjective elements of Maori identity, demographic factors and perceived discrimination with smoking status in a national probability sample of self-identified Maori (N = 667).Results: Our results suggest that core aspects of Maori identity and cultural engagement were not significantly linked with smoking. However, the extent to which participants felt they were perceived as prototypically Maori (measured as Perceived Appearance) was reliably associated with smoking. The effect of Perceived Appearance held when adjusting for perceived experiences of discrimination and other standard demographic indicators.Conclusion: Our analysis indicates that simply feeling that one is more visibly Maori is associated with an increased likelihood of smoking. This may reflect how Maori negotiate the larger systemic forces of racism present in New Zealand society.

T1  - The Anger Games: Who Voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 Election, and Why?
AN  - 2010612036
AB  - Recently released data from the 2016 American National Election Study allow us to offer a multifaceted profile of white voters who voted for Donald J. Trump in the 2016 presidential election. We find that Trump’s supporters voted for him mainly because they share his prejudices, not because they’re financially stressed. It’s true, as exit polls showed, that voters without four-year college degrees were likelier than average to support Trump. But millions of these voters—who are often stereotyped as “the white working class”—opposed Trump because they oppose his prejudices. These prejudices, meanwhile, have a definite structure, which we argue should be called authoritarian: negatively, they target minorities and women; and positively, they favor domineering and intolerant leaders who are uninhibited about their biases. Multivariate logistic regression shows that, once we take these biases into account, demographic factors (age, education, etc.) lose their explanatory power. The electorate, in short, is deeply divided. Nearly 75% of Trump supporters count themselves among his enthusiastic supporters, and even “mild” Trump voters are much closer in their attitudes to Trump’s enthusiasts than they are to non-Trump voters. Polarization is profound, and may be growing.

T1  - Interventions Highlighting Hypocrisy Reduce Collective Blame of Muslims for Individual Acts of Violence and Assuage Anti-Muslim Hostility
AN  - 1999028580
AB  - Collectively blaming groups for the actions of individuals can license vicarious retribution. Acts of terrorism by Muslim extremists against innocents, and the spikes in anti-Muslim hate crimes against innocent Muslims that follow, suggest that reciprocal bouts of collective blame can spark cycles of violence. How can this cycle be short-circuited? After establishing a link between collective blame of Muslims and anti-Muslim attitudes and behavior, we used an “interventions tournament” to identify a successful intervention (among many that failed). The “winning” intervention reduced collective blame of Muslims by highlighting hypocrisy in the ways individuals collectively blame Muslims—but not other groups (White Americans, Christians)—for individual group members’ actions. After replicating the effect in an independent sample, we demonstrate that a novel interactive activity that isolates the psychological mechanism amplifies the effectiveness of the collective blame hypocrisy intervention and results in downstream reductions in anti-Muslim attitudes and anti-Muslim behavior.

T1  - Multicultural Teaching in Flemish Secondary Schools: The Role of Ethnic School Composition, Track, and Teachers’ Ethnic Prejudice
AN  - 1992792104
AB  - In this study, we investigate the association between a school’s ethnic composition, the track in which teachers teach, and their level of involvement with multicultural teaching (MCT) in the Flemish context, taking into account the ethnic prejudice of teachers. Multilevel analyses of data from 590 Flemish teachers in 40 Belgian secondary schools suggest that teachers in schools with more ethnic minority pupils, teachers in vocational education, and ethnically unprejudiced teachers implement more MCT. These findings highlight the need for more research into the relationship between school features, the sociopsychological characteristics of teachers, and their involvement with MCT.

T1  - Imagined intergroup contact promotes support for human rights through increased humanization
AN  - 1993909001
AB  - Dehumanization concerns the denial of others' human uniqueness (animalistic dehumanization) or human nature (mechanistic dehumanization). Imagined intergroup contact has been suggested to be an effective technique for reducing dehumanization. We examined whether this intervention might primarily work by increasing the type of humanness the group specifically lacks. Study 1 revealed that after imagining contact with an animalized out-group (i.e., Gypsy people), participants attributed higher levels of human uniqueness. Study 2 replicated this finding, eliminating improved intergroup attitudes as an alternative explanation. Further, it demonstrated that imagined contact increased support for human rights, and that this was mediated by increased adscription of human uniqueness. Study 3 confirmed previous evidence by showing that after imagining contact with a mechanized out-group (i.e., Japanese people), participants attributed higher levels of human nature that explains support for human rights. Overall, imagined contact specifically works at increasing the type of humanness the group is typically denied.

T1  - Seeing the World Through the Other's Eye: An Online Intervention Reducing Ethnic Prejudice
AN  - 1990830396
AB  - We report the results of an intervention that targeted anti-Roma sentiment in Hungary using an online perspective-taking game. We evaluated the impact of this intervention using a randomized experiment in which a sample of young adults played this perspective-taking game, or an unrelated online game. Participation in the perspective-taking game markedly reduced prejudice, with an effect-size equivalent to half the difference between voters of the far-right and the center-right party. The effects persisted for at least a month, and, as a byproduct, the intervention also reduced antipathy toward refugees, another stigmatized group in Hungary, and decreased vote intentions for Hungary's overtly racist, far-right party by 10%. Our study offers a proof-of-concept for a general class of interventions that could be adapted to different settings and implemented at low costs.

T1  - Bourdieu Comes to Town: Pertinence, Principles, Applications
AN  - 1992306288
AB  - This article frames the themes of the two-part Interventions section 'Bourdieu Comes to Town'. I first establish the pertinence of Bourdieu's sociology for students of the city by revisiting his youthful work on power, space, and the diffusion of urban forms in provincial Béarn and colonial Algeria. In both cases, urbanization is the key vector of transformation, and the city, town, or camp the site anchoring the forces dissolving the social fabric of the French countryside and overturning French imperialism in North Africa. These early studies establish that all social and mental structures have spatial correlates and conditions of possibility; that social distance and power relations are both expressed in and reinforced by spatial distance; and that propinquity to the center of accumulation of capital (economic, military, or cultural) is a key determinant of the force and velocity of social change. Next, I discuss four principles that undergird Bourdieu's investigations and can profitably drive urban inquiry: the Bachelardian moment of epistemological rupture, the Weberian invitation to historicize the agent (habitus), the world (social space) and the categories of the analyst (epistemic reflexivity); the Leibnizian-Durkheimian imperative to deploy the topological mode of reasoning; and Cassirer's command to heed the constitutive efficacy of symbolic structures. The plasticity and productivity of his concepts suggest that Bourdieu can not only energize urban inquiry but also merge it into a broader analytic of the trialectic of symbolic division, social space, and the built environment. This paves a pathway for reconceptualizing the urban as the domain of accumulation, differentiation and contestation of manifold forms of capital, which makes the city a central ground, product, and prize of historical struggles.

T1  - What Explains the Differential Treatment of Renters Based on Ethnicity? New Evidence From Sydney
AN  - 1987415031
AB  - This article conducts the first contextual analysis of ethnic-based discrimination in an Australian rental housing market: metropolitan Sydney. Logistic regression is employed to investigate how the likelihood of five behaviors by rental agents that may favor Anglo home seekers varies according to characteristics of the agent, home seeker, dwelling, and neighborhood. We find that several forms of discrimination favoring Anglos are consistently more likely in neighborhoods characterized by lower crime rates and shares of renter households, regardless of the ethnicity of the agent. Other patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that, in general in the Sydney rental market, agents regardless of ethnicity are motivated to discriminate by statistical discrimination. Our result that profit, not prejudice, drives discrimination implies that it will prove resilient to unfettered housing market forces and changes in societal ethnic tolerance, but instead, must be addressed through enhanced civil rights enforcement strategies.

T1  - Sexual Attitudes Moderate the Effects of Alcohol Intoxication on Women's Risk Judgments
AN  - 1977597954
AB  - This study evaluated the effects of alcohol intoxication, sexual attitudes, and sexual victimization history on the cognitive processes underlying undergraduate women's risk judgments. Participants were 116 unmarried, undergraduate women between the ages of 21 and 29. The sample was diverse ethnically and composed primarily of heterosexual women. Stimuli were written vignettes describing social situations that varied on dimensions of sexual victimization risk and potential impact on women's popularity. Participants were assigned randomly to an alcohol or a no-alcohol condition, and completed an explicit classification task in which they rated how risky each situation was in terms of their having an unwanted sexual experience. They then completed the Sexual Experiences Survey (SES) and the Sociosexuality Scale (SS); SES responses were used to quantify the severity of victimization experiences, and SS responses were used to measure endorsement of positive attitudes toward casual, impersonal sex. Although there was no main effect for condition, higher sociosexuality predicted use of higher thresholds for judging situations as risky. Importantly, sociosexuality interacted with condition such that higher sociosexuality predicted lower sensitivity to risk information in the alcohol condition but not in the no-alcohol condition. More severe victimization history predicted increased use of popularity impactwhen judging risk. This study emphasizes the importance of identifying specific cognitive processes affected by alcohol that may explain why women have difficulty processing contextual cues signaling risk in social situations. It demonstrates also the relevance of examining individual difference factors that may exacerbate the relationship between intoxication and cognitive processing of risk-relevant information.

T1  - Young sexual minority women's definition of community: Toward addressing health disparities in the LGBTQQ community
AN  - 1977214846
AB  - In accord with Healthy People 2020 goals, the elimination of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQQ) health disparities will require community-level strategies to address stigma, discrimination, and prejudice linked to poor health. We explored how young sexual minority women (YSMW) define LGBTQQ community, community connection, community engagement, and community tensions because these concepts have implications for development and evaluation of health disparities interventions. A total of 30 YSMW (aged 18-24 years) from Michigan participated in semistructured, in-depth interviews. Participants varied by sexual identity, residency, and race/ethnicity. We analyzed transcribed interviews using thematic analysis and compared emergent themes across sexual identity, residency, and race/ethnicity. Women described community connection in terms of organizational involvement, participation in LGBTQQ spaces, and collective social identity. Participants noted how community connections were linked to stigma towards the LGBTQQ community. YSMW highlighted how divisive tensions exist within subgroups constituting the LGBTQQ community, hindering opportunities for social advocacy, unified policy priorities, and community-level interventions. The heterogeneity of YSMW's experiences identifying with the LGBTQQ community and engaging within LGBTQQ spaces suggest that researchers should attend to the role of community dynamics when developing health disparities interventions and policies. Efforts to reconcile tensions within the LGBTQQ community may strengthen and advance policymakers' ability to address sexuality-related disparities.

T1  - Couple-level Minority Stress: An Examination of Same-sex Couples' Unique Experiences
AN  - 1969814261
AB  - Social stress resulting from stigma, prejudice, and discrimination--"minority stress"--negatively impacts sexual minority individuals' health and relational well-being. The present study examined how being in a same-sex couple can result in exposure to unique minority stressors not accounted for at the individual level. Relationship timeline interviews were conducted with 120 same-sex couples equally distributed across two study sites (Atlanta and San Francisco), gender (male and female), and relationship duration (at least six months but less than three years, at least three years but less than seven years, and seven or more years). Directed content analyses identified 17 unique couple-level minority stressors experienced within nine distinct social contexts. Analyses also revealed experiences of dyadic minority stress processes (stress discrepancies and stress contagion). These findings can be useful in future efforts to better understand and address the cumulative impact of minority stress on relational well-being and individual health.

T1  - Remembrance Day influence on national sentiments and hostility towards out-groups: evidence from a panel study in Israel
AN  - 2051177967
AB  - While scholars have long emphasized the significant impact of national days on the masses, the actual impact of national days on people's national sentiments have been ignored. This study set out to examine the ways in which exposure to Remembrance Day impacts national sentiments and hostility towards out-groups. Unlike previous cross-sectional-design studies, it adopted longitudinal design in order to explore the actual impact of exposure to Remembrance Day amongst Israeli Jews. While exposure to Remembrance Day increased the respondents' sense of nationalism, neither their level of national identification and hostility towards out-groups nor the magnitude of the positive link between nationalism and hostility towards out-groups changed significantly. While national identification was unrelated to hostility prior to Remembrance Day, it became negatively related to it on Remembrance Day itself. The findings shed new light on the prevalent assumption regarding the impact national days have on public sentiment.

T1  - Revolution and antisemitism: the Bolsheviks in 1917
AN  - 1973043723
AB  - McGeever's essay offers an analysis of the Bolshevik encounter with antisemitism in 1917. Antisemitism was the dominant modality of racialized Othering in late imperial Russia. Yet 1917 transformed Jewish life, setting in motion a sudden and intense period of emancipation. In Russian society more generally, the dramatic escalation of working-class mobilization resulted not only in the toppling of the Tsar in February, but the coming to power of the Bolsheviks just eight months later. Running alongside these revolutionary transformations, however, was the re-emergence of anti-Jewish violence and the returning spectre of pogroms. Russia in 1917, then, presents an excellent case study for exploring how a socialist movement responded to rising antisemitism in a moment of political crisis and escalating class conflict. His article does two things. First, it charts how the Bolsheviks understood antisemitism, and how they responded to it during Russia's year of revolution. In doing so, it finds that Bolsheviks participated in a wide-ranging set of campaigns organized by the socialist left, the hub of which was composed of the soviets of workers' and soldiers' deputies. Second, the essay argues that antisemitism traversed the political divide in revolutionary Russia, finding traction across all social groups and political projects. As the political crisis deepened in the course of 1917, the Bolsheviks increasingly had to contend with the antisemitism within the movement. In traditional Marxist accounts, racism and radicalism are often framed in contestation. McGeever's article, however, offers a more complex picture in which antisemitism and revolutionary politics could be overlapping, as well as competing world views.

T1  - Modern prejudice and strength of conjunction error
AN  - 1938113464
AB  - PurposeModern prejudice was examined as a potential predictor of overestimating proportions of minority employees in gender-typed occupations. Strength of conjunction error was considered as an indicator of distorted perceptions of these proportions. Furthermore, the purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the association between modern prejudice and strength of conjunction error was weaker for gender-untypical than for gender-typical targets.Design/methodology/approachModern prejudice was considered as a predictor of overestimations of black female employees in Study 1 (n=183) and black female older employees in Study 2 (n=409). Data were collected using internet-mediated questionnaires.FindingsIn Study 1, modern racism, but not modern sexism, was associated with greater strength of conjunction error when respondents were presented with gender-typical targets. In Study 2, using a sample scoring higher on modern prejudice than in Study 1, modern racism, but not modern sexism and modern ageism, was associated with greater strength of conjunction error, irrespective of target occupation. Furthermore, there was an unexpected association between lower sexism and greater strength of conjunction error for gender-typical targets, but not for gender-untypical targets.Research limitations/implicationsThe findings lend support to the ethnic-prominence hypothesis in that modern racism, but not modern sexism or modern ageism, was associated with greater strength of conjunction error. Furthermore, empirical evidence suggests that target non-prototypicality can dilute the effect of modern prejudice on strength of conjunction error.Originality/valueThis is one of the rare studies examining attitudes and conjunction error in a work-relevant context, thereby bridging the gap between social cognition and applied psychology.

T1  - Anxiety Reduces Empathy Toward Outgroup Members But Not Ingroup Members
AN  - 1954915073
AB  - Substantial research concludes that favoritism toward members of people's ingroup, or ingroup bias, motivates people to oppose public programs that assist needy outgroup individuals. I argue that a gap in the empathic capacity for ingroup and outgroup members motivates and maintains ingroup bias in helping behavior and is sensitive to contextual cues that trigger anxiety. Using a novel experimental design, Study 1 demonstrates that anxiety exacerbates the outgroup empathy gap. Study 2 replicates these findings with an explicit measure of outgroup empathy. Study 3 shows that the outgroup empathy gap causes individuals to become less supportive of helping needy outgroup members. These studies suggest that opposition to welfare programs may go beyond simple prejudice.

T1  - Beyond the two-group paradigm in studies of intergroup conflict and inequality: Third parties and intergroup alliances in xenophobic violence in South Africa
AN  - 1877774188
AB  - Social psychologists typically conceptualize intergroup processes in terms of unequal pairs of social categories, such as an advantaged majority (e.g., 'Whites') and a disadvantaged minority (e.g., 'Blacks'). We argue that this two-group paradigm may obscure the workings of intergroup power by overlooking: (1) the unique dynamics of intergroup relations involving three or more groups, and (2) the way some two-group relationships function as strategic alliances that derive meaning from their location within a wider relational context. We develop this argument through a field study conducted in a grape-farming town in South Africa in 2009, focusing on an episode of xenophobic violence in which a Zimbabwean farm worker community was forcibly evicted from their homes by their South African neighbours. Discursive analysis of interview accounts of the nature and origins of this violence shows how an ostensibly binary 'xenophobic' conflict between foreign and South African farm labourers was partially constituted through both groups' relationship with a third party who were neither victims nor perpetrators of the actual violence, namely White farmers. We highlight some potential political consequences of defaulting to a two-group paradigm in intergroup conflict studies.

T1  - Supporting the democratic political organisation of Muslim immigrants: the perspective of Muslims in the Netherlands and Germany
AN  - 2076977383
AB  - Using data from three survey studies, this paper examines the support for the democratic political organisation of Muslims among Muslim immigrants in the Netherlands (Studies 1, 2, and 3) and Germany (Study 3). Using a social psychological perspective, support is examined in relation to religious group identification, Muslim linked fate, perceived discrimination, fundamentalist religious belief, and host national identification. The findings in all three studies show support for the political organisation of Muslims. Furthermore, higher religious group identification and higher linked fate were associated with stronger support. More discrimination and more fundamentalist beliefs were also associated with stronger support, and part of these associations was mediated by linked fate. National identification was not associated with support for the political organisation of Muslims.

T1  - Perceived Caste Discrimination, Self Esteem and Self Determination among college students belonging to Scheduled Castes
AN  - 1926526974
AB  - Discrimination is defined as the unjust and prejudicial treatment of different categories of people based on the group, class or category to which that person belongs. Self-esteem refers to a favourable or unfavourable attitude toward the self. Self determination is when individuals experience one of two forms of motivation: autonomous or controlled. Autonomous motivation is when people experience a profound sense of choice. In contrast, when individuals experience controlled motivation, they feel obliged and driven by forces that transcend the self. The present study is a quantitative study with a between groups design to observe if there is a difference between female students and male students belonging to the scheduled castes with respect to perceived caste discrimination, self esteem and self determination and its two dimensions (viz., self-contact and choicefulness). It also adopts a correlational design to study the relationship between perceived caste discrimination, self esteem and self determination and its two dimensions. Through purposive sampling, data was collected from 200 college students belonging to the scheduled castes. Brief Perceived Ethnic Discrimination Questionnaire-Community Version, Rosenberg's Self-esteem Scale and Self Determination Scale were used. Results of independent samples ř-test indicated a significant difference between female and male students, with respect to perceived caste discrimination. Pearson's correlation revealed a significant positive relationship between perceived caste discrimination and self-esteem in female students and a significant negative relationship between perceived caste discrimination and self-contact (dimension of self-determination) in both female and male students. In male students, a significant positive relationship between perceived caste discrimination and choicefulness (dimension of self-determination) was also found. In light of the current tumultuous environment in universities across India with regard to the issue of caste discrimination, the findings of the present study highlights the association of perceived caste discrimination with psychological factors which can be used for various interventions in educational institutions.

T1  - Human Rights: What the United States Might Learn from the Rest of the World and, Yes, from American Sociology
AN  - 1844786825
AB  - The U.S. Constitution includes civil and political rights--as individual rights--but does not include what is internationally understood to be "human rights," namely rights we enjoy as equals, including economic, social, and cultural rights, and protections for vulnerable persons, such as children, minorities, mothers, and refugees. The United States has not ratified any international (United Nations) or regional (Organization of American States) human rights treaty, is not a party to the Rome Statute that established the International Criminal Court, and is no longer a member of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. It might be concluded that Americans do not know what human rights are. It is more complicated than that. While opinion polls show that Americans often endorse individual rights--e. g., the rights of women--they do not frame them as being interdependent or being within the purview of government. Can we conclude that human rights have no place in the United States? Not at all. This article concludes by showing that many U.S. institutions of higher learning have programs in human rights and that some academic associations, including the American Sociological Association, recognize human rights.

T1  - From "brute" to "thug:" The demonization and criminalization of unarmed Black male victims in America
AN  - 1768022922
AB  - The synonymy of Blackness with criminality is not a new phenomenon in America. Documented historical accounts have shown how myths, stereotypes, and racist ideologies led to discriminatory policies and court rulings that fueled racial violence in the post-Reconstruction era and have culminated in the exponential increase of Black male incarceration today. Misconceptions and prejudices manufactured and disseminated through various channels such as the media included references to a "brute" image of Black males. In the 21st century, this negative imagery of Black males has frequently utilized the negative connotation of the terminology "thug." In recent years, law enforcement agencies have unreasonably used deadly force on Black males allegedly considered to be "suspects" or "persons of interest." The exploitation of these often-targeted victims' criminal records, physical appearances, or misperceived attributes has been used to justify their unlawful deaths. Despite the connection between disproportionate criminality and Black masculinity, little research has been done on how unarmed Black male victims, particularly but not exclusively at the hands of law enforcement, have been posthumously criminalized. This article investigates the historical criminalization of Black males and its connection to contemporary unarmed victims of law enforcement. Action research methodology in the data collection process is utilized to interpret how Black male victims are portrayed by traditional mass media, particularly through the use of language, in ways that marginalize and devictimize these individuals. This study also aims to elucidate a contemporary understanding of race relations, racism, and the plight of the Black male in a 21-century "postracial" America.

T1  - Proud to be an American?: The Changing Relationship of National Pride and Identity
AN  - 1951415561
AB  - The attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001 and subsequent military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq created a sharp increase in expressions of national pride and the invocation of "nation" in political discourse. Using the 1996 and 2004 General Social Surveys, we document these changing patterns of national pride, and ask how they affect conceptions of national identity. We report three main findings. First, the data corroborate the conventional wisdom that there was a greater expression of national pride than before September 11, 2001. Second, conceptions of American national identity became more nativist. Finally, the conventionally accepted distinction between patriots and nationalists has shrunk; patriots, like nationalists, are more likely to express nativist conceptions of national identity during a time of threat than they were pre-9/11. Our findings have important implications for research on group identification and national identity formation.

T1  - Does authoritarianism imply ethnocentric national attitudes: A revised look at the "authoritarian triad" and right-wing ideology
AN  - 1790523732
AB  - Dozens of studies have shown that authoritarian people are ethnocentric. They are described as nationalistic, prejudiced, and hostile toward ethnic/national out-groups. However, it can be argued that this critical claim remains unproven, as researchers do not take into consideration the very conservative right-wing views typical of authoritarian people. To address this problem, two theoretical approaches were contrasted: the most commonly used right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) approach and the group authoritarianism approach. Both approaches define authoritarianism as the covariance of submission, aggression, and conventionalism, but they differ in that the former is inextricably related to right-wing ideology while the latter is not. This paper presents the results of two survey studies conducted on samples of 600 and 400 respondents. In Study 1, it was found that RWA and group authoritarianism had different patterns of relationships with in-group and out-group national attitudes, providing strong evidence in support of the hypothesis that the right-wing ideology generated ethnocentric national attitudes. Study 2 showed a strong direct effect of right-wing ideology on ethnocentric national attitudes, while the impact of "pure" authoritarian covariance is marginal and sometimes even seems to be negative (e.g.,ethnic prejudices). These findings suggest that authoritarianism has little to do with ethnocentric national attitudes. It is not the covariance of authoritarian attitudes that results in growing ethnocentrism. The true perpetrator can be found in the large component of right-wing ideology contained in such measurement instruments as the RWA scale.

T1  - Support for Far Right Ideology and Anti-Migrant Attitudes among Youth in Europe: A Comparative Analysis
AN  - 1993534260
AB  - The last decade has seen a notable increase in support for far right parties and an alarming rise of right-wing extremism across Europe. Drawing on a new comparative youth survey in 14 European countries, this article provides deeper insight into young people's support for nationalist and far right ideology: negative attitudes towards minorities, xenophobia, welfare chauvinism and exclusionism in relation to migrants. We first map the support for far right ideology among youth in Europe, and then use multilevel regression analysis (16,935 individuals nested in 30 locations) to investigate which individual or contextual factors are associated with a higher propensity among young people towards getting involved in far right movements.

T1  - How Women of Color Detect and Respond to Multiple Forms of Prejudice
AN  - 1719468151
AB  - The processes by which women of color and White women living in the United States detect and respond to prejudice may differ because women of color experience racism, sexism and intersectional bias. This review builds on past research by articulating how existing process models of stigmatization, when applied to the stigmatization of women of color, leave important research questions unanswered. Stigmatized individuals' interpretations of and responses to others' behaviors are continuously shaped by the possibility that they will be targeted by prejudice. In each interaction in which prejudice is plausible, targets first determine whether they have experienced prejudice and, if so, they cope with the psychological and emotional consequences of prejudiced treatment. Current theories of stigmatization best account for the experiences of people who face only one form of prejudice. In contrast, we consider how women of color, who possess multiple stigmatized identities, respond to the multiple forms of prejudice they face. First, we identify barriers to including women of color in stigma research. Second, we describe research examining how targets with one stigmatized identity detect, respond to and cope with prejudice. Third, we draw on related research on multiple identities in areas outside of the stigma literature (e.g., intergroup bias, cognition) to raise questions that are important to address in future stigma research. Our analysis is supported primarily by research conducted in the U. S. Addressing the research questions raised in this review will position the stigma literature to more readily capture the stigmatizing experiences of women of color.

T1  - How Academics View Conservative Protestants
AN  - 1767330495; 201609096
AB  - A sizable body of research has demonstrated an anti-conservative Christian perspective among academics. Our research explores academics' negative attitudes toward conservative Protestants. We asked academics to rate Protestant Christian groups, and then explain their ratings, how they define mainline, evangelicals, and fundamentalist Protestants, and articulate the differences between various Protestant groups. Identifying as conservative Protestant and intergroup contact with conservative Protestants best predict less antipathy toward conservative Protestants. Analysis of open-ended questions indicates three groups of academics: Conservative Protestant Critics, Theological Definers, and Low Information. Conservative Protestant Critics envision conservative Protestants as intolerant, unscientific enemies to be openly opposed. Theological Definers are fairly supportive of evangelicals and project an image of objective assessment toward them. Low Information respondents do not have much knowledge of or interest in conservative Protestants. Ultimately, symbolic boundaries and lack of intergroup contact reinforce an academic identity that dismisses conservative Protestants for their perceived traits. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Predicting Positive and Negative Relationships in Large Social Networks
AN  - 1688547591
AB  - In a social network, users hold and express positive and negative attitudes (e.g. support/opposition) towards other users. Those attitudes exhibit some kind of binary relationships among the users, which play an important role in social network analysis. However, some of those binary relationships are likely to be latent as the scale of social network increases. The essence of predicting latent binary relationships have recently began to draw researchers' attention. In this paper, we propose a machine learning algorithm for predicting positive and negative relationships in social networks inspired by structural balance theory and social status theory. More specifically, we show that when two users in the network have fewer common neighbors, the prediction accuracy of the relationship between them deteriorates. Accordingly, in the training phase, we propose a segment-based training framework to divide the training data into two subsets according to the number of common neighbors between users, and build a prediction model for each subset based on support vector machine (SVM). Moreover, to deal with large-scale social network data, we employ a sampling strategy that selects small amount of training data while maintaining high accuracy of prediction. We compare our algorithm with traditional algorithms and adaptive boosting of them. Experimental results of typical data sets show that our algorithm can deal with large social networks and consistently outperforms other methods.

T1  - How contact shapes implicit and explicit preferences: attitudes toward Roma children in inclusive and non-inclusive environment
AN  - 1674422111
AB  - In two studies, the authors examined the effects of intergroup contact in inclusive and non-inclusive environments on children's explicit and implicit prejudices. In both studies, supervised contact with Roma peers, instructed by inclusive program, led to a more positive explicit evaluation of Roma and less social distance, while it had no significant impact on implicit attitudes. In contrast, implicit attitudes were related to mere exposure to Roma (Study 2). Intergroup anxiety and self-disclosure mediated the effect of inclusiveness level on explicit, but not on implicit attitudes. The results indicate that two types of attitudes might be formed via different routes, and that mere exposure and supervised contact influence them differently. This information could help tailor future prejudice reduction programs.

T1  - The effect of television viewing on ethnic prejudice against immigrants: A study in the Italian context
AN  - 1735657105; 201536976
AB  - Television viewers construct many different meanings from the programs they watch. Here, we investigated whether ethnic prejudice is differentially influenced by the genre of television programs in their portrayal of ethnic minorities. We also wanted to determine whether a higher educational level reduces ethnic prejudice and television use. A self-reported questionnaire was administered to 401 Italian adults. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships between ethnic prejudice and television program contents and educational level. Viewing Reality and Variety Shows was positively related to ethnic prejudice, News and Public Affairs was negatively related, and Films and TV series had no apparent influence on prejudice. Educational level was negatively related to both ethnic prejudice and watching Reality and Variety Shows, and positively related to viewing News and Public Affairs and Films and TV series programs.

T1  - Psychological asymmetry in minority-majority relations at different stages of ethnic conflict
AN  - 1767328872; 201606257
AB  - This study investigated the psychological asymmetry of majority and minority intergroup attitudes at different conflict stages: high versus low intensity conflict. Cross-sectional surveys using the same outcome measures were conducted at two time points with representative Kurdish and Turkish community samples in selected neighborhoods in the city of Izmir in Turkey. The first survey was conducted during a period of low intensity conflict (LIC), whereas the second survey was conducted 6 months later during a period of high intensity conflict (HIC). The results revealed seemingly paradoxical outcomes among minority Kurds, such that during HIC they exhibited higher social distance and less support for (Turkish) nationalistic leaders, but also higher endorsement of assimilative nationalism, less out-group negativity, and lower support for minority Kurdish rights. By contrast, Turks exhibited lower social tolerance, more support for nationalistic leaders, higher out-group negativity, lower support for minority rights, and higher endorsement of assimilative nationalism during HIC than LIC. Turks' and Kurds' images of each other were also assessed, revealing patterns consistent with image theory predictions: Turks viewed Kurds as rogue, whereas Kurds viewed Turks as barbarian. While Turks' out-group images did not change over time, Kurds' images of Turks were slightly more variable at HIC than LIC. The findings are interpreted in light of distinct challenges that conflict and violence at the national level poses to ethnic minorities and majorities. The results highlight the importance of considering the role of dynamic inter-group contexts on understanding micro-level intergroup outcomes. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Traits and Roles in Gender Stereotypes: A Comparison between Moroccan and Spanish Native Samples
AN  - 1535959661
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Social Roles of Men and Women in Spain: Emerging Issues and Implications for International Research              This study examines gender role attitudes and attitudes toward "man" and "woman" in two native samples from Spain and Morocco. The samples were made up of 400 participants, 200 in each country, containing the same number of men and women and selected with a similar procedure. We expected differences based on the independent variables of nationality, gender and educational level. The Spanish sample, female and student participants were predicted to present more egalitarian gender role attitudes and more positive attitudes toward "woman" than participants in the Moroccan sample, male and non-student participants. Overall MANOVAs were used to show the differences in gender role attitudes and attitudes toward "man" and "woman". Results confirmed the role of the nationality variable in the expected way. The Spanish sample showed a more egalitarian view and more favorable attitudes toward "woman" than the Moroccan one. Educational level and gender showed significant effects on the Moroccan sample but only partially. Moroccan student females and non-student males presented a more egalitarian view than non-student females and student males respectively.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Minority nations and attitudes towards immigration: the case of Quebec
AN  - 1507339807
AB  - Growing international migration constitutes a tremendous challenge for contemporary democracies, no more so than for minority nations. An important challenge for the latter is one of acceptance of immigration from the native-born population, in a context in which immigrant can be seen as both a cultural and a political threat. In this article we ask what explains attitudes towards immigration in minority nations. More specifically, we seek to provide answers to these questions: What is the impact of cultural insecurity on attitudes towards immigration in minority nations? Is strong attachment to a minority nation associated with less positive attitudes towards immigration? And finally, are proponents of independence for minority nations more likely to favour a reduction in the level of immigration than those who oppose it? The article seeks to answer these questions by exploring the case of Quebec.   [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - What Makes a Young Assertive Bystander? The Effect of Intergroup Contact, Empathy, Cultural Openness, and In-Group Bias on Assertive Bystander Intervention Intentions
AN  - 1559005085; 201433440
AB  - The present research tests the indirect effects of intergroup contact on adolescents' bystander intervention intentions via four potential mediators: 'empathy,' 'cultural openness,' 'in-group bias,' and 'intergroup anxiety.' British adolescents (N = 855), aged 11-13 years, completed measures of intergroup (interethnic) contact and the identified indirect variables. Intended bystander behavior was measured by presenting participants with an intergroup (immigrant) name-calling scenario. Participants rated the extent to which they would behave assertively. The findings extend previous intergroup contact research by showing a significant indirect effect of intergroup contact on assertive bystander intentions via empathy, cultural openness and in-group bias (but not via intergroup anxiety). Theoretical implications and practical suggestions for future prejudice-reduction interventions are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Race/ethnicity and perceptions of the police: a comparison of White, Black, Asian and Hispanic Americans
AN  - 1520331345; 201419190
AB  - This study extends the dominant Black-White paradigm in assessing public perceptions of the police by including Hispanic and Asian Americans. Relying on a large random sample of Seattle residents, this study examines: (1) perceptions of police problem-solving, hassling, racial profiling and bias among Hispanic, Asian, Black and White Americans and (2) factors that influence police perceptions. Results reveal both majority-minority and inter-minority variations in attitudes towards police, suggesting that a single vertical scale or gradation of attitudes cannot adequately describe the complexity of different racial/ethnic groups' perceptions of multiple aspects of policing. A range of individual demographic, police- and crime-related, and neighbourhood structural and cultural factors influence public perceptions of the police. Some interesting findings include that educational attainment and employment have negative effects on public satisfaction with the police, police visibility is associated with greater satisfaction with police problem-solving yet stronger beliefs on police harassment and racial profiling, and neighbourhood codes of violence is a consistent and outstanding predictor of public perceptions of the police. Possible explanations are provided. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Patterns in Account-Giving among White Collar Criminals
AN  - 1520336638; 201411562
AB  - Using Swedish entrepreneurs' own explanations, this article searches for the possible regularities in the accounts offered by white collar offenders and for the underlying factors that produce these regularities, tracing in particular the impact of these offenders' attitudes toward regulation and taxation as well as their perceptions of the functioning of the market in which they operate. The results show that justifications are more common among offenders who have a clearly negative view on both factors. Excuses, on the other hand, are more frequently used by those who hold a positive attitude toward taxation and regulation. The results also show that offenders who offer excuses tend to share the same negative perception of the market as the 'justifiers.' This unanticipated finding suggests that the 'excusers' commit their offenses because they believe that the unlawful behaviors of the relevant others disturb the functioning of the market mechanism and thereby push them toward criminality.

T1  - Cultural Variation in the Minimal Group Effect
AN  - 1494750917; 201402244
AB  - The minimal group effect (MGE) is one of the most robust psychological findings in studies of intergroup conflict, yet there is little evidence comparing its magnitude across cultures. Recent evidence suggests that the MGE is due in part to a projection of one's own perceived characteristics onto the novel in-group. Because of cultural variability in self-enhancement motivations, we thus expected that those from East Asian cultures would exhibit a diminished MGE relative to Westerners. A large and diverse sample of Japanese and American participants completed a traditional minimal group study. American participants were more likely to show an in-group bias in group identification, perceived group intelligence, perceived group personality traits, and resource allocation. Furthermore, these cultural differences were partially mediated by self-esteem. We discuss the implication of these findings for theories of intergroup conflict and suggest multiple directions for future cross-cultural research on the MGE.

T1  - ATTITUDES TOWARDS MUSLIMS ARE MORE FAVORABLE ON A SURVEY THAN ON AN IMPLICIT RELATIONAL ASSESSMENT PROCEDURE (IRAP)
AN  - 1718067479; 201530636
AB  - Sugar ingestion bolsters cognitive resources, which should improve ability to inhibit expressing socially undesirable responses on explicit measures, including surveys. In this study, undergraduates drank regular or diet root-beer, then completed an Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure (IRAP) followed by an Anti-Muslim Prejudice Scale (AMPS). The IRAP indicated neutral attitudes about Muslims and positive attitudes about Westerners. However, the AMPS indicated significant pro-Muslim attitudes. There was no significant effect of drink on the AMPS. However, participants who drank regular root-beer showed stronger anti-Muslim bias on the IRAP. Increased bias following sugar ingestion may reflect a discrepancy between implicit and explicit measures. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Life-course Perspective on Adolescents' Attitudes to Police: DARE, Delinquency, and Residential Segregation
AN  - 1494299675; 201404508
AB  - Objectives: Describe the developmental trajectory of perceptions of the police by youth as they transition from adolescence to young adulthood. Method: A longitudinal experiment to evaluate the impact of the D.A.R.E. program (N = 1,773). Latent variable growth modeling was used. Results: A dramatic decline in the favorable attitudes of youth toward the police begins in about seventh grade. More negative perceptions of police are associated with minority racial status, negative experiences with officers, involvement in the delinquent subculture, and greater expressions of skewed legal norms. There is a long-term positive effect of D.A.R.E. on attitudes toward the police, particularly for African American youth. Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of theorizing about perceptions of the police from a life course perspective. Findings raise new policy questions about the long-term impact of school-based programs, such as D.A.R.E., and the role of multiple reference groups in the formation of minorities' attitudes. More research is needed to gain a better understanding of the cognitive and experiential processes involved in attitude formation.

T1  - Enhancing moral virtues: Increased perceived outgroup morality as a mediator of intergroup contact effects
AN  - 1463011873; 201345655
AB  - Research has shown that intergroup contact is one of the most powerful approaches for improving outgroup attitudes. Further, it has been revealed that contact exerts its effects on prejudice reduction mostly by inducing positive affective processes. The present study (N = 146) investigated whether stereotype content enhancement along the core dimensions of competence, sociability, and morality might represent a basic cognitive mechanism driving the contact effects. Results showed that face-to-face encounters with immigrants increased their perceived competence, sociability, and morality. However, only increased perceived outgroup morality mediated the effect of contact on outgroup responses. Our findings extend prior research on the mediators of intergroup contact, showing the key role of perceived morality in driving the contact effects. The importance of these findings for improving intergroup relations is discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Combating the mental health stigma with nostalgia
AN  - 1448995371; 201342739
AB  - We report research implicating nostalgia as an intrapersonal means of warding off the stigmatization of persons with mental illness. We hypothesized and found that nostalgia about an encounter with a person with mental illness improves attitudes toward the mentally ill. In Experiment 1, undergraduates who recalled an encounter with a mentally ill person while focusing on central (vs. peripheral) features of the nostalgia prototype reported a more positive outgroup attitude. This beneficial effect of nostalgia was mediated by greater inclusion of the outgroup in the self (IOGS). In Experiment 2, undergraduates who recalled a nostalgic (vs. ordinary) interaction with a mentally ill person subsequently showed a more positive outgroup attitude. Results supported a serial mediation model whereby nostalgia increased social connectedness, which predicted greater IOGS and outgroup trust. IOGS and outgroup trust, in turn, predicted more positive outgroup attitudes. We ruled out alternative explanations for the results (i.e., mood, perceived positivity, and typicality of the recalled outgroup member). The findings speak to the intricate psychological processes underlying the prejudice-reduction function of nostalgia and their interventional potential. . [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - 'Categories We Share': Mobilising Common In-groups in Discourse on Contemporary Immigration in Greece
AN  - 1429639919; 201335620
AB  - Prejudice reduction has been an important concern within social psychology both in theory and applied research. According to the premises of Social Identity Theory, redrawing of the category boundaries is often considered a necessary step in order to battle prejudice, because in-group favouritism when the category boundaries change is diffused to the previously distinct identities. The present paper offers a review of the relevant research, and following a discourse analytic perspective argues that recategorisation can also be viewed as a rhetorical resource that people use in verbal interaction in order to achieve certain rhetorical ends. This point is exemplified using interview data from Greece with Greek participants who mobilise common in-groups between themselves and the immigrants in Greece. Different common in-groups were mobilised on the basis of common human nature, common ethnic descent and through the use of the common experience of migration that many Greek people have because Greece has been an emigrant sending country for the biggest part of the 20th century. Occasionally, these category constructions were used to differentiate between immigrants of different ethnic descent claiming that only certain immigrant groups can integrate to Greek society, whereas on other instances, these common in-groups were used in order to inoculate speakers of accusations of prejudice.

T1  - Heterosexuals' Attitudes Toward Transgender People: Findings from a National Probability Sample of U.S. Adults
AN  - 1357002397
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Intersections of LGBT, Racial/Ethnic Minority, and Gender Identities              Using data from a national probability sample of heterosexual U.S. adults (N=2,281), the present study describes the distribution and correlates of men's and women's attitudes toward transgender people. Feeling thermometer ratings of transgender people were strongly correlated with attitudes toward gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals, but were significantly less favorable. Attitudes toward transgender people were more negative among heterosexual men than women. Negative attitudes were associated with endorsement of a binary conception of gender; higher levels of psychological authoritarianism, political conservatism, and anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity; and lack of personal contact with sexual minorities. In regression analysis, sexual prejudice accounted for much of the variance in transgender attitudes, but respondent gender, educational level, authoritarianism, anti-egalitarianism, and (for women) religiosity remained significant predictors with sexual prejudice statistically controlled. Implications and directions for future research on attitudes toward transgender people are discussed.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The attitudinal consequences of thought suppression: A focus on thinness thoughts
AN  - 1773421261
AB  - Four studies examined whether thought suppression could enhance attitude accessibility and whether behaviours that are consistent with the more accessible attitudes would follow. Thinness was examined as the attitude object. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that suppression of positive thoughts about thinness increased the accessibility of the positive attitudes associated with thinness. Experiments 3 and 4 showed that suppression of positive thinness thoughts also elicited more health-promoting behaviours. The implications of the findings for attitude accessibility and the practical consequences of thought suppression are discussed.

T1  - Discrimination and the Health of Immigrants and Refugees: Exploring Canada's Evidence Base and Directions for Future Research in Newcomer Receiving Countries
AN  - 1478096047; 22729289
AB  - Research and practice increasingly suggests discrimination compromises health. Yet the unique experiences and effects facing immigrant and refugee populations remain poorly understood in Canada and abroad. We review current knowledge on discrimination against newcomers in Canada, emphasizing impacts upon health status and service access to identify gaps and research needs. Existing knowledge centers around experiences within health-care settings, differences in perception and coping, mental health impacts, and debates about "non-discriminatory" health-care. There is need for comparative analyses within and across ethno-cultural groups and newcomer classes to better understand factors shaping how discrimination and its health effects are differentially experienced. Women receive greater attention in the literature given their compounded vulnerability. While this must continue, little is known about the experiences of youth and men. Governance and policy discourse analyses would elucidate how norms, institutions and practices shape discriminatory attitudes and responses. Finally, "non-discriminatory health-care" interventions require critical evaluation to determine their effectiveness. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Ambassadors of gender equality? How use of pair forms versus masculines as generics impacts perception of the speaker
AN  - 1315600232; 201307423
AB  - Although the use of gender fair language is strongly promoted in German-speaking countries, the impact of its use on the way speakers are perceived by others is still unknown. Results of two experimental studies showed that irrespective of their sex, speakers using pair forms rather than generic masculines were perceived more competent by both men and women. Also, they were seen as less sexist by male and female listeners with positive attitudes towards linguistic equality. Findings with respect to the attribution of warmth were more complex: they were not only impacted by language use, but also dependent on speaker's sex and listener's attitude towards linguistic equality. Results are discussed in the context of language and stereotypes. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - 'We' is for Anarchism: Construction and Use of Collective Identity in the Anarchist Press of Fin-de-siècle Switzerland1
AN  - 1291088240
AB  - Despite strong statist and societal headwinds in late 19th and early 20th century, the anarchist movement in Switzerland persisted and for both seasoned and new activists, it remained an inviting and attractive movement to engage in. This paper brings to attention, that the permanent (re)constitution of collective identity played an integral part herein. As I shall contend, collective identity's dualistic character of simultaneous preservation and maintenance on one hand and of progress and development on the other, was key to the preservation of anarchism as a social movement in Switzerland. The analysis of 23 anarchist newspapers published between 1885 and 1914 in Switzerland in French and German discloses construction, use and embodiment of anarchist collective identity that are to be presented and discussed. In conclusion, light shall be shed on collective identity's role as a key motivational factor for social movements that focus on abstracta rather than on realia. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The impacts of friendship groups' racial composition when perceptions of prejudice threaten students' academic self-concept
AN  - 1417522448; 201333530
AB  - Literature on racially prejudiced stereotypes suggests that students' academic self-concepts (ASC) can be damaged when a stereotype demeans the intelligence of their racial or ethnic group. There is little research on how students overcome this burden, but there is some evidence that the racial composition of friendship groups play a role. One argument suggests having racially diverse friends could help students see the inaccuracy of stereotypes and another points out that racially homogenous friends could collectively resist the stereotypes as a support group. In this study I analyze a nationally representative and racially diverse sample of United States adolescents to examine these hypotheses. After estimating multivariate regression models for four separate racial/ethnic groups (Asian, African-American, Hispanic, white), results show that although perceptions of prejudice do predict decreases in ASC for African-American students, racially homogenous friendship groups have the opposite effect which lends credibility to the support group hypothesis. In addition, racial diversity of friendship groups predicts decreased ASC for African-American students, suggesting diverse groups could make prejudice more salient. The implications for these findings include the reminder that prejudice is still a valid concern in American schools and that peers can be a significant source of racial tension and/or support. In terms of students' ASC, it is important for educators to be aware of these social conditions and to continue to seek a better understanding of race relations in schools so that more students are not psychologically burdened by racial tension.

T1  - Islamophobia and Threat Perceptions: Explaining Anti-Muslim Sentiment in the West
AN  - 1188305855
AB  - This article investigates the determinants of anti-Muslim sentiment in the West. Starting from the premise that Islamophobic attitudes are more nuanced than a simple dislike of Muslims, I focus on specific forms of attitudes which link Muslims to violence and terrorism. Data from the Pew Global Attitudes Surveys are used to test three theories: perceived threat, social identity, and cognitive capabilities. A series of logit estimations are used for the empirical analysis of individual level data in the USA, Great Britain, France, Germany, and Spain. The results show that perceived realistic and symbolic threat is the most significant source of Islamophobic attitudes in the West. While individuals cognitively differentiate between general feelings toward Muslims and their specific characteristics, higher levels of education significantly reduces negative sentiments. A good number of Westerners think of Muslims as violent individuals while some believe that they support al-Qaeda. Citizens in the West are more likely to associate Muslims with terrorism if they feel threatened by their physical and cultural existence. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Perceived discrimination outside health care settings and health care utilization of Turkish and Moroccan GP patients in the Netherlands
AN  - 1448992687; 201344660
AB  - Background: Problematic interethnic relationships, expressed by feelings of discrimination, may contribute to ethnic variations in health and health care utilization. The impact of daily perceived discrimination on (mental) health has been shown. Less is known about the effect of everyday discrimination on the health care utilization. We examined the relationship between perceived discrimination of Turkish and Moroccan patients on GP health care utilization in the Netherlands and on health services use in the home country. Methods: Cohort study within the second Dutch National Survey of General Practice (2001). Interviews were conducted with 416 Turkish and 381 Moroccan respondents, and repeated in 2005 among respectively 118 and 102 participants. Linear, logistic and zero-inflated binomial regression models were used for the analyses. Results: Perceived discrimination was associated with non-attendance to the GP. Perceived quality of GP care was not a mediator in this relationship. No evidence was found for substitution of health care utilization in the home country to health care in the host country. GP attenders had higher odds of using health care in the home country than non-attenders. Over time, a lasting discrimination feeling was related to persistent non-attendance at the GP practice. Conclusion: Ethnic minority patients who feel discriminated may avoid GP health care. Further research is warranted on magnitude and health effects of such potential underutilization. Information on perceived discrimination within health care settings would increase insight into the profile of non-attenders, and on possible measures to better target interventions at a group at risk of underutilization.

T1  - Moderating Effects of Aggression on the Associations Between Social Withdrawal Subtypes and Peer Difficulties During Early Adolescence
AN  - 1024422146; 21879380
AB  - Recent research has revealed significant heterogeneity in the peer difficulties associated with social withdrawal subtypes during early adolescence, but little is known about possible sources of that heterogeneity. This study of 194 Indian young adolescents (48% female; 90% Hindu; M age = 13.35 years) evaluated whether the peer adversity related to self-reported social withdrawal subtypes (shyness, unsociability, avoidance) varied as a function of peer-nominated overt and relational aggression, and gender. Regression analyses revealed that overt aggression and gender moderated the pathways between shyness and peer exclusion and peer victimization such that the associations were significant and positive only for boys who were high and girls who were low in overt aggression. Several additional moderator effects were found, including results revealing that relational aggression (in certain cases, in conjunction with gender) moderated the association between: (1) avoidance and peer exclusion and peer rejection, (2) shyness and peer rejection, and (3) unsociability and peer victimization. For adolescents who were average and low in relational aggression, avoidance was positively related to peer rejection, and unsociability was positively related to peer victimization. However, only for boys who were high in relational aggression, avoidance was found to be positively related to peer exclusion, and shyness was positively related to peer rejection. The findings highlight the importance of considering additional individual risk factors in studies of social withdrawal subtypes and point to important differences for young adolescent withdrawn boys and girls.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The effect of acculturation and discrimination on mental health symptoms and risk behaviors among adolescent migrants in Israel
AN  - 1622297928; 201438289
AB  - This study examines the role of acculturation, perceived discrimination, and self-esteem in predicting the mental health symptoms and risk behaviors among 1.5 and second generation non-Jewish adolescents born to migrant families compared with native-born Jewish Israeli adolescents in Israel. Participants included n = 65 1.5 migrant adolescents, n = 60 second generation migrant adolescents, and n = 146 age, gender, and socioeconomic matched sample of native-born Jewish Israelis. Participants completed measures of acculturation pattern, perceived discrimination, and self-esteem as well as measures of mental health symptoms and risk behaviors. Results show that migrant adolescents across generations reported worse mental health symptoms compared with native-born Jewish Israelis. However, only the 1.5 generation migrants reported higher engagement in risk behaviors compared with second generation migrants and native-born Jewish Israelis. Our findings further showed that acculturation plays an important role in predicting the mental health status of migrant youth, with those characterized with integrated acculturative pattern reporting lower mental health symptoms compared with assimilated acculturation pattern. Importantly, contextual factors, such as higher perception of discrimination in the receiving culture as well as individual factors such as lower self-esteem and female gender were strongly associated with worse mental health symptoms. The findings manifest the complex relationship between contextual factors and individual level variables in the acculturative process of migrants as well as the importance of examining the effect of migration generation on mental health outcomes.

T1  - Ethnic Microaggressions and the Depressive and Somatic Symptoms of Latino and Asian American Adolescents
AN  - 1019369070; 22453294
AB  - Ethnic microaggressions are a form of everyday, interpersonal discrimination that are ambiguous and difficult to recognize as discrimination. This study examined the frequency and impact of microaggressions among Latino (n = 247) and Asian American (n = 113) adolescents (M ^sub age^ = 17.18, SD = .75; 57 % girls). Latino adolescents reported more frequent microaggressions that dismiss their realities of discrimination and microaggressions characterized by treatment as a second class citizen than Asian Americans, but similar levels of microaggressions that highlight differences or foreignness. There were no ethnic differences in the extent to which adolescents were bothered by microaggressions. Moreover, even supposedly innocuous forms of discrimination are associated with elevated levels of anxiety, anger, and stress, which may increase feelings of depression and sickness. Microaggressions should be recognized as subtle discrimination that send messages about group status and devaluation, and similar to overt discrimination, can evoke powerful emotional reactions and may affect mental health.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Becoming Black Women: Intimate Stories and Intersectional Identities
AN  - 1022053389
AB  - In this article, I argue that intimate stories are an important resource for the achievement of intersectional identities. Drawing on in-depth interviews with black college students at two predominantly white universities, I examine the stories black college women tell about interracial relationships between black men and white women. I argue that interracial stories serve an array of social purposes that go well beyond black women's intimate lives themselves. Interracial stories draw on public beliefs about gender, sexuality, and race to create a collective identity, imbue it with meaning, and socialize black women into common dispositions and practices. The transition to college makes race newly salient to black women; black women must coordinate raced gender identities with other black women across differences in backgrounds and dispositions. By learning and adopting interracial stories, black college women create alliances with other black women, draw boundaries against black men and white women, and craft black womanhood as strong and outspoken. Women's identity work is constrained, however, by the contradictions within and among gender, race, and class meanings, which make it difficult for them to enact identities that are at once strong and respectable, pushing black women to tie interracial stories to sexual restraint. I conclude by examining the implications of interracial stories for understanding black women's identities and the processes of intersectionality more broadly. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Beauty, Ethnicity, and Age: Does Internalization of Mainstream Media Ideals Influence Attitudes Towards Older Adults?
AN  - 958727213
AB  - Mainstream North American media promotes the message that attaining a thin, youthful appearance is central to a woman's value and social role while appearing older is highly undesirable. However, appearance ideals and attitudes toward aging differ substantially across cultural and ethnic groups, which may influence the degree to which one internalizes media ideals and holds anti-aging attitudes. Consequently, this study examined the relationships between internalization of the youthful, thin-ideal appearance perpetuated by mainstream North American media and attitudes toward the elderly in a sample of 281 undergraduate females under the age of 30 attending a university in the Western United States. Specifically, European American (n=115), Asian American/Pacific Islander (n=74), Hispanic/Latina (n=52), and African American (n=42) women voluntarily completed self-report measures of internalization of media ideals and attitudes towards older adults. Attitudes towards the elderly were significantly more negative at higher levels of internalization of North American appearance ideals, independent of ethnicity. These data suggest that internalization of North American appearance ideals perpetuated by media are related to negative attitudes towards older adults. Future research should investigate the influence of negative attitudes about aging on behaviors toward older adults or one's own aging process.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - I wouldn't, but you can: Attitudes toward interracial relationships
AN  - 1429628009; 201335611
AB  - Using the 2008 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), we study Whites' attitudes towards dating, cohabiting with, marrying, and having children with African Americans and Asian Americans. We find that 29% of White respondents reject all types of relationships with both groups whereas 31% endorse all types. Second, Whites are somewhat less willing to marry and bear children interracially than to date interracially. These attitudes and behaviors are related to warmth toward racial outgroups, political conservatism, age, gender, education, and region. Third, White women are likely to approve of interracial relationships for others but not themselves, while White men express more willingness to engage in such relationships personally, particularly with Asians. However, neither White men nor White women are very likely to actually engage in interracial relationships. Thus, positive global attitudes toward interracial relationships do not translate into high rates of actual interracial cohabitation or marriage. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Perception of Insecurity in French Poor Neighbourhoods: Racial Proxy or Pure Discrimination Hypotheses
AN  - 1023028579; 201227006
AB  - Many poor neighbourhoods, home to both socially disadvantaged populations and to foreigners, are characterised by a strong perception of insecurity. The purpose of this article is to determine the origin of this perception. To do so, two possible causes are dissociated: racial prejudice and racial proxy (the ethnic minorities are perceived in terms of the negative social characteristics that are often associated with them). More specifically, it is shown that the 'ethnic' variable captures the effects of an overconcentration of poverty, approximated here by the concentration of unemployment, but that these two variables act separately. This result should be taken into account in the policies implemented by public authorities and local actors. In this study, an original methodology is applied based simultaneously on individual geocoded data, the proportion of foreigners, the unemployment rate at the neighbourhood level and an indirect indicator of perceived insecurity.

T1  - Metropolitan Structure and Neighborhood Attainment: Exploring Intermetropolitan Variation in Racial Residential Segregation
AN  - 916888459; 21863366
AB  - Using data from the 1981, 1991, and 2001 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and several decennial censuses, we examine how characteristics of metropolitan areas are associated with black and white households' neighborhood racial composition. Results from hierarchical linear models show that about 20% to 40% of the variation in the percentage of households' tract population that is non-Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black exists across metropolitan areas. Over time, white households' exposure to non-Hispanic white neighbors has declined, and their exposure to non-Hispanic black neighbors has increased; the reverse trends are observed for blacks. These trends cannot be attributed to changes in the ecological structure of metropolitan areas. Blacks have fewer white neighbors in large metropolitan areas containing sizable minority populations, and blacks have more white neighbors in metropolitan areas with high government employment. Whites have more black neighbors in metropolitan areas with high levels of government employment and ample new housing; whites have fewer black neighbors in metropolitan areas with a high level of municipal fragmentation. The association between metropolitan-area percentage black and tract percentage black is weaker among whites than among blacks, suggesting that whites are especially motivated to self-segregate in metropolitan areas with large black populations.

T1  - Communicate over a network: the blog as a 'new' social space
AN  - 1037881572; 201232033
AB  - The contribution analyzes from a sociological perspective the development of the blog, passing through the different typologies, to define the relationship that develops in today's society between the network and the individual, through a theoretical comparison of the major scholars who have dealt with the issue of network. From Sherry Turkle to Manuel Castells up to the studies of Barry Wellman, we will define the development of the network as a new social space. The work incorporates some classical theories of Simmel, some by Goffman and Thompson about interaction, of community-society by Toennies and the action-system of Luhmann. The central part of the article focuses on how the space of the network can become, in some cases, a 'place' of sharing not only of entertainment topics but also of those that have some importance for public opinion. Then the blog becomes a 'showcase' in which to expose the peculiar characteristics of one's identity, but also a point of listening for those who do not have easy access to traditional media. Through the testimony of two young people, we will highlight those aspects that characterize the blog as a communication tool, from the diary to the letter, as well as the role played by these documentary sources in the past in sociology's field. In this way, some salient points arise about the use of the network space, compared to traditional media. The last part of the contribution proposes a comparison between America and Japan about the use of blogs and social networks, no longer in numerical terms, but proposing a reflection that brings out an individual who, as a sociable being, exploits all the possible ways to communicate, feeling in such situations freer to express his emotions, and able build a dialogue that turns out to be an added value to his person and in relationship with others outside.

T1  - Identity and Academic Success among Underrepresented Ethnic Minorities: An Interdisciplinary Review and Integration
AN  - 900190105
AB  - A growing body of literature provides insight into the ingredients for academic success for underrepresented ethnic minority students at all points of the academic pipeline. Theory and research in developmental and social psychology, education, and sociology all point to the important role of identity for students' academic success. The purpose of this article is to review some of the major findings across these social science disciplines to identify points of synergy that can inform effective policy recommendations. The review is structured around three points of convergence across disciplines: (1) prejudice and stereotype threat; (2) the role of social support; and (3) the availability of options for identity development. Reviewing these three topics sheds light on how the relation between identity and academic success in list be understood on individual, relational, and institutional levels of analysis.

T1  - Prejudicial Distribution of the HPV Vaccine
AN  - 1030869732; 201229848
AB  - Release of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine on the market sparked controversy: Teen girls, sex, politics, religion, and cancer intersected in the push to inject the vaccine into arms. The focus of this paper is the mythology of the vaccine, and the means in which various standpoints have created a discourse about HPV vaccine. I draw my findings from a qualitative discourse analysis of the public discussion and debate about the vaccine, including such literature as biomedical journal articles, newspaper articles and opinion pieces, blogs, internet sites devoted to the HPV or other vaccines (both pro and anti), and pharmaceutical company literature, to explore manipulation in the discursive practices of collective representation. I do not intend to argue against HPV vaccine as a protection against cervical or other cancers. Certainly the vaccine is to be credited for saving women's lives, particularly in areas where access to preventive health care is low. Rather, this work explores the collective representations surrounding the vaccine. At issue is a medical intervention, yet this intervention is laden with social meanings. The HPV vaccine is the only vaccine to be targeted toward women. This targeting has resulted in a language of manipulation and, in the case of school-based mandates, outright coercion. The discourse is filled with a variety of threats to further the aim of powerful social groups, including those interested in vaccinating women, such as pharmaceutical companies, physicians, and public health, and those in protest of the vaccine, such as some fundamentalist religious groups and vaccine safety organizations.

T1  - National Identity in the Political Discourse in Slovakia
AN  - 905650545
AB  - The present paper seeks to integrate social identity theory and theory of social representations, in the attempt to describe the links between the national identity and Slovakia's attitudes towards the Other. The paper's position is founded in the assumption that national identity is constructed and deconstructed discursively through the means of socialisation (media, education, legislation and everyday practices). Slovakia has recently adopted several controversial acts that substantially regulate the aforementioned means of socialisation, and are said to be designed to protect the nation, national identity and integrity, which itself implies perception of a threat of some kind. It is hypothesized that rhetoric of such laws constructs national identity as one that is threatened by the Other, while overemphasizing the presence of intergroup threat and conflict. Such discourse thus makes people defend themselves and re-evaluate their national identity, by reaffirming who they are in the respective intergroup affairs. The conflicts not only heighten identification with a group but also create antagonistic intergroup attitudes. Through a brief discourse analysis of the abovementioned laws (Act on the State Language, Act on Citizenship and Patriotism Act) the paper aims to analyse social representations of nation and national identity in the political discourse and their potential impact on intergroup relations between the so called 'Old Slovaks' (ethnic Slovaks) and the Other. We thus seek to test the extent to which Slovakia adheres to the universalistic principles of equality and justice, or to which it heightens social significance of ethnicity and creates division within society.

T1  - Introduction: Negotiation in intergroup conflict
AN  - 822518955; 201068350
AB  - Although conflicts most often occur between groups, research and theory on conflict management and negotiation have largely focused on the interpersonal system and ignored how groups negotiate a solution to their intergroup conflict. Thus we have a thorough understanding of the motivational, cognitive, and affective processes underlying the development of high quality solutions in interpersonal negotiation, but we know little about the extent to which these insights can be comfortably generalized to intergroup settings. Likewise, the large volume of work on intergroup perceptions and intergroup relations has much to say about intergroup negotiation, but these research areas have rarely been connected and produced systematic analysis. The current Special Issue presents research on these topics and aims at promoting cross-talk between negotiation researchers and social psychologists in the intergroup relation domain.

T1  - The Contact Space: A Novel Framework for Intergroup Contact Research
AN  - 743057741; 201043757
AB  - This article presents a new framework for understanding research on the intersection between language, communication, and intergroup contact. Contact theory has described a variety of ways in which contact between groups can reduce prejudice and improve intergroup relations. However, the field has become fragmented by the study of a variety of forms of contact whose interconnections have not been elucidated, and it has paid insufficient attention to the language and communicative dynamics of the contact event itself. This article accounts for the variation in forms of contact studied by arraying them in two-dimensional space organized by (a) involvement of self in contact and (b) richness of self-outgroup experience. The former pertains to whether an individual is directly involved in interaction with an outgroup member (vs. merely observing such contact); the latter pertains to the multiplicity of channels and senses through which one experiences the outgroup member. These two dimensions are argued to be largely orthogonal. The two-dimensional space is used to organize mediators and moderators in the field, to specify in detail the intersection between contact and issues of language and communication, as well as to outline areas of particular promise for specific contact interventions.
