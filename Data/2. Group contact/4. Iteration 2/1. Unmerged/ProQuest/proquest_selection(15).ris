T1  - The socio-psychological predictors of support for post-truth collective action
AN  - 2684795863
AB  - Politics in the current era are replete with unreliable media stories which lack evidence, sometimes disparagingly dubbed “fake news”. A survey on a sample of Muslims in Indonesia (N = 518) in this work found that participants’ endorsement of collective action in of support issues with little to no empirical evidence (i.e., post-truth collective action) increased as a function of their belief in fake news and prejudice against the outgroup (i.e., non-Muslims). Belief in fake news stemmed from participants’ generic and specific conspiratorial thinking, whereas prejudice was positively predicted by relative Muslim prototypicality, denoting how much Muslims in Indonesia view that their group is more representative than non-Muslims of the superordinate Indonesian identity that encompasses both groups. Additionally, our findings revealed that generic conspiratorial thinking and relative Muslim prototypicality were positively predicted by collective narcissism, which in turn spurred participants’ support for collective action by augmenting belief in fake news.

T1  - The good ol’ days: White identity, racial nostalgia, and the perpetuation of racial extremism: GPIR
AN  - 2652815229
AB  - A prevailing theme in White nationalist rhetoric is nostalgia for a time when Whites dominated American culture and had unchallenged status. The present research examines a form of collective nostalgia called racial nostalgia and its association with negative intergroup attitudes and extreme ideologies (White nationalism). In Studies 1 and 2, racial nostalgia was associated with higher racial identity, anti-immigrant attitudes, and White nationalism. Study 2 revealed that racial nostalgia was related to extreme ideologies, in part, through perceptions that immigrants and racial minorities posed realistic/symbolic threats. Study 3 manipulated nostalgia using a writing prompt (“America’s racial past” vs. “games of America’s past”) and an identity prime (prime vs. no prime). Racial nostalgia was higher in the racial prompt versus the games prompt condition, regardless of identity prime. Furthermore, there were significant indirect effects of the nostalgia manipulation on support for anti-immigrant policies and endorsement of White nationalism through increased racial nostalgia and its association with perceived threats. These findings show that racial nostalgia can be a maladaptive form of collective nostalgia linked to a sense of loss and threat, and can make people sympathetic to extreme racial ideologies.

T1  - Changing public opinion about gender activates group threat and opposition to feminist social movements among men: GPIR
AN  - 2652815159
AB  - Two studies examined whether men’s perception of the declining value of traditional masculinity activates social status, realistic, and symbolic threat, and in turn motivates opposition to feminist social movements. In Study 1, men’s perception that their ingroup is losing value across several social spheres was associated with social status and realistic threat, both of which were associated with opposition to feminist movements. Study 2, an experiment, presented men with public opinion data showing a 30-year decline in the degree to which Americans value traditional masculinity or no decline. Information about the declining value of masculinity activated status threat, which motivated less support for feminist movements. Among men who highly identified as masculine, this same information reduced support for feminist movements through symbolic threat. In sum, perceived decline in the social value of traditional masculinity creates status anxiety about the ingroup’s future and motivates compensatory reactions against gender equality.

T1  - Intergenerational language transmission in Quebec: patterns and predictors in the light of provincial language planning
AN  - 2625923682
AB  - The study presented here is the first empirical investigation of the patterns and predictors of the intergenerational transmission of French in Quebec. An online questionnaire was used to gather data from 274 parents from different mother tongue (L1) groups: L1 French, L1 English, L1 French and English, and L1 Other. The results show that L1 French-and-English-speaking parents and L1 Other parents displayed particularly low rates of French transmission. Three variables were found to be significant predictors of the intergenerational transmission of French: having it as one’s L1, high proficiency, and positive attitudes towards the language on the solidarity dimension. The same three variables were also found to be significant predictors for the intergenerational transmission of English in Quebec, indicating that they may not be merely language-specific. Not significant for either French or English were language used with partner, attitudes on the status dimension, Quebec-based social identity, migration background, and location within Quebec. Further research is needed to ascertain whether the identified predictors are context-specific, and what other variables are at play. The article discusses the implications of this study’s findings for theory as well as for language planning in Quebec, and especially the potential effectiveness of acquisition and prestige planning.

T1  - Do I really want to engage in contact? Volition as a new dimension of intergroup contact
AN  - 2569549851
AB  - Despite burgeoning evidence for the effectiveness of intergroup contact on prejudice reduction, relatively less is known about how much individuals' internal control and active choice is involved in the formation of intergroup contact. Through four correlational studies (Ntotal = 1043, Study 1 in Cyprus and Studies 2–4 in Turkey), we investigated the construct of ‘contact volition’—the extent to which one engages in intergroup contact deliberately. Studies 1–3 showed that intergroup contact perceived as primarily intentional and pursued by the active choice of the self (volitional contact) was associated with greater intimacy and positivity and thereby more positive attitudes, compared to contact that is primarily based on external/situational conditions (contingent contact). Study 4 showed that contact quantity was associated with more positive attitudes and behavioral tendencies through greater intimacy and positivity, only when contact was volitional. Findings contribute to the recently emerging research literature on motivated contact behavior that can help maximize the effectiveness of contact.

T1  - The generalization of intergroup contact effects: Emerging research, policy relevance, and future directions
AN  - 2509235142
AB  - Intergroup contact is one of the most promising and effective strategies for reducing prejudice. Importantly, intergroup contact not only improves attitudes towards an encountered outgroup member but also to the outgroup as a whole (i.e., primary transfer effects), to other outgroups (i.e., secondary transfer effects), and even enhances cognitive functioning beyond intergroup relations (i.e., tertiary transfer effect). In this article, we first review the recent developments on primary, secondary, and tertiary contact generalization. We then summarize mechanisms that underlie and condition each of these generalizations. Third, we highlight key critiques against the contact literature identifying avenues for future research on generalization processes. Lastly, we underline the policy value of research on generalization effects.

T1  - Why public health framing matters: An experimental study of the effects of COVID-19 framing on prejudice and xenophobia in the United States
AN  - 2510602542
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has triggered a notable increase in the expression of prejudicial and xenophobic attitudes that threaten the wellbeing of minority groups and contribute to the overall public health toll of the virus. However, while there is evidence documenting the growth in discrimination and xenophobia, little is known about how the COVID-19 outbreak is activating the expression of such negative attitudes. The goal of the current paper therefore was to investigate what aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic may be contributing to this rise in expressions of prejudice and xenophobia. More specifically, this study used an experimental design to assess the effects of using stigmatized language to describe the virus as well as the threat to physical health and economic wellbeing posed by the virus on COVID-19 prejudice. Data were collected from a national sample of 1451 adults residing within the United States. Results from 2 × 2 x 2 between-subjects analyses of covariance demonstrated that emphasizing the connection between China and COVID-19, rather than framing the virus neutrally, increased negative attitudes toward Asian Americans, beliefs that resources should be prioritized for Americans rather than immigrants, and general xenophobia. Emphasizing the severity of the economic impact of the virus also increased beliefs that Asian Americans are a threat to resources and general xenophobia. In contrast, messages which emphasized the serious health risks of COVID-19 did not increase bias toward Asian Americans or xenophobia. Our findings suggest that specific types of public health messaging related to infectious diseases, especially framing the virus in terms of its country of origin or its likely economic impact, may elicit prejudice and xenophobia. Public health campaigns that emphasize the severity of the virus, however, are not likely to trigger the same negative attitudes. Implications for public health responses to health crises are discussed.

T1  - The Creeping Concept of Trauma
AN  - 2465812367
AB  - Over the past century, the concept of trauma has substantially broadened its meanings in academic and public discourse. We document four directions in which this semantic expansion has occurred at different times: from somatic to psychic, extraordinary to ordinary, direct to indirect, and individual to collective. We analyze these expansions as instances of "concept creep," the progressive inflation of harm-related concepts, and present evidence for the rising cultural salience and semantic enlargement of trauma in recent decades. Expansive concepts of trauma may have mixed blessings for personal and collective identity.

T1  - How television news disguises its racist representations: The case of Romanian <i>Antena 1</i> reporting on the Roma
AN  - 2429520602
AB  - Research shows that news media around the world tend to represent ethnic minorities in ways which nurture distorted views and invite negative attitudes. Scholars have also emphasised that, in contemporary societies, a political climate has emerged which has made overt racism unacceptable and social taboos leading to racist statements are increasingly being managed and disguised in order to avoid direct accusations. In this paper we use Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis (MCDA) to carry out an in-depth analysis of a Romanian television news report—selected from a larger corpus—which addressed the situation of the Roma migrants in Norway. We show how this medium, with editing techniques, voice-overs, sound effects and captions, has its own subtleties for communicating racism in ways that are less obvious at a casual viewing. The case we analyse reports on a Norwegian/EU project to build a factory in Romania, so that Roma migrants can return home to work rather than live and beg on the streets of Oslo.

T1  - Understandings of national identity and outgroup attitudes in culturally diverse Mauritius
AN  - 2506626012
AB  - This study investigated understandings of national group belonging in relation to attitudes toward foreign and established outgroups in Mauritius. Representative data were collected among the three numerically largest ethno-cultural groups (Hindus, Muslims, and Creoles; Ntotal = 1770) and results confirmed a distinction between "being," "doing," and "feeling" Mauritian among all three groups, with some small differences for Creoles compared to Hindus and Muslims. Furthermore, "being" Mauritian was not significantly related to attitudes toward established and foreign outgroups. In contrast, the "doing" understanding was negatively associated with both attitudes, and the "feeling" understanding showed positive associations with both outgroup attitudes among all three participant groups. The findings make a novel contribution to the literature on how people understand national identity, how these understandings differ between ethno-cultural groups within a nation, and how these relate to attitudes toward foreign as well as established outgroups.

T1  - Dehumanization of dirty workers and attitudes toward social support
AN  - 2319730213
AB  - In lay perception, dirty work is a type of labor that degrades human dignity. Work can be perceived as dirty on three bases: social (related to the subordinate position or associated with contact with stigmatized people), physical (related to direct contact with garbage and waste), and moral (related to jobs considered sinful, dubious, or defying social norms). “Dirty” stigma makes workers objects of dehumanization and discrimination, in particular, people distance themselves from dirty workers and are not ready to help and support them. In the experimental study (N = 340), we investigated how certain types of dirty workers are dehumanized compared to nondirty workers and the indirect effect of the type of dirty work on attitudes toward the social support of dirty workers via animalistic (attribution of uniquely human traits) and the mechanistic (attribution of human nature traits) dehumanization. The results show that individuals are willing to offer more social support to a low status but not dirty worker rather than to social or moral dirty workers. At the same time, less social support is provided to nondirty than to physical dirty worker. Animalistic and mechanistic dehumanization mediates the relationship between the types of dirty work and the attitudes toward social support. In particular, less dehumanization leads to more positive attitudes toward social support. The limitations and future directions of the obtained results are discussed.

T1  - Comparing Negative Attitudes Toward the Unemployed Across European Countries in 2008 and 2016: The Role of the Unemployment Rate and Job Insecurity
AN  - 2432396890
AB  - We explore how negative attitudes toward the unemployed are related to countries’ overall and long-term (LT) unemployment rate. Insights from the risk attribution and position theory are combined with the in-group–out-group conflict model, derived from migration literature. Multilevel analyses are performed on two waves (2008 and 2016) of the European Social Survey. Negative attitudes toward the unemployed are measured via the item “most unemployed people do not really try to find a job.” Results show that in countries with a high LT unemployment rate and/or an increase in this rate, people are more likely to hold negative attitudes toward the unemployed. Moreover, this is more pronounced among people in secure job conditions (those with a permanent contract and/or perceiving job security).

T1  - Contextual factors and prejudice at the beginning of the migrant influx: The Moroccan case in Seville, Spain
AN  - 2296289427
AB  - Studies addressing contextual factors associated with anti‐immigrant prejudice have focused on out‐group size and rapid demographic changes in receiving locations. However, the territorial concentration and distribution of ethnic minorities at a local and intraurban level has received little attention. We analyse the relationship between emerging territorial concentration points—alongside other contextual variables—by Moroccans and receiving society's growing prejudice towards them in a city experiencing the start of a migrant influx. We combine survey and census data from five Seville districts (southern Spain). Our results show how rapid changes in the general population's ethnic composition, coupled with Moroccan and economic migrants' territorial concentration, correlate strongly with negative attitudes towards Moroccans at this early stage. However, a weaker relationship between the immigrant percentage and degree of prejudice by the receiving group is observed. We also discuss guidelines for ensuring good, local diversity management to prevent socioterritorial fragmentation in multicultural cities.

T1  - The silver lining between perceived similarity and intergroup differences: Increasing confidence in intergroup contact: Postdisciplinary Humanities & Social Sciences Quarterly
AN  - 2181632211
AB  - Positive intergroup contact and cross-group friendships are known to have numerous benefits for intergroup relations in diverse schools. However, children do not always spontaneously engage in cross-group friendships, choosing rather to spend time with their ingroup peers. Several factors have previously been identified that influence children’s confidence in contact and subsequent development of cross-group friendships, including perceived intergroup similarity and reconciliation of intergroup differences. However, inducing perceived similarity may pose a threat to the person’s social identity and increase the need for distinctiveness. Therefore, it remains unclear how one should manipulate perceived similarity and group boundaries when designing interventions that prepare school children for successful contact. Moreover, eliminating perceived group boundaries need not lead to the generalization of improved attitudes towards the outgroup. An optimal balance of inclusion and differentiation between the groups should be determined so as to make way for beneficial cross-group friendships. Based on a literature review, we provide recommendations for designing prejudice reduction interventions in schools from the perspective of intergroup similarity.

T1  - Moral(ity and) Economy: Work, Workfare, and Fairness in Provincial Hungary
AN  - 2108776074
AB  - The relationship between morality and economy has been muddied in the course of disciplinary specialization. While dominant paradigms in economics abstract from the moral dimension, recent approaches to morality and ethics in anthropology neglect the material economy. E. P. Thompson’s “moral economy” has been an influential bridging concept in recent decades, but recent inflationary usage has highlighted shortcomings. Following an overview of the disciplinary debates, the moral dimension of economic life is illustrated in this paper with reference to work as a value between the late 19th and early 21st centuries in Hungary. Contemporary workfare is explored with local examples. It is shown how discourses of work and fairness are being extended into new ethical registers to justify negative attitudes towards a new category of migrants.Alternate abstract:La relation entre la moralité et l’économie a été perdue au gré de la spécialisation disciplinaire. Alors que les paradigmes dominants en économie font généralement abstraction de la dimension morale, les approches récentes de la morale et de l’éthique en anthropologie négligent l’économie matérielle. Le concept intermédiaire d’« économie morale » proposé par E.P. Thompson a été influent au cours des dernières décennies, mais l’inflation récente de ses usages a mis en évidence d’importantes lacunes. Après un tour d’horizon des débats disciplinaires, la dimension morale de la vie économique est saisie dans cet article à partir du cas du travail comme valeur en Hongrie, entre la fin du xixe et le début du xxe siècle. Le modèle contemporain du « workfare » est exploré à partir d’exemples locaux. Il est montré comment les discours sur le travail et l’équité sont étendus à de nouveaux registres éthiques pour justifier des attitudes négatives envers les migrants.Alternate abstract:Die fortschreitende Spezialisierung der Disziplinen hat die Beziehung zwischen Moral und Wirtschaft ausgeblendet. Während die dominierenden, wirtschaftlichen Paradigmen die moralische Dimension außer acht lassen, vernachlässigen jüngste Ansätze der Moral und der Ethik in der Anthropologie die materielle Wirtschaft. Das dazwischen liegende Modell der “moralischen Wirtschaft” von E.P. Thompson hat in den letzten Jahrzehnten einen großen Einfluss ausgeübt, wenngleich jüngste Anwendungen seine Lückenhaftigkeit verdeutlicht haben. Der Zusammenfassung der Fachdebatten folgt eine Analyse der moralischen Dimension des Wirtschaftslebens, verdeutlicht in Sachen Arbeit als Wert am Beispiel Ungarns vom Ende des 19. bis zum Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts. Das zeitgenössische Modell des “workfare” wird mittels örtlicher Beispiele untersucht. Es wird aufgezeigt, wie Reden über Arbeit und Gerechtigkeit auf neue ethische Register ausgeweitet werden, um negative Verhaltungsweisen gegenüber Migranten zu rechtfertigen.

T1  - Realistic Group Conflict and Voting for the 2002 Aboriginal Treaty Negotiations Referendum in British Columbia
AN  - 2007683893
AB  - Although Indigenous peoples constitute one of the most socially, economically, and politically marginalized groups in the world, relatively few quantitative social scientists have studied the broader public's views of this ethnicity globally or in Canada. To help isolate the roots of such attitudes, this research note investigates why ordinary British Columbians decided 1. to vote in; and 2. to vote "yes" on the controversial 2002 Aboriginal Treaty Negotiations Referendum. The essay examines the theoretical literature on attitudes toward ethnic minorities in the abstract, which suggests that support for the measure might have been rooted in various forms of realistic group conflict. To evaluate this theory, the research note next examines data from the April 2002 BC Reid Express Poll as well as official census and voting results. Cross-tabulations of the Reid Poll and Gary King-method ecological-inference analysis of the election statistics indicate that regional and ethnic differences but not individual economic circumstances seem to have motivated much of the conflict over this measure.

T1  - 'I Just Want to Be Myself': How We Can Challenge Homophobia, Transphobia, and Racism in Australian Schools
AN  - 1933970685
AB  - Drawing on the experiences of Safe Schools Coalition in Australia since 2010, this article focuses on the potential for successfully challenging homophobia, transphobia, and racism in schools. The discussion challenges assumptions about the incompatibility of cultural difference with gender or sexual diversity, in particular the perceived irreconcilability of Islamic faith or culture with same-sex attraction. Comparing research on the health impact of homophobia and transphobia on students with the impact of racism provides the basis for a discussion of the benefits of challenging all forms of prejudice-based abuse and discrimination. While there are some key differences, the methods and strategies used in schools to value and support cultural diversity can also be applied in schools to support gender and sexual diversity. Lessons from the practice experiences of Safe Schools Coalition suggest that all forms of diversity can and do positively interact to create more inclusive educational environments.

T1  - Revisiting the contact hypothesis: Effects of different modes of computer-mediated communication on intergroup relationships
AN  - 1914570519
AB  - This study applies the contact hypothesis to computer-mediated communication (CMC) and examines whether intergroup computer-mediated contact can facilitate relationships between conflicting groups. The effectiveness of different CMC modes, text-based and video-based, in Improving interpersonal and Intergroup attitudes was compared. The results from an experiment indicated that video-based CMC exerted greater Influence in improving participants' attitudes towards a targeted outgroup member when compared to text-based CMC. However, text-based CMC produced a stronger effect than video-based CMC in improving one's attitudes towards the outgroup as a whole.

T1  - The Polish underground organization Wolnosc i Niezawislosc and anti-Jewish pogroms, 1945-6
AN  - 1883150415
AB  - Tokarska-Bakir's paper considers the deep-rooted cognitive habits among informers and reporters belonging to the Polish post-war, anti-Communist underground organization Wolnosc i Niezawislosc (Freedom and Independence) with regard to their perception of Polish Jews. The organization's archive is preserved in the National Archives in Krakow in Poland, and it thoroughly documents its members' social beliefs and fears. A theory of pogroms formulated by Senechal de la Roche understands the pogrom as an act of social control. Using the archival documents with that theory in mind, Tokarska-Bakir analyses Wolnosc i Niezawislosc in relation to the anti-Jewish pogroms that took place in Rzeszów, Krakow and Kielce in the years immediately following the Second World War.

T1  - Contextualizing Competence: Language and LGBT-Based Competency in Health Care
AN  - 1914570320
AB  - Changes in the language and terminology used to refer to individuals identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT), as well as how best to discuss issues of sexual and gender identity, can prove challenging for health care providers due to (1) lack of training; (2) interdisciplinary issues; and (3) prejudices on personal and institutional levels. Given the importance of language in the relationship between health care provider and patient as well as the myriad ways in which language can reflect knowledge, skills, and attitudes, we contend that language is both a facilitator and inhibitor of competence. In this article, we discuss language as a means of exhibiting cultural competence as well as the barriers to facilitating this degree of competence. Communicative competence, a concept traditionally used in linguistics, is discussed as a framework for contextualizing LGBT-specific cultural competence in health care. Ideally, a professional will be considered competent once they (1) acquire a foundation in issues associated with LGBT individuals, as well as a basic understanding of appropriate vocabulary' (2) reconcile personal beliefs with their professional role; (3) create an inclusive healthcare environment such that the influence of personal biases does not negatively impact care; and (4) use identifiers suggested by the patient.

T1  - Anti-Semitism in Poland, yesterday and today
AN  - 1858569897
AB  - Representatives of the extreme Right in Europe have recently made attempts to modify  and  ‘civilise’  their  public  image  by  replacing  anti-Semitism  with  Islamophobia (as the National Front did in France). This trend does not, however, extend to right-nationalist circles in all states. In  Poland,  reluctance  to  accept  refugees  from  North  Africa  and  the  Middle  East  remains  strong,  as  shown  in  surveys,  but  this  does  not  mean  that  the  upsurge of Islamophobia has chased away the ghosts of anti-Semitism. The Jew remains a powerful symbol of the ‘other’ in Polish society. What are the roots of Polish anti-Semitism?  Three  different  books  answer  this  question: Joanna Beata Michlic, Obcy jako zagrożenie. Obraz Żyda w Polsce od roku 1880 do  czasów  obecnych  (Poland’s  Threatening  Other:  the  image  of  the  Jew  from  1880  to  the  present)  (Warsaw:  ŻydowskiInstytut  Historyczny,  2015);  Ireneusz  Krzemiński  (ed.), Żydzi  –  problem prawdziwego Polaka (The Jews – a problem for the real Poles) (Warsaw: Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego, 2015); Jan Józef Lipski, Idea katolickiego państwa narodu polskiego. Zarys ideologii ONR ‘Falanga’ (The Idea of the Catholic State of the Polish Nation: the ideological outline of ONR ‘Falanga’) (Warsaw: Krytyka Polityczna, 2015).

T1  - Far Right Populism and Women: The Normalisation of Gendered Anti-Muslim Racism and Gendered Culturalism in the Netherlands
AN  - 1833978394
AB  - The paper approaches the rise of far right populism in Europe with a feminist lens and on the background of the discursively constructed sexist and racist features of the current moral panic. It is argued that we can follow up a continuum of normalised culturalist gendered discourses in Europe, and for some time, in the Netherlands in particular. The paper is organised by looking, first, at the place of gender in far right discourses and the role of women in far right-wing populist parties. Second, a feminist critique of processes of normalisation is presented, helping to clarify the term 'culturalism'. To illustrate the dynamics of gendered culturalism and the way it impacts the everyday life of Muslim women in the Netherlands, some interview sequences of an empirical study with female Dutch-Moroccan citizens are discussed. The experiences of the women illustrate how far right populist perspectives and prejudices entered their daily lives, and which counter strategies, the women used to resist intimidation.

T1  - Validation Study of the Revised Version of the Scale of Prejudice Against Sexual and Gender Diversity in Brazil
AN  - 1827659629
AB  - In Brazil, there is a deficit of culturally adapted tools to assess prejudice against sexual and gender diversity with empirically demonstrable validity and reliability. Prejudice against non-heterosexual orientations is a strong problem within Brazilian culture and is particularly related to nonnormative expressions of gender. To address these issues, a scale was created. The objective of this article is to validate the revised version of this instrument developed for the specificities of Brazilian culture and establish its reliability. The revised version of Scale of Prejudice Against Sexual and Gender Diversity (PASGD) was completed by 8,184 undergraduate students from southern Brazil. Analysis was conducted using the item response theory (IRT) model for rating scale data, criterion validity, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The scale showed good validity and reliability. The results indicate that the PASGD is a useful tool for assessing prejudice in the Brazilian context, adapted for the local Brazilian reality.

T1  - “Oil and Water”? Latino-white Relations and Symbolic Integration in a Changing California
AN  - 2406943817
AB  - Existing research on race relations between racial/ethnic groups in the United States highlights how personal contact can lead to increased harmony or conflict between groups and may reduce intergroup prejudice. This study engages this literature and draws from more than 20 months of ethnography and 66 interviews in a Spanish/English dual-language school in Los Angeles to qualitatively examine Latino-white relations in diverse settings. Interactions between Latino and white adults of varying class statuses are characterized by politeness and civility, yet parents segregate within the school and rarely form meaningful cross-racial relationships that transcend the campus. Despite regular interpersonal contact, a shared goal of bilingualism, and shared class status for some, divisions between Latino and white parents persist, and interactions between them are characterized by what the author terms symbolic integration. Symbolic integration refers to polite, but surface-level, interactions between racial/ethnic groups that are enjoyable, voluntary, and additive. This type of integration nuances our understanding of race relations and elucidates how sustained regular contact and the absence of negative racial stereotypes do not ensure lessened racial stratification between racial/ethnic groups.

T1  - In the wake of radical right electoral success: a cross-country comparative study of anti-immigration attitudes over time
AN  - 1809640289
AB  - This paper tests the theoretically assumed relationship between the parliamentary presence of radical right parties (RRPs) and anti-immigration attitudes over time. Data come from six rounds of the European Social Survey between 2002 and 2012. Using multi-level models with applications for repeated cross-sectional data, the study examines the implications of changes tied to the political advancements of the radical right with a focus on three possible scenarios: people's attitudes about immigration have generally become more negative, opposition towards immigration has become more dependent on immigrants' ethnicity, and attitudes towards immigration have become more polarised. Contrary to expectations, it is found that neither the presence, the representational strength, nor the nationalistic framing of an RRP affect opposition towards immigration over time. Thus, the conclusion is that the RRPs, so far, have not driven anti-immigration attitudes in Europe. Possible explanations for these results are discussed in the concluding section.

T1  - Wedding Imagery and Public Support for Gay Marriage
AN  - 1807594659
AB  - This study uses an experiment embedded in a large, nationally representative survey to test whether exposure to imagery of a gay or lesbian couple's wedding influences support for gay marriage. It also tests whether any such effects depend on the nature of the image (gay or lesbian couple, kissing or not) and viewer characteristics (sex, age, race, education, religion, and ideology). Results show that exposure to imagery of a gay couple kissing reduced support for gay marriage relative to the baseline. Other image treatments (gay couple not kissing, lesbian couple kissing, lesbian couple not kissing) did not significantly influence opinion.

T1  - Contrasting Lay Theories of Polyculturalism and Multiculturalism: Associations With Essentialist Beliefs of Race in Six Asian Cultural Groups
AN  - 1799020453
AB  - Multiculturalism and polyculturalism are two lay theories of culture that have been associated with some similar intergroup attitudes and behaviors. But other than the studies of Rosenthal and Levy in the United States, there have been no studies that directly distinguish between these two lay theories. In this study, we use confirmatory factor analysis procedures to show that multiculturalism and polyculturalism represent two distinct latent constructs among our 1,730 participants in six Asian cultural groups (China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macau, Malaysia, the Philippines). Moreover, we show that essentializing race is associated with endorsement of multiculturalism (but not polyculturalism) in five cultural groups (except Hong Kong). The results provide strong cross-cultural empirical evidence for the distinction between the two lay theories and, more importantly, point to aspects of the lay theory of multiculturalism that relate to why it is sometimes associated with stronger stereotyping and prejudice toward minority cultural groups.

T1  - Anxious politics in the European city: an introduction
AN  - 1786270047
AB  - This special issue grew out of the 'Understanding the New Europe' workshop that the guest editors of this issue organized in November 2012 in Amsterdam. We want to thank all the participants and contributors for stimulating conversations and papers. We learned much about the 'New Europe' during this event and even more so in the editing of this issue.. When we decided to move ahead with this special issue, we felt assured that, with the line-up of authors that we had, the contributions would be excellent. We are not disappointed. We thank all of the authors, with special thanks for Gregory Noble for bringing another critical lens to both the international workshop and this special issue. We also would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments, and Anick Vollebergh for her insightful reading for a draft of this introduction. We owe a great debt to Patterns of Prejudice editor Barbara Rosenbaum for her unfailing support, patience, adroit feedback and insightful editing, for which we say a big thank-you. Anouk de Koning's work that led to this special issue was supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) under Grant W 07.68.115.00, and by the European Research Council (ERC) under Grant 640074 (MigrantParents).

T1  - Afterword: from anxiety to hope
AN  - 1786265095
AB  - As I write this, yet another panic has erupted in Australia over a proposed mosque, one of many that seem to erupt on a regular basis, feeding social anxieties about a range of social 'problems' that are reduced to one Big Problem. As Wayne Modest and Anouk de Koning, the guest editors of this issue of Patterns of Prejudice, point out in their introduction. The current consternation about supposedly racially inspired sexual assaults in Germany is another moment in this same cycle of what they call anxious politics: a cycle that constructs particular kinds of social problems (and implies, for some, their 'solutions'). There are many way in which my home - Australia - is different to the European settings of this collection of papers but, when it comes to such processes, the similarities are often more obvious than the differences. The stories these scholars tell are comparable to ones I hear in Australia, the United Kingdom and North America. Given the 'global Islamophobia' of the last decade or so, this is not surprising. But it would be a mistake to think that these similarities mean there is a single story to be told: each of the papers here offers empirical detail, context and theoretical tools to capture the nuance of their subject matter. As with the best scholarship, it is by attending to both similarities and differences across contexts that we can profit from the accounts it gives, intellectually and politically. Moreover, these papers collectively pose a set of issues that should frame future research: a reconfiguration of conventional issues around citizenship and racialization, but also questions of hope and conviviality.

T1  - Immigration and French national identity under neoliberalism: Sarkozy's selective immigration politics as a performance of sovereignty
AN  - 1784145487
AB  - In 2007 then French president Nicolas Sarkozy established the Ministry of Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Cooperative Development. Ocak investigates what the ministry wanted to achieve by promoting national identity and linking it with immigration. Focusing on the so-called selective immigration policies and the national identity debate, she examines the ways in which neoliberalization hollows out the nation-state and transforms its relations vis-à-vis citizens and, as a result, increases the need to perform sovereignty to counterbalance the crisis of the welfare state. The articulation of the undesired immigrant figure and the project to engage French citizens in the management of the immigrant operate, she suggests, as tactics to smooth this transformation and compensate for the losses that the French citizens experience as a result of the reign of neoliberal policies.

T1  - Liberals and Pseudoliberals: Psychological Profiles
AN  - 1885893477
AB  - The article recognizes that liberalism is unpopular in contemporary Russia. The author believes that what is really unpopular is not true liberalism but its pseudoliberal "mutation." The main differences between the liberals and pseudoliberals are the interpretation of freedom, the attitude toward patriotism and morality, the basic ideologems, the style of thinking, way of life, the correlation between principles and interests, etc. The author formulates the main tasks that need to be tackled to restore a positive attitude toward liberalism in our country and predicts that the confrontation between true and pseudoliberalism may in the coming years become a major arena of ideological battles.

AB  - Increases in substantive portrayals of working women, racial groups, and sexual minorities on television are a common explanation for some of the observed increase in social tolerance over the last few decades. In this study, I first document change in these portrayals from 1970 to 2000. After doing so, I determine if higher levels of recurring portrayals are associated with greater levels of social tolerance for those who report watching larger amounts of television. If no association is found, this would validate claims of non-existent or minimal effects. The findings show that frequent television viewers generally have more negative attitudes as compared with non-viewers when recurring portrayals of these groups are low. However, television viewers have similar or higher levels of social tolerance compared with non-viewers when recurring portrayals become frequent. This supports the argument that increasing televised portrayals of women and minorities on television can help increase social tolerance, but differences in the substance and quality of these portrayals likely condition this link.

T1  - Encountering the southern Other: imagining the Civil Rights Movement through travel narrative
AN  - 1784145696
AB  - Kuryla proposes rethinking the Civil Rights Movement through a consideration of travel narratives. This requires recasting the movement as it is 'imagined', recognizing its contemporary function as an ultimate good in modern moral discourse, in which it works to legitimize most any political position. With this in mind, travel narratives reveal this imagined movement at work as travellers, either explicitly or implicitly, considered their place within or outside the movement, particularly in their encounters with white and black Southerners in southern spaces during and after its classic phase (roughly 1955-65). As a thought experiment, Kuryla offers two readings of V. S. Naipaul's A Turn in the South (1989), moving from considerations of post-civil rights era black leadership to an account of the role that southern hospitality and violence played in Mississippi in the middle of the 1960s, respectively. Viewing the movement through the lens of a travel writer like Naipaul draws attention to a constantly changing southern society amidst a life and death struggle over intimate questions having to do with naming practices and hospitality. Naipaul's status as a postcolonial outsider sets these questions against a backdrop of global assumptions about postcolonial development and historical consciousness.

T1  - The spectre of Japan: The influence of foreign relations on race relations theory, 1905-24
AN  - 1784145653
AB  - Race relations became the dominant paradigm by the time the official report on the 1919 Chicago riot, The Negro in Chicago, was published. It expressed a new appreciation of the danger to Whites of conflict based on colour. Before 1905 most observers assumed the inferiority of Blacks and saw race conflict as the fault of African Americans. But a new possibility arose when the fate of African Americans was linked to the rising power of Japan, occurring after the defeat of Russia by Japan in 1904-5. Race conflict, in this new model, was a form of conflict between nations. Race relations pioneer Robert E. Park, in his 1913 article, 'Racial Assimilation in Secondary Groups', noted that 'under conditions . . . of individual liberty and individual competition, characteristic of modern civilization, depressed racial groups tend to assume the form of nationalities. A nationality, in this narrower sense, may be defined as the racial group which has attained self-consciousness, no matter whether it has at the same time gained political independence or not.' Yuill's paper will explore the thesis that a liberal perspective based on developments in contemporary international relations slowly changed the way race was regarded in the United States. From 1905 onwards, a new liberal paradigm sought to manage race conflict. It was this-rather than labour-based racial antipathies or commitment to racial equality-that shaped US race relations in the twentieth century.

T1  - Independent or ungrateful? Consequences of confronting patronizing help for people with disabilities: GPIR
AN  - 1933571156
AB  - People with disabilities routinely face a dilemma in dealing with patronizing help: While accepting unsolicited assistance may be harmful for its recipients, confronting the helper can lead to negative interpersonal repercussions. Across two studies, participants were presented with a scenario depicting an interaction between a blind target and a sighted pedestrian and asked to evaluate the behaviors of the characters involved. Study 1 showed that, whereas blind participants considered both patronizing and hostile treatment as inappropriate responses to the blind target's request for information, sighted participants saw patronizing help as significantly more appropriate than openly hostile treatment. Study 2 further demonstrated that, among sighted participants, blind targets were viewed as less warm and more rude when confronting benevolent versus hostile discrimination. These findings highlighted the difficulty of confronting patronizing treatment and have important implications for people with disabilities as well as other patronized minorities more generally.

T1  - Interreligious Contact, Perceived Group Threat, and Perceived Discrimination: Predicting Negative Attitudes among Religious Minorities and Majorities in Indonesia
AN  - 1690246042
AB  - This study examines the relationship between interreligious contact and negative attitudes toward the religious outgroup among minority Christians and majority Muslims in Indonesia. It answers two research questions: Does interreligious contact reduce negative outgroup attitudes equally for minority Christians and majority Muslims? Are mediation by perceived group threat and moderation by perceived discrimination equally important for religious minorities and majorities? The analysis is based on unique survey data collected from among Christian and Muslim students in Ambon (the Moluccas) and Yogyakarta (central Java). Results show that a higher quantity of interreligious contact reduces negative outgroup attitudes among majority Muslims but not among minority Christians. However, the quality of contact reduces negative attitudes regardless of relative group size. Perceived group threat is an important mediator of the contact-attitude relationship and is equally so for Christians and Muslims. Findings suggest that perceived discrimination does not affect the relationship between interreligious contact and negative attitudes.

T1  - THE BRIEF IMPLICIT ASSOCIATION TEST IS VALID: EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE
AN  - 1692289882; 201521459
AB  - As a new variant of Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998), the Brief Implicit Association Test (BIAT; Sriram & Greenwald, 2009) has been shown to be useful in predicting various behaviors. This research aims to examine experimental validity of the BIAT. Two experiments were conducted. Experiment 1 demonstrated that the BIAT was sensitive to implicit favoritism toward and identification with a newly established ingroup by memorization procedure, a minimal group induction procedure (Pinter & Greenwald, 2011). Experiment 2 showed that the BIAT was responsive to the threat effect on intergroup attitudes and further predictive of resultant intention to boycott outgroup. Moreover, mediation analysis showed that the change in implicit favoritism revealed by BIAT partially explained changes in the intention to boycott. These findings suggest that BIAT is not only sensitive to newly formed associations but also to the change of an existing association. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Religious fundamentalism and racial prejudice: a comparison of implicit and explicit approaches
AN  - 1660021259; 201505832
AB  - We examined religious fundamentalism (RF) and racial prejudice (RP) using the implicit Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP) and explicit Feeling Thermometer (FT). Ninety undergraduates (38 Blacks and 52 Whites) from a small southern USA university participated. We experimentally manipulated aggression/love Bible texts to study any influence on RP, but found that it had no effect on reducing pretest-posttest AMP scores. Analysis of AMP posttest data found that Black participants favoured Black over White Primes, but White participants did not discriminate between Race Primes. High RF did not discriminate between Race Primes, although low RF did, in preferring Black Primes. Analysis of explicit FT Warmness towards Whites/Blacks found an in-group preference for both White and Black participants. In this analysis, RF was not a discriminator among White participants in overall Warmness towards Whites/Blacks, although it was among Black participants. Most consistent across implicit-explicit data analyses was that high RF was generally unrelated to RP. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Strivers vs skivers: Class prejudice and the demonisation of dependency in everyday life
AN  - 1551000734; 201429131
AB  - This paper focuses on the moral dimension of everyday lives, using original empirical material about the judgments we make about others to explore and understand the contemporary nature of class prejudice. In doing so, we pay attention to the relationship between class prejudice and other forms of stigma and discrimination by exploring the complex (re)alignment of associations between different social groups (including working class people, disabled people, asylum seekers) in processes of 'othering' and exclusion. The research highlights the potential shared interest of groups who are demonised for being 'in need' to challenge the contemporary hegemony of the individualised ethic of self-interest which is producing a process of de-socialisation in which the importance of values such as care, compassion and social responsibility risk becoming casualties with inevitable consequences for social cohesion. Rather, the paper concludes by arguing for a re-socialisation of politics that recognises the structural causes of inequalities and which values and promotes understandings across, instead of moral judgements of, difference and our social obligations towards each other.

T1  - 'Struck by the Turks': reflections on Armenian refugeehood in Cyprus
AN  - 1559006021; 201431945
AB  - A large part of the Armenian community in Cyprus descends from survivors of the 1915 genocide in Anatolia who initially settled in neighbourhoods of the capital Nicosia. Following the independence of the island from British colonialists in 1960, these neighbourhoods fell under Turkish-Cypriot administration. As the ethnic conflict unfolded between Greek- and Turkish-Cypriots from 1963 onwards, these Armenians became displaced from their homes for a second time, seeking refuge in the Greek-Cypriot sector. Demetriou analyses the experience of this displacement and the entanglement of the legal, political and subjective spheres that constitute it. She examines the legal and administrative measures that classified those fleeing from Turkish-Cypriot administered areas as Tourkoplikti (struck by the Turks), a label that reinforced the distinction between Armenians and Greek-Cypriots, the majority of whom were displaced in 1974, and were officially classified as 'refugees' or prosfiyes. By looking at the difference between Tourkoplikti and prosfiyes, Demetriou interrogates the location of the Armenian minority within the Greek-Cypriot community. She argues that the silencing of minority experiences of the conflict does not merely impoverish our understanding of it, but also perpetuates a blindness to subtle structures of discrimination. Understanding these structures can show how victimization may turn into a domination strategy (such as through the production of a hegemonic rhetoric of refugeehood). Attention to such processes, which develop through and in the aftermath of conflict, might offer a better grasp of the complex patterns of post-conflict prejudice and exclusion.

T1  - Skin-Color Prejudice and Within-Group Racial Discrimination: Historical and Current Impact on Latino/a Populations
AN  - 1520343162; 201412972
AB  - The psychological literature on colorism, a form of within-group racial discrimination, is sparse. In an effort to contribute to this understudied area and highlight its significance, a concise and selective review of the history of colorism in Latin America is provided. Specifically, three historical eras (i.e., conquest, colonization, and post-colonization) are summarized. In each era, the establishment of racial and ethnic stratification and its consequences for Latino/as of indigenous and African descent are discussed. Connections between today's color-blind racial attitudes and mestizaje, or the mixing of races, is underscored to demonstrate how these strategies have been used, historically and today, to deny and minimize skin-color privilege. The article culminates with questions to help readers reflect and engage in dialogue about colorism as a prelude to recommendations for stimulating future research on this significant yet neglected topic.

T1  - Psychosocial Predictors of Antiracist Bystander Action Toward Indigenous Australians
AN  - 1718067939; 201530763
AB  - Racism toward Indigenous people remains a social problem in Australian culture, and racial abuse is part of that social problem. In this research, we investigated whether internal and external motivations, being open-minded, and having racist attitudes predicted the intention to engage in bystander action in support of Indigenous Australians in situations deemed low- and high-risk to personal safety. A total of 168 non-Indigenous community participants completed an anonymous online survey in Perth, Western Australia. In the low-risk scenario, low levels of racism, high internal motivation, and openness predicted the intention to engage in bystander action. In the high-risk scenario, participants with lower levels of racism and being female were more likely to engage in bystander action in support of Indigenous Australians. Coupled with previous research in the field, our findings suggest that internalized values relating to antiracist sentiments are significant predictors of antiracist bystander action.

T1  - The Gay Second Generation: Sexual Identity and Family Relations of Filipino and Latino Gay Men
AN  - 1520342905; 201413358
AB  - While studies have considered how race has reshaped how children of immigrants adapt to US life, studies have not thoroughly considered how sexual identity affects their assimilation. With a focus on familial incorporation, this study draws from the narratives of second-generation Filipino and Latino gay men to show that sexual identity deeply shapes the degree to which gay children of immigrants are able to secure social support and moral acceptance from their parents. These men employ strategies to maintain rapport with their families before and after coming out of the closet, a process I term moral management. While this study focuses on a unique population, the findings have greater implications for uncovering the mechanisms of intergenerational conflict and consensus among immigrant populations, as well as the dynamics of overcoming social prejudices within minority communities.

T1  - The Big Five Personality Traits and Attitudes towards Immigrants
AN  - 1520339780; 201413083
AB  - Recent research suggests that the Big Five personality traits are important determinants of a wide range of political and social attitudes. In spite of this, the impact of personality traits on attitudes towards immigrants has been unattended in sociological research. On the basis of insights from personality psychology, we extend the sociological approach to immigrant-specific prejudice by analysing the effects of personality using a large and nationally representative sample of the Dutch population. Moreover, we consider personality jointly with situational predictors of attitudes towards immigrants. The results confirm that some personality traits are associated with attitudes towards immigrants, beyond the effect of socio-economic, attitudinal and contact predictors. We conclude that combining insights from sociology and personality psychology in the study of dispositional and situational determinants of attitudes towards immigration is a fruitful avenue for research.

T1  - Nazi archaeology abroad: German prehistorians and the international dynamics of collaboration
AN  - 1520336185; 201413125
AB  - Examining the work of German prehistoric archaeologists during the Third Reich reveals the importance of international scholarship in understanding how and why professional academics collaborated with the Nazi regime. Hare's article focuses on a specific cohort of German prehistorians at the University of Kiel and the Schleswig-Holstein Museum of Antiquities whose work was especially valued by Nazi ideologues. Through a study of their correspondence with colleagues at home and abroad, it identifies four key ways in which the international academic sphere informed collaboration at home, including the demands of foreign networks, the politics of cross-border projects and conferences, concerns about the reputation of German academia and the involvement of German archaeologists in occupied countries during the Second World War. Ultimately, this case study of Kiel archaeologists working during the 1930s and 1940s shows that engagement on the international level led both German and foreign scholars to make accommodations with the regime, but also at times led away from Nazi goals and provided a foundation for rebuilding the discipline after 1945.

T1  - Mixing bodies and minds: race, class and 'mixed schooling' controversies in New Orleans and Atlanta, 1874-87
AN  - 1520331128; 201413173
AB  - Educational access was central in the racial inscription of class identities in the late nineteenth century. In Atlanta and New Orleans, white newspapers, politicians and ordinary citizens launched vigorous campaigns against integrated schools, which resulted in limited access to elite public schooling for upwardly mobile Blacks. Jewell's study analyses these cases to explore social reproduction as a link between race and class as social structures. Whites in both cities used the concept of miscegenation, or racial mixing, to define Blacks' access to elite cultural knowledge and social networks as a violation of the colour line. Jewell argues that analyses of racial formation should give attention to discursive links between race and class in struggles over social reproduction because maintaining racial hierarchies in periods of social change requires constructing new cultural narratives that reproduce economic dominance over racial minorities.

T1  - 'Anyone Can Be an Illegal': Color-Blind Ideology and Maintaining Latino/Citizen Borders
AN  - 1512220922; 201408763
AB  - Previous research has shown that nativist ideology racializes nonwhite immigrants, but little research has looked at how color-blind racist discourse shapes how people accomplish this while maintaining a race-neutral identity. This study examines how online discussion forum participants of an anti-immigrant organization in the United States use color-blind racist discourse. The qualitative analysis of 200 threads (2,168 posts) shows that forum participants use the color-blind discursive tactic of diminishing the importance of race through rhetoric of legality, cultural racism, and reverse racism. This rhetoric frees forum participants to conflate illegal, criminal, and Hispanic. This neutralizes contradictions in their claims of a race-neutral stance, which is most evident in their discussions of Puerto Rico whereby participants reinforce a dichotomy between citizen and Latino. While color-blind racism has been used to explain race relations between white and nonwhite citizens, this research shows how the ideology extends to include nonwhite immigrants.

T1  - African American and Black Caribbean Mutual Feelings of Closeness: Findings From a National Probability Survey
AN  - 1550999634; 201429120
AB  - African American and Black Caribbean relations are described as strained. Standard portrayals of Black Caribbeans as a 'model minority' that has effectively assimilated into the American landscape often make explicit their distinctiveness from and enmity toward African Americans. Analysis using National Survey of American Life data (N = 6,082), exploring the nature and correlates of intergroup perceptions, reveals that both groups characterize their mutual relationships as being close. Gender and region of residence influence African American feelings of closeness toward Black Caribbeans, while for Black Caribbeans, perceived discrimination was significantly associated with feelings of closeness to African Americans. Black Caribbean immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries and Haiti felt closer to African Americans than did Jamaicans. In addition, foreign-born Black Caribbeans (first generation) felt closer to Black people from the Caribbean than second-generation Black Caribbeans. These and other findings are discussed in relation to research on intergroup closeness among African Americans and Black Caribbeans.

T1  - Music as a weapon of ethnopolitical violence and conflict: processes of ethnic separation during and after the break-up of Yugoslavia
AN  - 1494751508; 201401977
AB  - Using illustrations from the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s and their aftermath, Baker argues that understanding popular music and public discourses about it can help to understand the dynamics of ethnopolitical conflict. Studies of war and conflict have approached music as political communication, as an object of securitization, as a means of violence and as a symbol of ethnic difference, while international law in the context of another case of collective violence, Rwanda, has even begun to question whether performing or broadcasting certain music could constitute incitement to genocide. Drawing on poststructuralist perspectives on the media and ethnicization in conflicts, Baker explores and interrogates the discourse of popular music as a weapon of war that was in use during and after the violent break-up of Yugoslavia. Music during the Yugoslav wars was used as a tool of humiliation and violence in prison camps, and to provoke fear of the ethnic Other in line with a strategy of ethnic cleansing; it was also conceptualized as a morale-booster for the troops of one's own side. A discourse of music as a weapon of war was also in use and persisted after the war, when its referent was shifted to associate music-as-a-weapon not to the brave and defiant ingroup so much as the aggressive Other. This was then turned against a wider range of signifiers than those who had directly supported the Other's troops and had the effect of perpetuating ethnic separation and obstructing the reformation of a (post-)Yugoslav cultural space. Despite evidence that music did serve as an instrument of violence in the Yugoslav wars (and the precedent of the Bikindi indictment in Rwanda), Baker concludes that music should be integrated into understandings of ethnopolitical conflict not through a framework of incitement and complicity but with respect for the significance of music in the everyday.

T1  - Heterosexual Students' Experiences in Sexual Orientation Intergroup Dialogue Courses
AN  - 1463013039; 201345780
AB  - Heterosexism contributes to an unsafe campus climate for lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) college students. Intergroup dialogue courses about sexual orientation seek to build awareness, cross-group relationships, and commitment to social action to address anti-LGB prejudice and discrimination. Although dialogue courses are growing in popularity, few courses address sexual orientation. To advance knowledge of these dialogues, this qualitative study explores heterosexual students' motivations and expectations, challenges, and learning outcomes related to their participation in intergroup dialogue courses on sexual orientation. Core themes include desire to learn about the LGB community, concerns about offending classmates, anxiety around LGB stigma, conflict with classmates around controversial topics, affirming LGB people, and learning about heterosexism, privilege, and intersectionality of identity. Implications for intergroup dialogue pedagogy and research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - When white people report racial discrimination: The role of region, religion, and politics
AN  - 1429630075; 201335789
AB  - Scholarly interest in the correlates and consequences of perceived discrimination has grown exponentially in recent years, yet, despite increased legal and media attention to claims of 'anti-white bias,' empirical studies predicting reports of racial discrimination by white Americans remain limited. Using data from the 2006 Portraits of American Life Study, we find that evangelical Protestantism increases the odds that whites will report experiencing racial discrimination, even after controlling for racial context and an array of social and psychological characteristics. However, this effect is limited to the South. Outside the South, political affiliation trumps religion, yielding distinct regional profiles of discrimination reporters. These findings suggest that institutions may function as regional 'carriers' for whites inclined to report racial discrimination. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - African American Students' Responses to Racial Discrimination: How Race-Based Rejection Sensitivity and Social Constraints are Related to Psychological Reactions
AN  - 1417523734; 201331939
AB  - We examined the association between two individual differences (race-based rejection sensitivity and social constraints in talking about racism with family, friends, and/or intimate partners) and psychological reactions to an incident of racial discrimination. Participants were 551 African American undergraduates from either a predominantly white university (PWU) or a historically black university (HBU). Race-based rejection sensitivity (RS-Race) predicted higher negative affect and lower forgiveness for the perpetrator. Social constraints predicted higher negative affect and (marginally) lower forgiveness. There was also an interaction between social constraints and RS-Race: RS-Race was strongly negatively related to positive affect and forgiveness among participants with low social constraints but essentially unrelated among those with high social constraints. Thought intrusions (that might prolong the memory of the prejudicial event) also mediated the effects of RS-Race and social constraints on negative affect and forgiveness. The results document how individual differences are associated with reactions to being the target of racial discrimination in day-to-day interactions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Modern genocidal dehumanization: a new model
AN  - 1364704270; 201323563
AB  - While there has been a great deal of scholarly discussion of dehumanization in specific cases of genocide, few have asked why it manifests, whether it is present in all cases or what function/s it performs. These questions-and therein a broader problematic concerning the validity and usefulness of the concept-remain open. Savage's article addresses this gap in the literature by proposing a novel model of genocidal dehumanization that is conceived as a discursive strategy. In doing so, it takes a comparative approach, surveying previous work on genocidal dehumanization emerging from different disciplines and examining definitional problems. In demonstrating why the conditions of modernity-specifically, the rise of the state and changing perceptions of legitimate violence-require dehumanization as an accompaniment to genocide, the paradigm of initially 'good' or 'ordinary' perpetrators is rejected. Genocidal dehumanization is shown to perform two distinct functions: motivation, and legitimization. Manifestations of genocidal (and non-genocidal) dehumanization can therefore be placed on a continuum of extremity. Ultimately, Savage proposes a new structural and functional model of genocidal dehumanization. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The representation of migrants in the Italian press: A study on the Corriere della Sera (1992-2009)
AN  - 1492599423; 201400209
AB  - The research analyses media discourse on migration in Italy, regarded as a means of reproducing and maintaining a racist interpretation of inter-group relations. The theoretical framework is the Critical Discourse Analysis approach. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed on data consisting of headlines and articles from the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, published between 1992 and 2009. Overall, it emerged that discourse is built according to themes and discursive strategies already identified by similar research based on European media, indicating how this system of representations defines a common sense of cultural belonging and a shared construction of ethnic relations. The rather long time span considered in the study allowed us to focus on how the discourse on migration in Italy might have evolved over time, but also to identify any elements that may have remained unchanged.

T1  - Running from our shadows: the performative impact of policy diagnoses in Dutch debates on immigrant integration
AN  - 1551002896; 201429135
AB  - This article examines the performative politics of claiming policy failure in the integration of immigrants in the Netherlands, often articulated as the failure of 'the multiculturalist model'. Four consecutive 'post-'discourses are distinguished, in which we see the construction of increasingly explicit notions of Dutchness. This idea of the Dutch is as much about the style in which it is articulated as it is about the symbolic resources through which Dutchness is imagined. Examining the national imagination in policy diagnoses helps us to understand why immigrant integration has been so consistently presented as a failure of multiculturalism.

T1  - Between assimilation and multiculturalism: models of integration in Australia
AN  - 1551002409; 201429133
AB  - This paper outlines the ways in which the conception of social integration and its practical realization have developed over time in Australia, and the various pathways that models of integration have followed. It makes a distinction between the approaches to inclusion of the indigenous population, the Australian Aborigines in broader Australian social life and social institutions, and those dealing with populations of incoming migrants, refugees and asylum-seekers. Although there are similarities in the models of integration mobilized in both arenas, the differences and interactions are also significant and characteristic of what is specific about settler-colonial societies. The central models in both fields are assimilation, integration and multiculturalism, and the paper will sketch briefly how each model has operated both in theory and in practice, how they have succeeded and interacted with each other, how they have intersected with other types of concerns, such as citizenship, civilization and security, as well as what might be distinctive about the Australian approach to social integration in comparison with other countries.

T1  - Insights from studying prejudice in the context of American atheists
AN  - 1417526280; 201331864
AB  - Our research on non-religion supports the proposed shift toward more interactive models of prejudice. Being nonreligious is easily hideable and, increasingly, of low salience, leading to experiences not easily understood via traditional or contemporary frameworks for studying prejudice and prejudice reduction. This context affords new opportunity to observe reverse forms of interactive prejudice, which can interfere with prejudice reduction. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Heterosexism, homonegativity, and the sociopolitical dangers of orthodox models of prejudice reduction
AN  - 1417524293; 201331974
AB  - Criticism of orthodox models of prejudice reduction is particularly relevant for lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals, particularly when considering stage models of coming-out. If social change is to be effected regarding endemic homonegativity and heterosexism, then it is argued that a radical rethink is needed to the understandable but misinformed desire to get us to like each other more.

T1  - The dominance of the individual in intergroup relations research: Understanding social change requires psychological theories of collective and structural phenomena
AN  - 1417521754; 201332022
AB  - Dixon et al. suggest that the psychological literature on intergroup relations should shift from theorizing "prejudice reduction" to "social change." A focus on social change exposes the importance of psychological theories involving collective phenomena like social norms and institutions. Individuals' attitudes and emotions may follow, rather than cause, changes in social norms and institutional arrangements. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Intergroup bias toward "Group X": Evidence of prejudice, dehumanization, avoidance, and discrimination against asexuals
AN  - 1283641062; 201303101
AB  - Although biases against homosexuals (and bisexuals) are well established, potential biases against a largely unrecognized sexual minority group, asexuals, has remained uninvestigated. In two studies (university student and community samples) we examined the extent to which those not desiring sexual activity are viewed negatively by heterosexuals. We provide the first empirical evidence of intergroup bias against asexuals (the so-called "Group X"), a social target evaluated more negatively, viewed as less human, and less valued as contact partners, relative to heterosexuals and other sexual minorities. Heterosexuals were also willing to discriminate against asexuals (matching discrimination against homosexuals). Potential confounds (e.g., bias against singles or unfamiliar groups) were ruled out as explanations. We suggest that the boundaries of theorizing about sexual minority prejudice be broadened to incorporate this new target group at this critical period, when interest in and recognition of asexuality is scientifically and culturally expanding.

T1  - Is racial bias malleable? Whites' lay theories of racial bias predict divergent strategies for interracial interactions
AN  - 1347785943; 201318844
AB  - How do Whites approach interracial interactions? We argue that a previously unexamined factor -- beliefs about the malleability of racial bias -- guides Whites' strategies for difficult interracial interactions. We predicted and found that those who believe racial bias is malleable favor learning-oriented strategies such as taking the other person's perspective and trying to learn why an interaction is challenging, whereas those who believe racial bias is fixed favor performance-oriented strategies such as overcompensating in the interaction and trying to end the interaction as quickly as possible. Four studies support these predictions. Whether measured (Studies 1, 3, and 4) or manipulated (Study 2), beliefs that racial bias is fixed versus malleable yielded these divergent strategies for difficult interracial interactions. Furthermore, beliefs about the malleability of racial bias are distinct from related constructs (e.g., prejudice and motivations to respond without prejudice; Studies 1, 3, and 4) and influence self-reported (Studies 1-3) and actual (Study 4) strategies in imagined (Studies 1-2) and real (Studies 3-4) interracial interactions. Together, these findings demonstrate that beliefs about the malleability of racial bias influence Whites' approaches to and strategies within interracial interactions.

T1  - A Black Dutchman and the Racial Discourse of the Dutch in America, 1850-1920
AN  - 1347782674; 201318718
AB  - Following the American Civil War, a Dutch-American immigrant soldier returned to his home in Holland, Michigan, with a freed slave whom he had adopted. The adopted child, named Siras, was then raised in a Dutch immigrant household where he learned the Dutch language and the tenets of Dutch Calvinism. Although Siras was clearly well regarded by locals, he could not escape the racial stereotypes and prejudices of the Midwest and spent his entire adult life working as a hotel porter. Siras remained the only black man among the Dutch and a challenge for what it meant to be both Dutch and American. A micro-history of Siras, rooted in primary sources, sheds light on a larger discourse of Dutch-American ethnic and national identity. Dutch American immigrants of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries generally avoided contact with blacks, expressed implicit racial superiority, and defined themselves in reference to black as an 'other'.

T1  - Recruiting the 'martial races': identities and military service in colonial India
AN  - 1283644050; 201303429
AB  - British rule in India was entirely reliant on local troops, and the mobilization and recruitment of Indian communities gave rise to a multiplicity of discourses, traditions and identities reflecting the peculiar relationship between colonial power and indigenous military labour. Through the late nineteenth century, these discourses became increasingly racialized: only certain native communities were deemed to possess the 'spirit' necessary for military service. These so-called 'martial races'-including Nepalese Gurkhas, Punjabi Sikhs and Muslims from the northern and frontier provinces-provided the backbone of the imperial military and played a vital role in defending and extending colonial authority. By the early twentieth century, the racialized nature of soldiering in India was invoked to explain the composition of imperial forces and to legitimize the preservation of colonial rule. While the theory of 'martial races' is the subject of an increasingly diverse literature, relatively little attention has been paid to the practice-and practical origins-of restricted recruitment. In this article Rand and Wagner seek to re-examine the role of martial-race theories in British recruitment policies and practices in colonial India, drawing attention to the incoherence and complexity that marked the relationship between ideas of race and the practicalities of colonial military administration. They focus in particular on long-term patterns of continuities, rather than neat periodizations, and suggest that racialized discourses regarding soldiering have to be considered within the context of mutually advantageous relationships between the colonial state and its indigenous allies.

T1  - Making bodies modern: race, medicine and the colonial soldier in the mid-eighteenth century
AN  - 1283644049; 201303271
AB  - The expansion of British imperial warfare during the middle of the eighteenth century provided motivation and opportunity for observations on British and native forces. The nature of military medicine, with its use of regimental returns and empirical observations about mortality rates of large groups of anonymous individuals, encouraged generalizations about differences between native and European bodies. As foreign, colonial environments accentuated European deaths due to disease during war-time, and as early modern medicine advised the use of acclimatized, native labour, the physical experience of eighteenth-century colonial warfare encouraged the recruitment of native forces as menial labourers under the direction of professional British soldiers. Although not inherently racial, such practices buttressed emerging social and cultural prejudices. In contrast to the traditional focus on intellectual writings on race and science during the modern period of nineteenth-century imperialism, Charters's article examines the experience of common men-rank-and-file soldiers-during the early modern period, demonstrating the relationship between developing empirical and scientific observations and burgeoning racial theories.

T1  - "Unskilled" Workers: Social Skills Stereotypes Affect Evaluations of Biracial Job Applicants
AN  - 1266147523; 201300451
AB  - Why do Black/White workers earn wages similar to Black workers ($6.30 less per hour than White workers), despite encountering less negative, anti-Black sentiment from others? We propose that Black/White workers must contend with stereotypes suggesting that biracial people are socially unskilled. In the present study we observed that, regardless of whether job candidates were rejected for external reasons (interviewer prejudice) or whether candidates acted in undesirable ways (claimed discrimination), participants rated Black/White applicants as less socially skilled and as more likely to have demonstrated poor interview skills than Black applicants. Implications for biases against hiring biracial people are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The New "New Racism" Thesis: Limited Government Values and Race-Conscious Policy Attitudes
AN  - 1023026007; 201223844
AB  - Some contend that Whites' application of values to form opinions about race-conscious policy may constitute a subtle form of racism. Others challenge the new racism thesis, suggesting that racism and values are exclusive in their influence. Proponents of the thesis assert that many Whites' attitudes about such policy are structured by a mix of racism and American individualism. The author suggests that an even more subtle form of racism may exist. Racism may actually be expressed in opposition to big government. The test results presented here indicate that the effects of limited-government values on attitudes about race-conscious policy are conditional on levels of racial prejudice for many Whites, whereas the effects on racially ambiguous social welfare policy attitudes are not. The author contends that these results provide support to the argument that racism still exists and has found a new subtle expression.

T1  - African and Black Caribbean origin cancer survivors: a qualitative study of the narratives of causes, coping and care experiences
AN  - 1520336209; 201419621
AB  - Objectives. Although there is evidence in the USA and UK to suggest that ethnic minority groups have an inferior experience of cancer care, few studies investigate ethnic disparities in satisfaction and care experiences among survivors. Patients' illness perceptions (lay explanations for illness) and coping styles (emotional and behavioural) are influenced by ethnicity-related cultural beliefs and expectations. Depressive illness or fears of recurrence of cancer may also lead to poorer recovery and function. This paper investigates whether ethnic influences explain different coping behaviours, care experiences and help-seeking behaviours. Design. Eight participants of African or Black Caribbean origin were recruited from a London support group for a series of qualitative in-depth interviews. The interviews were recorded and transcribed, and the transcripts analysed using a framework method of qualitative data analysis. The emergent themes were tested and documented to reflect the issues of importance to patients. Results. Lay explanations of causes of cancer were complex and diverse reflecting cultural influences and the impact of contact with health professionals. Generally, positive views about cancer care were found, especially at the secondary care level. Primary care attracted mixed views. In contrast to American studies, no acknowledgement of discrimination on the basis of ethnicity was reported. The need to be resilient and think positively were widely acknowledged as coping strategies. Some coped by avoiding contemplation of their condition or diagnosis. Religious beliefs and practices provided coping mechanisms for some, and a means to improve confidence and avoid distressing contemplation about their condition. Family, friends and charitable groups also provided emotional and practical support. Conclusions. Subjects were generally satisfied with their care; different coping styles included positive attitudes, minimisation of difficulties or more realistic consideration of the impact of cancer.

T1  - Anti-Masonry as political protest: fascists and Freemasons in interwar Romania
AN  - 1283643183; 201303277
AB  - Clark analyses the anti-Masonic discourses used by fascist groups in interwar Romania. Unlike attacks on already stigmatized groups such as Jews and communists, the objects of anti-Masonic attacks had institutional power and were socially respectable. Romanian anti-Masonry was an attempt by politically marginal parties on the extreme right to undermine the authority of their mainstream opponents. Anti-Masonry was a core doctrine for both of the major fascist parties in interwar Romania-A. C. Cuza's National Christian Defence League and Corneliu Zelea Codreanu's League of the Archangel Michael-as well as for journalists and writers associated with smaller groups or those attempting to create a united fascist front. Drawing on a large corpus of anti-Masonic texts, they claimed to be opposing a global conspiracy against the Christian world by Freemasons in co-operation with Jews and communists. Fascists slandered specific individuals, including government ministers and leading writers, accusing them of treason and heresy because of their supposed ties to Freemasonry. Romanian Freemasonry's connections with French lodges led fascists to blame Masons for their country's pro-French, pro-League of Nations foreign policy, which they saw as evidence that Romania was run by Jews. Anti-Masonry extended beyond fascist circles and was also adopted by the Orthodox Church, which declared Freemasonry to be heretical and anti-Christian. Not limiting themselves to those who actually were Masons, fascists also accused other fascists of having Masonic connections as a way to undermine the nationalist credentials of political rivals. Anti-Masonic slander continued even after Freemasonry was dissolved in Romania, but decreased in frequency once fascists gained institutional power. For them, anti-Masonry was primarily a way to attack people in power and, once the fascists ruled Romania, anti-Masonry became an excuse to replace representatives of the old regime with new fascist appointees.

T1  - Parsimony in Personality: Predicting Sexual Prejudice
AN  - 1283641923; 201303401
AB  - Extant research has established numerous demographic, personal-history, attitudinal, and ideological correlates of sexual prejudice, also known as homophobia. The present study investigated whether Five-Factor Model (FFM) personality domains, particularly Openness, and FFM facets, particularly Openness to Values, contribute independent and incremental variance to the prediction of sexual prejudice beyond these established correlates. Participants were 117 college students who completed a comprehensive FFM measure, measures of sexual prejudice, and a demographics, personal-history, and attitudes-and-ideologies questionnaire. Results of stepwise multiple regression analyses demonstrated that, whereas Openness domain score predicted only marginal incremental variance in sexual prejudice, Openness facet scores (particularly Openness to Values) predicted independent and substantial incremental variance beyond numerous other zero-order correlates of sexual prejudice. The importance of integrating FFM personality variables, especially facet-level variables, into conceptualizations of sexual prejudice is highlighted. Study strengths and weaknesses are discussed as are potential implications for prejudice-reduction interventions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Deciding the Fate of Others: The Cognitive Underpinnings of Racially Biased Juror Decision Making
AN  - 1283640397; 201303364
AB  - In criminal law, jurors are supposed to ignore defendant race when considering factual matters of culpability. However, when judging the merits of a criminal case, jurors' ability (or inability) to avoid bias may affect verdicts. Fact-based decision making expend cognitive resources, while heuristic-based decisions (e.g., using criminal stereotypes) conserve resources. Here, we investigated whether differences in cognitive resources and prejudice attitudes about Blacks influenced trial outcomes. We tested the impact of working memory capacity (WMC), cognitive load, prejudice, and target race (Black, White) on penalties ascribed to fictional criminal defendants in ambiguous-fact cases. Results showed that when "loaded," prejudiced-low-WMC persons supported guilty verdicts with higher confidence more often for Black than White defendants. Conversely, regardless of WMC or prejudice attitude, participants penalized White defendants more often when not loaded. We suggest that cognitive resources and prejudice attitude influence fact-based decisions. Links to juror judgments and potential trial outcomes are discussed. . Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "It Ain't All as Bad as it May Seem": Young Black Lesbians' Responses to Sexual Prejudice
AN  - 1266144128; 201300449
AB  - This article explores the ways in which young, Black lesbians manage their sexual minority identity when experiencing sexual prejudice. Fourteen Black lesbians between the ages of 16 and 24 participated in semistructured interviews. Instances of sexual prejudice and the young women's responses were thematically analyzed using open and axial qualitative coding techniques. Results indicated that participants experienced sexual prejudice frequently and even within the lesbian community. Responses to sexual prejudice included: cognitive reframing of heterosexist messages, passing, gaining support from self-created gay families, and fighting back (physically and verbally) in the event of isolated instances of sexual prejudice. Analysis focuses on how gender identity relates to experiences of sexual prejudice and identity management strategies. Findings suggest that there are parallels between the management strategies of these women and young, Black gay and bisexual males and between these women and Black women who are coping with sexism and racism.

T1  - Anti-Slavic imagery in German radical nationalist discourse at the turn of the twentieth century: a prelude to Nazi ideology?
AN  - 1531933839; 201423301
AB  - By applying methods of cognitive metaphor theory, Jaworska examines metaphorical scenarios employed in the discourse of anti-Slavism, which featured prominently in radical nationalist propaganda in Germany at the turn of the twentieth century. She does so by analysing metaphorical expressions used to refer to the Polish population living in the eastern provinces of Prussia, in the so-called Ostmark. Her article is based on an analysis of a range of pamphlets and newspaper articles written by some of the leading figures of two nationalist organizations: the Pan-German League (Alldeutscher Verband) and the Eastern Marches Society (Ostmarkenverein). The main research questions it addresses are: What kind of metaphoric scenarios were used to depict the Polish minority, and to what extent were the metaphorical patterns of anti-Slavic imagery similar to those employed in the antisemitic propaganda of the Nazi era? Is there a discursive continuity between the radical nationalism of imperial Germany and the National Socialism of the Third Reich at the level of metaphorical scenarios? Ultimately, Jaworska attempts to contribute to a better understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying radical and essentially racist attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Protestant work ethic's relation to intergroup and policy attitudes: A meta-analytic review
AN  - 1018342780; 201212787
AB  - The Protestant work ethic (PWE), the belief that hard work leads to success, is prevalent in many cultures and has been related to negative attitudes toward disadvantaged groups (prejudice) and social policies targeting them. Given recent theorizing and findings suggesting that PWE is not necessarily associated with prejudice among all people or in all contexts, this meta-analysis examined the direction and strength of PWE's relation to prejudice (37 eligible studies) and policy attitudes (16 studies) among published and unpublished studies across 38 years. Results revealed not only significant positive relationships between PWE and both types of intergroup attitudes but also significant moderators of these relationships. There were significantly larger effect sizes for PWE's relationship with both prejudice and policy attitudes among samples in Western countries (Canada, England, New Zealand, USA), and marginally significantly larger effect sizes for PWE's relationship with both types of attitudes the older the mean age of the sample (within Western countries). PWE's relationship with intergroup attitudes also varied by the target group of the attitudes. Findings support a more nuanced view of PWE's relationship with intergroup attitudes, suggesting that PWE does not always promote greater prejudice; rather its consequences are culture and context bound.

T1  - Urban encounters with difference: the contact hypothesis and immigrant integration projects in eastern Berlin
AN  - 1023029673; 201226987
AB  - Recent urban scholarship celebrates the increased cultural and ethnic diversity of contemporary cities as promoting conviviality and intercultural sensibilities. The contact hypothesis and immigrant integration policies drawing on it similarly stress the importance of increased face-to-face contact for reducing inter-group prejudice and conflict. Drawing on ethnographic research in eastern Berlin, this paper examines spaces of encounters between local residents and recent immigrants and their potential for decreasing negative stereotypes, prejudice, and conflict. We find that contact between Russian Aussiedler and local German residents in public and quasi-public spaces remains fleeting, often reinforcing pre-existing stereotypes. Local immigrant integration projects, despite their intentions of increasing contact between migrant and non-migrant residents, often fail to provide opportunities for deeper contact. On the other hand, sustained and close encounters are enabled in spaces of neighborhood community centers, where immigrants and native residents work side-by-side on common projects. These sustained encounters engender more empathy and positive attitudes toward individual immigrants but these are not scaled up to the group, contradicting claims of recent contact theorists. We suggest that scholars and integration practitioners be cautious of overoptimistic assumptions about how encounters across difference can contribute to decreasing resentment and interethnic conflict, as these are underwritten by much broader processes of marginalization and deeply entrenched unequal power relations.

AN  - 1023025411; 201223971
AB  - We examined the relationships between beliefs about the etiology of having a same-sex sexual orientation, sexual prejudice, and support for gay-relevant legislation using the justification-suppression model of prejudice as our theoretical foundation. Results indicated that more belief that a same-sex sexual orientation was due to nurture factors predicted less support for gay-relevant legislation, and that this relationship was mediated by levels of sexual prejudice. The opposite pattern was found for belief that a same-sex sexual orientation was due to nature factors. This suggests that beliefs about the etiology of sexual orientation may serve as justification (or suppression) factors in the expression of prejudice toward gay men and lesbians.

T1  - Contact and knowledge as predictors of attitudes toward individuals with intellectual disabilities
AN  - 907925886; 201124581
AB  - Understanding attitudes that may lead to barriers to equality can help enhance social inclusion and quality of life for individuals with intellectual disabilities. The current study examined multidimensional attitudes toward individuals with intellectual disabilities. We expected that those with more knowledge and greater quantity and quality of contact with people with intellectual disabilities would have more positive attitudes toward this social group. Hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that greater knowledge and quantity of contact were unrelated to attitudes. Greater quality of contact, however, was associated with more positive attitudes. These findings add support to previous findings that positive experiences may lead to less intergroup anxiety, less hostility, and less avoidance of outgroups.

T1  - Continuity and change in anti-Jewish prejudice: the transmission of the anti-talmudic texts of Sixtus of Siena
AN  - 907925907; 201124635
AB  - One of the main elements common to both the mediaeval anti-Jewish tradition and modern antisemitism is the use of Jewish religious texts-particularly the Talmud-in order to 'prove' that Jews pose a threat to non-Jews. Bravo Lopez considers how a series of anti-talmudic texts written by Sixtus of Siena in the sixteenth century were disseminated and used, up to the beginning of the twentieth century, to legitimize a threatening image of Judaism and Jews. Despite the changing historical context, that image remained virtually intact throughout the centuries, allowing these same texts to be used time and time again to 'prove' that it was a faithful reflection of reality. Although historical changes can account for differences in the specific motives that drove each author to use the texts of Sixtus of Siena, those authors all shared the same image of Judaism and the Jews, and they considered these texts-cited as an authoritative source, legitimizing their point of view-to be effective in support of their cause.

T1  - The Two Faces of Liberalism: Islam in Contemporary Europe
AN  - 896164319; 201120143
AB  - This article addresses long-standing normative claims that liberalism-understood as the priority of economic and political liberty, neutrality in the public sphere, the universal application of human rights, and the requirement to treat all subjects equally-is inadequate in the context of deep, migration-driven diversity. Beginning with the assumption that liberalism-as-an-integration-paradigm must be evaluated empirically, the article examines the immigration experience of two liberal states: France and the United States. Evidence from these important countries of immigration demonstrates that universal, difference-blind policies that are suspicious of claims to difference in the public sphere reduce prejudice and promote positive intra-community attitudes (France), while limited income support and dynamic labour markets promote economic integration (the United States). Far from being an inadequate relic of a simpler age, liberalism is the best framework for accommodating diverse societies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Citizenship and multiple belonging. Representations of inclusion, identification and participation among children of immigrants in Italy
AN  - 1125218227; 201240380
AB  - This article aims to explore how children of immigrants enrolled in higher secondary schools in Milan conceive and speak about citizenship. It illustrates how the formal, participatory and identity dimensions of citizenship come to be articulated in a complex and changeable way in relation to discourses and contexts. In particular, it attempts to look more closely at the transformations of belonging, which today seems to be composed of different layers that underline different aspects: admittance stresses the universalistic claim to be equal, to not be excluded on the basis of discrimination or prejudice; identification conserves a particularistic and essentialist meaning, it stresses the importance and the 'unavoidableness' of difference; involvement regards lifestyles, everyday relations, it confers importance on the possibility to participate on behalf of a specific interest and have a stake in a community's life and future. Therefore, citizenship assumes different meanings when discourses shift from one layer to another. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Effects of Teams-Games-Tournaments on Achievement, Retention, and Attitudes of Economics Education Students
AN  - 881461181; 201117140
AB  - Cooperative learning, as an instructional methodology provides opportunities for students to develop skills in group interactions and in working with others that are needed in today's world. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of the cooperative learning technique of Teams-Games-Tournaments (TGT) on the achievement, retention, and attitudes toward TGT as a teaching method. A pretest-posttest, quasi-experimental design was used. Data collection instruments, an achievement test (Test of Economic Literacy), an attitude toward TGT and a retention test were used for the purpose of this study. Results indicated that the achievement test score for the TGT group was 52.99, while the Lecture control group was 50.13. This implies that the TGT group performed better in the achievement test compare to the control group. The retention test for both groups were very similar. The treatment group indicated positive attitude towards TGT as a teaching strategy for economics education. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Wanderer in a Distant Place: Tibetan Exile Youth, Literacy, and Emotion
AN  - 964189992; 201207507
AB  - Among Tibetans living in exile in India, expressions of longing and sadness for family, friends and places in Tibet are not uniformly shared across members of the community. Time and distance have faded and idealized their homeland in the memories of long-term exiles. Yet, for a segment of this community called New Arrivals, who have only relatively recently left Tibet, people and places "back home" are real and immediate. The immediacy of these ties to Chinese Tibet, however, often engenders perceptions of New Arrivals as Sinicised, backward and uneducated. This paper focuses on these New Arrivals in the enclave of McLeod Ganj, India, home to the Tibetan exile government and approximately 7,000 Tibetan exiles. In this predominately Tibetan area, the division between long-term exiles and New Arrivals constitutes the dominant social boundary among McLeod Ganj Tibetans, a division that is most prominent among McLeod Ganj's Tibetan youth. Drawing from community discourses, social networks and practices, and educational institutions, I analyse everyday written forms (e.g., poetry, letters, diary entries) to suggest that through these writings, New Arrival youth are constituting and reconstructing their marginalized position within the community. In an exile community where resources are limited, improving the position of New Arrivals can be challenging. Here, I suggest two approaches to the difficulties these youth face. First, re-educating the larger Tibetan community in order to breakdown the prejudices that exist toward these new exiles. Second, refashioning the existing educational institutions for New Arrivals to better prepare them for employment in the Tibetan communities or elsewhere in India. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Barack Obama and the South: demography as electoral opportunity
AN  - 902082804; 201122211
AB  - Barack Obama was more successful in the South in the 2008 election than many previous Democratic presidential nominees had been. While John McCain continued Republican dominance in the conservative region, it was a major breakthrough for a northern liberal Democrat, especially an African American from Illinois, to win three southern states and secure 55 electoral votes. Florida, North Carolina and Virginia were good opportunities for Obama because, demographically, they had come to resemble other large states outside the South. In these 'converging' southern states, the Latino and Asian communities had grown substantially. The percentage of college-educated Whites had increased and there had been large-scale migration from other regions of the country. The states that Obama won in the South were not as 'southern' as they once were. In some southern states, those called the 'neo-Confederate South' in this article, white support for Obama was less than John Kerry had received in 2004. This decline in white voting for the Democratic presidential nominee occurred despite the difficult economic times that enveloped the country in the months preceding the election, and the general unpopularity of the incumbent Republican administration headed by George W. Bush. Some of these states, like Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, had been among the most intransigent states in resisting the claims of the civil rights movement for social and political equality for African Americans in the 1950s and 1960s. In the future it may be more accurate to speak of more than one South, rather than refer to the region as an undifferentiated whole. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Kuryla maps a metaphorical American island of the colour blind--in law, public rhetoric and culture--in the process locating the first black president of the United States on it, evaluating the claim that his presidency represents a colour-blind or post-racial politics. Barack Obama rejects colour blindness as a fact in the present yet gestures to its 'better history' (his modern transposing of Lincoln's 'better angels') while refusing any theoretical resolution of the idea. Obama, in public pronouncements and by sheer fact of his being and his biography, reveals the epistemic irony of the colour-blind idea, its persistence amid the conditions of its impossibility.

T1  - Not Quite Color Blind: Ethnic and Gender Differences in Attitudes toward Older People among College Students
AN  - 1364699852; 201326861
AB  - Attitudes toward older people can influence how they are treated and their cognitive and physical health. The populations of the United States and many other countries have become more ethnically diverse, and are aging. Yet little research examines how ethnic diversity affects attitudes toward older people. Our study addresses this research gap. Using the Aging Semantic Differential, 592 university students expressed their attitudes toward older African-American, Hispanic, and White women and men. Repeated measures analysis of variance examined attitude differences by participant ethnicity and gender, and by the ethnicity and gender of evaluated individuals. Both African-American and White students had more positive attitudes toward older women and men of their own ethnic group. Participants had more positive attitudes toward older women than they did toward older men. Findings suggest in-group favoritism, and the usefulness of training those in service industries and public service to treat older individuals equitably. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Regulating Islamophobia: The Need for Collecting Disaggregated Data on Racism in Ireland
AN  - 1081862695; 201235198
AB  - Over the past 20 years, not only has Europe witnessed an increasing prominence of right-wing political groups, European governments have also moved to regulate Muslims and how they practice their faith. Contrary to this negative form of regulation, I propose through drawing on the theoretical insights of Michel Foucault that the agencies of European governments -- focusing here on the government of Ireland -- can regulate the societal position of Muslims in a manner that protects against Islamophobia. Islamic communities in Ireland are rich in their cultural and religious diversity. Nevertheless, there exists a paucity of data vis-a-vis Muslims and their experience of racism in Ireland. Put in an international context, Muslims are increasingly vulnerable to prejudice and discrimination on the basis of their faith and the ascribed negative imagery. I contend that the effective collection of data by State agencies is not only necessary to gauge levels of Islamophobia in Ireland, but that this data would also increase the effectiveness of State policies. Furthermore, I contend that if Islamophobia is to be challenged, moves must be made to pathologize this form of racism. This can be achieved by the systematic collection of disaggregated data that illuminates the levels of Islamophobia that exist in society. Effective data collection of this sort could be instrumental in increasing the utility of future State policies designed to combat racist sentiment directed towards Muslims as propagated by right-wing groups and others.

T1  - Race Prejudice, Class Conflict, and Nationalism
AN  - 1010632402; 201210495
AB  - The United States has set the pattern of Oriental exclusion for such countries as Canada and Australia. On the Pacific Coast, and in California especially, a distinct and rather involved racial situation has developed; perhaps it may be thought of as the completion of a "race-relations cycle." Here, because of the rapid cultural advancement of these colored people, the natural history of race relations has been greatly expedited. Like all racial situations, we approach this one also from the point of view of the white man's initiative -- he is the actor in chief; the Asiatics react to their best advantage.

T1  - Islamophobia in Austria: The Recent Emergence of Anti-Muslim Sentiments in the Country
AN  - 852900028; 201103259
AB  - This paper examines the characteristics of Islamophobia in contemporary Austria. The country represents a particularly interesting case study of the dissemination of anti-Muslim sentiments as it has had a strong tradition of populist, right-wing politics, which was closely associated with the name of Jorg Haider until his death in 2008. However, publicly voiced prejudices against Muslims have remained comparatively rare. For some time, Austria's policy towards its Muslim population was even regarded as a model to be adopted by other countries. Even though this situation has started to change in the last three or four years, Islamophobia in Austria still seems to be more modest than, for example, in The Netherlands, where populist politics and anti-Muslim diatribes are closely connected. A further thesis to be confirmed in this research links anti-Muslim rhetoric in Austria with entrenched Judeophobic prejudices in the society at large. In this sense, some kinds of Islamophobia may serve as a cover for anti-Semitism. This view is very much in accordance with Austria's collective memory, which for a long time has demonstrated an amiable attitude towards Muslims, whereas Jews have always been seen as the utmost enemy. At a time when anti-Semitism has become socially disrespected, Islamophobia, a widely held attitude throughout Europe, is being used to appeal to Judeophobic sentiments.

T1  - The Influence of Social Desirability Pressures on Expressed Immigration Attitudes
AN  - 818800582; 201072013
AB  - Objective. Immigration scholars have found that the highly educated and political liberals are considerably less likely to support restrictionist immigration policies than other groups. I ask whether the influence of social desirability pressures in the survey interview is responsible for this finding. Methods. unobtrusive questioning technique known as the list experiment is used to measure Americans' support for immigration restrictionism. The list experiment can easily be embedded in a standard telephone survey and has been used by previous investigators to study racial attitudes. Results. Restrictionist sentiments are found to be more widespread among the U.S. populace than previous studies have estimated, especially among college graduates and political liberals. Conclusion. immigration scholars and social scientists who study other sensitive attitudes and behaviors. The most commonly employed strategies to reduce socially desirable responding may not be enough. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The changing image of the Kurds in Turkish cities: middle-class perceptions of Kurdish migrants in Izmir
AN  - 754039428; 201049789
AB  - Saracoglu deals with the ways in which the Kurdish migrants living in the western cities of Turkey have been identified in middle-class discourse by certain pejorative labels and stereotypes. He argues that this new Kurdish image demonstrates the ethnicization of longstanding anti-migrant sentiments in Turkey. He develops and substantiates the argument by means of qualitative data gathered in a field study in Izmir between June 2006 and July 2007. The study involved ninety in-depth interviews with middle-class individuals living in the city and explored their anti-Kurdish attitudes. Through a close analysis of two of the common stereotypes that these interviewees deployed in the interviews--namely, that the Kurds were 'benefit scroungers' and that they 'disrupt urban life'-- Saracoglu explores the formation of the urban social context in which such perceptions have emerged. Close examination of the narratives of the middle-class respondents indicates that the development of a new image of the Kurds has occurred in an urban context shaped by the neoliberal transformation of Turkish cities, on the one hand, and the internal displacement of Kurdish migrants, on the other.

T1  - A Paradox of Integration? Interracial Contact, Prejudice Reduction, and Perceptions of Racial Discrimination
AN  - 743066950; 201043232
AB  - A random digit dialing survey (N = 596) investigated the relationship between quantity and quality of interracial contact and Black South Africans' perceptions of racial discrimination in postapartheid society. Results showed that harmonious contact was associated with lower levels of perceived collective discrimination, an effect that was mediated by racial attitudes and personal experiences of racial discrimination. The implications of the survey's findings are discussed in relation to two models of social change in social psychology (cf. Wright & Lubensky, 2008): a model of change grounded in the rehabilitation of the prejudiced individual and a model of social change grounded in collective awareness of, and resistance to, systemic inequality.

T1  - 'Away with the fairies?' Disability within primary-age children's literature
AN  - 743050779; 201031556
AB  - This article outlines the findings of a new study that explores the portrayal of disability within a sample of the primary-age children's literature most readily available to UK schools. The kind of literature to which children are exposed is likely to influence their general perceptions of social life. How disability is handled by authors is therefore important from the standpoint of disability equality. Findings suggest that whilst there are some good examples of inclusive literature 'out there', discriminatory language and/or negative stereotypes about disability continue to be present in a range of more contemporary children's books. Clearly, more still needs to be done to ensure that schools and teachers are provided with information relating to the best examples of inclusion literature and efforts must continue to be made to inform authors, publishers and illustrators about how to approach the issue of disability.

T1  - Anti-Gay Sentiment Among Adolescents in Belgium and Canada: A Comparative Investigation into the Role of Gender and Religion
AN  - 60370544; 201017513
AB  - Previous research has indicated that opposition toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and trangender (LGBT) rights remains prevalent among Western populations. In this article, we investigate the determinants of anti-gay attitudes among adolescents in two liberal democracies, Belgium (n = 6,330) and Canada (n = 3,334). The analysis indicates that hostile feelings toward LGBT rights are particularly widespread among boys, while the effects of socioeconomic status and parental education remain limited. Various religious denominations proved to have a strong and significant negative impact on tolerance, with especially high scores for Islam. Religious practice, too, contributes to a negative attitude toward LGBT rights. The consequences of these findings with regard to tolerance for gay rights among Islamic youth in Western democracies are discussed. Adapted from the source document.
