T1  - Attachment in the time of COVID-19: Insecure attachment orientations are associated with defiance of authorities’ guidelines during the pandemic
AN  - 2691407190
AB  - Previous research has linked people’s relational attachment orientations to emotional reactions and coping during crises, and to social trust and trust in societal institutions. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis for which collective efforts, such as social distancing, are necessary to stop the spread of the virus. During previous pandemics, people high in trust have typically adhered to such efforts. In the present study, we investigated whether attachment orientations were related to people’s adherence to authorities’ guidelines to stop the spread of COVID-19. We also tested whether previous mediational findings—linking attachment-related avoidance to welfare state trust via social trust—would replicate. We used a web-based survey of 620 participants. Our findings showed that attachment-related anxiety was linked to low adherence to social distancing regulations. This finding was especially noteworthy because high attachment-anxious participants also experienced more negative emotions, yet negative emotions were generally linked to high adherence. Thus, people higher in attachment anxiety seem to have more difficulties in avoiding social situations despite heightened risk of catching and spreading the virus. In addition, attachment-related avoidance was negatively related to adherence and to welfare state trust, and its effects on welfare state trust were statistically mediated by low social trust.

T1  - Resisting Privilege: Effects of a White Privilege Message Intervention and Conservative Media Use on Freedom Threat and Racial Attitudes
AN  - 2662236714
AB  - Identifying ways to effectively communicate about racial/ethnic disparities is a place where communication scholars can make vital contributions. Yet, existing studies on this subject are scarce. Borrowing from reactance theory and the 3D model of White identity management, the present study tested whether exposing White adults to White privilege messaging helps them to become more aware or deny racial privilege. The results of our experiment revealed that there was a main effect for reading about racial privilege and increased awareness of privilege. However, in keeping with reactance theory, if the message stoked a perceived threat to freedom, message exposure resulted in the denial of both blatant and institutional racism. We also found a moderating role for Fox News viewing such that awareness of racial privilege was not affected by the intervention for heavy Fox News viewers, but it was for low Fox News viewers. We conclude that messages focused on explaining White privilege are promising, but there are risks.

T1  - Superwoman Schema: a context for understanding psychological distress among middle-class African American women who perceive racial microaggressions
AN  - 2662234770
AB  - Objective: Current racial mental health disparities among African American women have been attributed to chronic experiences of race-related stressors. Increased exposure to racism in predominately White spaces may increase reliance on culturally normative coping mechanisms. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between psychological distress, perceived racial microaggressions, and an obligation to show strength/suppress emotions among educated, middle-class African American women.Design: A sample of 243 African American women aged 19–72 years (M = 39.49 years) participated in an online study. Participants completed self-report measures of psychological distress (PHQ-8 and GAD-7), racial microaggressions (IMABI), and modified items from the Stereotypical Roles for Black Women (SRBWS) to assess an obligation to show strength/suppress emotions. Factor analyses were conducted to assess the reliability of the obligation to show strength/suppress emotions subscale in our sample. Descriptive statistics, multiple linear regression, and mediation analyses were also conducted to examine variable associations.Results: Statistical analyses revealed educated, middle-class African American women who endorse an obligation to show strength/suppress emotions with perceived racial microaggressions experienced increased psychological distress.Conclusion: Obligation to show strength/suppress emotion may increase risk for psychological distress among African American women who perceive racial microaggressions. Future research and clinical implications are discussed.

T1  - Loneliness and social disconnectedness in the time of pandemic period among Brazilians: evidence from the ELSI COVID-19 initiative
AN  - 2655355356
AB  - Objectives: This study aimed at estimating the pre-pandemic and pandemic prevalence of loneliness and investigating the association of loneliness with social disconnectedness during social distancing strategies in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic period.Methods: We used data from the ELSI COVID-19 initiative with participants from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), which comprised 4,431 participants aged 50 years and over. Loneliness (hardly ever/some of the time/often) was assessed by the question “In the past 30 days, how often did you feel alone/lonely?”. Social disconnectedness included  information on social contacts through virtual talking (i.e. telephone, Skype, WhatsApp, or social media) and outside-home meetings with people living in another household. Covariates included sociodemographic and health related characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence interval (CI).Results: The overall prevalence of loneliness during the pandemic was 23.9% (95% CI 20.7-27.5); lower than in the pre-pandemic period (32.8%; 95% CI 28.6-37.4). In the pandemic period, 20.1% (95% CI 16.9-23.6) reported some of the time feeling lonely and 3.9% (95% CI 3.1-4.8) reported often feeling lonely. In the fully adjusted model, virtual talking disconnectedness (OR=1.67; 95% CI 1.09-2.56) was positively associated with some of the time feeling lonely and outside-home disconnectedness  (OR=0.33; 95% CI 0.18-0.60) was negatively associated with often feeling lonely.Conclusion: Individuals with virtual talking disconnectedness and without outside-home disconnectedness are at higher risk of loneliness during the time of COVID-19 pandemic. Stimulating virtual talking connectedness might have the potential to diminish loneliness despite steep outside-home disconnectedness.

T1  - Urban/Rural Digital Divide Exists in Older Adults: Does It Vary by Racial/Ethnic Groups?
AN  - 2653219974
AB  - Despite the overall increase in older adults’ internet use, the digital divide within older Americans remains substantial, particularly for those in rural areas and with racial/ethnic minority backgrounds. The current study examines how one’s residential area and racial/ethnicity relate to internet access, both singularly and in concert. Data were from the 2016 Health and Retirement Study. The sample consisted of 17,372 Americans aged 50 and above. Logistic regression analyses were performed to test the direct effects of residence and race/ethnicity and their interaction effects on internet use. The odds of internet use were significantly lower for older adults living in suburban and rural residences as well as for Black and Hispanic individuals. Furthermore, rural living reduced the probability of using the internet more for Blacks than Whites. These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions to narrow the digital divide, with particular attention required for older Blacks in rural communities.

T1  - Dealing with declining dominance: White identification and anti-immigrant hostility in the US: GPIR
AN  - 2652815199
AB  - Increasing diversity and the anticipation of its resulting cultural change is raising vociferous protestations among White Americans. Here, we explore moderation and mediation of its intergroup implications. Among a nationally representative sample of White Americans, Study 1 (n = 2,257) revealed that living in a region that experienced a greater (vs. lesser) increase in racial diversity in recent years was associated with more anti-immigrant attitudes, but only among those who were highly White-identified. In an experiment, Study 2 (n = 420, White Americans) revealed that collective nostalgia (i.e., longing for the ingroup’s past) mediated the relation between anticipated cultural change resulting from shifting demographics and anti-immigrant attitudes, but only for those who were highly White-identified. Thus, anti-immigrant sentiment among White Americans in response to changing demographics and culture is seen primarily among those personally invested in their White racial identity, an effect partly explained by a longing for bygone days.

T1  - The populist campaigns against European public service media: Hot air or existential threat?: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2617233388
AB  - Right-wing populists are gaining ground in Western democracies. Surveys show that they often distrust established media and public service media (PSM) in particular, claiming that they are biased against them. This paper examines how they have challenged PSM and proposes some potential responses to these challenges. The paper is based on an analysis of a number of recent and long-standing surveys of public attitudes towards the media, combined with an analysis of support for right-wing populists. It focuses on three purposively sampled national case studies: Austria, Germany and Sweden. We show several commonalities among PSM in these three countries, including similar right-wing populist attacks on PSM. The findings crystallise around two points: First, the impartiality and objectivity of news media has generally become less taken-for-granted in a ‘high-choice’ media environment offering various news products of different quality. Secondly, historical left-right distinctions have become less clear-cut, also because right-wing populists challenge them. Consequently, the role of PSM in creating a shared national conversation which represents the diversity of society has also come under siege. At the same time, partisan websites and social media platforms enable certain groups to showcase content that is more aligned with the perspectives of right-wing populists. The paper concludes by asking if right-wing populists are a growing threat to PSM and whether this threat is isolated or potentially indicative of a broader and more sustained pattern.

La situación crisis mundial ha puesto en vigencia el ambiente problemático en cuanto a políticas-sociales, en un contexto de comunicación global cada vez más complejo. El propósito del trabajo es analizar la comunicación académica al discurso político en torno a Covid-19 en las ciencias políticas. La metodología de la investigación aborda el problema y busca posibles respuestas mediante métodos mixtos; seleccionando artículos académicos desde diversas bases de datos de la Core Collection - Web of Science y Scopus. Como resultado se obtiene de la aplicación de dos software, que el VOSviewer, mediante títulos y resúmenes de 12 artículos, excluyendo etiquetas de estructura y declaraciones de derechos de autor, logró identificar 411 términos, reducidos a 73 con restricción de 2 ocurrencias, donde la coocurrencia de términos se agrupa en 6 clusters; y, con el software Atlati9, se observan etapas emocionales como actitud política negativa, neutral y positiva ante el Covid-19, extraídas de las referencia teóricas analizadas que manejan discursos políticos y comunicación académica, concluyendo que esta última resulta relevante en comparecencias públicas, impactando todos los sectores.Alternate abstract:This document offers an exploratory study of the crisis generated by the coronavirus pandemic (Covid-19), from academic communication to political discourse.

T1  - “My friends keep me woke about these things”: how college students experience and engage with police use of force content on social media
AN  - 2659839157
AB  - This study explores retrospective social media experiences of college students from the St. Louis area and their level of engagement with content on police use of force, using qualitative semi-structured interviews (N = 32). Participants were asked about their online experiences with content showing the police use of force, the extent of their engagement with the content, and the types of police force they approve of. The study revealed that most participants who use social media experienced emotions of sadness, anger, and frustration when they observed the police use of force online, making them question police legitimacy. Although a majority of participants acknowledged police use of force news on social media helped them form opinions about law enforcement, only a small portion chose to share this content on their social media platforms. This is possibly due to the fear of negative backlash and/or employment and other opportunities they may be denied. Use of force approval rationales also varied by race when participants imagined hypothetical instances. The findings have implications for theories of media and race relations.

T1  - Case Study: Decolonising the Curriculum – An Exemplification
AN  - 2610018074
AB  - Coventry University has made a strategic commitment to address the dimension of ‘race’ in its learning and teaching. Central to this is the establishment of a cross-institution curriculum change initiative called ‘Curriculum 2025’. The case study shared here details how we are approaching this task and some early reflections. Two things are explained: first, the provision of resources for staff who want to learn more about possible actions to take; second, our approach to working alongside course teams on new materials, often designed as reusable learning objects. An example of such a learning object is discussed which uses Wikipedia to enable students from diverse backgrounds to examine critically academic texts, books and other resources to understand how their learning may be skewed in favour of Western-originated thought and to identify alternative perspectives. The student activity also provides a co-creation opportunity, in that students are discovering the curriculum for themselves.

T1  - White parents’ racial socialization and young adults’ racial attitudes: Moral reasoning and motivation to respond without prejudice as mediators: GPIR
AN  - 2609042692
AB  - This study examined relations between parental racial socialization messages (i.e., egalitarianism, racemute, and preparation for bias) and racial attitudes in a sample of 282 White young adults (ages 18–22) in the United States. Egalitarianism messages were positively related to warmth toward racial outgroup members, whereas preparation for bias was negatively related to warmth toward racial outgroup members. In both cases the relation between racial socialization and racial attitudes was mediated by internal motivation to respond without prejudice and fairness/reciprocity moral orientation. Contrary to our expectations, racemute socialization messages were not directly related to participants’ warmth toward racial outgroup members. However, racemute socialization predicted internal motivation to respond without prejudice and fairness/reciprocity moral orientation, which in turn predicted outgroup warmth. These findings suggest possible mechanisms by which parents’ messages about race and racism may shape youths’ racial attitudes.

T1  - The evolution of the shared societies concept: The theoretical concept's application in practice
AN  - 2604756406
AB  - The concept of a Shared Society emerged around 2007. The paper describes the evolution of the concept from a statement of intent and a rallying call to mobilize interest, then a framework for exploring the costs of social exclusion and how to overcome them, until today it is a coherent analytical framework which can guide practice and evaluation. It considers the ways in which the Concept differs from other approaches to overcoming social divisions, and in particular the distinctive nature of the relationship between the society and the people living in it. Consideration is given to the usefulness of the Concept and how it can guide the policy process from development through implementation to monitoring and finally evaluation, to ensure progress towards a society that works for all and overcomes division and conflict.

T1  - The ‘Scots porridge case’ of 1969: bogus discrimination, the loony state and the white backlash archive
AN  - 2673745297
AB  - In November 1969, a quite odd and ludicrous case of alleged discrimination was blown out of all proportion, perhaps wilfully, by Conservative politicians and the media in Britain, some eighteen months after Enoch Powell’s Birmingham speech. A quite high-profile issue at the time, the case has now been completely forgotten. Yet, Esteves’s article suggests that the event itself is helpful to make better sense of the British—rather than merely English—ramifications of debates on race relations and discrimination, particularly at a time of an upsurge in Scottish nationalism. More importantly, the case partakes of what Esteves calls the ‘white backlash archive’, a populist and popular repertoire that nativists—not only in Britain—draw from in order to underline that the state is inefficient and counter-productive when it tries to legislate against discrimination, as well as that ethnic minorities and immigrants get undue protection from the state authorities, even though the 1969 case itself had nothing to do with ethnic minorities or immigration.

T1  - Youth and the COVID-19 crisis: Lessons learned from a human rights-based prevention programme for youths in São Paulo, Brazil
AN  - 2557935457
AB  - Youths living in crowded impoverished urban areas face higher risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2. This article presents lessons learned from a preventive intervention project intersected by the COVID-19 crisis that moved from a mix-methods study design to online ethnography. The ‘home-officed’ research team e-witnessed high-school students’ daily lives and collaborated in youths’ and community-based organisations’ responses in the territories where they study and live. Psychosocial distress increased, also driven by the disastrous governmental response to the health and economic crises. There was growing anxiety about meeting friends and dating, with structural limits for sustaining the recommended social distancing, which added to gender/sexuality-based violence. Simultaneously, we observed students becoming relevant actors through co-producing preventive practices, surpassing risk-group notions and combining SARS-CoV-2 prevention with sexuality, gender, racism and mental-health issues. They managed internet-mediated applications to promote critical thinking and collective actions aimed at health promotion among their peers, from their homes. Freire’s concept of ‘untested-feasibility’ fostered researchers’, students’ and community leaders’ imaginations in the face of this unprecedented crisis, thereby enhancing social responses to the epidemic to become rights-based comprehensive dialogical preventive activities. This ongoing intervention-research stresses how prevention sciences can go beyond reduction of this pandemic to a viral event.

T1  - Loneliness and Its Association With Social Media Use During the COVID-19 Outbreak
AN  - 2583827467
AB  - Social distancing rules during the COVID-19 pandemic changed social interaction for many and increased the risk of loneliness in the general population. Social media use has been ambiguously related to loneliness, and associations may differ by age. The study aimed to examine loneliness and its association with social media use within different age groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia during April/May 2020, and 3,810 participants aged 18 years or above were recruited. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between social media use and social and emotional loneliness within separate age groups. Emotional loneliness was higher among young adults and among those who used social media several times daily. Adjusting by sociodemographic variables, using more types of social media was associated with lower social loneliness among the oldest participants, and with higher emotional loneliness among the youngest participants. Among middle-aged participants, using social media more frequently was associated with lower social loneliness. We found that the associations between social media use and loneliness varied by age. Older people’s engagement on social media may be a resource to reduce loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed higher levels of loneliness among high-frequent social media users of younger age.

T1  - How Black Teen Girls Navigate Social Media to Form Romantic Relationships
AN  - 2583827263
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the use of social media within the context of heterosexual Black teen girls’ romantic partner selection processes. To better understand Black teen girls’ experiences, five focus groups (N = 27; aged 14–18 years) were conducted over Zoom. An inductive thematic analysis revealed four major themes: (1) the use of different platforms to gather different types of information, (2) the rules of social media scouting, (3) detecting partner qualities through social media, and (4) exploring Black teen girls’ experience with social media and dating. Participants in our study primarily used Instagram to understand a potential partner’s true self, while Twitter was used to assess a potential partner’s political leanings. Our participants shared numerous “rules” related to the partner-scouting process. Black teen girls in our study explained that photos index a potential partner’s style and hygiene, while memes were used to gauge sense of humor compatibility. More specific to Black teen girls, across all focus groups, participants shared their experiences of racism and bias, such as being associated with Black stereotypes, cultural invalidation, and being accused of “acting White.” Although teen girls of various racial and ethnic groups may use social media to vet romantic partners, findings reveal that Black teen girls navigate social media in a unique way, including being highly attuned to signs of bias. Our findings suggest that in the first few months of COVID-19 social distancing had little impact on our participant’s practice of using social media to vet potential romantic partners.

T1  - Heterogeneity in preventive behaviors during COVID-19: Health risk, economic insecurity, and slanted information
AN  - 2561104770
AB  - The present study examines whether people respond heterogeneously to statewide social distancing mandates as a function of factors that proxy for health risk, economic insecurity, and media consumption. Using longitudinal data of 7400 American adults between March 10 and June 23, 2020, the study examines social-distancing and mask-wearing behaviors. We use a staggered difference-in-difference model to explore whether state policies lead to preventive behaviors. We further examine heterogeneity in individual responses to state mandates by including interaction terms with health risk, economic insecurity, and media consumption. The study finds that state policies lead to increased adoption of these behaviors. Our findings also suggest that old age and living with the elderly are key predictors of preventive behavior adoption in the presence or even absence of state mandates. However, the economically insecure, such as the unemployed, those with low incomes and net worth, or without health insurance, are less likely to adopt preventive behaviors regardless of the mandates. The adoption of the behaviors is also polarized between CNN users and Fox News/Social Media users, with greater compliance by the former.

T1  - “Scrounger-bashing” as national pastime: the prevalence and ferocity of anti-welfare ideology on niche-interest online forums
AN  - 2540620967
AB  - Recent research has noted the persistence of a long continuum of “anti-welfare” discourses that are increasingly embedded in the UK news media, political communication, and popular culture (e.g. Golding and Middleton 1982. Images of Welfare: Press and Public Attitudes to Poverty. Oxford: Mark Robertson; Jensen 2014. “Welfare Commonsense, Poverty Porn and Doxosophy.” Sociological Research Online 19 (3): 277–283; Morrison 2019. Scroungers: Moral Panics and Media Myths. London: Zed Books). Historical distinctions between the “deserving” and “undeserving poor” have been sharpened by successive governments in the service of varying shades of neoliberal governance. While Margaret Thatcher castigated “shirkers” in fostering an ideology of economic self-reliance, both New Labour and the Coalition obsessed over “welfare reform”: promoting an ideology of “work” in symbolic opposition to supposed cultures of “worklessness”. But, while “scroungerphobia” (Deacon 1978. “The Scrounging Controversy: Public Attitudes Towards the Unemployed in Contemporary Britain.” Social Policy and Administration 12 (2): 120–135) is now a widely recognised sociological phenomenon, scholarly attention to the concept has largely been reserved for its manifestation in tabloid newspapers, political rhetoric and, latterly, “poverty porn” television. Even recent work considering the public’s contribution to scrounger discourse(s) on social media focuses on mainstream platforms, such as Twitter and newspaper comment threads (e.g. Van Der Bom et al. 2018. “‘It’s not the Fact They Claim Benefits but Their Useless, Lazy, Drug Taking Lifestyles we Despise’: Analysing Audience Responses to Benefits Street Using Live Tweets.” Discourse, Context & Media 21: 36–45; Morrison 2019. Scroungers: Moral Panics and Media Myths. London: Zed Books; Paterson 2020). This paper begins to address this oversight, by examining how normative anti-welfare discourses infiltrate everyday communication in more disparate online communities – including niche consumer forums. It draws on previously unpublished findings from an analysis of welfare-related conversations in these and other spaces at the height of a recent moral panic over “scroungers”: the period from 2013-2016, when Conservative-led governments strove to legitimise sweeping benefit cuts and punitive “welfare reform”.

T1  - Black lives matter in the sports world
AN  - 2518072929
AB  - This issue explores the relationship between sports and BLM specifically and racial, gender and ethnic discrimination or challenges more generally. The contributors build from and extend the burgeoning academic scholarship on race, sport, and activism over the past decade, and ask critical questions about the current and future status of promoting racial justice within and through sport (Agyemang and Singer 2014; Coombs and Cassilo 2017; Darnell 2012; Evans et al. 2020; Gill 2016; Hylton 2020; Schmittel and Sanderson 2015). While debates around race relations in sport are not new, they have a renewed urgency and intensity due to BLM and the COVID-19 pandemic, shining a light on continued inequities and injustices in sport and society. Questions remain about how various actors within sport are responding to BLM. Debates about the efficacy of athlete activism, corporate messaging, league actions to redress racism, and media coverage continue. Indeed, they have extended internationally as individual athletes, governing bodies, clubs and teams around the world integrated BLM protests during the spring and summer of 2020 to show solidarity against structural racism.

T1  - MEDIA FRAMING ON MUSLIMS AND ISLAM IN CHRISTCHURCH MOSQUE ATTACK: A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF THE PRESS AND NEW YORK TIMES ONLINE NEWS
AN  - 2563492558
AB  - For decades, and particularly since September 11 attacks, media framing of Muslims as terrorists was persistent. Considerable studies showed that Western media framed Islam and Muslims as the major terrorism posing threat to Western society. Islam is depicted as a monolithic and homogenized religion whereas Muslims are uncivilized and inhuman religious maniacs. News coverage on terrorism, which involved Muslims as the perpetrator, heightened the fear culture for Muslims and Islam, eventuate the rise of "Islamophobia". The media portrayed perpetrators of Muslims as terrorists who clashed the Western civilization and threatened public security as a whole. However, the recent Christchurch mosque attack that happened on 15 March 2019 in New Zealand, killed more than 50 Muslims by a local extremist, turned Muslims into terrorism victims. Despite abundant studies criticising Islamophobic representations of Muslims in Western media, there is scant literature examining the coverage of terrorism act where perpetrators are non- Muslims and victims are Muslims. Therefore, it is interesting to scrutinize how Islam and Muslims were framed in two influential online news sites, The Press and New York Times, where Muslims appeared to be the victims of the attack. By using framing analysis as the theoretical framework, this study examined the news themes covered in portraying Muslim victims and Islam for the incident. The finding determined how media framing of Muslim victims and Islam in the Christchurch mosque attack transformed the media event into international mourning in a climate of counter-Islamophobia.

T1  - Everything is inside the home: the boundaries of home confinement during the Italian lockdown
AN  - 2492788634
AB  - This article investigates the ways in which social distancing and home confinement restrictions have been experienced and perceived in the Italian socio-cultural context, in order to assess how they reshaped everyday life, and which are their social implications. Drawing on 60 in-depth semi-structured interviews, this article sheds light on the sense-making processes and the construction of inter-subjective meaning around home confinement and social distancing that emerged during the lockdown. Results support that during the national quarantine individuals had to reframe everyday practices, thereby redefining the boundaries of their experience. Indeed, individuals had to deal with a lack of personal spaces, a following stress overload and a collapse of the typical boundaries between the professional and private sphere, which required a complex management of everyday activities. Implications of these preliminary findings are discussed, as well as suggestions for future research.

AN  - 2488192329
AB  - During the COVID-19 crisis, living in lockdown and observing social distancing rules have become an integral part of everyday life. In this article, I offer some auto-ethnographic reflections on the increased use of ICTs within families and particularly across generations. Using vignettes relating to communication with my one-year-old granddaughter and my 92-year-old mother, I consider what it means to have the haptic dimensions of kinship relations stripped out and replaced by technologically mediated connection. By way of conclusion, I consider the relationship between the ‘magic’ of ICTs in interpersonal communication on the one hand and Marshall Sahlins’ notion of mutuality on the other.

T1  - THE PARADOX OF DISPARAGEMENT HUMOR: AN ANALYSIS OF WHATSAPP JOKES ON WOMEN IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
AN  - 2477274165
AB  - This qualitative theoretical paper hinges on literature and content analysis on the paradox of disparagement humor evoked by WhatsApp jokes that target women and are related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper employs the functionalist and feminist theory of mass media and the justification suppression model of prejudice as the bedrock to the debate and analysis. Although humor helps us to cope with pandemics, the paper finds several jokes on COVID-19 departing from this function and promoting dysfunctions such as humiliation and social exclusion of women. Inferences are made that such jokes that are derogatory and denigrating can elicit feelings of self-doubt and reduced physical and intellectual performance of women. The researcher advocates for assertive media polices and reforms that promote gender equality and freedom for all.

T1  - Education and Ignorance: Between the Noun of Knowledge and the Verb of Thinking
AN  - 2539892099
AB  - In this paper we look at the relations between knowledge and thinking through the lens of ignorance. In relation to knowledge, ignorance becomes its “constitutive outside,” and as such it may be politically organised in order to delimit the borders of the right to knowledge [the “ignorance economy,” see Roberts and Armitage (Prometheus 26 (4): 335–354, 2008)]. In this light, the notion of a knowledge-based society should be understood as a society structured along the lines of knowledge distribution: the rights of possession of and access to knowledge demand that ignorance is planned and executed as the condition of their establishment. In relation to thinking, ignorance appears differently. According to Rancière, the teacher's ignorance conditions the student's appearance as Anthropos, a being who can be asked: what do you think about it? Hence, we are dealing with the ambiguity of ignorance which seems to be both the criterion of social exclusion, and the condition of emancipation. Following this thread with reference to Heidegger's discourse on thinking, we would like to explore the possibility of comprehending knowledge and education beyond the relations of ownership and demands of productivity. Following Rancière, we may say that thinking—as displacing the notion of ignorance—stands in the position of “politics” and questions the ways knowledge societies are structured as “police orders” along the lines of knowledge possession and exclusion.

T1  - Resisting media marginalisation: Black women’s digital content and collectivity
AN  - 2442574342
AB  - Based on analysis of 23 interviews, this paper examines how social media and online content is implicated in the collective, resistant and transnational media experiences of Black women in Britain. It contributes to scholarship concerning race and the virtual marketplace by examining tensions between the countercultural, communal and commercial qualities of Black women’s online experiences. Drawing upon theorising of the oppositional spectator gaze of Black women, and narratives of technology consumption, we unpack how Black women’s digital activity can enable them to navigate the hegemony of US content, their marginalisation in British mass-media, and situate them within a Black experience that transcends Britain’s borders. Our work illustrates how Black women’s online encounters can be a source of resistance, Black digital commentary and community, as well as being subject to corporate co-optation. We conceptualise such online experiences as being shaped by transnational dimensions of the relationship between race, media and markets.

T1  - Perceived Incentives and Barriers to Social Participation: The Case of Older Adults Living Alone in Lithuania
AN  - 2451163015
AB  - Social (non)participation is one of the key elements associated with social exclusion in old age. Scholarship about this topic tends to rely mainly on quantitative research from Western and Northern European countries. The aim of this article, based on qualitative interviews with older people (N=27) in Lithuania, is to give some insight into how older people in an Eastern European country experience social participation, and the reasons they offer for abstaining from engaging in it. Findings are contradictory: social participation is valued by older people for both direct and indirect reasons (e.g. a desire to simply be among people), but they hesitate to participate for a variety of reasons. The article contributes to the academic discussion by providing insights into older people’s perspectives about social participation, their preferences, and, in particular, the backdrop that particular organizations (such as the church) can play in promoting social participation and consequently strengthening the social inclusion of older adults in post-communist countries.

T1  - Valorization of an ‘Enemy Language’: Politics of ‘Progressive Anti-War’ Position and English-Worship in the Japanese TV Show <i>Massan</i>
AN  - 2440456019
AB  - This article analyzes portrayals of English in Japan during World War II in Massan, a Japanese television show that features the life of a mixed-race bilingual couple, Masaharu (the Japanese husband) and Ellie (the Scottish wife), and their adopted Japanese daughter (Ema) living in Japan. I argue that the show constructs a hierarchy of languages where English is valorized as a sign of an anti-war position, speaking one’s mind and material wealth, all framed as progressive, in contrast to Japanese language. As the use of language is connected to race relations in the drama, this hierarchisation of English and Japanese languages is consistent with the historical and current valorization of English and whiteness in Japan. However, this hierarchy contradicts the show’s explicit message of inclusiveness of all races. This article analyses a set of performative messages conveyed by this highly popular drama in the current Japanese political and racial context to show the ways uses of language convey unarticulated and sometimes contradictory messages.

T1  - How does social capital affect individual health among the elderly in rural China?—Mediating effect analysis of physical exercise and positive attitude
AN  - 2427510977
AB  - Background 
The elderly in rural areas comprise over half of the older population in China, and their health problems are a matter of great concern for the Chinese government and society. Among the many factors affecting health, social capital has generated much interest in academic research. Exploring the relationship between social capital and individual health among the elderly in rural China provides ways to improve the health of Chinese people, which has a positive impact on policy.
 Methods 
We selected 3719 respondents from the 2016 China Family Panel Studies (CFPS). Structural and cognitive social capital were obtained via exponentiation of variables (mean of zero and a standard deviation of one) and by giving them equal weight. Ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage least squares (2SLS) estimators were used to analyze the association between social capital and individual health. We explored the mechanism linking structural and cognitive social capital with individual health through a mediation effect analysis.
 Results 
After correcting for endogeneity bias, structural social capital had a positive correlation with individual health among the elderly, with a coefficient of 0.062 (95% CI: 0.020-0.104). Cognitive social capital also had a positive correlation with individual health, with a coefficient of 0.097 (95% CI: 0.060-0.135). Physical exercise and positive attitude were two significant mediating variables of the relationship between social capital and individual health in the study group, with mediating effects of 0.018 and 0.054, respectively.
 Conclusions 
Cognitive social capital played a stronger role than structural social capital in promoting individual health among the elderly. Physical exercise and positive attitude mediated the relationship between social capital and individual health. Policymakers should not only build basic medical and health care systems but also consistently cultivate and strengthen structural and cognitive social capital among the elderly in rural China.

T1  - Racialized differences in perceptions of and emotional responses to police killings of unarmed African Americans
AN  - 2571095479
AB  - Widespread attention to, and mobilization against, police killings of unarmed African Americans shatter any lingering myths of a post-racial America. We argue that the entrenched racial divide in the lived experiences and perceptions of whites and African Americans is mediated by emotions. Continuing research about the perceptions of and emotions attached to political events by people of different races, we draw on an embedded experiment. We contend that stories about police killings will elicit distinct emotions from whites and African Americans. The experiment varies the race of a victim of a police-involved shooting as well as whether the victim was suspected of criminality. We find that the majority of respondents express disappointment without regard to condition and that African Americans are more likely than whites to express anger as an emotional response. We see in-group/out-group psychological tendencies, with whites who read about a white victim (regardless of criminality) more likely to recommend criminal charges for the officer versus those who received a black victim. The findings highlight how identity moderates the connection between emotions and politics while also contributing to our understanding of race relations today.

T1  - Race and policing in the 2016 presidential election: Black lives matter, the police, and dog whistle politics
AN  - 2400926654
AB  - A series of deaths of Black Americans at the hands of the police sparked mass protests, received extensive media coverage, and fueled a new civil rights movement in the years leading up to the 2016 presidential election. Both major party nominees campaigned on issues of race and policing in different ways. Drawing on colorblind racism theories and the history of law‐and‐order politics, we explore how views of race relations and the police were associated with voting behavior. We ask, on the one hand, whether people were engaged with the civil rights issues raised by Black Lives Matter and, on the other hand, whether Trump's expressions of support for the police functioned as a racial “dog whistle” to mobilize a particular set of voters. Using the 2016 American National Election Studies (ANES) Time Series Study, we find that concern about biased policing and support for the civil rights movement seeking to address it were associated with increased turnout among Democrats and more votes for Clinton. In addition, consistent with a dog whistle effect, claims of supporting the police were connected to votes for Trump mainly among those with high levels of racial resentment. We conclude by discussing the symbolic role of police in American society and politics.

T1  - Migrant categorizations and European public opinion: diverging attitudes towards immigrants and refugees
AN  - 2400029060
AB  - In recent years, European media and public discourse have been increasingly categorising newcomers using terminology like ‘immigrants’ and ‘refugees’. The aim of this practice is to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate newcomers in the wake of the 2015 ‘refugee crisis’ in Europe. Drawing on data from an online survey in Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Sweden (n = 6000) in September and October of 2017, this article investigates how the use of these categories relates to public opinion on ‘immigrants’ and ‘refugees’. Findings show that people hold more positive attitudes towards ‘refugees’ than towards ‘immigrants’, a process which is likely driven by media framing. Attitude discrepancies within ‘immigrant’ and ‘refugee’ categories are also investigated, as categorical fetishism causes further differentiation of attitudes within these groups. Public opinion differences within ‘immigrants’ and ‘refugees’ are found along three cleavages: ethnicity, the economic situation of the origin country, and region of origin. Newcomers with the same ethnicity (vs. a different ethnicity), from ‘rich’ countries (vs. ‘poor’ countries), and from European countries (vs. non-European countries) are preferred in both categories. With these findings, this article reveals important aspects of the influence of migrant categorizations on public opinion towards vulnerable groups of newcomers.

T1  - БІДНІСТЬ СІЛЬСЬКИХ ДІТЕЙ В УКРАЇНІ
TT  - POVERTY OF RURAL CHILDREN IN UKRAINE
AN  - 2453915011
AB  - Метою статті є виявлення і дослідження особливостей монетарної і немонетарної бідності сільських дітей, а також їх соціального відторгнення. Новизною роботи є доведення факту, що сільські діти перебувають у суттєво гіршому становищі, порівняно з міськими, не стільки за монетарною бідністю, скільки за позбавленнями, і що для вирішення цієї проблеми недостатньо лише зростання доходів у домогосподарствах сіл. Для дослідження бідності сільських дітей в Україні застосовано спеціальні і загальнонаукові методи: аналіз і синтез, статистичний метод, метод графічного аналізу, аналіз бази даних. Виявлено, що родини, які проживають у різних типах місцевості, мають різні можливості щодо забезпечення достатку і розвитку дітей. Низькі доходи частково визначають високий рівень бідності як за відносним критерієм, так і за фактичним прожитковим мінімумом за витратами сімей з дітьми в сільській місцевості. Визначено, що сім'ї з дітьми сільської місцевості загалом у структурі витрат більше витрачають на продукти, хоча це суттєво менші суми, ніж у містах. Визначено, що монетарна бідність не завжди є основною проблемою сільських родин з дітьми, оскільки суттєво посилюється немонетарною бідністю. Сільські родини з дітьми мають більші позбавлення в житлових умовах. В сільській місцевості вища частка дітей, які взагалі не склали зовнішнє незалежне оцінювання, не мають доступу до дистанційної освіти через низьку якість інтернет-зв'язку, а часом і його відсутність. Сільські діти більшою мірою позбавлені можливості оздоровлення, вони менше бувають на морі чи відпочивають у санаторіях і дитячих таборах. Проблемою є і позбавлення у доступі до медичних послуг. Окрім монетарної і немонетарної бідності в дуже малих селах існує проблема із соціальним відторгненням дітей. Більшість матеріальних проблем сімей з дітьми в сільській місцевості можна вирішити насамперед покращенням зайнятості населення, і, що не менш важливо, її диверсифікацією. Значний поштовх до поліпшення рівня життя сімей з дітьми, а також зниження соціального відчуження дітей має дати ремонт наявних і будівництво нових доріг, покращення транспортного сполучення.Alternate abstract:Th e purpose of the article is to identify and study the features of monetary and non-monetary poverty of rural children and their social exclusion. Th e novelty of the work is that it is shown that rural children are in a much worse position than urban children, not so much in monetary poverty as in deprivation, and that increasing incomes in rural families with children will not solve this problemTo study the poverty of rural children in Ukraine, special and general scientifi c methods were used: analysis and synthesis, statistical method, method of graphic analysis, database analysis. It was found that families living in diff erent types of areas have diff erent opportunities to ensure the well-being and development of children. Low incomes partly determine the high level of poverty in both relative and absolute terms in families with children in rural areas. It has been determined that families with rural children generally spend more on food in the cost structure, although this is signifi cantly less in monetary terms than in cities. It is determined that monetary poverty is not always the main problem of rural families with children, as it is signifi cantly exacerbated by non-monetary poverty. Rural families with children have greater deprivation in living conditions. In rural areas, the highest proportion of children did not pass the external independent evaluation. Rural children do not have access to distance education due to the low quality of Internet communication, and sometimes there is no Internet connection.Rural children are largely deprived of health opportunities, they rarely visit the sea or rest in sanatoriums and children's camps. Deprivation of access to medical services is a problem. In addition to monetary and non-monetary poverty, there is a problem of social exclusion of children in very small villages. Most of the fi nancial problems of families with children in rural areas can be solved primarily by improving the employment rate and diversifying employment. A signifi cant impetus in improving the living standards of families with children and reducing the social exclusion of children themselves is the repair and construction of roads, improving transport links.

T1  - Doing nothing does something: Embodiment and data in the COVID-19 pandemic
AN  - 2429074179
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic redefines how we think about the body, physiologically and socially. But what does it mean to have and to be a body in the COVID-19 pandemic? The COVID-19 pandemic offers data scholars the unique opportunity, and perhaps obligation, to revisit and reinvent the fundamental concepts of our mediated experiences. The article critiques the data double, a longstanding concept in critical data and media studies, as incompatible with the current public health and social distancing imperative. The data double, instead, is now the presupposition of a new data entity, which will emerge out of a current data shimmer: a long-sustaining transition that blurs the older boundaries of bodies and the social, and establishes new ethical boundaries around the (in)activity and (im)mobility of doing nothing to do something. The data double faces a unique dynamic in the COVID-19 pandemic between boredom and exhaustion. Following the currently simple rule to stay home presents data scholars the opportunity to revisit the meaning of data as something given, a shimmering embodied relationship with data that contributes to the common good in a global health crisis.

T1  - The process to rapprochement between Vietnam and its diaspora in the United States
AN  - 2318469669
AB  - Despite the lingering conflict between the government of Vietnam and the Vietnamese diaspora in the United States, issues of remittance and relationship relaxation between the refugees and Vietnamese government happened both in the 1990s. Recent years have seen the attitude-change of the returning diaspora and their shifting strategies of working in Vietnam. This paper describes the first step toward rapprochement between Vietnam and its diaspora in the United States, by analysing the attempts of Vietnam to approach its diaspora in the United States and the reactions of the diasporic community members. On the other hand, it also describes the efforts of Vietnamese Americans to empower Vietnamese people through philanthropic and civic engagement activities. The rapprochement via media and civic engagement reveals a shift from hard, intense ideological conflict to soft tactics in the transnational relation between Vietnam and the Vietnamese diaspora in the United States. This paper concludes that the process to rapprochement is still challenged by the significant differences in political views between the two sides. It suggests that the process of negotiation and conflict resolution be conducted with openness, honesty and acceptance of differences.

T1  - Roil Britannia! Al Sharpton, the British Press, and the 1991 Murder of Rolan Adams
AN  - 2454089544
AB  - Drawing on archival material from the Black Cultural Archives, the British Library, and the Institute of Race Relations, this article sheds fresh light on a largely overlooked 1991 visit to Britain by controversial Black American preacher Al Sharpton following the racist murder of Black teenager Rolan Adams. The extraordinary response to Sharpton’s arrival by the British mainstream press revealed racist patterns of news reporting and a chauvinistic rejection of ‘outside agitators’, while the minister’s intervention drew a mixed response from local activists. However, the furore sparked by Sharpton’s visit also helped to raise public awareness of Adams’ murder and galvanise local Black communities, providing an important insight into anti-racist organising and British media coverage of high-profile racist incidents prior to the death of Stephen Lawrence.

T1  - After Marginalization: Pixelization, Disability, and Social Difference in Digital Russia
AN  - 2296043517
AB  - Contemporary social thought frequently posits sociopolitical exclusion as marginalization. This article argues that marginalization relies on a spatial metaphor that conceptualizes social exclusion as always already configured in relation to center and periphery. Suggesting that this reliance on marginalization as a way of understanding sociopolitical exclusion limits political thought, this article calls for a renewed attention to actual material configurations of social exclusion. Considering ethnographic research with adults with mobility and speech disabilities in Petrozavodsk, Russia, and representation of disability in contemporary Russian film, the concept of marginalization is demonstrated to be insufficient to analyze the actual spatial segregation of people with disabilities in contemporary Russia in the digital era. The spatial metaphor of marginalization fails to describe the way that interlocutors with mobility impairments are at once segregated and included in sociopolitical life in the digital era, when civic life unfolds in cyberspace. Drawing on ethnographic interviews and observation, this article proposes pixelization as a descriptor of the specific spatial pattern of sociopolitical exclusion of people with mobility and speech impairments in Petrozavodsk, characterized by material segregation in family apartments combined with intricate enabling connection to various publics via digital networks. Spatial metaphors for social difference matter for the kinds of alternate presents and futures that might be envisioned, challenging the presumption that ableism’s power comes from limiting political participation in public space defined by a liberal democratic agora.

T1  - Inglorious glorification and attachment: National and European identities as predictors of anti‐ and pro‐immigrant attitudes
AN  - 2265597203
AB  - Anti‐immigrant attitudes are not only widespread among Eurosceptic nationalists, but also among people who feel that immigration threatens European values and identity. We therefore assumed that the connection between nationalism and xenophobia can only partially explain the rise of hostile attitudes in the post‐2015 period. In two online surveys (N = 1,160), we compared how (a) glorification versus attachment and (b) national versus European identity can predict anti‐immigrant and anti‐Muslim attitudes in Hungary. In the first study, national and European glorification predicted higher anti‐immigrant and anti‐Muslim prejudice. However, attachment with Europe predicted positive, while attachment with Hungary predicted negative attitudes towards immigrants. We replicated this pattern in a second study and found that the different predictions of national versus European identities were mediated by attitudes towards the EU. Eurosceptic attitudes were associated with increased hostility towards both immigrants and Muslim people and reflected a perceived contradiction between the interest of the nation and that of the EU. We conclude that for a better understanding of intergroup hostility towards Muslim immigrants in Europe, we need to simultaneously consider the psychological phenomenon of ingroup glorification and the values and norms of the social categories with which people identify.

T1  - Race, National Identity, and Responses to Muhammad Ali in 1960s Britain
AN  - 2320921195
AB  - Muhammad Ali fought in the UK three times in the 1960s, each time to the accompaniment of significant media coverage that made him into a public figure. On his first fight in 1963, his unusual personality both delighted and reviled. Many of the criticisms were rooted in a dislike of American culture but beneath them were also racial stereotypes that encouraged a view of him as brash and immature. By his second and third fights in 1966, he was a deeply controversial figure in the USA because of his conversion to Islam and opposition to the Vietnam War. Yet neither issue had the same significance in the UK and his British fan base grew, despite the way he also reminded some of the danger that British racial tensions might escalate in the way they had in America. Ali was also an inspiration to Britons of colour and those who believed in the need for radical challenges to the world's problems. As such, he is an example of how ideas, fears and hopes around race relations were transnational and the need for its British historians to ensure their accounts are de-domesticised.

AB  - ObjectivesThe objective of the current study is to examine the determinants of wage floors set by state governments in the United States, with a particular focus on the effects of income inequality and ethnic diversity.MethodWe estimate the effects of income inequality, ethnic diversity, and their interaction on real state minimum wages using a state‐level panel of Census demographic data from 1981 to 2010. We also control for state‐level demographics and additional state‐level information, such as measures of voter and government liberalism, along with time and state fixed effects.ResultsWe find that the impact of income inequality is mediated by ethnic diversity. When states are highly ethnically homogeneous, increases in income inequality are associated with higher state minimum wages. When states are highly ethnically heterogeneous, increases in income inequality are associated with lower state minimum wages. The impact of income inequality lacks statistical significance when levels of ethnic diversity are either average or somewhat below average.ConclusionsOverall, our results suggest that the negative impact on state minimum wages in heterogeneous states could stem from rising income inequality, which increases the social distance between whites and other ethnic groups and weakens mass support for wage policies that are believed by the public to be beneficial to the poor.

T1  - Decolonizing a Discipline: Rethinking Sociology in a Changing World
AN  - 2209247711
AB  - In the past decade, we have witnessed increasing reports of institutional and interpersonal violence against bodies of color across the nation. There have been many suggestions on why this has continued to occur. Some have argued that fear of change-where immigrant and minority populations supposedly overwhelm the inhabitants of average, "nice" communities-has increased anxieties that contribute to volatile race relations. Another popular narrative uses significant political milestones-like the election of a black president- to argue that racism is over (or overplayed) and that overly sensitive people actually are contributing to racism by talking about its presumably fake existence. In other versions of this color-blind racist ideology, accidental or mere coincidences unrelated to race ("this could have been avoided if they were just more polite") or a call for us to rally together as a nation ("Put that far-way past behind you and choose to live in the present"). There are so many flavors of color-blind racism that it is sometimes hard to distinguish its tastes as over racial inequities like when police violence or traumatic scenes of discrimination are circulated in throughout the media. These inequalities, which are made visceral as we watch Brown and black bodies be murdered and again as many of their murderers are set free with excuses that make little to no sense, are vibrant, distressing, and gripping. Yet, even in these moments, those using pseudoscience or individualistic arguments continue to claim that racialized inequality does not exist in ways that should be thought of as significant, systemic, or even newsworthy.

T1  - Unfolding the pattern of contentious participation in Taiwan
AN  - 2216895771
AB  - Global violent revolts against both democratic and non-democratic regimes have caught the attention of governments and academia (Tilly and Tarrow, 2015). On December 17, 2010, the self-immolation of Mohammed Bouazizi, a Tunisian street vendor, sparked countrywide protests against the injustices of the local police. Scenes of protest played out again and again in Algeria, Oman, Yemen, Egypt, Syria, and Morocco. The wave of uprisings spread upwards into Europe. Mass protests erupted in London and Stockholm in 2011 and 2013, respectively. While deprivation and poverty could be the key causes of these riots, still other possible factors could lead to contentious activities. In South America, research suggests that economic slumps and corruption were the key reasons why Venezuela, Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador and French Guiana all faced large demonstrations. On August 9, 2014, in Ferguson, Missouri, an 18-year-old African American youth was fatally shot by a white police officer. The death of Michael Brown instigated a certain amount of street violence, while the Black Lives Matter movement has since organized a handful of national and local protests. Looting and vandalism occurred at the same time. In Asia, laborers and students gathered in South Korea's major cities on August 23, 2013, protesting an election manipulation scandal that erupted in the 2012 presidential election. In 2015, Koreans protested the National Intelligence Service's (NIS) attempt to sway public opinion ahead of the presidential election out of fear that these kinds of abuses of power would happen again. From mid-September to mid-December 2014, students in Hong Kong led a series of sit-in street strikes pressing Beijing to adopt universal suffrage in the 2017 Chief Executive election. This galvanization of political activism among youth has been widely noticed. These widespread movements across Europe, Africa, America, and Asia pose challenges for democracy and globalization. To explain the underlying causes of individual activism, scholars have tapped into the literature on political participation and democratization. While economic grievances may account for high participation in the Arab Spring (Beissinger et al., 2015), online mobilization could be a key reason why millennials and the younger generation have partaken so much in recent social movements (Chen et al., 2016). In addition to a generational difference in contentious participation, religious beliefs have been demonstrated as another important factor in an individual's conventional and unconventional participation in Taiwan (Chang, 2016). Considering the scope of unrest and its effect on democracy, it is necessary to devote more research toward factors other than personal grievances and demographic backgrounds. More specifically, we would like in this study to address the enduring puzzle of the relationship between age and social disorder. While the younger generation seems to represent the majority of protesters, there is as yet no definitive evidence regarding the effects of age on contentious action (Chung, 2016; Wang and Weng, 2017). As we believe that it is imperative to study protest behavior with a solid theoretical foundation, the civic voluntarism model was chosen to test whether personal resources and political attitudes may have a bearing on patterns of contentious politics. We contend that the probability of taking part in a demonstration increases with age because older people tend to acquire more skills and personal resources. Accordingly, we examined the effects of education, political efficacy and cognitive mobilization on protests, which may contribute to the current literature on contentious action. We chose Taiwan as a case study to test our hypotheses. Taiwan has held routine elections at the national and local level since the 1960s. Before democratization in the 1990s, however, people often decided on contentious action to express their discontent with labour, the environment, and civil rights issues. Many of the activists organized the opposition party, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), and challenged the ruling party, Kuomingtang (KMT), both in the elections and on the streets. Contentious politics continues after the second party turnover in 2008, and Internet and social media is used to diffuse messages. In March 2014, several groups of college students protested against a congressional review of a trade pact with China, which had been passed by the standing committee. From March 18 to April 10, hundreds of students stormed and occupied the Legislative Yuan, the national legislature, to paralyze the legislation. Under pressure from students and civil society, KMT agreed not to pass any agreement without first enacting a law to regulate the review process. It was named Sunflower student movement because students held the sunflower to symbolize their call for more sunshine on the legislative process. Quite a lot of research pointed to the influence of national identity (Tsai and Chen, 2015), civil disobedience (Wang and Weng, 2017), and social networks (Chen et al., 2016). Since political participation is “a social and psychological decision” (Dalton, 2014:78), the role of political attitudes such as political efficacy and political cognition should be examined closely. In agreement with previous literature, this research aims to provide evidence that factors such as political efficacy, expectations for government transparency, political discussion, and partisanship help to explain civic activism in an East Asian democracy. We also contend that the tendency to take part in demonstrations increases with age. These empirical findings may shed light on the dynamics of global activism and contribute to the literature on political participation in general.

T1  - Happy parents' tweets: An exploration of Italian Twitter data using sentiment analysis
AN  - 2266300364
AB  - BACKGROUND Demographers are increasingly interested in connecting demographic behaviour and trends with 'soft' measures, i.e., complementary information on attitudes, values, feelings, and intentions. OBJECTIVE The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how computational linguistic techniques can be used to explore opinions and semantic orientations related to parenthood. METHODS In this article we scrutinize about three million filtered Italian tweets from 2014. First, we implement a methodological framework relying on Natural Language Processing techniques for text analysis, which is used to extract sentiments. We then run a supervised machine-learning experiment on the overall dataset, based on the annotated set of tweets from the previous stage. Consequently, we infer to what extent social media users report negative or positive affect on topics relevant to the fertility domain. RESULTS Parents express a generally positive attitude towards being and becoming parents, but they are also fearful, surprised, and sad. They also have quite negative sentiments about their children's future, politics, fertility, and parental behaviour. By exploiting geographical information from tweets we find a significant correlation between the prevalence of positive sentiments about parenthood and macro-regional indicators of both life satisfaction and fertility level. CONTRIBUTION We show how tweets can be used to represent soft measures such as attitudes, values, and feelings, and we establish how they relate to demographic features. Linguistic analysis of social media data provides a middle ground between qualitative studies and more standard quantitative approaches.

T1  - Using Media Literacy to Counter Stereotypical Images of Blacks and Latinos at a Predominantly White University
AN  - 2206009096
AB  - Media literacy, the critical analysis and deconstruction of media messages, has the potential to promote favorable attitudes toward members of racial minority groups. This study reports on the development and implementation of two types of media literacy interventions (i.e., critical and stereotype) aimed at enhancing college students' attitudes toward Blacks and Latinos. Students from 5 sections of the same course took part in a quasi-experiment and were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 interventions or to a control group. Students' attitudes were measured at 3 different times during the study: 6 weeks before the intervention, immediately following the intervention, and 6 weeks after the intervention. Both interventions enhanced students' attitudes toward Blacks and Latinos but the stereotype intervention was more effective than the critical one, both for short- and long-term effects, as the latter disappeared in the critical condition. Attitudes of students in the control group remained the same throughout the study. Implications address how to use media literacy to enhance conversation about race relations.

T1  - Embracing Germany: Interwar German Society and Black Germans through the Eyes of African American Reporters
AN  - 2034195957
AB  - This article looks at the published reports on visits made to interwar Germany by prominent black journalists Robert S. Abbot, J. A. Rogers and Lewis McMillan. Drawing on their own experiences as well as their engagement with German-based blacks, the reporters contrasted the oppressive conditions black people faced in the US with the apparent lack of colour prejudice in Germany. Their coverage serves as a critique of race relations in the US, while also providing snapshots into the conditions under which black Germans lived as well as an insight into the writers' own perceptions of a broader black diaspora in development.

T1  - The identity curation game: digital inequality, identity work, and emotion management
AN  - 2002462153
AB  - The research examines an understudied facet of digital inequality: how digital inequality impacts identity work and emotion management. The analysis reveals how unequal access to digital resources shapes how well youths are able to play what I call the identity curation game. Digital resources determine youths' ability to succeed in this game that is governed by three implicit rules: (1) constantly update or be sidelined, (2) engage in constant reciprocated identity-affirming interactions, and (3) maintain a strategy of vigilance to remove traces of failed identity performances. This article draws on Symbolic Interactionism and pays particular attention to Hochschild's theory of emotion management. Drawing on these frameworks, the findings reveal how under-resourced youths experience connectivity gaps that disrupt their ability to play the identity curation game, as well as the resulting emotional consequences. Under-resourced youths manage distinctive negative emotions arising from connectivity gaps that hinder their digital identity work, as well as engaging in distinct kinds of suppressive work to police their own emotions including longing, envy, shame, frustration, and stigmatization. In making these linkages, the research reveals the cascading effects of digital inequality among youths where constant connectivity is the sine qua non of social inclusion.

T1  - Factors of adoption of eco-labelling in hotel industry
AN  - 2084460380
AB  - The article aims to understand the reasons why hoteliers adopt an eco-label, but also to identify the factors that may call into question this choice in a context where the environmental pressures are multiple and strong. The article analyzes the whole process of adopting an eco-label from the knowledge phase to the confirmation phase a posteriori. By integrating different diffusion, neo-institutional and entrepreneurial approaches, the model makes it possible to identify all the motives, attitudes, norms and mechanisms of adoption and factors that can reverse this choice. Using a non-parametric quantitative methodology on a sample of 182 French hotels, we can explain the probability of adopting an eco-label and reversing its decision. The choice of adoption is explained by attitude towards risk, and ability to enact eco-label, two dimensions of entrepreneurial orientation, but also by mimetic institutional pressure. For institutions that have not yet adopted the certification, the intention to change its choice depends on normative and mimetic pressures, and entrepreneurial characteristics (like risk-taking, fear of bureaucracy). For certificated hotels, the complexity of the certification system is decisive in the choice of abandoning the certification while positive attitude towards environmental logic and pressures of the reference group help maintain the previous adoption.

T1  - Old-Fashioned Racism, Contemporary Islamophobia, and the Isolation of Muslim Americans in the Age of Trump
AN  - 2031051738
AB  - While extant research has documented the existence of negative attitudes toward Muslim Americans, it is unclear whether old-fashioned racism (OFR) is at the root of contemporary Islamophobia, and whether beliefs in the inherent inferiority of Muslims are linked to support for political actors and policies that aim to further isolate them. Bringing to bear a unique dataset of 1,044 white, black, Latino, and Asian participants, we demonstrate that a nontrivial portion of survey respondents make blatantly racist evaluations and rate Muslim Americans as the least "evolved" group. Next, we illustrate that these dehumanizing attitudes are strongly linked to modern objections of Muslim Americans, which we measure with a new Muslim American resentment scale (MAR). Our mediation analysis reveals that the relationship between OFR, support for President Trump, and various policy positions is powerfully mediated by MAR. These results suggest that the relevance of OFR in contemporary politics should not easily be dismissed, and that the literature on racial attitudes, which has predominantly focused on the Black-white dichotomy, should also be extended to appraisals of Muslim Americans.

T1  - Media’s Influence on Perceptions of Trans Women
AN  - 1992792646
AB  - Although media representations of trans women are becoming increasingly common, many trans women still face discrimination in their daily lives, in part due to prejudices and stereotypes that are perpetuated by media. In two studies, we investigated group differences in baseline transphobia linked to gender, sexual orientation, religiosity, and political ideology; we then measured whether different representations of trans women in media led to attitude change. After providing information about their baseline attitudes, participants were randomly assigned to positive, negative, or control film-viewing conditions, with a problematic condition (i.e., sympathetic portrayal of a trans woman by a cisgender male actor) added in study 2. In each condition, participants viewed two depictions of trans women from film or television shows. After watching the clips, participants’ attitudes toward trans individuals were re-assessed. Heterosexuals, Christians, conservatives, and men (study 2 only) showed greater transphobia at pretest than LGB individuals, atheists, liberals, and women, respectively. Attitudes of participants who viewed negative film depictions of trans women became more negative after viewing the clips. We discuss implications of these findings in relation to recent media interest in representing trans women.

T1  - Labor market disadvantage and political alienation: a longitudinal perspective on the heterogeneous risk in temporary employment
AN  - 1989130535
AB  - This paper investigates whether and how individual shocks of temporary employment translate into feelings of political alienation. Recently, research started to investigate cross-sectional associations between temporary employment, political attitudes and behavior. Yet, the cross-sectional research so far struggles to disentangle empirically whether the relationship between temporary work and political orientations is determined by structural factors only – such as skill-set and education – or whether we are also able to observe the dynamic patterns suggested in theoretical arguments. This paper takes up the task of tracing the dynamic relationship between temporary employment experiences and adjustments in political orientations. It is argued that temporary employment has ambiguous effects on political orientations and that we are in need for convincing strategies to tackle this heterogeneity. Using perceived risk measures as mediators, we propose a strategy to capture the dynamic effects of temporary employment. Fixed-effects regressions show that if temporary employment experiences are translated by increases in perceived job insecurity and perceived financial insecurity, trust in politics starts to erode. The identification of such dynamic patterns is highly relevant for research on the political effects of labor market disadvantages.

T1  - Homelessness in the UK: who is most at risk?
AN  - 1961826038
AB  - Is the common pressure group and media refrain that 'we are all two pay cheques away from homelessness' justified by the evidence? Drawing on multivariate analysis of two cross-sectional datasets (the 'Scottish Household Survey' and the UK-wide 'Poverty and Social Exclusion') Survey and one longitudinal data-set (the 'British Cohort Study 1970'), this paper provides a systematic account of the social distribution of homelessness in the UK. Informed by a critical realist explanatory framework, our analysis underlines the centrality of poverty, especially childhood poverty, to the generation of homelessness, while also demonstrating the impact of broader labour and housing market contexts, and certain demographic, personal and social support characteristics. These findings reinforce the moral imperative for policy action on homelessness, while at the same time signalling opportunities to target preventative interventions on high risk groups.

T1  - Citizens of the margin: citizenship and youth participation on the Moroccan social web
AN  - 1941393668
AB  - This paper examines how marginalized youth in Morocco use YouTube to contest hegemonic discourses of state power and institutional practices of social exclusion. The paper analyses a user-generated, YouTube web-series, Tales of Bouzebal, as a performance of marginality and a social critique of state bureaucracies and institutions in the context of post-Arab Spring Morocco. Using a combined method of textual and discourse analyses, the paper argues that the new media practices of producing and consuming user-generated video are best understood as practices of cultural citizenship that contribute to social change through the production of counter-discursive political subjectivities among youth in MENA. The paper posits that the concept of citizenship needs to be expanded to account for citizen participatory media practices that contest the conditions of marginality and inequality sustained by normative definitions of citizenship.

T1  - Neighborhood Priority or Desegregation Plans? A Spatial Analysis of Voting on San Francisco’s Student Assignment System
AN  - 1962127592
AB  - In 2011, San Francisco held an unprecedented citywide vote on its public schools’ student assignment policy. Proposition H provides a unique opportunity to learn more about the public’s desire for “neighborhood schools,” as compared to their interest in maintaining districtwide desegregation efforts. This paper takes the approach of applying geographic information system tools and regression analysis to understand the relationships between neighborhood, race, income, and attitudes toward student assignment systems. By comparing the election results with demographics and school quality data, we identify patterns of support for the narrowly defeated proposition. Support for a shift toward neighborhood-based schools was higher in census tracts with high-performing schools, more school age children, high median income, or a large fraction of foreign-born residents, and lower in tracts with a high percentage of Latinos. The shifting race- and class-based politics of the city foreshadow expected demographic shifts in the US.

T1  - The public positioning of refugees in the quasi-education market: linking mediascapes and social geographies of schooling
AN  - 1952103134
AB  - This article analyses some ways in which racialising discourses around refugees interact with the spatial and social dynamics of marketised schooling. It identifies conflicting discourses that contribute to the polarisation of school social composition and resourcing in the Australian state of Victoria. Media narratives around 'ethnic' gangs contribute to wider discourses surrounding working-class neighbourhoods and schools as dangerous and violent 'hotspots'. At the same time, some elite private schools discursively produce themselves as providing a ladder of opportunity for talented and deserving refugee youth, offering volunteer tutoring and scholarships. These discourses work together to legitimate the funding of socially exclusive sites at twice the rate of the schools that cater to virtually all refugee-background students. The article draws on critical discourse analysis, based on media reporting on refugees, and interviews with parents selecting a secondary school for their children. The findings have implications for the management of school choice as a policy framework, suggesting that its exclusionary effects are heightened in the context of intense media and political attention to refugees as racialised subjects.

T1  - You're either with us or against us! Moral conviction determines how the politicized distinguish friend from foe: GPIR
AN  - 1928355685
AB  - Three studies investigated how politicized collective identification affects individuals' reactions towards others. We hypothesized that a strong politicized identity tends to be accompanied by a moral conviction about the politicized cause, which in turn determines how the politicized respond to those less committed to their cause. Consistent with this, Study 1 showed that politicized (feminist) identification is associated with lower identification with women who place moderate (vs. high) moral value on gender equality. Study 2 showed that politicized identification was associated with negative emotions towards people who disagree with this cause and this was mediated by the extent to which participants saw supporting the activist goal as morally obligatory. Study 3 showed that politicized identification, to the extent to which it implied holding a moral conviction about the activist cause, is associated with a desire for more social distance to an attitudinally dissimilar other, but not from an attitudinally similar other.

T1  - Too far to help: The effect of perceived distance on the expected impact and likelihood of charitable action
AN  - 1930864393
AB  - Fact: Holding force constant, a snowball thrown from 10 feet away will hurt more than one thrown from 50 feet away; it will have more impact. We show that people expect charitable donations -- much like snowballs -- to have more impact on nearby (vs. faraway) targets. Therefore, because making an impact is a powerful motivator of prosocial behavior, people are more willing to take action to help nearby (vs. faraway) causes -- independent of social distance. Six studies, including lab and field experiments, and secondary data from fundraising campaigns support this prediction. Specifically, Study 1 shows that people expect charitable donations to have a greater impact on nearby (vs. faraway) recipients, and that these judgments stem from metaphorical thinking. In the context of alumni giving to their alma mater, the next two studies show that donations increase as real (Study 2) or perceived (Study 3) distances decrease. Study 4 extends these findings using a more conservative manipulation of distance perception (Study 4). Finally, Study 5 demonstrates the mediating role of expected impact on the effect of perceived distance on charitable action, whereas Study 6 shows that a motivational focus on making an impact moderates this effect.

T1  - Introduction to Special Issue: We March Lest We Forget
AN  - 1892345155
AB  - This timely volume entitled “We March Lest We Forget” not only explores why marching and other forms of social protest matter, but also provides a close look at contemporary race-related commemorations for social justice and/or human rights in the United States. As the essays here investigate contemporary symbolic acts of resistance and their relationship to civil rights commemoration they also explore the degree to which remembering and forgetting civil rights struggles of the past reframes, restates, and re-examines the fight for social justice today. For example, during the week leading up to March 8, 2015 more than 100,000 people gathered to commemorate Bloody Sunday, and the sacrifices people made to ensure that African Americans were permitted voting rights already promised to them via previous legislation. Yet the march was linked in media and popular culture to Ferguson and recent young, Black, male deaths. Present day civil rights activism is in fact an amalgam of struggles for social justice. This special issue is not just about civil rights as an indicator of a 1960s' freedom struggle, but also about all struggles for basic citizen rights since the 1960s.

T1  - Stereotypes Associated With Age-related Conditions and Assistive Device Use in Canadian Media
AN  - 1844211743
AB  - Purpose of the Study: Newspapers are an important source of information. The discourses within the media can influence public attitudes and support or discourage stereotypical portrayals of older individuals. This study critically examined discourses within a Canadian newspaper in terms of stereotypical depictions of age-related health conditions and assistive technology devices (ATDs). Design and Methods: Four years (2009-2013) of Globe and Mail articles were searched for terms relevant to the research question. A total of 65 articles were retained, and a critical discourse analysis (CDA) of the texts was conducted. The articles were coded for stereotypes associated with age-related health conditions and ATDs, consequences of the stereotyping, and context (overall setting or background) of the discourse. Results: The primary code list included 4 contexts, 13 stereotypes, and 9 consequences of stereotyping. CDA revealed discourses relating to (a) maintaining autonomy in a stereotypical world, (b) ATDs as obstacles in employment, (c) barriers to help seeking for age-related conditions, and (d) people in power setting the stage for discrimination. Implications: Our findings indicate that discourses in the Canadian media include stereotypes associated with age-related health conditions. Further, depictions of health conditions and ATDs may exacerbate existing stereotypes about older individuals, limit the options available to them, lead to a reduction in help seeking, and lower ATD use. Education about the realities of age-related health changes and ATDs is needed in order to diminish stereotypes and encourage ATD uptake and use.

T1  - The Inner Geographies of a Migrant Gateway: Mapping the Built Environment and the Dynamics of Caribbean Mobility in Manchester, 1951-2011
AN  - 1991113190
AB  - Between the 1960s and 1990s a series of urban redevelopment projects in Manchester radically transformed ethnic settlement in the city. The ward of Moss Side, which had been a gateway for Caribbean and African immigrants, experienced repeated slum clearances in which whole communities were relocated and large tracts of housing stock were demolished and redesigned. The relationship between these physical and demographic changes has been overshadowed by the persisting stigmatization of Moss Side as a racialized "ghetto," which has meant that outsiders have constructed the area as possessing a fixed and homogenous identity. This article uses geographic information systems in conjunction with local surveys and archival records to explore how the dynamics of immigrant mobility within Moss Side were shaped by housing stock, external racism, family strategies, and urban policy. Whereas scholarship on ethnic segregation in Britain has focused on the internal migration of ethnic groups between administrative areas, using areal interpolation to connect demographic data and the built environment reveals the intense range of movements that developed within the variegated urban landscape of Moss Side.

T1  - Rhetoric and a Body Impolitic: Self-Definition and Mary Mcleod Bethune's Discursive Safe Space
AN  - 1784674820
AB  - Mary McLeod Bethune is one of the most profound and influential African Americans in the history of American democracy. To some, she was often characterized as the "female Booker T. Washington," because she was held in high regard by both White and Black audiences. She is notably respected for her avid persistence to uplift the race, advocating quality education and civil rights for Blacks. However, though her life and work single-handedly changed U.S. race relations, Bethune is not well known as a rhetor. With all the speeches, presentations, lectures, meetings, and conversations she had, most scholarship on her life is primarily concentrated in history or there is a one-to-two page overview of her entire life in almanacs or biographical sources, still excluding scholarly explication of Bethune's rhetoric. The goal of this article is to provide this rhetorical examination. To continue to build, as rhetorical scholar Olga Davis noted a Black female rhetorical tradition, my aim is to demonstrate the rhetorical strategies employed by Bethune to self-define herself, extol Black womanhood, and reclaim Black female humanity, challenging the dominant White supremacist narrative of femininity.

T1  - From "brute" to "thug:" The demonization and criminalization of unarmed Black male victims in America
AN  - 1768022922
AB  - The synonymy of Blackness with criminality is not a new phenomenon in America. Documented historical accounts have shown how myths, stereotypes, and racist ideologies led to discriminatory policies and court rulings that fueled racial violence in the post-Reconstruction era and have culminated in the exponential increase of Black male incarceration today. Misconceptions and prejudices manufactured and disseminated through various channels such as the media included references to a "brute" image of Black males. In the 21st century, this negative imagery of Black males has frequently utilized the negative connotation of the terminology "thug." In recent years, law enforcement agencies have unreasonably used deadly force on Black males allegedly considered to be "suspects" or "persons of interest." The exploitation of these often-targeted victims' criminal records, physical appearances, or misperceived attributes has been used to justify their unlawful deaths. Despite the connection between disproportionate criminality and Black masculinity, little research has been done on how unarmed Black male victims, particularly but not exclusively at the hands of law enforcement, have been posthumously criminalized. This article investigates the historical criminalization of Black males and its connection to contemporary unarmed victims of law enforcement. Action research methodology in the data collection process is utilized to interpret how Black male victims are portrayed by traditional mass media, particularly through the use of language, in ways that marginalize and devictimize these individuals. This study also aims to elucidate a contemporary understanding of race relations, racism, and the plight of the Black male in a 21-century "postracial" America.

T1  - Rendering the implicit explicit: political advertisements, partisan cues, race, and white public opinion in the 2012 presidential election
AN  - 2571055019
AB  - In The Race Card (2001), Tali Mendelberg claims that once the racial content of an implicit racial appeal has been exposed the appeal loses its ability to mobilize voters. In this paper, we investigate this claim by employing a survey experiment embedded in Amazon's Mechanical Turk in which respondents view Mitt Romney's “Right Choice” television ad on welfare and then read a short op-ed. The op-ed, written by a fictitious member of Congress whose partisanship was systematically varied, argues that the Romney ad (1) is racist or (2) has no racial undertones. In line with Mendelberg's predictions, we find that – regardless of the partisanship of the elite in question – exposure to an op-ed that denounces the Romney welfare advertisement as racist leads white Democrats and Republicans to more strongly perceive the advertisement as racist and express greater opposition to Romney's campaign. Our findings contribute to the literatures on racial priming and partisan motivated reasoning, and also make a strong case for further evaluating the influence of political leadership on racial attitudes.

AB  - As a setting, prisons offer a unique opportunity to invest in the health of disadvantaged and marginalised populations and address health inequalities and social exclusion – thereby achieving sustainable improvements in well-being for offenders and their families and in turn, helping to reduce rates of re-offending. This article draws on English and French experiences and doctoral research to advocate a shift from a pathogenic model towards a salutogenic model of health as a helpful way to address inequalities and thus, by promoting joined-up working across justice and wider systems, impact positively beyond ‘health’ for the effective resettlement of prisoners. The paper utilises examples from horticulture to further argue the powerful role of nature in the prison setting in mediating aspects of culture particularly relating to processes of socialisation. Critical success lies in bridging across systems and a commitment to joined-up working at all levels across and beyond prison.

T1  - Stigma of persons with disabilities in Afghanistan: Examining the pathways from stereotyping to mental distress
AN  - 1774575492
AB  - Despite evidence that stigma of disability is frequently reflected through stereotyping and often results in mental distress, very limited literature demonstrates the pathways through which stereotyping has an impact on mental health. Drawing from a large sample of 1449 participants interviewed between December 2012 and September 2013 from an Afghan community-based rehabilitation program, we examined the structure of stigma associated with disability in Afghanistan. Labeling and negative stereotypes, associated with a specific cause of disability, result in social exclusion that in turn impacts mental health. Using structural equation modeling with latent variables, we examined the mediation effect of stereotypes associated with disability on mental distress and anxiety. We found a mediating role of social exclusion between stereotypes and mental distress but only in the case of persons with disabilities from birth. Comparing the total effect of 'disabled at birth' and mental distress 0.195 (95% CI: 0.018-0.367) the effect size of this mediation effect was 0.293 (95% CI: 0.173-0.415). There was no significant direct effect between 'disabled at birth' and mental distress once mediation effect was accounted for in our model. These findings suggest that a multipronged policy approach that recognizes the driving forces of stigma and promotes social participation directly alongside psychosocial interventions on mental distress of persons with disabilities is necessary to achieve wellbeing for a group that has been historically and systematically excluded from development interventions.

T1  - Has Gramsci Left the Building?
AN  - 1882017963
AB  - [...]there are concerning elements to some of these politics: a re-emergence of left-wing anti-Semitism (see Luce, 2016), a tendency to blame the "folly" of the crowd and to rely on a relatively small echo chamber comprised of a concerned and/or alienated middle class.  While we [sociologists] are attentive to globalization, global cities, new elites and the politics of the young, those suffering from economic decline and marginalization, the elderly, and Old Economy geographies tend to only receive attention from demographers and scholars of public health (McQuarrie, 2016).  [...]he goes on to note that rather than being observers, sociologists have become "political adversaries to many of the people we might want to study" (McQuarrie, 2016).

T1  - Why do the lonely stay lonely? Chronically lonely adolescents' attributions and emotions in situations of social inclusion and exclusion
AN  - 1767329962; 201605738
AB  - The goal of this study was to identify mechanisms associated with chronic loneliness by examining the effect of adolescents' accumulated history of loneliness on responses to new social situations. Specifically, this study investigated whether attributions and emotions in situations of social inclusion and exclusion differ between chronically lonely adolescents and adolescents with a different loneliness history. A total of 730 adolescents (Mage at Wave 1 = 15.43 years) participated in a 4-wave longitudinal study with annual loneliness assessments. A chronic loneliness trajectory was identified, in addition to low-stable, moderate-stable, moderate-increasing, and high-decreasing loneliness trajectories. At Wave 4, vignettes depicting social inclusion and exclusion were presented, and participants rated a set of attributions and emotions following each vignette. Compared with individuals following other trajectories, chronically lonely adolescents were characterized by hypersensitivity to social exclusion (i.e., higher levels of negative emotions) and hyposensitivity to social inclusion (i.e., lower levels of enthusiasm). Further, chronically lonely adolescents had a stronger tendency to attribute social inclusion to circumstantial factors and social exclusion to internal and stable characteristics. This maladaptive attribution style partially mediated their emotional experiences. Together, results indicate that chronically lonely individuals respond to social situations in ways that may perpetuate rather than reduce their loneliness.

TT  - Attitudes to climate change and actions for the energetic decline of practicing Christians: the effects of religious persuasion and social capital
AN  - 1882302700
AB  - This quantitative study of the attitudes towards climate change and energy reduction actions of Australian Christian churchgoers presents data from a series of national surveys, one of which is investigated in greater depth to identify the relationship between religious persuasion and social capital on the one hand and consumer energy reduction and 'civic' action on the other. Comparisons are made with reference to surveys of the Australian population carried out in 2006 and 2011. Churchgoers were found to be slightly more pro-environment than the Australian population as a whole in their attitudes and actions. Social capital was a stronger predictor of action, particularly civic actions, than environmental attitudes or religious persuasions. The norm of Christian responsibility for the environment was also a strong predictor of action. Because church leaders were trusted sources of information about climate change, they played an important role in fostering positive changes in attitudes and actions.

T1  - Making Up Allies: The Identity Choreography of Straight LGBT Activism
AN  - 1698326916
AB  - This qualitative study investigates the contemporary landscape of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) politics and activism, specifically the concept and identities of "straight allies." Through in-depth interviews with 13 individuals who identify as straight allies, we explore how these heterosexuals engage in LGBT politics and activist cultures. We take a grounded theory approach to data analysis, through which the concept of "passive" and "active" activism emerges as a framework to understand these allies' meaning-making practices, as well as how they negotiate the emotional, interpersonal, life-historical, and mass-mediated complexities of being straight allies when interacting with LGBT communities and engaging in pro-LGBT politics. We draw upon Thompson's ( 2005 ) theory of ontological choreography to posit "identity choreography" as way to describe and make sense of the heterogeneous knowledges and experiences our participants use to constitute their straight ally identities and to evaluate others' ally identities and activisms. Implications for future research on LGBT politics and straight allies, particularly in terms of education, attitude change, and activism, are discussed.

T1  - A National Prospective Study of Pornography Consumption and Gendered Attitudes Toward Women
AN  - 1695135473
AB  - Whether consuming pornography leads to gendered attitudes toward women has been debated extensively. Researchers have primarily studied pornography's contribution to gendered sexual attitudes such as rape myth acceptance and sexual callousness toward women. The present study explored associations between pornography consumption and nonsexual gender-role attitudes in a national, two-wave panel sample of US adults. Pornography consumption interacted with age to predict gender-role attitudes. Specifically, pornography consumption at wave one predicted more gendered attitudes at wave two for older--but not for younger--adults. Gender-role attitudes at wave one were included in this analysis. Pornography consumption was therefore associated with interindividual over time change in older adults' gendered attitudes toward women. Older adults' attitudes toward nonsexual gender roles are generally more regressive than those of younger adults. Thus, this finding is consistent with Wright's (Commun Yearb 35:343-386,  2011 ) script acquisition, activation, application model (^sub 3^AM) of media socialization, which posits that attitude change following media exposure is more likely for viewers' whose preexisting behavioral scripts are less incongruous with scripts for behavior presented in mass media depictions. Contrary to the perspective that selective exposure explains associations between pornography consumption and content-congruent attitudes, gender-role attitudes at wave one did not predict pornography consumption at wave two.

T1  - PRIMING WITH ENERGY DRINKS MAY PROMOTE MEN'S TOLERANCE OF SOCIAL PAIN
AN  - 1721707422
AB  - In advertising of caffeinated energy drinks, there appears to be a consistent emphasis reinforcing masculine identification. Greater tolerance of social pain in a situation of exclusion is a characteristic particularly identified with masculinity. In this study, we tested the priming effect of an energy drink on men's social pain tolerance in the situation of experiencing social exclusion in Cyberball, a virtual ball-tossing game. We recruited 93 men who were undergraduate students at a university in Taiwan to participate in an experimental study. Results showed that the men exposed to a popular caffeinated energy drink (Red Bull) tolerated being excluded from a greater number of throws in Cyberball than did those with a neutral prime or no prime. Induced conformity to masculine norms mediated the link between the energy drink prime and increased tolerance of social pain. These findings suggest that mere exposure to energy drinks may lead men to behave according to masculine norms in a seemingly unrelated domain.

T1  - Automatic personality assessment through social media language
AN  - 1767328133; 201607510
AB  - Language use is a psychologically rich, stable individual difference with well-established correlations to personality. We describe a method for assessing personality using an open-vocabulary analysis of language from social media. We compiled the written language from 66,732 Facebook users and their questionnaire-based self-reported Big Five personality traits, and then we built a predictive model of personality based on their language. We used this model to predict the 5 personality factors in a separate sample of 4,824 Facebook users, examining (a) convergence with self-reports of personality at the domain- and facet-level; (b) discriminant validity between predictions of distinct traits; (c) agreement with informant reports of personality; (d) patterns of correlations with external criteria (e.g., number of friends, political attitudes, impulsiveness); and (e) test-retest reliability over 6-month intervals. Results indicated that language-based assessments can constitute valid personality measures: they agreed with self-reports and informant reports of personality, added incremental validity over informant reports, adequately discriminated between traits, exhibited patterns of correlations with external criteria similar to those found with self-reported personality, and were stable over 6-month intervals. Analysis of predictive language can provide rich portraits of the mental life associated with traits. This approach can complement and extend traditional methods, providing researchers with an additional measure that can quickly and cheaply assess large groups of participants with minimal burden.

AB  - Research finds that historic racial violence helps predict spatial distributions of contemporary outcomes, including homicide. These findings underscore the continued need to historicize modern race relations, yet intervening processes linking past violence with present events remain unclear. This study examines these intermediary mechanisms by reducing the century-long time-lapse common to legacy of racial violence research. We use mid-century measures of violent opposition to the Civil Rights Movement to bridge the historical gap between lynchings and later homicide, thus clarifying the dynamic and contingent nature of the legacy of racial violence. Structural equation models indicate that incidents of anti-civil rights enforcement and contemporary homicides are more likely to occur in areas with pronounced histories of lynching. Civil rights era assaults mediate the relationship between lynchings and contemporary homicide generally, but not White-on-Black homicide, signaling a need for further research documenting events of mid-century racial violence and clarifying these and other sources of historical transmission. Implications for future research and public policy are considered. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Majority-minority acculturation preferences concordance as an antecedent of attitudes towards immigrants: The mediating role of perceived symbolic threat and metastereotypes
AN  - 1735657122; 201536997
AB  - Through an experimental design, we investigated the effects of majority-minority acculturation preferences concordance and immigrants' generational status on Italians' attitudes towards Albanian immigrants. The role of perceived threat and metastereotypes in mediating this relationship was examined. Participants (N = 178) were categorized into different levels of culture maintenance and intercultural contact concordance. Findings showed that discrepancies in the contact dimension affected majority members' attitudes towards immigrants. Both perceived threat and metastereotypes were found to mediate the relationship between contact discrepancies and attitudes towards immigrants. Culture maintenance concordance interacted with immigrants' generational status in influencing majority members' attitudes. This research confirmed the importance of taking into account the dynamic and reciprocal relationship between majority and immigrant acculturation preferences, confirming that the most positive attitudes were produced when immigrants were perceived to adopt the same strategy as the majority, especially with respect to intergroup contact.

T1  - Punishment Regimes and the Multilevel Effects of Parental Incarceration: Intergenerational, Intersectional, and Interinstitutional Models of Social Inequality and Systemic Exclusion
AN  - 1735657252; 201537860
AB  - The US prison boom has resulted in the mass incarceration of parents in the United States. We review recent scholarship on the relationship between parental incarceration and child inequality and social exclusion over the life course. We develop a multilevel social exclusion framework to stimulate future research on the effects of paternal and maternal incarceration. This framework is intergenerational in its focus on incarcerated parents and their children, interinstitutional in its attention to state and school regimes, and intersectional in its consideration of the role of gender and race and ethnic contingencies. It is also systemic in its focus on multiple chosen and overlapping institutional policy domains of exclusion. We address both mediators and moderators of the effects of parental incarceration on child outcomes. We emphasize the underresearched importance of meso-level (e.g., school) and macro-level (e.g., state and cross-national) exclusionary and inclusionary regimes in understanding the effects of parental incarceration. We propose hypotheses to synthesize current research on the impact of maternal and paternal incarceration on children. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Digital inclusion and social inclusion: a tale of two cities
AN  - 1660022758; 201506405
AB  - This paper presents results of a recent research project that focuses on the influence of mobile technologies on social exclusion. It investigates the impact of two distinct approaches by local government to providing access to local support and services. Aug City advocated a bottom-up infrastructure-based model with non-state involvement after the technology was embedded. Conversely, Mobile City used a centrally planned model where the state acted as service custodians through teams of visiting officers and a mobile office. A case study approach was utilized focusing on two urban area of the UK, that adopted contrasting initiatives for implementing mobile information and communication technologies (MICT) to provide access to local government support and services. Activity Theory was used to provide a theoretical and analytical framework. A range of pre-existing information needs and barriers were revealed, but in some cases the technology itself presented a barrier. Issues with literacy, technology skills and in some cases the socioemotional condition of some of the socially excluded combined with the complexity of their information needs fundamentally undermines the direct access model for this section of the community. There are implications for social policy and practice. It is important to understand and address existing information needs and barriers (such as literacy and IT literacy, and social-emotional issues), ahead of new MICT initiatives to ensure the fullest chance of success and benefit for targeted communities and individuals.

T1  - Race, culture, and practice: segregation and local food in Birmingham, Alabama
AN  - 2561088650
AB  - In this study, we use a combination of geographic information systems and Bourdieuan social theory to analyze the development of a food policy council in Birmingham, Alabama. The questions we investigate are: What is the relationship between race and culture? How is this relationship manifest in practice within the alternative food and agriculture movement? In our work, we show how the racially segregated conditions of metropolitan Birmingham forge divergent habitus among Blacks and Whites in the region. Consequently, Whites have difficulty producing practices and interpretations of those practices that Blacks can recognize as legitimate, and vice versa. As a result, the food policy council emerges from and remains trapped within a space of Whiteness, and few Blacks serve on the council or participate in its production.

T1  - Linguistic Factors Associated With Propagation of Political Opinions in Twitter
AN  - 1531933889; 201422692
AB  - In the last decade, social networks have emerged as a significant media platform for dissemination of political information. In this article, we characterize linguistic factors that affect the dissemination of a political message on Twitter. This is important because characterization of messages that were posted by users from both political camps can provide a unique insight into how rival audiences can be reached. We analyze about 20,000 Twitter users who expressed explicit support for Barack Obama or Mitt Romney during the 2012 U.S. presidential election. We extracted approximately 344,000 tweets by these users that contained links to political webpages and appeared in the 3 months prior to the election. We show that the language used in a linked page is correlated with the page's popularity in terms of the total number of users that post a link to this page. Pages that are written in a more Republican language are posted by a larger number of users than Democrat-leaning pages. We also observe that pages that use highly polarized language are generally posted by users from a single political camp. Pages that are reposted by both Romney and Obama supporters are usually written in a relatively neutral language. In addition, when the user is a Republican, the text accompanying a retweeted page is likely to be modified, usually to refute information that conflicts with the user's viewpoint.

T1  - The Wannabe, The Man, and Whitebread: Portrayals of Whiteness in Black Films
AN  - 1524696336
AB  - Research on race and media in Western societies typically emphasizes the static characterizations of ethnic minorities in light of a White majority cast (e.g. the Black coon or the asexual Asian). Through the theoretical lens of whiteness, these representations are understood to be congruent with traditional articulations of racial identity and promote an ideology of White supremacy. Contemporary scholarship, however, challenges researchers to examine whiteness in light of an ethnic majority cast. In this article, we focus on the representation of Whites in Black films. We examine three popular Black films and propose three prevailing portrayals of whiteness evident in Black-oriented films: The Wannabe, The Man, and Whitebread. Findings reveal the promulgation of essentialized notions of race and the perpetuation of White dominance through film art. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Nation-State Science: Lappology and Sweden's Ethnoracial Purity
AN  - 1513963404
AB  - Abstract              This paper introduces the concept of "nation-state science" to describe the scientific work of ethnoracial classification that made possible the ideal of the homogenous nation-state. Swedish scientists implicitly defined their nation for Continental Europeans when they explicitly created knowledge about the "Lapps" (today's Sámi/Saami). Nation was coupled to state through such ethnoracial categories, the content of which were redefined as Sweden's geopolitical power rose and fell. These shifts sparked methodological innovations to redefine the Lapp, making it a durable category whose content was plastic enough to survive paradigm shifts in political and scientific thought. Idiosyncratic Swedish concerns thus became universalized through the scientific diffusion of empirical knowledge about Lapps and generalizable anthropometric techniques to distinguish among populations. What Sweden lost during the nineteenth century in terms of geopolitical power, it gained in terms of biopower: the knowledge and control of internal populations made possible by its widely adopted anthropometric innovations. Nation-state science helps unpack the interrelationships between state-building, nation-making, and scientific labor. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The History of Affirmative Action in the USA: A Teaching and Learning Guide
AN  - 1490422122
AB  - This Teaching and Learning Guide is designed to accompany my Sociology Compass article on affirmative action. The sample syllabus is organized historically beginning with FDR's New Deal and the first use of the term affirmative action and ending with the most recent Supreme Court's deliberations on this policy. In doing so, it attends not only to the varied meanings and forms of affirmative action across time but also the different interest groups arguing for and against this remedial policy. Along the way, it explores the changing history of race relations in the USA, considers the value of personal narratives as sources in exploring meaning and personhood, examines the ways the news media has framed the debate in contemporary America, and finally, speculates about the future of this controversial policy.

AB  - This paper draws attention to the personal weblogs written by Japanese migrant women in Australia. Entries in these weblogs elucidate their daily experiences, thoughts, concerns, and feelings. Blog data provide rich personal accounts of migrant experiences from the first-hand experiences of migrants. Based on collected blog entries, this paper details Japanese spouses' settlement experiences in Australia by highlighting issues of language and culture, and critiques celebratory attitudes toward international mobility by discussing the disadvantages of migration. While mobility to western countries is often romanticized and regarded as a symbol of emancipation for Japanese women, diasporic subjects still confront social exclusion and marginalization in an adopted society. Migrants' struggles and difficulties remain even in Australia, which is a country generally perceived as a multicultural society that has a large number of migrants and a long history of immigration.

T1  - Gender, culture and changing attitudes: experiences of HIV in Zimbabwe
AN  - 1367697790
AB  - This paper draws on a series of qualitative interviews with 60 people living in economically poor communities of Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, to provide new insight into the cultural landscape of HIV. While there has been extensive exploration of gender, sexuality, culture and HIV in Zimbabwe, there is a need to revisit these issues given the country's recent political and economic history. These questions have shaped the meanings that have been created around HIV (i.e., notions of HIV-as-death and as being produced by promiscuity) and the gendered mediation of cultural practices (i.e., forms of sexual expression and treatment uptake). Drawing on the accounts from a group directly affected by HIV, we illustrate the persistence of gendered and spiritualised ideas about 'blame', 'transmission' and 'treatment' and the disproportionate burden that still falls on Zimbabwean women. We conclude with an exploration of how everyday understandings of HIV may be shifting and the ways in which marginality, discrimination and stigma may be being challenged by openness, dialogue and attitude change.

T1  - Sleep duration, positive attitude toward life, and academic achievement: The role of daytime tiredness, behavioral persistence, and school start times
AN  - 1364702762; 201326368
AB  - Sleep timing undergoes profound changes during adolescence, often resulting in inadequate sleep duration. The present study examines the relationship of sleep duration with positive attitude toward life and academic achievement in a sample of 2716 adolescents in Switzerland (mean age: 15.4 years, SD=0.8), and whether this relationship is mediated by increased daytime tiredness and lower self-discipline/behavioral persistence. Further, we address the question whether adolescents who start school modestly later (20min; n=343) receive more sleep and report better functioning.

T1  - Humour in advertising: An associative processing model
AN  - 1516511639
AB  - This chapter reviews a research programme on the effects of humour in advertising on positive and negative brand associations and brand choice, and integrates the findings into a single overarching model. Based on the Associative and Propositional Processes Model of Evaluation (Gawronski & Bodenhausen, 2006, 2007, 2011), we propose that repeated pairings of a novel brand with brandunrelated humour forms positive brand associations, which mediate spontaneous brand choice. This associative process was found to be independent from the level of distraction posed by humour and from awareness of the stimulus pairings. In fact the distraction posed by humour benefits persuasion by preventing negative brand associations. Previous marketing research, which mainly viewed humour as a cue in peripheral processing, was rather pessimistic about the persuasive impact of humour. In contrast, this research programme suggests that a repeated pairing of a brand with humour affects the brand's underlying associative structure, which may lead to stable attitude changes that guide overt spontaneous brand choice. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Representation of masculinities and race in South African television advertising: a content analysis
AN  - 1347783610; 201322619
AB  - This paper examines how masculinities and race are co-constructed in South African television advertising. A sample of 5803 advertisements was collected that included 876 primary visual male actors. These were coded and analysed by means of traditional content analysis. A coding scheme was developed which was partly based on existing research. Coding categories included advertisement setting and products; race, social class, age and portrayal of primary visual actor; as well as sexuality, toughness, independence, status, responsibility and homophobia norms of traditional masculinity as related to the primary visual male actor. Hypotheses predicted that men would be represented significantly differently in television advertisements depending upon their race. These differences in representation reflect an intersection between traditional gender and race relations in South Africa that are marked by longstanding inequalities. The findings largely supported these hypotheses. White men are represented as exemplars of hegemonic masculinity whilst black men are marginalised. It is argued that these representations serve to maintain hierarchical social relations between men in South Africa. This study provides a foundation upon which further work may be undertaken. Avenues for future research are outlined. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - RE-CREATING THE FAVELA IN O HOMEM QUE COPIAVA BY JORGE FURTADO
AN  - 1283639655; 201306659
AB  - The Brazilian film director Jorge Furtado's O homem que copiava centers on two plots, both based on accepted social discourses: how to escape lower-middle-class poverty; and the perennial question of the obstacles to love. These two plots are intertwined when the love quest is made to depend on the former, that is, when success in love is predicated on success in social mobility. However, in making the film's protagonist black, Furtado inserts the question of race into these two discourses and highlights the discursive absence of race in dealing with the problems of poverty and race relations. The film underscores the role of education and the discursive implications of social representation in excluding marginalized groups from social mobility while exploring the underside of the mesticagem myth, the role of race in the question of national identity.

T1  - Representations and Remembrance: Tracing Civil Rights Meanings in the Narratives of Civil Rights Activists and Hollywood Filmmakers
AN  - 889259025
AB  - In this article, we examine the narratives of the Civil Rights Movement as presented in cinematic narratives and in accounts of civil rights leaders. We conduct a comparative analysis focusing on the comparison of the Civil Rights narratives of the Hollywood films The Long Walk Home (1989) and Driving Miss Daisy (1989), to the 1997 audio series Will the Circle Be Unbroken? In the analysis, we identify a Hollywood and a black consensus narrative, but there are important differences in the representational politics of black activists who participated during the Civil Rights Movement and that of Hollywood filmmakers. In particular, our findings reveal that the two Hollywood films downplay black agency, deploy the white heroin character, privilege sentimental aspects over historical references, limit the historical scope of the movement, and use a language of intimacy and optimism about race relations. These depictions sharply differ from the black consensus narrative in which life under Jim Crow, black activism, unity, struggle, and group resilience are emphasized.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - "Generation Islam": Arab American Muslims and Racial Politics after September 11
AN  - 1010632377; 201210458
AB  - This research draws upon the lived experiences of sixty young adult Muslims living in Los Angeles in order to provide a comprehensive overview of the racialized processes shaping the representation, oppression, and emergent identities of the Muslim diaspora. Historically, Arab American Muslims have occupied a contradictory position within U.S. race relations. They have been designated by the government as categorically white, but simultaneously have been the victims of racism in different institutional arenas. I explore how the War on Terror has shaped the collective and individual racial consciousness of young adult Arab American Muslims. Moreover, I argue that the newest generation of Muslims, designated "Generation Islam" by mainstream media outlets, exhibits a distinguishing feature that older cohorts of Arab American Muslims do not possess: namely, they are more likely to disidentify with whiteness. My research demonstrates how this generation of Arab American Muslims is far more likely than previous generations to situate their racial identity as non-white "racialized" subjects.

T1  - Urban Career Women and Stress in Southeast Asia
AN  - 1429636589; 201336299
AB  - A theoretical and conceptual review of stressors facing urban career women in southeast Asian countries is presented within a chronological age-bracket framework. Similarities and distinguishing differences from findings in the United States, Europe, and Australia are discussed. Younger attractive women were more likely to encounter sexual harassment and be taken less seriously at work. In the middle years, family demands with young children pose more of a distraction for the women. Southeast Asian career women have an edge compared to their Western counterparts in better access to support for household duties and child-minding from live-in maids and parents. However, they are expected to care for elderly parents and be responsible for efficient home management. In higher management appointments, they face similar stressors in critical perceptions of their authority and leadership by both men and women subordinates. Management initiatives to inculcate attitude change and transparency in addressing convoluted and irrelevant gender-role expectations can yield substantial organizational benefits.

T1  - Ingroup norms, intergroup contact and intergroup anxiety as predictors of the outgroup attitudes of majority and minority youth
AN  - 1417521414; 201332183
AB  - This study focused on the interplay of perceived parental and peer norms and the quality of intergroup contact in predicting outgroup attitudes among majority and minority youth. In addition, the role of intergroup anxiety on the contact-attitude association was studied simultaneously with the effects of social norms. 225 adolescents (93 Finnish majority and 132 Russian-speaking minority youth) were surveyed. As was hypothesized, the effects of intergroup contact and social norms on the outgroup attitudes were different depending on the group status: perceived norms and the quality of intergroup contact had a joint effect on outgroup attitudes only among minority youth. While perceived norms and contact experiences affected the outgroup attitudes of majority group members independently of each other, minority group members' negative contact experiences were associated with negative attitudes towards the majority only when the perceived ingroup norms supported the expression of negative attitudes. Surprisingly, intergroup anxiety mediated the contact-attitude association only in minority youth, and the effect of contact quality on outgroup attitudes was stronger among the minority than among the majority. The results are discussed in relation to the specific intergroup context in question. It is suggested that both positive ingroup norms and pleasant personal contact experiences play a crucial role in the formation of positive attitudes among minority as well as majority youth, and in some contexts positive norms may be even more important than positive intergroup contact.

T1  - Attacks on Indian students: the commerce of denial in Australia
AN  - 896165630; 201120130
AB  - The issue of racist violence appeared in the Australian media and politics in mid-2009 following a spate of attacks on international students in Melbourne and Sydney. The racist aspect of these attacks was downplayed, authorities describing them as 'opportunistic' and a 'regrettable fact of urban life'. The denial of racism is a familiar hallmark of contemporary racism; for some scholars, it is a defining criterion of what has been called the 'new racism'. But the denial of racism around the attacks on Indian international students also had an economic imperative. Negative media coverage within India posed a substantial threat to the AUS $18.6 billion international education export market, with potential students and sponsors becoming concerned about their security should they elect to study in Australia. Data from the Challenging Racism project provide compelling evidence on the racist context of the attacks. The Indian media and politicians maintained an outraged position on the attacks, affecting student interest in Australia. And as the substantial economic costs became clearer, Australian governments came to more openly acknowledge a racist element to the attacks, also hinting at structural issues regarding community relations and attitudes which required policy attention.

T1  - Observers' benefit finding for victims: Consequences for perceived moral obligations
AN  - 881468853; 201116335
AB  - In three studies we examined how observers making meaning of victimization by finding benefits for the victim leads to the perception that victims are morally obligated to help others and not do harm. In Experiment 1, participants perceived a victim as having greater moral obligations when the meaning of victimization was considered for the victim rather than the perpetrator. This effect on moral obligations was mediated by the extent to which participants believed victims should have found benefits. Experiments 2 and 3 examined the consequences when victims fail or fulfill their moral obligations. Greater social distance from a victim who did harm was sought when participants focused on the meaning of victimization for the victim as compared to the perpetrator. Less social distance from a victim who helped was sought when participants focused on the meaning of victimization for the victim as compared to the perpetrator or when they made no meaning. These studies show that how observers make meaning of victimization has implications for subsequent responses to victims. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - The Influence of Exemplar Versus Prototype-Based Media Primes on Racial/Ethnic Evaluations
AN  - 907928728; 201124734
AB  - This study examined the individual and combined effects of exposure to positive Latino exemplars and prototypes in the media on White audience members' attitudes about and judgments regarding Latinos in society. Although it was expected that exposure to these favorable models would promote positive evaluations of Latinos among White consumers, the extent to which one mode of presentation could be privileged in the production of more beneficial outcomes was uncertain based on existing research. These results cautiously indicate that while prototypes may offer some advantages in terms of reducing stereotyping, both exemplar- and prototype-based characterizations of positive race-related media content (alone and in combination) can positively influence consumers' perceptions of target racial/ethnic groups.

T1  - The Social Psychology of the 2008 U.S. Presidential Election
AN  - 835113959; 201102025
AB  - This article introduces the 16 articles appearing in the 2009 and 2010 volumes of Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy that were submitted in response to a call for papers on 'The Social Psychology of the 2008 United States Presidential Election.' The papers touch a wide array of election topics, comparing the backgrounds and values of voters and nonvoters, those voting for different candidates, and those who choose which candidates they support early vs. late during the campaign. These papers, together with several others on media representations of candidates, highlight the continuing presence of race in shaping political attitudes and preferences, and also emphasize the evolution of American prejudices in the election process, from overt rejection of individuals who are racially different, to qualified political support under certain circumstances. Other papers in the collection focus on the role of gender as well as race, and also on some of the many ways in which presidential elections reflect and shape the self-concepts of American voters.

T1  - The Politics of Habitus: Publics, Blackness, and Community Activism in Salvador, Brazil
AN  - 754043895; 201053270
AB  - Abstract This paper explores how politics is experienced by actors who mediate neighborhood organizations and formal political institutions in the Northeastern city of Salvador da Bahia, in Brazil. It is based on a series of ethnographic interviews in 2004 among identified community leaders in the city's poorer neighborhoods, with attention to their politics of habitus--their socially-situated modes of expression of political proclivities. While all of our informants identified themselves as Black and identified racial structures as shaping their lives, their understandings and evaluations of formal politics were divided. Those who only mediated between the neighborhood and formal institutions were critical of the world of politics and its polluting influence. Those who were also involved in mediating publics tended to experience formal politics as unjust but ultimately accessible through legitimate Black political action. This distinction helps account for the difficulty in mobilizing around a reformist political project and adds a local and political dimension to the understanding of race relations in Brazil.

T1  - 'Reasonable accommodation' in Quebec: the limits of participation and dialogue
AN  - 754044619; 201053351
AB  - This article explores the Bouchard-Taylor Commission, a 2007-8 government consultation that was established in Quebec to study interculturalism, secularism and national identity, in response to what had become known as the 'reasonable accommodation debates' on the extent to which minority and immigrant cultural practices could be accommodated. The focus of this exploration is on two aspects of the Commission: the citizens' forums that were a part of its deliberative process; and the ways in which it responded to the idea of crisis. Through an analysis of aspects of the Commission's final report, the ways in which the Commission was structured and the media representations of the Commission, this article argues that, despite the spirit of equality and fairness to which the commissioners were committed and the praise it received from some members of immigrant and minority groups, the Commission ended up reinforcing the racialised hierarchies and exclusions that it wanted to redress.

T1  - The power of racial scripts: What the history of Mexican immigration to the United States teaches us about relational notions of race
AN  - 748324153
AB  - This article examines Mexican immigration to the United States after the passage of the 1924 Immigration Act to better understand the construction of racial categories. Unlike traditional studies of Mexican immigrants in the United States, this article focuses on how discourses about other racialized groups, principally Indians, African Americans, and Asians, were crucial in informing people what "Mexican" meant at this time. The post-1924 Immigration Act period is significant in cementing negative cultural constructions of Mexicans that last into the present day and thus is a key place to look to understand these racial constructions. The article draws on immigration hearings, debates, correspondence, and newspaper articles on Mexican immigration demonstrating how immigration discourse was central in cuing people what "Mexican" meant at this time.

T1  - The White Savior Film and Reviewers' Reception
AN  - 733868862
AB  - This article documents the collective interpretations of film reviewers, a position typically associated with individual aesthetic judgment rather than socially shared scripts of explanation. Drawing on the reviews of a feature film with implicit racial content, produced in the context of a supposedly "color-blind" era, this article documents how reviewers constitute a racialized interpretive community. Reviewers rely on specific cultural frameworks to both contest and reproduce the notion of a "post-racial" society. These interpretations equate nonwhites with pathological and dysfunctional traits, frame hard work as a white normative characteristic, and construct deterministic views of both Hollywood's ability to represent progressive racial representations and the educational system's potential. This analysis illustrates how film reviews operate as mediating voices between producer and consumer, and in so doing, the interpretations of the film serve as "common-sensed" mappings of the contested terrain of contemporary race relations.

T1  - 'Reciprocal recognitions': race, class and subjectivity in Tony Harrison's The Loiners
AN  - 754044660; 201053369
AB  - Over the last four decades, the work of Tony Harrison has won him the status of England's alternative poet laureate, some of it reaching a mass audience through the medium of film and television. At its heart lies a radical republicanism often expressing itself through an impassioned dialectic between race, class and culture. Yet, despite the honours and critical acclaim that have punctuated his career, this aspect of his work has been less explored. Here, Nicholson examines the seminal influence on Harrison s poetry of his time in Nigeria, with particularly reference to his early collection The Loiners, and relates it to the analysis of colonialism developed by Frantz Fanon.

T1  - Hearing it From Jon Stewart: The Impact of the Daily Show on Public Attentiveness to Politics
AN  - 743053625; 201032518
AB  - This study examines the impact of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, an American political comedy show, on public attentiveness to politics. I found that watching the show was positively related to following the issues that were covered with relative frequency by the program (e.g., the Afghanistan War in 2002 and news about the presidential candidates in 2004) among politically inattentive viewers. As viewers' political attentiveness increased, however, the magnitude of the positive relationship decreased. These findings, in light of those from previous research on the show, call for further investigations of the potential effect of the program and others of its ilk on the U.S. democratic system. Adapted from the source document.
