T1  - Why does segregation prevent conflict in some regions but not others? Interrogating social distance amid ethnic conflicts in Jos, Nigeria
AN  - 2697225744
AB  - This paper revisits the longstanding question of why segregation douses ethnic tensions in some places but exacerbates them in others. Anchored on the concept of social distance and drawing on empirical evidence from Jos, Nigeria’s hotbed of ethnoterritorial conflict, this article provides a nuanced analysis of why segregation mediates both the emergence and the prevention of ethnic conflict. In the examined case study, the role of social distance in conflict mitigation varies according to neighbourhood type. Animosity was already deep-seated across the region when social distancing – the effect of partition and segregation – was cemented following the outbreak of conflict in some communities in 2001. Yet the conflict spread to some ethnically unmixed neighbourhoods but not others. In conflict-affected areas, social distance did not avert future conflicts compared to neighbourhoods where the initial conflict was avoided. However, past conflict is not a predictor of future outbreaks in socially distanced neighbourhoods given that in the areas that avoided future conflicts, social distance occurred simultaneously with extensive informal bi-communal leadership engagements. Therefore, the paper shows that even imperfect unmixing can dampen violence when combined with observable leadership engagement.

T1  - Intersections of class, lifestyle and politics. New observations from Norway
AN  - 2681283700
AB  - Although social class was once central to political sociology, it has become increasingly less so; many analysts now believe that one’s class position is less important in determining political attitudes and political party preferences. Simultaneously, more attention has been paid to what might be called the culturalization of politics, as epitomized by the US culture wars and stereotypes like the “latte-drinking liberal.” Here, political attitudes are regarded as primarily structured by people’s lifestyles and broader way of life. But do political preferences have to be explained by either relations of sociomaterial conditions (e.g. class) or cultural orientations (e.g. status and lifestyles)? In this article, we argue in favor of an approach that aims to reconcile these factors, allowing for the empirical mapping of whether and how they intersect in shaping political party preferences. We investigate this by using detailed Norwegian survey data to measure the extent to which intraclass heterogeneity in political party choices can be accounted for by the interaction between class and lifestyle. We employ a novel combination of Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) and Chi-Squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID). In drawing on constructed models of the social space and the space of lifestyles, we show that there are important correspondences between these spaces and that their interaction may help account for party choices. The results highlight the need for a more complex account than that suggested in recent works of cultural stratification research.

T1  - Neighbourhood selection and neighbourhood matching: Choices, outcomes and social distance
AN  - 2645796763
AB  - In this article, we ask how well Australian households are matched to their neighbourhood social environments. We broadly replicate a previous study of matching and ask to what extent households live in communities that are similar in socio-economic status to their characteristics. And, when households move, do they relocate in such a way as to increase similarity to their neighbours? The processes are at the heart of understanding the urban structure, how it changes over time and the links to urban inequality. The article uses data on household incomes from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamic (HILDA) Survey to measure the degree of similarity between households and their neighbours. We study the variation in matching for the population as a whole, and by quintiles of median neighbourhood income. We also measure how individuals that change neighbourhoods increase their similarity to the destination neighbourhood. We find that with respect to matching there is considerable diversity in the levels of matching; and that with respect to residential change, households in general do not make major shifts to increase matching when we control for housing tenure and other household characteristics. There is a need for further replications to understand the nature of matching and the outcomes.

T1  - Migration, Social Exclusion, and Subjective Well-Being: Evidence from China Labor Dynamics Survey
AN  - 2660383454
AB  - Drawing upon data from the China Labor Dynamics Survey, this study examines the mediating role of social exclusion between migrant status and subjective well-being. Our empirical findings suggest that not only current migrants are socially excluded in the cities of destination but also returned migrants are insufficiently reintegrated into their villages of origin. The experienced social exclusion, in particular, the lack of social support, the feeling of vulnerability, and the deficiency in the sense of community persistently undermines the subjective well-being of both current and returned migrants. Our findings shed new light on how migration decisions could affect people’s perceptions of their lives and create inequality across social groups.

T1  - Linking LGBT inclusion and national innovative capacity
AN  - 2620906489
AB  - This paper investigates the relationship between the social inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people, and technological innovation. It empirically establishes that LGBT inclusion helps foster human capital skills, thus strengthening national innovative capacity. Exploiting cross-country data, this research provides suggestive evidence that social tolerance towards homosexuality is positively correlated with the economic complexity index, a novel measure of cross-country differences in innovative capabilities. Individual-level analyses, based on data from the World Values Survey, reveal that surveyed respondents who self-report tolerance towards homosexual acts tend to have positive attitudes towards technological innovation, ceteris paribus. This lends credence to the international evidence. Further analyses indicate that the link between LGBT inclusion and innovation is partially mediated through the accumulation of human capital. The main findings suggest that the social exclusion of LGBT people, at least to some extent, impedes long-run economic development by hindering innovative activities.

T1  - Restructuring intimacies during COVID-19: Women in Community Networks
AN  - 2658990078
AB  - As a concept, intimacy has been a powerful way of understanding how the ongoing pandemic has affected gender relations, expression and access. The pandemic’s effects on women have been disproportionately adverse, with social distancing, intermittent lockdowns and travel restrictions that have changed the socialisation scenario, impacting relationships. Women’s expression and connections are increasingly mediated through technology which is shaped by gendered dynamics of access and availability.Community networks (CNs) and community radio stations (CRs) have been central to ensuring last-mile connectivity through the use of frugal technologies. This has been an effective source of information dissemination, especially over the course of the pandemic. Through qualitative data from CRs in India, we show that care work and intimacy are strong elements of communications as mediated by CNs and CRs. Against the backdrop of gendered care work, we explore the conceptual depth that different aspects of intimacies and intimate economies offer to understand communications as mediated through CNs and CRs over the course of the pandemic, at the levels of personal expression, interpersonal communications and community conversations. We seek to understand how these forms of mediating technologies play a role in furthering, challenging and reimagining our understanding of intimacies as a concept.

T1  - Justify my love: Cognitive dissonance reduction among perpetrators of online and offline infidelity
AN  - 2609042305
AB  - A longitudinal survey study was conducted to examine which strategies for reducing cognitive dissonance were used among men engaging in infidelity. Data were collected in two waves, 1 month apart (ntime1 = 1514, ntime2 = 425), from a sample of male users of Ashley Madison, a “married dating” site targeting users who are seeking to engage in infidelity. Because perpetrators of infidelity may justify their behaviors differently depending on whether they cheated in an online environment, both online and offline infidelity behaviors were considered. Results indicated that attitude change and self-concept change were positively related to online infidelity, while only self-concept change was positively related to offline infidelity, suggesting their differential effectiveness for various communication media. Self-concept change, attitude change, and denial of responsibility were negatively related to psychological discomfort and perceived negative impact at time 2, indicating their relative success for reducing negative psychological outcomes compared to other strategies such as adding consonant cognitions.

T1  - The smartphone and its punishment: Social distancing of cellular transgressors in ultra-Orthodox Jewish society, from 2G to the Corona pandemic
AN  - 2575534943
AB  - Over the past 20 years, the leaders of Israel's ultra-Orthodox (haredi) community carried out an intensive campaign against the diffusion of mobile phones in their enclave society. It included a variety of resistance strategies that escalated in parallel to the consistent increase in mobile phone penetration into the community. If at first the "cellphone danger" was contained by the successful "kosherphone," a new threat appeared in the form of the smartphone. In this article we explore the severe rabbinic sanctions directed against those who deviate from the communal norm by using a smartphone. We analyze the general "lawfare" strategy of social distancing they adopted, and offer a close reading of the specific religious-law decrees, interpreting them through the historical and legal lens of halakhah (Jewish law). This socio-legal analysis constructs the way haredi leadership understands the role of the smartphone in two contexts. One is the rapidly changing contemporary media environment; the other is the social dynamic affecting this island community, as it encounters the surrounding national and global culture through digital media. The article concludes with a preliminary analysis of the implications of the Corona pandemic on the campaign against the smartphone.

T1  - Social representations of ‘social distancing’ in response to COVID-19 in the UK media
AN  - 2548553567
AB  - The emergence and spread of a new pandemic, COVID-19, have raised topics of concern for health professionals, policy makers and publics across the globe. Governments have struggled to find the right policies to stop disease transmission, but all have introduced social distancing. In the United Kingdom this has come to be understood as staying at home and, when outside, maintaining a physical distance of approximately two metres between oneself and others. In this article, the authors examine the emergence of this new social representation as portrayed in one UK broadsheet and one tabloid with the widest circulation: The Times and The Sun, between early March and early April 2020. Using social representations theory and thematic analysis, the authors show that social distancing struggled to emerge from underneath government obfuscation. It was first seen as a threat to normal life, which in modernity is predicated on mobility; it was later portrayed as a threat to social order; and finally perceived as a burden that, like the lockdown (its conceptual twin), needed to be lifted.

T1  - Racial Attitudes Through a Partisan Lens
AN  - 2543258360
AB  - The conventional wisdom is that racial attitudes, by forming through early socialization processes, are causally prior to most things political, including whites' party identifications. Yet a broad literature demonstrates that partisanship can shape mass attitudes. The author argues that this influence extends even to presumptively fundamental predispositions like racial attitudes. The study applies cross-lagged models to panel data from the 1990s and 2000s to demonstrate that whites align their racial attitudes with their party loyalties. The results demonstrate that partisanship has a more pronounced influence in the latter time period, which is consistent with a view that changes in the political context can make partisanship a more likely causal force on other attitudes. Racial concerns not only provide a foundation for political conflict: my results reveal that political processes can increase or decrease racial animus.

[...]the physical distancing currently being prescribed by American policy makers is unprecedented in recent times in its scale [5].

[...]it may lead to different outcomes by race/ethnicity than past events [2, 6, 7].

[...]the growing splintering of news media and community, as well as inconsistent recommendations from the U.S. government, has propagated misinformation since the pandemic began has disproportionately influenced dismissals of the dangers of COVID-19 [41].

[...]White populations may be just as unlikely to distance as Black and Hispanic populations in response to COVID-19.

Areas with high shares of Black residents often have cultural hubs for these groups, like churches and barbershops, that shield them from discrimination, encouraging the spread, and adherence, to medical advice [47, 48].

[...]these sites can be used to help people of color select

T1  - Socially-supportive norms and mutual aid of people who use opioids: An analysis of Reddit during the initial COVID-19 pandemic
AN  - 2522847425
AB  - Background: Big events (i.e., unique historical disruptions) like the COVID-19 epidemic and its associated period of social distancing can transform social structures, social interactions, and social norms. Social distancing rules and the fear of infection have greatly reduced face-to-face interactions, increased loneliness, reduced ties to helping institutions, and may also have disrupted the opioid use behaviors of people who use drugs. This research used Reddit to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the social networks and social processes of people who use opioids. Methods: Data were collected from the social media forum, Reddit.com. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. (March 5, 2020, to May 13, 2020), 2,000 Reddit posts were collected from the two most popular opioid subreddits (r/OpiatesRecovery, r/Opiates). Posts were reviewed for relevance to COVID-19 and opioid use resulting in a final sample of 300. Thematic analysis was guided by the Big Events framework. Results: The COVID-19 pandemic was found to create changes in the social networks and daily lives among persons who use opioids. Adaptions to these changes shifted social networks leading to robust social support and mutual aid on Reddit, including sharing and seeking advice on facing withdrawal, dealing with isolation, managing cravings, and accessing recovery resources. Conclusions: Reddit provided an important source of social support and mutual aid for persons who use opioids. Findings indicate online social support networks are beneficial to persons who use opioids, particularly during big events where isolation from other social support resources may occur.

T1  - The Development and Validation of COVID-19 Prevention Behaviour Scale on Female Hungarian Population
AN  - 2519893605
AB  - In the emergency situation of an ongoing global pandemic, disease prevention behaviour is essential. The majority of studies assess preventive behaviour through relevant unidimensional questions, but this approach is not necessarily the best way to conceptualize prevention, as health maintenance guidelines cover several different areas of possible individual precautionary and preventive practices. The aim of the study is the development and validation of a multidimensional COVID-19 prevention behaviour scale for the Hungarian speaking population (Covid-19-PBS). The items address major aspects related to preventive behaviour towards COVID-19 inspired by preliminary pandemic studies and the WHO prevention recommendations. 612 eligible female individuals were included in the study; the sample was recruited from the Hungarian general population, and participants were between the ages of 18 and 65 years old. According to preliminary studies women are more likely to engage proactively in prevention behaviour; they perceive the risk of a disease more profoundly, and even disease information seeking was more prevalent among women. An exploratory factor analysis was performed for this new scale, followed by a confirmatory factor analysis. According to our results, the model fit indices are adequate (CFI= .928, RMSEA= .064). Cronbach's alpha was used to examine the reliability of the factors; the internal validity of the scale is good (a = .78). The final instrument contains 11 items with responses scored on a 4-point Likert scale and 3 domains: general hygiene, social distancing, and COVID-19 information-seeking behaviour. Our results have revealed that the new scale has good psychometric properties and may be a useful instrument for assessing COVID-19 preventive behaviour across women. This tool can be useful for professionals in order to develop more effective and targeted prevention programs especially in the female population, as the instrument was validated only in women up to this stage. This scale can serve the purpose of improving individual and collective adjustment to prevention regulations during the epidemic.

T1  - The COVID-19 Pandemic and Psychosocial Outcomes Across Age Through the Stress and Coping Framework
AN  - 2499918426
AB  - Background and Objectives The emergence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the measures implemented to curb its spread may have deleterious effects on mental health. Older adults may be at increased risk for adverse psychosocial outcomes because opportunities to remain socially connected have diminished. Research is needed to better understand the impact of pandemic-related stress on mental health. The purpose of this study is 3-fold: (a) to examine the influences of COVID-19 pandemic-related stress on depression, anxiety, and loneliness; (b) to assess the mediating role of coping style and social support; and (c) to investigate whether these relationships vary across age. Research Design and Methods Participants (N = 1,318) aged 18–92 years completed an online survey assessing pandemic-related stress, mental health, social support, coping, and their experiences with social distancing, during the initial implementation of social distancing measures in the United States. Results Social support and coping style were found to relate to psychosocial outcomes. Avoidant coping was the strongest mediator of the relationship between pandemic-related stress and psychosocial outcomes, particularly depression. Avoidant coping more strongly mediated the relationship between stress and depression in younger adults compared to older adults. Discussion and Implications Results were consistent with the stress and coping framework and recent work highlighting older adults' resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings highlight the associations between positive coping behaviors and psychosocial well-being and indicate that older adults may use unique adaptive mechanisms to preserve well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.

T1  - Unauthorized migrants in Israel: The contribution of threat variables and personal and community resources to the perception of social distance toward migrants from Africa
AN  - 2493134807
AB  - To examine the contribution of background variables, threat variables, and personal and community resources to participants' perceived social distance toward unauthorized migrants. Study participants were 168 Israeli citizens/longtime residents of three disadvantaged neighborhoods in Israel, who filled out self‐report questionnaires. We applied a hierarchical regression model and also examined the direct and indirect contribution of the abovementioned variables to the social distance of these longtime residents toward unauthorized migrants in Israel. All participants reported high levels of social distance, irrespective of their physical proximity to the migrants. Cultural disparity was perceived as a major threat. Residents who lived in close proximity to migrants particularly expressed concern about harm to their economic well‐being. Although political preference had no statistically significant direct effect on social distance, the mediation analysis revealed a complete indirect mechanism of the effect of political preference on social distance through threat perceptions. The research broadened our understanding of longtime neighborhood residents' perceived social distance toward migrants.It migrants. It also contributes to the development of knowledge, which will form the basis for intervention programs in the community

T1  - Living Through COVID-19: Social Distancing, Computer-Mediated Communication, and Well-Being in Sexual Minority and Heterosexual Adults
AN  - 2489964518
AB  - COVID-19 has had far-reaching effects on people’s lives, with evidence of a disproportionate impact on marginalized groups. Given existing health disparities and research on minority stress, COVID-19 may have uniquely impacted psychological well-being among sexual minorities. In an online survey of adults in the U.S. (N = 1,007) conducted in April 2020, we examined differences between sexual minority and heterosexual participants in psychological well-being, social distancing, computer-mediated communication, and COVID-19-related worry and experiences. Sexual minorities reported lower thriving and greater psychological distress, social distancing, computer-mediated communication, and COVID-19 worry and experiences than heterosexual participants. Social distancing and distress were positively correlated among sexual minorities and more frequent computer-mediated communication predicted greater thriving across groups. Path analyses showed sexual minorities’ poorer psychological well-being was mediated by their greater COVID-19 worry and social distancing, in particular. These findings shed light on the distinct impact of COVID-19 on sexual minorities.

T1  - Telehealth and COVID-19: Using technology to accelerate the curve on access and quality healthcare for citizens in India
AN  - 2551249976
AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic has reinstated the importance of telehealth as a business model for accelerating the accessibility of healthcare and improving the quality of healthcare for citizens of a country. Telehealth service has a tremendous potential in a developing country like India where the healthcare facilities in India are heavily concentrated in urban cities while their majority (67%) of the population resides in rural areas. At the same time, a high teledensity of almost 90% supports telehealth overall reach. However, the growth of telehealth in India till now has been sluggish but the corona virus (COVID-19) crisis has redefined the telehealth ecosystem by reducing the risk of infection through person-to-person contact. In this study, we explore the perception of healthcare users towards telehealth services and analyze the key enablers for the telehealth services in the current scenario. We collected data from 1170 participants through personal interview. The results of the study shows a considerable segment of the population is having high healthcare need, have aspirations for accessing better healthcare for themselves and their family members and use ICT to a significant extent. At the same time, they have positive attitude towards telehealth and socio-demographic factors like age, geographical location, educational qualification, family size affects the attitude towards telehealth services. The results of the study shows there is a significant market for telehealth services in India to be explored by the technology firms, hospitals and other healthcare stakeholders and going forward it has an enormous capability to transform the complete healthcare ecosystem, especially in developing countries like India post the COVID-19 crisis.

T1  - Intolerance of COVID-19-Related Uncertainty and Negative Emotions among Chinese Adolescents: A Moderated Mediation Model of Risk Perception, Social Exclusion and Perceived Efficacy
AN  - 2628161404
AB  - The uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated negative emotions, especially among adolescents, who feel unable to tolerate the uncertainty of the epidemic. However, the mechanism by which the intolerance of COVID-19-related uncertainty (COVID-19 IU) affects negative emotions in adolescents remains unclear. This study explored the underlying mechanism from COVID-19 IU to negative emotions using a moderated mediation model in adolescents. In total, 3037 teenagers completed a cross-sectional survey including measures of COVID-19 IU, risk perception, social exclusion, perceived efficacy, and negative emotions. The results showed that COVID-19 IU positively predicted negative emotions and that risk perception and social exclusion mediated this relationship. In addition, both the direct effect of COVID-19 IU on negative emotions and the mediating effect of risk perception on this relationship were moderated by perceived efficacy; in particular, COVID-19 IU had a greater impact on negative emotions among adolescents with lower levels of perceived efficacy. These findings suggest that COVID-19 IU is closely associated with negative emotions among adolescents and that effective measures should be taken to enable adolescents to improve their perceived efficacy and develop a reasonable perception of risk, help them eliminate the stigma of the disease, and strengthen their connections with society.

AB  - Habitualmente se relaciona el atraso económico con la exclusión social de las áreas rurales. El texto aborda de manera independiente el efecto que tiene el hábitat -rural o urbano- dentro de los factores que inciden en la vulnerabilidad. Se analiza el indicador AROPE -riesgo de pobreza y exclusión- mediante un modelo de regresión logística que incluye el efecto de los factores -sociodemográficos, estructuras de hogar y vinculación agraria- y la interacción con el hábitat, considerado como variable moderadora. Los resultados muestran que el medio rural reduce las diferencias en vulnerabilidad y proporciona un entorno menos desigual entre sus habitantes, debido a la internalización que hacen las estructuras de hogar de la posición periférica de las áreas rurales en el acceso a los servicios del bienestar.Alternate abstract:In general, social exclusion in rural areas is attributed to economic backwardness. The paper examines the rural-urban habitat contribution over the factors that produce vulnerability. The AROPE index -risk of poverty and exclusion- is analyzed by a logistic regression model that considers -socio-demographic household structures and agrarian bonding- as factors and their interaction with the habitat as a moderator variable. The findings show, by one hand, rural habitat reduces the vulnerability differences producing a less unequal environment among inhabitants. By another hand, it implies the internalization inside the households of the inequalities in the access of the rural population to the welfare services.

T1  - ‘When the Waves Roll High’: Religious Coping among the Amish and Mennonites during the COVID-19 Pandemic
AN  - 2576402146
AB  - Religious beliefs, practices, and social support facilitate coping with psychologically distressful events and circumstances. However, COVID-19 and governmental mandates for social distancing and isolation make in-person communal forms of religious coping difficult. While some congregations began holding virtual rituals, this was not an option for Amish and conservative Mennonite groups that restrict communication and media technologies as a religious sacrament. Governmental mandates placed a disproportionate burden on these groups whose members could not conduct rituals or interact virtually with other members and family. What religious coping strategies did the Amish and Mennonites use to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic given their restricted ability to participate in in-person rituals? We collected data from The Budget and The Diary, two Amish and Mennonite correspondence newspapers, which provide information on the experiences of community members. We content analyzed all entries from March 2020 to April 2020 and identified several themes related to religious coping focused on the positive benefits of the pandemic, specifically how it helps and reminds the Amish and Mennonites to refocus on the simple and important things in life, including God, spirituality, family, tradition, gardening, and other at-home hobbies, all of which reflect their religious commitment to a slower pace of life.

T1  - Between gang talk and prohibition: The transfer of blame for County Lines
AN  - 2543834672
AB  - Background The drug supply model termed 'County Lines' has generated extensive attention over recent years in the UK. Associated street violence, the involvement of young people and exploitation have been the source of intense concern. However, little discussion has sought to situate this drug market 'phenomenon' in relation to recent austerity policies and intensifying social exclusion. Drawing on Douglas' (1995) conceptualisation of scapegoating as a process of blame transfer, this paper provides a critical analysis of the ways that attention has been diverted from the social conditions that are arguably fundamental to driving involvement in this supply model and its associated harms. Methods A critical discourse analysis was undertaken on publicly available content on the subject of County Lines. Sources included newspaper articles, other media outputs, official publications and parliamentary debates. These were analysed to identify scapegoating discourses. Once established, these were theoretically developed by drawing on a range of extant perspectives. Results Three forms of scapegoating related to County Lines were identified. A familiar process was found in the form of 'gang talk', with County Lines reduced as a product of these 'evil' groups. A notably less familiar outlet of blame was identified in the form of middle class cocaine users, with a range of powerful actors attempting to denounce this 'imagined' population as fuelling the market. A final form was identified in relation to drug legalisation campaigns, with an unwavering focus on prohibition also arguably serving to obfuscate underlying structural drivers. Discussion Scapegoating for the issue of County Lines has taken multiple forms. The role of these discourses in diverting attention away from the social conditions that drive these market harms should be recognised and challenged. In their place, political economy and addressing social exclusion should be at the fore of policy discussions.

T1  - A Corpus-Assisted Discourse Study of Attitudes toward Spanish as a Heritage Language in Florida
AN  - 2521486230
AB  - Spanish speakers constitute the largest heritage language community in the US. The state of Florida is unusual in that, on one hand, it has one of the highest foreign-born resident rates in the country, most of whom originate from Latin America—but on the other hand, Florida has a comparatively low Spanish language vitality. In this exploratory study of attitudes toward Spanish as a heritage language in Florida, we analyzed two corpora (one English: 5,405,947 words, and one Spanish: 525,425 words) consisting of recent Twitter data. We examined frequencies, collocations, concordance lines, and larger text segments. The results indicate predominantly negative attitudes toward Spanish on the status dimension, but predominantly positive attitudes on the solidarity dimension. Despite the latter, transmission and use of Spanish were found to be affected by pressure to assimilate, and fear of negative societal repercussions. We also found Spanish to be used less frequently than English to tweet about attitudes; instead, Spanish was frequently used to attract Twitter users’ attention to specific links in the language. We discuss the implications of our findings (should they generalize) for the future of Spanish in Florida, and we provide directions for future research.

T1  - Meeting social needs and loneliness in a time of social distancing under COVID-19: A comparison among young, middle, and older adults
AN  - 2510494012
AB  - Loneliness has a significant impact on the health and wellbeing of people. The COVID-19 pandemic has demanded individuals to socially distance, which has implications for loneliness and social isolation. This cross-sectional study explored the ways in which people in the United States (N = 412) are meeting their social needs in a time of social distancing, how these activities relate to levels of loneliness, and any differences among young, middle-aged, and older adults. Results indicated higher levels of loneliness and social isolation for the entire sample and across the three age groups from pre- to during COVID-19 with younger adults experiencing higher levels of emotional loneliness during COVID-19. The extent to which the activities were related to loneliness was only found among the young adults and older adults where outdoor meet-ups, talking on the phone, and texting was associated with lower levels of loneliness among the young adults, and engaging in social media and talking on the phone was associated with lower levels of loneliness among the older adults. The findings support social work and public health recommendations for addressing loneliness during times of social distancing under the COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises.

T1  - Women Heads of State and Covid-19 Policy Responses
AN  - 2506655971
AB  - Anecdotal media reports suggest that countries led by women politicians have had better outcomes from combating the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper systematizes the evidence by using data on the presence of women heads of state and COVID-19 related infection and death rates in 144 countries. The regression results show that: (1) there is a negative and statistically significant correlation between COVID-19 outcomes and the presence of a woman head of state; (2) there is no evidence that countries led by women responded faster than countries led by men in implementing social distancing measures to “flatten” the infection curve; and (3) countries led by women have a higher rate of universal healthcare coverage than countries led by men; if the countries led by men had comparable levels of investment in a widely available healthcare system, their outcomes from fighting the pandemic would be similar.HIGHLIGHTSCountries with women heads of state report fewer cases and deaths related to COVID-19.These states also have higher rates of universal healthcare coverage.Women’s preferences for public spending on healthcare made these countries better prepared for the pandemic.There is no evidence that women leaders were faster to implement social distancing measures.Countries led by men could have similar outcomes with investment in higher healthcare coverage.

T1  - Social exclusion reduces happiness by creating expectations of future rejection
AN  - 2490840470
AB  - Social exclusion reduces happiness and well-being partly by creating a generalized expectation of future rejection and lack of belonging. An experiment (N = 709) using a guided imagination task found that social exclusion led to reduced feelings of happiness. The effect was mediated by future expectations, as participants who imagined a vivid exclusion scenario thought they were more likely to experience actual rejection in the coming weeks. A correlational survey focusing on individual differences found a similar pattern. People who felt a strong sense of general belonging thought they were less likely to experience future rejection than people with weak belonging, and they also reported higher levels of current happiness.

T1  - How social exclusion and high self-esteem negatively affect consumer attitudes toward anthropomorphized products
AN  - 2489784702
AB  - Empirical studies have demonstrated that the anthropomorphism of products has positive effects on consumers' attitudes and behaviors toward those products. However, our findings in two experiments suggest that product anthropomorphism might produce negative effects under certain conditions. People who were socially excluded and who had high self-esteem evaluated anthropomorphized products more negatively than did those with low self-esteem, and the distinctiveness motivation mediated the effect of this interaction of social exclusion and self-esteem on attitudes toward anthropomorphized products. Our findings extend extant knowledge of product anthropomorphism and provide marketing managers with practical suggestions for applying marketing strategies that utilize anthropomorphized products.

T1  - COVID-19 and Human Connection: Collaborative Research on Loneliness and Online Worlds from a Socially-Distanced Academy
AN  - 2472333748
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in protracted social isolation across the globe due to the implementation of social distancing to limit the transmission of the virus. People have relied overwhelmingly on digital technology/social media to manage physical distancing while maintaining social connection, resulting in concerns about loneliness and technology's impacts during isolation. Cairns worked with students from her undergraduate methods course to research people's experiences related to COVID-19 and their connection strategies during isolation. The study served multiple purposes, including (1) providing academic insight into the variety of experiences with social isolation as well as technologies/platforms for connecting during COVID-19, including those technologies used in the classroom, (2) encouraging students to explore and discuss what they were facing during the pandemic, and (3) providing creative anthropological research methods training during a time of social isolation for students. This work finds that COVID-19 has fundamentally re-contextualized the relationships between people, technology, and loneliness. While individual experiences during COVID-19 are nuanced, technology served to facilitate connections and provided opportunities for new modes of interaction and meaningful relationship-building during the pandemic. This work also informs future pedagogical approaches to teaching during times of crisis and/or at a distance.

T1  - Securing decent incomes at a crossroads: On the legal feasibility of a Framework Directive on Minimum Income
AN  - 2466009027
AB  - In spite of having been an alleged priority for the EU and the Member States over the last ten years, the number of people in situations of poverty and social exclusion remains unacceptably high. As the Covid-19 crisis unfolds, the EU is left at a crossroads that will likely be determinant for its future. This contribution explores the possibility of taking the solidarity route at this crossroads by activating the social competences in the form of a Framework Directive on Minimum Income. To this end, this contribution first discusses the context of this proposal and the importance of minimum income schemes in improving the living standards of the population. From there, it explores the possibilities for legal action under the current Treaty framework. It then emphasizes the importance of choosing adequate methodologies in such an instrument when aiming to secure adequate incomes to live a life in dignity in any given Member State. It is argued that this is equally important to comply with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. Ultimately, the EU will have to bet on its social dimension to remain true to its raison-d’être of becoming a social market economy.

T1  - An investigation of the impact of social exclusion on attachment to possessions and saving behaviors
AN  - 2447574550
AB  - Background and objectives: Hoarding disorder (HD) is a debilitating mental illness characterized by extreme difficulty parting with possessions and clutter that can result in dangerous living conditions. One hypothesis about why individuals with HD save possessions is that they possess a pathological attachment to their belongings, which may serve to compensate for unfulfilling interpersonal relationships. However, there is a dearth of empirical work examining this. The current study examined the impact of an experimental manipulation of social exclusion on attachment to possessions and saving behaviors in a sample of individuals with elevated hoarding symptoms. Methods: Participants (n = 117) were selected for scoring above the non-clinical mean on a measure of hoarding symptoms. Participants were randomized to either be included or excluded in a game of Cyberball. They completed a behavioral discarding task and object attachment measure before and after completion of the game. Results: Study condition was unrelated to in vivo attachment to possessions and saving behaviors during the discarding task. However, a post hoc mediation model showed that greater feelings of rejection, regardless of condition, were associated with greater in vivo attachment to possessions and subsequent number of items saved during the lab task. Limitations: Limitations include the use of a non-clinical and homogeneous sample. Conclusions: Taken together, individuals prone to feelings of rejection may be at risk for developing HD as they may use possessions to cope with interpersonal stress. Results will be discussed in light of implications for theoretical models and potential treatment targets in HD.

T1  - Posttraumatic Stress Related to the Killing of Michael Brown and Resulting Civil Unrest in Ferguson, Missouri: Roles of Protest Engagement, Media Use, Race, and Resilience
AN  - 2458264719
AB  - Objective: A significant body of research has examined the psychological harm of exposure to collective traumas such as disasters (e.g., tornados, hurricanes, mass violence). Less well studied are the mental health effects of exposure to macro-level race-related traumas, such as instances of police violence toward African Americans and subsequent civil unrest that are widely covered by traditional and social media. Method: This study examined posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms in a sample of 936 Black and white residents of the St. Louis, MO, metropolitan statistical area surveyed following the August 2014 fatal shooting of Michael Brown and subsequent civil unrest in Ferguson, MO. We used structural equation modeling to examine direct, indirect, and conditional relationships among race, protest engagement, media use, and resilience on PTS symptoms. Results: Race and protest engagement were directly associated with PTS symptoms, whereas media exposure was indirectly associated with PTS through protest engagement. Resilience had an inverse relationship with PTS symptoms. Conclusion: Our results suggest that social workers should provide mental health resources and interventions for community members experiencing macro-level race-related events and work to address racial injustices that compound trauma and increase risks for posttraumatic difficulties.

Based on an analysis of debates between 2015 and 2018 in the Hong Kong Legislative Council, government statements and documents, media reports, two surveys on local people’s attitudes and an NGO interview, I argue that the government has sought to criminalize asylum-seekers by forcing them to breach Hong Kong’s immigration law. The article suggests that a pragmatic, inclusive approach would help the government to promote ethnic harmony in the territory.

T1  - Developing a Measure of the Impact of COVID‐19 Social Distancing on Household Conflict and Cohesion
AN  - 2441140889
AB  - This report introduces the COVID‐19 Family Environment Scale (CHES), which aims to measure the impact of social distancing due to COVID‐19 on household conflict and cohesion. Existing measures do not capture household experiences relevant to the pandemic, in which families are largely confined to their homes while sharing a life‐threatening situation. Using best practice guidelines, we developed a pool of items and revised them with review by a panel of experts, and cognitive interviewing with community respondents. We administered the CHES by online survey to 3,965 adults. The CHES consists of 15 items for each of two subscales, household conflict (α = .847) and household cohesion (α = .887). Exploratory factor analysis yielded two factors, corresponding to the intended conflict and cohesion items, which accounted for 29% of variance. Confirmatory factor analysis partially supported the 2‐factor model (RMSEA = .057; CFI = .729, TLI = .708, and SRMR = .098). The CHES also contains 25 optional items to describe respondent and household characteristics, and household‐level COVID‐19 exposure. The CHES, publicly available at https://elcentro.sonhs.miami.edu/research/measures-library/covid-19/index.html, provides a tool for measuring the impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on important determinants of resilience in the face of major stressful events. Further work is needed to address the factor structure and establish validity of the CHES.Alternate abstract:Este informe presenta la Escala del Entorno Familiar de la COVID‐19 (COVID‐19 Family Environment Scale, CHES), cuyo fin es medir el efecto del distanciamiento social debido a la COVID‐19 en el conflicto familiar y la cohesión familiar. Las herramientas de medición actuales no captan las experiencias familiares relevantes de la pandemia, en la cual las familias están en su gran mayoría confinadas en sus hogares mientras comparten una situación que pone en riesgo la vida. Utilizando pautas de mejores prácticas, desarrollamos un conjunto de ítems y los revisamos con un grupo de expertos, e hicimos entrevistas cognitivas a personas de la comunidad. Administramos la CHES mediante una encuesta en línea a 3965 adultos. La CHES consta de 15 ítems para cada una de dos subescalas, la de conflicto familiar (α = .847), y la de cohesión familiar (α = .887). El análisis factorial exploratorio dio dos factores correspondientes a los ítems planeados de conflicto y cohesión, que representaron el 22 % de la varianza. El análisis factorial confirmatorio respaldó parcialmente el modelo de dos factores (RMSEA = .057; CFI = .729, TLI = .708 y SRMR = .098). La CHES también contiene 25 ítems opcionales para describir las características de los encuestados y la familia, y el nivel de exposición de la familia a la COVID‐19. La CHES, disponible públicamente en https://elcentro.sonhs.miami.edu/research/measures-library/covid-19/index.html ofrece una herramienta para medir el efecto de la pandemia de la COVID‐19 en determinantes importantes de resiliencia ante situaciones de gran estrés. Se necesitan más trabajos para abordar la estructura factorial y establecer la validez de la CHES.Alternate abstract:本文介绍了COVID‐19家庭环境量表(CHES)，该量表旨在衡量COVID‐19导致的社交距离对家庭冲突和凝聚力的影响。现有的量表不能反映出与新冠疫情有关的家庭经历，在这种情况下，家庭大多数都被限制在家中，同时又面临着共同的对生命有威胁的情况。我们使用了最佳实践指南，开发了一个项目集合，并由专家小组的审查之后修订，还有在和社区受访者的认知访谈完成之后也会加以修改。我们通过在线调查对3965名成年人进行了CHES测试。CHES包括两个子量表，即家庭冲突（α=0.847）和家庭凝聚力（α=0.887）每个子量表有15个项目。探索性因子分析得出两个因子，对应于预期的冲突和凝聚力项目，占方差的22%。验证性性因子分析部分支持了双因子模型（RMSEA = .057；CFI = .729，TLI = .708，SRMR = .098）。CHES还包含25个可选项目，用于描述受访者和家庭特征，以及家庭层面的暴露在COVID‐19情形下的相关情况。CHES的公开网址是，它提供了一种工具，用于衡量COVID-19大流行对重大压力事件中，对复原力有着重要决定性的因素的影响。本研究提出有必要进行进一步的研究专门去针对因素结构和如何建立CHES量表的效度。

T1  - How does health consciousness influence attitudes of elderly people towards traceable agricultural products? Perspectives of the technology acceptance model
AN  - 2421791161
AB  - Recently, internet usage among elderly adults has been increasing and becoming more mainstream; with the ageing population in Taiwan, concerns over health are on the rise, and this is directly related to the products that people eat. The main objectives of this study were to develop an integrated extensibility model incorporating the technology acceptance model and to investigate the impact of health consciousness on elderly adults’ acceptance of technology in relation to traceability information websites in Taiwan. This study used structural equation modelling to analyse the data. The results revealed that elderly people with high health consciousness and high perceived usefulness had more positive attitudes towards products than those with low health consciousness and low perceived usefulness, and those with high health consciousness and high perceived ease of use had more positive attitudes than those with low health consciousness and low perceived ease of use in relation to the agricultural product traceability system.

T1  - From sociality to social distancing: reversing values of solidarity in Italy
AN  - 2431010880
AB  - In March, as many countries vacillated in their response to the emerging COVID‐19 pandemic, Italy emerged as the ghost of a dystopian future. Healthcare workers and ordinary people took to social media with dire warnings about the virus and reports of lives under strict lockdown. ‘State a casa’ (stay at home) quickly coalesced into a moral imperative. An act of self‐preservation for the elderly and other vulnerable groups, for the young and healthy staying at home has become an act of solidarity.

T1  - Links between parental socialization of coping on affect: Mediation by emotion regulation and social exclusion
AN  - 2449286309
AB  - Introduction
Parental socialization of coping strategies is associated with various emotion regulation difficulties and continues to impact individuals during emerging adulthood. As emerging adults’ transition into adulthood, they experience social stressors that put their emotion regulation skills to the test.
Methods
The current study examined the associations of the parental socialization of coping strategies and emotion regulation difficulties with emerging adult positive and negative affect in response to social exclusion. Emerging adults (N = 402, 206 males and 196 females) from a large Southern university in the United States were recruited for the study. Participants completed survey measures of parental socialization of coping, positive and negative affect, and emotion regulation difficulties before engaging in a social exclusion task called Cyberball. After the task, participants completed a measure of positive and negative affect again.
Results
Primary parental socialization of coping was associated with emotion regulation difficulties, both of which were associated with affect after the exclusion task, thus supporting the indirect effect of parental coping socialization on affect through a preexisting variable (i.e., emotion regulation) and a causal manipulation (i.e., exclusion task).
Conclusions
The impact of parental suggestions of coping strategies and emotion regulation difficulties during emerging adulthood indicate that parents continue to be an important point of intervention as individuals’ transition to adulthood.

T1  - Migration status, emotional engagement, and social exclusion in Chinese schools
AN  - 2449276413
AB  - Introduction
Since migration has become one of the pressing issues of our time, the school engagement of migrant children in the destination cities has drawn increasing scholarly attention. While most existing studies have focused on the cognitive and behavioral dimensions of school engagement of migrant children compared to local children, the emotional dimension has received less scholarly attention. Using a large-scale, national representative, school-level longitudinal survey data conducted in 2014 in China, this study examined the effect of migration status on children's emotional engagement in school.
Methods
This study was conducted with 15,872 Chinese junior high school students (mean age = 13.52, SD = 1.24) using ordered logistic regression. KHB mediation analysis was employed to explain migration-emotional engagement linkage.
Results
Compared with urban local children, both rural and urban migrant children are less likely to feel closely connected to their peers in school and are more likely to feel bored and to express escapism. The KHB mediation analysis further suggests that compared with the number of friends and proportions of the same-school friends, the percentages of local friends at the same school mediate most of the effect of migration status on all three measures of emotional engagement, particularly for rural migrant children.
Conclusions
These findings revealed that although both social exclusion and the absence of friendship play statistically significant mediation roles, social exclusion is of vital importance in understanding the differences between migrant and local children in emotional engagement.

T1  - The ‘changing’ face of media discourses on poverty in the age of populism and anti-globalisation: The political appeal of anti-modernity and certainty in Brazil: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2335044488
AB  - This article analyses how the political right in parts of the Global South has appropriate agendas and issues that in the past were often associated to the political left and presented them instead as their own. It does so by articulating narratives around poverty and social exclusion in the context of anti-globalisation and nationalistic discursive regimes that appeal to popular ‘common sense’. The piece explores this argument by examining the case of Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro. Reviewing a sample of Brazilian news media outlets and the type of messages in relation to poverty during the most recent presidential elections, it is suggested that by linking themes of social exclusion with nationalism in the news media, the political right has been able to explain poverty by means of increasing globalisation and liberalism and co-opt this agenda.

T1  - ‘Bad <i>hombres</i>’? An examination of identities in U.S. media coverage of immigration
AN  - 2358711144
AB  - When discussing immigration on the campaign trail in 2016, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump used the term ‘bad hombres’ to criticise immigrants, and in particular Latino men. Using a novel dataset of images accompanying immigration news stories in three major news magazines from 2000–2010, we examine the extent to which press coverage helped set the stage for this sort of racialised and gendered association. We find overwhelming support for the ‘bad hombres’ hypothesis, demonstrating that in comparison to the true demographics of immigrants in the U.S., press portrayals significantly over-represent Latino men and under-represent all other immigrant groups. Our results are particularly important in light of research demonstrating that individuals’ political attitudes are influenced by the perceived ‘target group,’ or beneficiary, of a given policy, as well as scholarship demonstrating the media’s role in fostering a sense of ‘Latino threat.’

T1  - The Mexican European diaspora: class, race and distinctions on social networking sites
AN  - 2311910643
AB  - This article presents original user-based research concerning a Mexican European Diaspora's use of Social Networking Sites (SNSs) for making racial and classed distinctions through the course of sharing and viewing content on their networked profiles. Bourdieu's theoretical framework is used to address the ways in which SNSs usage fosters social capital, exclusion and displays of prejudice and discrimination. We also found useful the analysis of racial distinctions based on participants' references to physical attributes. To illustrate the use of racial and classed distinctions, we specifically consider the use of Facebook and also of A Small World (ASW), an exclusive SNS, regarded as one of few designed for use by 'the wealthy' [Ruiz, 2008. "Five Social Networking Sites for the Wealthy." Forbes. Accessed June 11, 2010. http://www.forbes.com/2008/05/02/social-networks-vip-tech-personal-cx_nr_0502style.html]. We analyse the term 'naco', a pejorative Mexican term commonly used to refer to vulgarity or inferiority amongst Mexican European and privileged diaspora with strong racial, classed and gendered connotations. The empirical material for this study is based on ethnographic research. Through the analysis of displayed images and text as well as well questionnaires and interviews we found tacit or explicit exclusion, discrimination and segregation through close-knit SNS networks engaged in by our participants, a Mexican privileged European diaspora.

T1  - ‘Publish and Be Damned?’ Race, Crisis, and the Press in England during the Long, Hot Summer of 1976
AN  - 2454089428
AB  - The summer of 1976 is an under-cited moment of significance in the history of race and immigration in post-war England. A series of major incidents appeared to highlight lasting racial fractures in English society, often exacerbated by the provocative editorial decisions of the press. This article, focused particularly on events in the Lancashire town of Blackburn, analyses some of the ways in which constructions of a ‘crisis of race relations’ were developed in local and national newspapers during this tumultuous summer.

T1  - The interrelationship between place and critical life transitions in later life social exclusion: A scoping review
AN  - 2331209115
AB  - Understanding the role of place in protecting against social exclusion (SE) and risk during critical life transitions (CLTs) in older age is essential to create effective community-level ageing policies. However, existing knowledge is diffuse across a range of literatures and lacks coherency. Through a two-stage scoping review, this paper aims to synthesise state-of-the-art international research linking place, old-age SE and CLTs. Findings show that: (1) place serves as a setting for, and as a mediator of exclusion resulting from CLTs and (2) theoretical conceptualisation to address the intersection of CLTs, place and SE in later life is underdeveloped. The implications of the state of scientific knowledge on this topic are discussed in relation to future research needs and ageing in place policy.

T1  - Excluding Europe’s Muslims: Symbolic Boundaries and Anti-immigrant Attitudes Along a Racial–Ethnic Hierarchy
AN  - 2287916928
AB  - Research has shown that immigrants in Europe face exclusion in an increasingly hostile political climate. However, few studies comprehensively investigate whether exclusionism is patterned by a pervasive race–ethnicity hierarchy. This article bridges anti-immigrant attitudes research with the symbolic boundaries literature, which identifies Islam and Muslim “otherness” as a bright ethnic boundary. I use 2014 European Social Survey data to test whether immigrants of different racial–ethnic profiles are excluded along a preference hierarchy and whether this hierarchy structures intergroup contact, a well-known depressor of anti-immigrant sentiment. In all sample countries, I find that same race and Muslim immigrants are the most and least preferred immigrant groups, respectively. Further, while natives’ residential isolation is typically mediated by interethnic contact, both forces exert a dual influence on anti-Muslim exclusionism only. Results qualify the optimism of intergroup contact theories and indicate an extensive targeting of Muslims for exclusion beyond xenophobia or general racist sentiment.

T1  - Modern avenues for intergroup contact: Using E-contact and intergroup emotions to reduce stereotyping and social distancing against people with schizophrenia: GPIR
AN  - 2302361386
AB  - Intergroup contact is the leading strategy for reducing the stigma associated with mental illness. For the first time, the current study examines the effectiveness of a contemporary intergroup contact strategy, called electronic or E-contact, to reduce stigma against people diagnosed with schizophrenia. It also examines the mediating role of three target-relevant intergroup emotions, namely fear, anger, and pity. In total, 133 participants engaged in E-contact with a person diagnosed with schizophrenia (intergroup E-contact), E-contact with a person without a mental illness (intragroup E-contact), or no contact. Compared to the intragroup E-contact and no-contact conditions, intergroup E-contact reduced fear, anger, and stereotyping toward people with schizophrenia. Additionally, fear and anger, but not pity, were found to be significant affective mediators of the E-contact effect. The findings demonstrate the value of computer-mediated intergroup contact for stigma reduction, and emphasize the importance of intergroup emotions in this domain.

T1  - Research on media framing of public policies to prevent chronic disease: A narrative synthesis
AN  - 2312515998
AB  - Media coverage plays a key role in shaping public and political attitudes towards policy interventions to improve health. We reviewed studies of news media to identify the arguments used to frame policies that address risk factors for chronic disease, and the impact of different arguments on attitudes to policy. Drawing on a previous scoping review, we identified a subsample of 49 studies of media framing of policies to address risk factors for lifestyle-related chronic disease for further analysis. We extracted and synthesised data to explore key themes. Of the limited research that has been undertaken, most studies have focused on tobacco policy, followed by alcohol, with a small number of studies of food and beverage policies. Studies have primarily used content analysis. Our synthesis demonstrated that advocates and opponents draw on five frames: health, social, economic, practical and ideological. Only a small number of studies have examined the impact of framing on public attitudes towards policy interventions, although such studies have tended to focus on the impact of how problems, rather than solutions (i.e. policies) are framed. Media research is crucial to understanding the complex ways in which attitudes towards policy interventions shape, and are shaped by, public discourses and can provide public health advocates with insights into strategies to successfully position policy arguments. This review highlights key insights and gaps in the hope that this will stimulate further research that will enhance public health advocates' abilities to promote effective public health policy.

T1  - At home with strangers: social exclusion and intimate labor in Anthony Chen's Ilo Ilo (2013)
AN  - 2254360427
AB  - In Singapore, many middle-class families employ foreign domestic workers (FDWs) to take on care and domestic work. In this setup, female FDWs need to be "a part of the family" and "feel at home" to better perform and render intimate labor, but they are structurally displaced and prevented from being fully integrated in both their employer's homes and in the host country. Ilo Ilo (2013), a debut film by a Singaporean director Anthony Chen, has poignantly portrayed this paradoxical relationship by showing a young boy's growing affection to his Filipina maid, and how this brief yet enduring bond demonstrates migration's effects on both the foreign helpers and the middle-class families employing them. This Singaporean family melodrama depicts the affective nature of migration by demonstrating how FDWs are positioned as an intimate yet excluded figure inside the employer's homes. The contradiction between intimacy and social exclusion seen in the film also simultaneously describes and prescribes the FDW's place in the host country. The film illustrates the paradox of intimacy and exclusion in the host-guest worker relationship of employers and their maids within the private domains of household and the public discourse on FDWs' claims in Singapore.

T1  - Promoting intergroup openness and support for equality in a new cultural context: Replicating the effects of internal criticism
AN  - 2224323171
AB  - Exposure to an outgroup member voicing criticism of his or her own group fosters greater openness to the outgroup's perspective. Research suggests that this effect owes its influence to a serial process in which participants' perception of the risk involved in voicing internal criticism leads to an increase in the perceived credibility of the speaker. The credibility makes it possible for the speaker to be viewed as open-minded, which subsequently inspires greater hope. This process culminates in an increased openness to the outgroup. These findings have been restricted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but here we examine their generalizability to racial conflict in the United States. Results reveal that White Americans exposed to internal criticism expressed by a Black authority figure express greater openness to African-American perspectives on race relations and are more willing to support policies of racial equality. Replicating past research, this effect is serially mediated by risk, credibility, and hope.

T1  - The Ethnic Minority Question and Rohingya Crisis in Contemporary Myanmar
AN  - 2197128604
AB  - The recent humanitarian Rohingya crisis has once again put Myanmar onto the centre stage of global media attention. The aim of this paper is to look into the ethnic minority question in contemporary Myanmar. The paper has a special focus on the Muslim Rohingya community. The paper argues that problematic race relations in Myanmar today should not be viewed in isolation but should be seen as a part of a historical continuum. The British colonial policies of divide and rule, political leaders and their obsession with Buddhism in the post-independence period and xenophobic tendencies during the long years of the military junta have all collectively contributed to the very complex situation in which the country finds itself today when it comes to race relations. Meaningful democracy and economic development have been advocated as the way forward especially for the more peripheral parts of the country where there is a strong ethnic minority presence.

T1  - Framing Effect of Media Portrayal of Migrants to the European Union: A Survey Experiment in Poland
AN  - 2170130475
AB  - As a result of the rise of online communication and political divisions based on symbols, rather than structure (decrease in the importance of class-based voting), citizens are increasingly linked to news outlets that articulate and reinforce their views. The process is facilitated by the spontaneous processes of bottom–up communication that excludes, in an iterative process, people who express views that are inconsistent with the prevailing opinion. The emergence of “information verticals” is a significant influence on attitudes to some issues covered in political debate. These effects operate with regard to so-called easy issues, that is, those rooted in emotions and in the symbolic sphere. Our article is an empirical test of our hypotheses about the effects of media framing of “hard” and “easy” issues. We apply a survey experiment method to verify whether contact with news coverage has an effect on attitudes, taking into account the political orientation and cognitive skills of citizens. Our empirical analyses confirm that a hostile media framing of migration changes respondents’ attitudes no matter their level of cognitive engagement. The data come from Poland.

T1  - Troubled kids? Locational disadvantage, opportunity structures and social exclusion
AN  - 2154273885
AB  - Young people growing up in poverty often have restricted access to out-of-school enrichment activities that are important for generating the soft skills that support post-school transitions. This paper compares young Australians' accounts of their opportunity structures - their engagement with enrichment activities, their post-school aspirations, and their knowledge of routes to achieve them - in two suburb types - improver suburbs (close to the median on many indicators) and isolate suburbs (severely disadvantaged on most indicators). While young people in improver suburbs felt able to access facilities and networks in equally or more affluent neighbouring suburbs, young people in isolate suburbs felt excluded from neighbouring suburbs, and experienced more restricted opportunity structures than young people living in improver suburbs, even those who were themselves economically disadvantaged. The paper argues that this geographical experience of exclusion prevents many economically disadvantaged young people from accumulating knowledge and skills valued in post-school settings.

T1  - Social Exclusion, Surveillance Use, and Facebook Addiction: The Moderating Role of Narcissistic Grandiosity
AN  - 2329644494
AB  - According to the social skill model, high levels of social anxiety lead to the increased use of the Internet in order to elevate the sense of self-worth [13].

[...]a primary driver of social media use is the fear of being excluded and forgotten, which increases the frequency of Facebook use [10,22].

[...]remote technologies such as the Internet increase the effect of disinhibition effect on users [31].

Facebook’s surveillance function keeps people informed about their connections and personal information [35].

[...]when social exclusion occurs, people can access social information on Facebook, which increases the number of alternative actions that can compensate for the lack of social relationships.

T1  - The Hidden Curriculum of College Athletic Recruitment
AN  - 2237543296
AB  - In this article, Kirsten Hextrum considers institutional avenues that limit upward mobility opportunities by revealing a hidden curriculum of athletic recruiting that favors students from privileged backgrounds. The study's data center on forty-seven life history interviews with National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I athletes from an athletically and academically prestigious university. Hextrum's findings reveal three phases of a hidden curriculum-socialization, covert selection, and overt selection-that secure greater access to elite colleges for White middle-class communities via athletic participation. In this case, social reproduction required active effort by both representatives of higher education and representatives of White middle-class communities to protect existing class and race relations.

T1  - Anger as a catalyst for change? Incremental beliefs and anger’s constructive effects in conflict: GPIR
AN  - 2109033310
AB  - The traditional understanding of the role of anger in conflicts is that it leads to aggressive actions that escalate conflict. However, recent research has found that under certain circumstances anger can have constructive effects such as increasing support for more risky conciliatory steps in negotiation. The current study aims to identify a psychological moderator that determines whether anger has such destructive or constructive effects. We propose that people’s beliefs about the malleability of groups (i.e., implicit theories about groups) moderate whether anger leads to conciliatory, constructive behaviors or destructive, aggressive behaviors. We test this hypothesis in two different contexts (a) race relations in the US in the context of recent protests against police brutality, and (b) the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Results indicated that induced anger (compared to control condition) increased support for aggressive policies for participants who believed that groups cannot change. In contrast, for those who believed groups can change, inducing anger actually increased support for conciliatory policies compared to a control condition. Together, this indicates that anger can have constructive effects in conflict when people believe that groups can change.

T1  - Cybervictimization, self-esteem, and social relationships among German secondary school students
AN  - 2081412485
AB  - By differentiating between five specific forms of cybervictimization (denigration, betrayal, social exclusion, cyberstalking, happy slapping), the present study examined the multifaceted structure of cybervictimization and specific relationships o these five forms of cybervictimization with students' self-esteem and social relationships. Moreover, mediating effects of self-esteem were explored. Factor analyses supported the five-factor structure. Self-esteem and social relationships were negatively related to almost all five forms of cybervictimization. However, hierarchical regression analysis showed that only student-student relationships were negatively predictive of social exclusion, while only teacher-student relationships were negatively predictive of denigration, betrayal, and cyberstalking. Further, self-esteem appeared to be a negative predictor and mediator of denigration and social exclusion. Girls experienced more betrayal than boys. Older students reported lower social exclusion but more cyberstalking than younger students.

T1  - Social exclusion, sense of school belonging and mental health of migrant children in China: A structural equation modeling analysis
AN  - 2088759588
AB  - In recent years, the number of migrant children has continued to increase in China. This study aims to investigate how social exclusion and sense of school belonging influenced the mental health of Chinese migrant children. Data were from the 2013–2014 wave of the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS), a school-based national multistage probability sample of Chinese junior high school students. 1898 children who had experienced migration were selected as research sample. Structural equation model was adopted to test the hypothetical framework. The results suggested that social exclusion was not significantly associated with children's mental health, whereas a high sense of school belonging was related to their enhanced mental health outcomes. The sense of school belonging fully mediated the effect of social exclusion on migrant children's mental health. Our study validated the applicability of rejection–identification model, social identity theory, and cognitive–experiential self-theory in Chinese context. This study also provided implications for the social work intervention and social policy focused on migrant children in China.

T1  - School-Based Social Exclusion, Affective Wellbeing, and Mental Health Problems in Adolescents: A Study of Mediator and Moderator Role of Academic Self-Regulation
AN  - 2034653334
AB  - The desire to build and maintain positive relations is a fundamental and universal need of humans. Therefore, individuals’ perception of social exclusion has been investigated as a potentially important factor for mental health and wellbeing. In order to enhance adolescents’ wellbeing and promote mental health at school, the purpose of the present study was to investigate whether academic self-regulation mediated and moderated the effect of social exclusion on youths’ mental health (internalizing and externalizing problems) and affective wellbeing at school. Participants comprised 313 adolescents (55.3% girls), ranging in age between 11 and 19 years (M = 15.678, SD = 1.739). Findings from structural equation analyses indicated a partial mediating effect of academic self-regulation on adolescents’ mental health problems and affective wellbeing, and that it promoted their mental health and wellbeing in the face of social exclusion. In addition, moderation analyses supported these results, demonstrating a significant moderating role of academic self-regulation on youths’ wellbeing and mental health. Taken together, these results support the importance of academic self-regulation on youths’ mental health and wellbeing in the face of social exclusion, and contribute to the design of school-based services in order to protect their mental health and wellbeing. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

T1  - New media, diasporic identity and social exclusion: A study of everyday practices of identity negotiation among second-generation Ghanaian women in Hamburg
AN  - 2049548854
AB  - This article focuses on new media use of second-generation Ghanaian women living in Hamburg to negotiate a diasporic identity, drawing from empirical findings of a larger study on Ghanaian women’s use of new media to negotiate identity and belonging in Hamburg and London. Using the non-media-centred approach to contextualize new media use with other social and cultural processes in everyday life. The article argues that whereas new media open up possibilities of maintaining communication networks in the face of social exclusion there is a need to consider other social and cultural processes. The article addresses the role of new media in negotiating diasporic identity through communication, and alternative representation as a means of exerting agency, and empowering a diasporic identity in the face of social exclusion.

T1  - Tweeting back while shouting back: Social media and feminist activism
AN  - 1999858886
AB  - Shouting back’ or responding using a hashtag in digital spaces is a way of exposing the prejudice faced by people on a daily basis, while sharing and reacting to it, and provoking responses; social networking sites (SNSs) provide a visible platform for feminists to address experiences relating to sexism and misogyny. Guillard (2016, p. 1) argues that digital spaces are central to defining ‘a fourth wave of feminist practice’ and allow for global engagement, yet the use of digital media can be tokenistic (Kristofferson, White, & Peloza, 2014) and use of the Internet is insufficient to demarcate a new wave of practice. As feminist academics (Braun, 2011) writing from the United Kingdom, who have engaged with social media for a number of years, we seek to explore some of the issues related to social media-based feminist campaigns and examine the process of ‘shouting back’ against hegemony, misogyny and sexism. Digital spaces are a powerful influence on social movements (Earl & Kimport, 2011), and we consider some of the ways in which social media has contributed to the feminist movement.

T1  - Problem ubóstwa i wykluczenia społecznego w krajach Unii Europejskiej w kontekście zrównoważonego rozwoju
TT  - The Problem of Poverty and Social Exclusion in the European Union Member States in the Context of Sustainable Development
AN  - 2167812962
AB  - W artykule poruszono problem ryzyka ubóstwa i wykluczenia społecznego w kontekście zrównoważonego rozwoju obszarów wiejskich. Materiały empiryczne zawarte w artykule pochodzą z badań cząstkowych EU-SILC (Europejskie badanie warunków życia ludności). Stanowią one punkt odniesienia dla porównania statystyk dotyczących dystrybucji dochodów i integracji społecznej w Unii Europejskiej. Za jeden z ważniejszych milenijnych celów rozwoju uznano niwelację ubóstwa i przeciwdziałanie marginalizacji społecznej. Z badań wynika, że co czwarty mieszkaniec obszarów wiejskich w UE jest zagrożony ubóstwem lub marginalizacją społeczną. W największym stopniu marginalizacją lub/i ubóstwem zagrożeni są mieszkańcy obszarów wiejskich w Bułgarii (54,8%) i Rumunii (50,8%), ale także w Polsce i na Litwie poziom ten przekracza średnią unijną (odpowiednio o 4,5 p.p. oraz 9,2 p.p.). Na drugim biegunie wykluczenia są Holandia i Czechy z poziomem ryzyka na poziomie 12,8%. Czynnikiem konstytuującym bezpieczeństwo ekonomiczne gospodarstwa domowego, a w efekcie poczucie pewności, są dochody. Ich wielkość wpływa na poziom ubóstwa obiektywnego mierzonego metodą parametryczną. W UE przyjmuje się, że zagrożone ubóstwem są osoby, których dochody nie przekraczają 60% mediany dochodów w danym kraju. Tym samym niemal co piąty mieszkaniec wsi w UE jest zagrożony ubóstwem. Ubóstwo i wykluczenie społeczne są zjawiskami wielowymiarowymi. Powodują niezaspokojenie potrzeb na wielu płaszczyznach – ochrony zdrowia, edukacji, warunków mieszkaniowych, kultury i czasu wolnego. Brak odpowiednich dochodów powoduje pewnego rodzaju sprzężenia zwrotne i jest zarówno przyczyną, jak i konsekwencją deprywacji potrzeb, a także sprzyja niezrównoważonemu rozwojowi obszarów wiejskich.Alternate abstract:This paper addresses the poverty risk issues in the context of sustainable development of rural areas. Empirical materials included in this paper are based on EU-SILC (European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions) partial studies, and provide a reference point for comparing the EU income distribution and social integration statistics. Poverty reduction and counteracting social exclusion are among the key Millennium Development Goals. According to the studies, one in four inhabitants of the EU rural areas is at risk of poverty or social exclusion. While the highest shares of at-risk population are recorded in Bulgaria (54.8%) and Romania (50.8%), the levels reported by Poland and Lithuania are also above the EU average (by 4.5 and 9.2 percentage points, respectively). At the other end of the spectrum, the risk rate in the Netherlands and the Czech Republic is 12.8%. For the households, income is a factor underpinning their economic safety and, their confidence as a result. The amount of income affects the objective poverty levels measured with a parametric method. In the EU, people earning no more than 60% of the national median income are assumed to be at risk of poverty, which means that the risk of pover ty affects nearly every fifth rural inhabitant of the EU. Poverty and social exclusion are multi dimensional aspects which result in unsatisfied needs in multiple areas: healthcare, education, housing, culture and leisure. While triggering some kind of feedback loop, insufficient income is both the cause and the effect of deprivation of needs. Also, it provides favorable conditions for an unsustainable development of rural areas.

T1  - An Evaluation of Media's role in de-popularizing and Influencing Political Attitudes towards Jacob Zuma: Collating Events Leading to His Removal
AN  - 2157374265
AB  - Media has for decades been and still remains a significant instrument for societal socialisation. In most recent times, the media in South Africa has come to occupy a critical space in shaping political opinions as well as attitudes. While various scholarly works have documented the role of media in the political landscape of societies, not much has been written recently by scholars regarding the contribution of media in de-popularising of politicians, in particular the former South African President Jacob Zuma. Therefore, this paper examines how the growing participation of media in the transmission of principles, moral standards and values, resulted in citizens being more vocal regarding their dissatisfaction, which led to constant national calls for the removal of the former president Jacob Zuma. The qualitative study uses secondary sources to identify the dynamics of media reinforcement of Jacob Zuma declining popularity. The study found that the media used its agenda setting role to negatively undermine Zuma's popularity and influence public opinion about him and his leadership dynamics. The study therefore recommends the need for developmental journalism, which will help in advancing transformational leadership under President Ramaphosa and the future leaders of the country.

T1  - How paradata can illuminate technical, social and professional role changes between the Poverty in the UK (1967/1968) and Poverty and Social Exclusion in the UK (2012) surveys
AN  - 1949494724
AB  - This article brings together analyses of the micro paradata ‘by-products’ from the 1967/1968 Poverty in the United Kingdom (PinUK) and 2012 Poverty and Social Exclusion in the UK (PSE) surveys to explore changes in the conditions of production over this 45 year period. We highlight technical, social and professional role continuities and changes, shaped by the institutionalisation of survey researchers, the professionalization of the field interviewer, and economisation. While there are similarities between the surveys in that field interviewers were and are at the bottom of the research hierarchy, we demonstrate an increasing segregation between the core research team and field interviewers. In PinUK the field interviewers are visible in the paper survey booklets; through their handwritten notes on codes and in written marginalia they can ‘talk’ to the central research team. In PSE they are absent from the computer mediated data, and from communication with the central team. We argue that, while there have been other benefits to field interviewers, their relational labour has become less visible in a shift from the exercise of observational judgement to an emphasis on standardisation. Yet, analyses of what field interviewers actually do show that they still need to deploy the same interpersonal skills and resourcefulness to secure and maintain interviews as they did 45 years previously.

T1  - Examining the impact of integrated and non-integrated parasport events on volunteer attitudes towards disability
AN  - 1947106134
AB  - Attitudes, and attitudinal change towards persons with disabilities, is an important area of research as it can potentially enable greater understanding of the constraints that may preclude full participation in society. In the realm of sport and recreation mega sporting events have been suggested as a potential catalyst for positive societal change and shifting negative attitudes. Much of the event research to date, however, has focused on able-bodied sport events, with parasport events being largely overlooked. As a result, the impact of major parasport events on attitudinal change towards persons with a disability is assumed by sport practitioners, policy-makers and politicians but not justified by empirical evidence. The current study thus presents a starting point by examining the benefits of hosting mega sport events and in particular focuses on an important event stakeholder group; volunteers. More specifically, the current study addresses volunteer's perceptions of attitudes towards disability at two major parasport events: the 2014 Commonwealth Games (where parasport was integrated with the able-bodied sport) and the 2015 Pan Am/ParaPan American Games (where parasport was separated from the able-bodied sport). Data were collected at two time points for each event: pre-Games, and post-Games. Results revealed that both events had an impact on volunteer awareness levels of disability and accessibility-related issues, as well as positively impacting attitudes towards persons with disability. Interestingly, the integrated events at the Commonwealth Games appeared to impact attitudes to a greater degree than the non-integrated events at the ParaPan Am Games. Implications are discussed pertaining to the impact of an integrated vs. non-integrated major parasport event on disability/accessibility awareness, and attitudes towards disability.

T1  - Local information services in Medellin: Technology, institutions, communities and power
AN  - 1953096728
AB  - This article examines the politics of technology and information by exploring a case study of local information service provision in Medellin, Colombia. Local Information Service (LIS) is defined as a community centre where information deemed relevant to local communities is generated, stored, organized and disseminated through print and digital means. Using a social construction of technology approach, the article attempts to deconstruct the implementation and delivery of LIS in Medellin, Colombia and analyse how empowering and disempowering discourses form through relationships between institutions and citizens laden with social and economic inequality. The article analyses the development and deployment of this artefact and positions LIS as a socio-technical system, embedded with political, social, cultural, and economic values. We describe the unintended consequences of this deployment through a multilevel perspective of the head organisation and the smaller 195 local institutions that support it. The article challenges and operationalises the social construction of 'local' in local information by highlighting practices of social exclusion and resistance embedded within the design of the service. This case provides a vantage point from which to examine how relevant social groups interpret and engage with technological devices and the implications of this for the communities the device is intended to serve.

T1  - Exposing The American Dilemma: How Aversive Racism Plays a Part in Homicide News Reception
AN  - 1952105766
AB  - This study examined whether news stories about violent shooting homicides impact implicit and explicit attitudes about race. To explore these relationships, the authors used a 3 (race: White, Black, control) × 3 (role: victim, perpetrator, control) × 3 (multiple messages) mixed factorial design. The study found that high social dominant-oriented (SDO) individuals expressed more empathy in general, with the most empathy toward Black perpetrators in homicide news stories in comparison to low SDO individuals. Ironically, for high SDO individuals, perpetrators in the stories received more explicit negative Black stereotyping than victim in the stories. These findings indicate that aversive racism occurs in the processing of news stories. This has practical implications for journalists because stereotyping and bias in news coverage could reinforce aversive racism.

T1  - Creative precariousness, urban discontent and cultural networks: An introduction to a public lecture with Néstor García Canclini
AN  - 1898548195
AB  - Following from a public lecture at City University London, the articles discuss the interface between creativity, urban transformation, precariousness and social networking. This introduction places the lecture within the framework of North-South academic exchanges and in relation to how Latin American cities are responding to the rise of the creative economy in urban policy development. The main article, written by Néstor García Canclini, provides the foundation for an anthropology of precariousness and creativity in the context of globalised urban discontent and the transformation of space through information technologies. Voicing classical cultural studies concerns about identities, economy, global imaginaries and political resistance, he examines the strategies and networks that young creative producers, cultural entrepreneurs and artists use to navigate contradictory transnational processes. The article offers a renewed critical perspective into creative urbanism, connecting local cultural practices with global processes of neoliberal economic restructuring, urban violence and social exclusion. In doing so, it delineates the possibilities for an emancipatory transformation of urban space in times of increasing uncertainty.

T1  - Television News Content of Minority Groups as an Intergroup Context Indicator of Differences Between Target-Specific Prejudices
AN  - 1880496565
AB  - Although research has shown that different types of prejudice are highly correlated, the existence of prejudice hierarchies indicates that individuals differentiate between target groups. Here we examine the relationship between television news coverage and differences in attitudes toward minority groups. We rely on intergroup threat theory, tone, and framing theories to formulate our hypotheses and conduct a multimethod study: All prime-time television news items in Flanders (N = 1,487) reporting on five minority groups (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender; Jews; Eastern Europeans; North Africans; Roma) were coded in terms of tone and framing and subsequently combined with individual-level survey data. Patterns in news coverage reflect differences in prejudice: Groups that are most negatively/positively evaluated by the public receive the most negative/positive coverage. Prejudice is especially high for minority groups associated with problems and criminal threat frames in the news. We conclude that news content is an important characteristic of the intergroup context reflecting differences in minority group appraisals in society.

T1  - Online political participation, online contacts with out-groups members and social distances
AN  - 1920414158
AB  - In light of the growing role of social media in conflict management, the current study analyzes the interrelationship of online political participation of Israeli Jews, the frequency of their online contacts with Arabs, and Jews' perceived social distances from Arabs. The research was conducted through an online survey of a representative sample of 458 Israeli Jews who use the social media at least 3 times a week. Overall, although causation cannot be inferred because of the correlational design of our study, results suggest that frequency of online contacts may positively affect closeness to Arabs in line with contact theory. In keeping with the socialization perspective of political engagement, the findings indicate that the impact of online political participation on social distances from Arabs was mediated by interactions between Jews and Arabs in the social media.

T1  - MONEY PRIMING AFFECTS CONSUMERS' NEED FOR UNIQUENESS
AN  - 1868266701
AB  - We conducted 3 studies to investigate the effect of money priming on consumers' need for uniqueness. In Study 1, we found that when choosing products, consumers who were primed with money had a stronger need for counterconformity, compared to those who were not. In Study 2, we found that the meaning of money linked to the amount of money moderated the effect of money concept on consumers' choice of innovative products, and that the likelihood that individuals primed with a large amount of money would choose unique products was significantly higher than that of both those primed with a small amount of money and the nonmoney-primed control group. In Study 3, we found that social distance mediated the influence of money concept on the consumers' need for uniqueness. Overall, the results showed that consumers who are primed with money perceive greater social distance and have a stronger need for uniqueness.

T1  - People Like Us: Dominance-oriented Racial Affiliation Preferences and the White Greek System on a Southern U.S. Campus
AN  - 1853361318
AB  - Studying in-group affiliation preferences can be a valuable tool for understanding race relations in the contemporary United States. We draw on theories of social dominance and social identity to analyze racial attitudes, as measured by the Social Distance Scale, for a subset of black and white students at the University of Mississippi. While both black and white students expressed strong in-group preference, this preference was stronger for whites than for blacks, especially for white women presently affiliated or planning to affiliate with campus Greek organizations. Social dominance orientation, a measure describing whether social inequalities are accepted and justified, mediated the greater in-group preference of many whites, especially for intimate or high-power relationships. We discuss possible individual and institutional causes for the differences we observe, and we draw implications for understanding continued self-segregation both on- and off-campus in a society that implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, espouses "color-blind" ideals.

T1  - Excluded From All Humanity
AN  - 1830218582
AB  - Past research suggested that--from the perspective of perpetrators--animal metaphors are a powerful means to reinforce social exclusion and to foster hostile behaviors against the targets of social exclusion. In the current work, we focus on the consequences of this dehumanizing form of social exclusion from the perspective of victims. In two studies, we manipulated the presence of animal metaphors in a variety of contexts of interpersonal social exclusion. Our results showed that when social exclusion is associated with animal metaphors, its consequences are exacerbated. In particular, labelling targets of social exclusion as animals indirectly caused them to display more aggressive tendencies compared with when they are labelled with corresponding offending, but nondehumanizing, attributes. Crucially, this increased aggressiveness was mediated by higher perceptions of being treated (Study 1) or viewed (Study 2) by others as animal-like. Overall, our research showed the detrimental effects of the interplay between social exclusion and animal metaphors from the perspective of victims.

T1  - Neural Correlates of Prosocial Behavior: Compensating Social Exclusion in a Four-Player Cyberball Game
AN  - 1802588096
AB  - Prior studies demonstrated contributions of the insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) for both experiencing and observing social exclusion, but it is not yet well understood how the brain processes the compensation of exclusion, as is observed in prosocial helping. Here, we tested if social brain regions, specifically the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and temporal parietal junction (TPJ) are involved when individuals show prosocial behavior towards excluded others. For this purpose, 23 female participants played a four-player Cyberball Game in which participants could toss balls to each other. During the exclusion game, two players excluded one of the other players. When participants observed exclusion by others, they showed elevated activity in the insula, consistent with prior studies. However, when they tossed the ball to the excluded player, they showed increased activation in the TPJ, consistent with the hypothesis that prosocial behavior is associated with social reasoning. In addition, tossing to the excluded player was associated with increased activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc). Given that prior studies reported that the NAcc is involved in experiencing rewards, this may suggest a warm glow for showing prosocial compensation behavior when helping excluded others.

T1  - When It's Okay That I Don't Play: Social Norms and the Situated Construal of Social Exclusion
AN  - 1797547768
AB  - Being excluded and ignored has been shown to threaten fundamental human needs and cause pain. Such reflexive reactions to social exclusion have been conceptualized as direct and unmoderated (temporal need threat model of ostracism). Here, we propose an extension and argue that reflexive reactions depend on how social exclusion situations are construed. If being excluded is understood as a violation of an inclusion norm, individuals will react with pain and threat. In contrast, if being excluded is consistent with the prevailing norm, the exclusion situation is interpreted as less threatening, and negative reflexive reactions to ostracism should be attenuated. Four studies empirically support this conceptual model. Studies 3 and 4 further show that to guide situated construal, the norm has to be endorsed by the individual. In both Studies 1 and 3, the effect of the norm is mediated by the objective situation's subjective construal.

T1  - Disgust predicts prejudice and discrimination toward individuals with obesity
AN  - 1793852378
AB  - This study examined the relevance of disgust to evaluations of an obese target person, and the connection between disgust and prejudice toward that person. Participants (n=598) viewed an image of an obese or non-obese woman, and then evaluated that woman on a number of dimensions (emotions, attitudes, stereotypes, desire for social distance). Compared with the non-obese target, the obese target elicited more disgust, more negative attitudes and stereotypes, and a greater desire for social distance. Furthermore, disgust mediated the effect of the target's body size on all of the outcome variables (attitudes, stereotypes, social distance). Disgust plays an important role in prejudice and discrimination toward individuals with obesity, and might in part explain the pervasiveness of weight bias.

AN  - 1778392952
AB  - This article presents a theoretical framework of how intergroup violence may figure into the activation and maintenance of group categories, boundaries, and identities, as well as the mediating role played by organizations in such processes. The framework's analytical advantages are demonstrated in an application to southern lynchings. Findings from event- and community-level analyses suggest that "public" lynchings, carried out by larger mobs with ceremonial violence, but not "private" ones, perpetrated by smaller bands without public or ceremonial violence, fed off and into the racial group boundaries, categories, and identities promoted by the southern Democratic Party at the turn of the 20th century and on which the emerging Jim Crow system rested. Highlighting that racialized inequalities cannot be properly understood apart from collective processes of racial group boundary and identity making, the article offers clues to the mechanisms by which past racial domination influences contemporary race relations.

T1  - ATTITUDE TOWARDS MENTAL ILLNESS IN SOUTHEASTERN NIGERIA: THE CONTRADICTIONS OF A COMMUNITARIAN CULTURE
AN  - 1768626826
AB  - The effect of mental illness stigma can be greater in the developing world where sufferers are additionally affected by destitution. This study investigated the attitudes of the Igbo people of Southeastern Nigeria toward mental illness to establish the extent and determinants of negative attitudes. Multistage sampling was used to select participants (n = 602), to whom questionnaires were administered. More than half of all the demographic groups demonstrated authoritarian attitude and primary social distance. A third of the sample equally endorsed social restrictiveness, anticommunity care, and secondary social distance. Low education, male gender, older age, Protestant denomination, and not being familiar with people with mental illness predicted more negative attitudes. Culture, stereotypes, causal explanations, and poor mental health knowledge were the leading mediators of negative attitudes. The determinant role of culture and demographic variables in the stigma dynamics indicate that contextualized and targeted interventions could be more effective than general campaigns.

T1  - Adaptive behaviour in urban space: Residential mobility in response to social distance
AN  - 1760021403
AB  - The social relationship between an individual and their residential environment is shaped by a range of housing market rules and regulations, by residential choice and by constraints. This paper elaborates on that relationship by focusing on the distance between an individual's (and his/her household) social position and the social position of the neighbourhood of residence. Through the analysis of large-scale longitudinal register data for each resident in the four largest cities of the Netherlands, we studied the relations mentioned, as well as the residential moves triggered by such relations, as well as the outcome effects on individual-neighbourhood relations in the destination neighbourhoods. We found that the larger the social distance (positive or negative) between an individual and the median social position of their residential neighbourhood, the higher the odds that the individual would move from that neighbourhood. Those individuals that moved tended to select destination neighbourhoods that reduced their social distance. Our findings offer new input for debates and policies relating to de-segregation and social mixing. [web URL: http://usj.sagepub.com/content/53/2/227.abstract]

T1  - Gender Stereotypes and Attitudes Towards Information and Communication Technology Professionals in a Sample of Spanish Secondary Students
AN  - 1757516514
AB  - Issue Title: Social Roles in Spain--Part 2 
This study examined Spanish young people's gender-stereotyped beliefs and attitudes about people working in the field of information and communications technology (ICT). For this purpose, their positive, negative, and neutral perceptions of the associated characteristics of these workers were also analyzed. Likewise, the use of masculine, feminine, or neutral expressions to describe these professionals was explored. The existence of gender differences in these aspects was also investigated. 900 students from Catalonia (51 % girls) enrolled in the last course of junior secondary education (mean of age=15 years old; S.D.=1.73) participated in a survey with close and open-ended questions. Content analysis of responses to an open-ended question indicated that the boys and girls held several stereotypical beliefs about ICT professionals (a highly male-dominated field), but they also reported counter-stereotypical beliefs about them. As expected, these stereotypical beliefs described a masculine portrayal of ICT workers. Contrary to expectations, most of the students' portrayals of people working in ICT were either positive or neutral, not negative. Likewise and opposite to predictions, young males did not show more positive attitudes towards ICT professionals than girls. In fact, both girls and boys evaluated more positively than negatively the different descriptive aspects associated with ICT professionals. In support of expectations, most boys and girls referred to masculine role models working in ICT. No gender differences were observed in the type of characteristics associated with ICT professionals. However, young females were more likely to offer feminine references about professions where ICT is the tool rather than the object of their work. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings within the context of Spain are discussed.

T1  - MATERNAL AND PATERNAL IMPRISONMENT AND CHILDREN'S SOCIAL EXCLUSION IN YOUNG ADULTHOOD
AN  - 1879971340
AB  - The United States has entered its fourth decade of high imprisonment levels. It is now possible to assess the impact of parental imprisonment on children who have completed the transition to adulthood. We elaborate the role of parental incarceration from a life course perspective on intergenerational social exclusion in young adulthood. The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health [Add Health] representatively sampled the historically unique national cohort born in the 1980s, during the onset of mass incarceration. Four waves of the Add Health survey provide a valuable moving window on incarcerated parents and the transitions of their children from adolescence, through school, to young adulthood. We focus on four young adult outcomes as indicators of social exclusion: personal income, household income, perceived socioeconomic status, and feelings of powerlessness. Our findings indicate that both maternal and paternal incarceration significantly contribute to young adult social exclusion among offspring in their late twenties to early thirties. Successful completion of college is a mediator of the exclusionary effects of maternal and paternal incarceration, reducing parental imprisonment effects 14%-50% (net of college completion of the mothers and fathers and a comprehensive set of further controls). This mediating college effect is consistent with other growing evidence of the salience of the college/non-college divide as an exclusionary barrier in American society. The implication is that prisons and schools are now strongly linked institutions in the intergenerational reproduction of American socioeconomic inequality.

T1  - Racial resentment and smoking
AN  - 1738477081; 201539201
AB  - Racial resentment (also known as symbolic racism) is among the most widely tested measures of contemporary prejudice in political science and social psychological research over the past thirty years. Proponents argue that racial resentment reflects anti-black emotion obtained through pre-adult socialization. In light of affect-based models of substance use, this paper examined the association between racial resentment and smoking in a national sample of non-Hispanic white, black, and Hispanic respondents. Data come from the 2012 American National Election Study, which contained two measures of smoking. The results of ordinal logistic regression models indicate a positive association between racial resentment and smoking among non-Hispanic whites (N = 2133) that is not present among blacks (N = 693) or Hispanics (N = 660). Models controlled for age, education, income, gender, political ideology, region, and mode of interview. Furthermore, analyses indicated that a measure of race-related affect, admiration and sympathy towards blacks, partially mediated the association between racial resentment and smoking. For non-Hispanic whites, racial resentment appears to constitute a risk factor for smoking. Future studies should further specify the conditions linking substance use to the race-related affective component of racial resentment. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Demonising 'the other': British Government complicity in the exploitation, social exclusion and vilification of new migrant workers
AN  - 1660023946; 201505831
AB  - This article demonstrates the close and complex connection between the demonisation, exploitation and exclusion of new migrant workers. In so doing, it testifies to the blurred boundaries between the categories of severe labour exploitation, forced labour and slavery. This study highlights the absence of citizenship rights as crucial to understanding the vulnerability to demonisation, exploitation and exclusion that characterises the embodied experience of such workers. It also highlights the key role of citizenship as a means for such workers to make rights claims. In the UK, new migrant workers, particularly those arriving from Eastern Europe since 2004, have been increasingly designated by government and media as interlopers in a tight labour marketplace. Whilst their collective economic contribution is sometimes welcomed, they are regarded as 'external' to UK society and citizenship, a potential threat to indigenous values and culture, and in competition with British workers. Rarely are migrants afforded the space in public and private spheres to express their individual needs, wants, cares or perspectives. UK migrants have variously been portrayed by the tabloid media and irresponsible politicians as rapacious opportunists, as benefit scroungers, criminals and potential terrorists. The predominant discourse around new migrant workers in the UK is that they are not citizens, but temporary residents who are expected to work industriously and to remain otherwise unseen and unheard until they return to their country of origin. No further contribution to social and political life is required or expected. It is within such an unsupportive environment that new migrant workers in general, and undocumented migrants in particular, have become highly susceptible to employer and gangmaster abuse and exploitation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Power, negotiations, and the anticipation of intergroup encounters
AN  - 1644755532
AB  - This review places intergroup encounters in a broad framework which considers the context in which such encounters take place, and in particular, the power dynamics at play. We address different forms of encounters, spanning from interpersonal interactions (not focused on intergroup aspects) to political negotiations between the groups' representatives, and argue for a deeper consideration of power asymmetries in examining such encounters. We argue that because high- and low-power group members have different motivations for change in the status quo, they differ in their expectations from intergroup encounters and in the types of encounters they prefer. We describe relevant research while considering moderating factors such as the legitimacy and stability of the power dynamics. We also identify remaining gaps and topics requiring further research. This work has both conceptual and practical implications for the prospects of promoting both positive attitudinal change as well as changes to the hierarchical status quo.

T1  - Are the latter-day saints too latter day? Perceived age of the Mormon Church and attitudes toward Mormons
AN  - 1512218347; 201408612
AB  - Two studies examine how social distance toward Mormons is affected by the relative recency of the Mormon religion. In Study 1, we found that the perceived age of the Mormon religion predicted social distance toward Mormons such that people who perceived Mormonism as more recent wanted more social distance from Mormons. In Study 2, we manipulated the antiquity or recency of the Mormon religion. We found that emphasizing the long history of the religion reduced social distance from Mormons (relative to emphasizing the religion's newness), an effect that was mediated by perceived legitimacy of the Mormon religion. These findings support past research showing that the longevity of a practice implies its goodness and that this inference extends to practitioners as well.

T1  - Perceived Threat, Immigration Policy Support, and Media Coverage: Hostile Media and Presumed Influence
AN  - 1559004092; 201432595
AB  - This study, using survey data (N = 529), examined perceived immigration 'threat,' subjective knowledge, support for punitive and assimilative immigration policies, and opinions about media coverage effects. Perceived threat was not related to a third-person effect; however, perceived threat of immigrants was related to support for punitive immigration policies, and a strong 'hostile media perception' was confirmed. There was a significant belief among respondents that others would view immigration negatively, if only media were not biased in favor of immigration. Internet use, age, race, and education predicted threat perception; perceived threat, perceived favorableness of coverage, and daily newspaper reading predicted presumed influence of news coverage.

T1  - Examining the Distinct Effects of Emotive Triggers on Public Reactions to International Terrorism
AN  - 1512219795; 201411105
AB  - In recent years, a growing body of research has set out to examine the role that emotions play in shaping political attitudes and behaviors regarding terrorism. However, one major issue that is generally overlooked is whether the thematic relevance of emotive triggers leads to differential effects on people's reactions to international terrorism. Specifically, does anger-regardless of its source-tend to drive people towards supporting an aggressive foreign policy option to counter terrorism, or do the thematic underpinnings of anger (i.e., the specific contents that trigger this particular emotion, such as watching a news story about a recent terrorist attack) matter vis-a-vis the policy choice? To address this gap, this study experimentally examines the impact of anger -- induced by thematically relevant versus irrelevant emotive triggers -- on people's cognitive processing and foreign policy preferences regarding international terrorism. Overall, we find that the induction of anger via thematically relevant emotive triggers leads to a higher tendency for selecting a military option, a lower amount of information acquisition, and a shorter processing time in response to terror-related incidents.

AB  - An article based on excerpts from a chapter in the book, Bad News for Refugees by the Glasgow Media Group. It examines, in a detailed content analysis of sixty-nine articles in UK national papers in June 2011, how the rightwing press helped set the political agenda on immigration through a consistent conflation of issues of economic and forced migration, an emphasis on numbers as a threat, the pointing to migrants as an economic burden and potential criminals and a stress on the need for immigration controls.

T1  - Reduction of Perceived Social Distance as an Explanation for Media's Influence on Personal Risk Perceptions: A Test of the Risk Convergence Model
AN  - 1463015473; 201345720
AB  - The risk convergence model proposes reduction of perceived social distance to a mediated personality as a mechanism through which the mass media can influence audiences' personal risk perceptions. As an initial test of the model, this study examined whether 5 audience variables known to facilitate media effects on personal risk perceptions-identification, parasocial interaction, personal relevance, transportation, and perceived realism-would exert their influences through the reduction of perceived social distance. The results indicate that reduction of perceived social distance fully explained the process of identification and transportation influencing personal risk perceptions, while partially mediating the relationship between personal relevance and personal risk perceptions. Theoretical and practical implications for health risk communication and entertainment education are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Sweden: when hate becomes the norm
AN  - 1448992484; 201342848
AB  - The author, who worked at the Swedish Vallentuna centre for unaccompanied minors, was shocked by the anti-foreigner climate she encountered. In order to examine the parameters of this hostility, she researched representations of unaccompanied minors online. Working within the framework of netnography, she uncovered a potent mix of Islamophobia and anti-foreigner hate, with unaccompanied minors depicted within a Eurabian mindset. The article reflects on the relationship between offline and online worlds and suggests that extremist sites provide echo chambers for far-right opinion. By normalising extreme views, they serve to deliver more votes to the Sweden Democrats an extreme-right parliamentary party which is setting the national terms of debate on restricting immigration.

T1  - Gendered Labour Migrations in Europe and Emblematic Migratory Figures
AN  - 1417521500; 201331969
AB  - This paper explores the dichotomies and gendered invisibilities underpinning the concept of the knowledge economy and society through a closer examination of two emblematic and contrasting figures working in Information and Communication Technology and domestic/care work as bearers of different configurations of knowledge and skills in the contemporary circuits of globalisation. Such knowledge can be broken down into different types-such as embrained, encoded, embodied and encultured-which are valued differentially and with consequences for gendered labour markets. These gendered differences are reflected in current immigration policies which privilege migrants in scientific and information technology sectors and discount those engaged in care work, associated with embodied knowledge and skills. The impact of these differences has been reinforced during a period of economic recession when immigration has become increasingly restricted, even amongst the skilled.

T1  - Reliving history: Using priming to assess the effects of world events on public opinion
AN  - 1417521862; 201332727
AB  - We present an experimental method to assess the impact of world events on political attitudes. Building on cognitive priming research, we expose experimental groups to reminders of historical events and a control group to neutral pictures and captions. Attitudes of interest are assessed afterward. Differences between experimental and control groups indicate the current impact of thoughts of the event. Study 1 assessed how Muslims' political attitudes in Malaysia, Cameroon, and Israel are affected by the violent Iranian government crackdown following the 2009 presidential election and by President Obama's outreach to Islam (T. Holzman, June 4, 2009, Obama seeks "New Beginning" with Muslim world. Washington, DC, National Public Radio). Study 2 assessed whether primes of Arab Spring uprisings (the wave of prodemocratic demonstrations and protests that occurred across the Arab World in early 2011) increased support for democracy among Tunisian Muslims. Both studies demonstrated effects of these events, supporting the utility of this method. This method can complement existing approaches in public-opinion research, shed light on psychopolitical dynamics set in motion by historical events, and provide useful information to policymakers.

AN  - 1512220527; 201408793
AB  - This paper examines how race relations have changed since Barack Obama was elected to the office of President of the United States. The authors examined media coverage of issues encountered by this president, to see if any of those issues had a racial bias. Results showed that change has come to America in the area of race relations because a black man has ascended to the Presidency, the highest office in the land. On the other hand, commentators are still debating his 'blackness' or lack thereof, which indicates race remains a salient issue in society. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Role of Dehumanization in Attitudes Toward the Social Exclusion and Rehabilitation of Sex Offenders
AN  - 1433106458
AB  - We examined the role of dehumanization in people's attitudes toward the rehabilitation of sex offenders. In Study 1, the more participants dehumanized sex offenders, the less they supported their rehabilitation and the longer the sentences they recommended. In Study 2, the more participants dehumanized sex offenders, the more likely they were to support their exclusion from society. In Study 3, the more participants dehumanized sex offenders, the more they supported their violent ill treatment. In Study 4, within a sample of correctional staff, good quality contact with sex offenders was related to less dehumanization and more support for rehabilitation. Mediation analyses indicated that the relationship between quality of contact and support for rehabilitation was mediated via dehumanization.

T1  - Ukrainianization, terror and famine: Coverage in Lviv's <i>Dilo</i> and the nationalist press of the 1930s
AN  - 2697556880
AB  - This article looks at the press coverage of Ukrainianization, the Soviet terror, and the famine (Holodomor), particularly in the years 1932–33, focusing on the largest Ukrainian daily outside Soviet Ukraine, the Lviv Dilo. It compares this coverage to the reporting in the press of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). It argues that these two years were a turning point in political attitudes. Galician Ukrainians turned away from the Communist Party of Ukraine and support for the OUN began to grow. Ironically, the OUN had not led protests against the famine, but benefited from the lack of a strong response from European governments and international bodies. The article draws on a reading of the Ukrainian press of the 1930s, and on recent research by Polish and Ukrainian scholars.

T1  - Being brown in Dixie: Race, ethnicity and Latino immigration in the New South edited by Cameron D. Lippard and Charles A. Gallagher
AN  - 1019027006
AB  - The articles approach these questions through a variety of topics that include discrimination in the workforce and housing market, the impact on and responses of educational and government institutions, affects on juvenile crime rates, the racial framing of Latinos in media and several organizing efforts.  While the information presented here is regionally specific, the political and social implications of this amount and depth of information are vast as the growth of the Latino population is in no way limited to the south.  Because of the continued and projected growth of the Latino population and the proximity of the United States to Latin America, the imperative to better articulate the national patterns and regional/county level specificities of how Latino are challenging and changing race relations will only increase.

T1  - Cool Minds in Heated Debates? Migration-related Attitudes in Germany Before and After a Natural Intervention
AN  - 1322714744; 201314100
AB  - Data from the Transatlantic Trends: Immigration survey was used to investigate whether the debate surrounding Thilo Sarrazin's immigration-skeptical Deutschland schafft sich ab (Germany abolishes itself) had any impact on migration-related attitudes in Germany. The book was published in August 2010 and fieldwork took place during the evolving debate, providing a unique opportunity to study the impact of a major media event on public attitudes. Descriptive findings on the aggregate level show no substantial change in migration-related attitudes in the months after publication. More detailed findings reveal a significant increase in skepticism only for respondents with low levels of education, whose assessment of Muslim migrants' integration became more negative during the debate. There are two possible reasons for the lack of more substantial attitudinal change. Firstly, the debate was highly polarized and lacked the consonant national media coverage that is an important precondition for media effects on public opinion. Secondly, there were no additional "external shocks" prior to the book's release, such as a high levels of immigration, that could have made the public more susceptible to criticism of the impact of migration. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Perceived out-group (dis)continuity and attribution of responsibility for the Lebanese Civil War mediate effects of national and religious subgroup identification on intergroup attitudes
AN  - 1023028874; 201223691
AB  - Successful reconciliation between groups following a violent conflict requires psychological change. We test a model predicting intergroup attitudes towards Muslims in Lebanon among Maronite (Christian) Lebanese youths. Identification with both their religious subgroup and with the superordinate national group predicted attitudes towards Muslims, in opposite directions. These effects of levels of identification on intergroup attitudes were mediated by attributions of responsibility for the war (Muslim responsibility) and perception that the current generation of out-group members is different from the war generation (perceived out-group discontinuity). Identification with Lebanon fosters positive attitudes towards Muslims by lowering Muslim responsibility for the war, and by increasing perceptions of foreign responsibility and perceived out-group discontinuity. In contrast, increased identification with their own religious subgroup undermines attitude change by increasing Muslim responsibility for the war and lessening perception of out-group discontinuity. Representations of the past have implications for attitudes towards former enemies and reconciliation in the present. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Variation in Parent Use of Information and Communications Technology: Does Quantity Matter?
AN  - 1081868466; 201237201
AB  - Although the availability of new information and communication technologies (ICT) may be revolutionizing learning, an understanding of how parents use these innovations is still emerging. Using online survey data from 1,653 parents across the United States, this study identified nine subgroups of parent technology users on dimensions that included their online activity frequency, devices they were using, and their attitude toward technology. Subgroups ranged from those who did a variety of activities daily, used many different devices, and had a positive attitude, to those who infrequently accessed technology, used few types of technology, and had a negative attitude. Further subgroup comparisons reveal few demographic differences characterizing technology use. However, clear differences in constraints and attitude suggest the need for assessing variations in and expanding conceptualizations of technology behavior before designing programs that rely on the Internet for delivery.

T1  - Social Exclusion, Gender, and Access to Education in Canada Narrative Accounts from Girls on the Street
AN  - 917429217
AB  - Based on an exploratory study of the intersection among social exclusion, gender, and access to education, this article documents interpretive insights into the social and cultural dimensions of schooling through the narrative accounts of young women and girls living in poverty and experiencing homelessness in Canada. Having recognized the challenges of the public education system to meet the varying needs of a diverse student body, the declarations of these girls shed much-needed analytic light on the multiple factors mediating the issue of access, social and economic constraints, and alienation from teaching and learning environments faced by homeless young women and girls in the educational arena. Consequently, they shift our attention away from notions of individualized failure in school to a structural and gendered critique of "access" in education, and bring into relief important questions about justice and social equality in Canada.

T1  - Familiarity with and Social Distance from People with Mental Illness: Testing the Mediating Effects of Prejudiced Attitudes
AN  - 919903583; 201201495
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine prejudiced attitudes as a factor associated with social distance from people with mental illness. A total of 289 university students from Greece completed written measures assessing social distance from, prejudiced attitudes about, and familiarity with mental illness. A structural equation model with manifest variables was tested. Participants who reported to be more familiar with mental illness held stronger social care and weaker prejudiced beliefs, and consequently expressed a less strong desire for social distance. Implications of the results and suggestions for future research are outlined. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Pathways to Social Exclusion -- A Life-Course Study
AN  - 881465615; 201117330
AB  - The article analyses how living conditions during childhood and adolescence structure socio-economic circumstances in midlife. The data are drawn from a new longitudinal Swedish data set-the Stockholm Birth Cohort Study-in which we can follow 14,294 individuals from birth (1953) to the age of 48 (2001). The analysis proceeds in three steps. The first step establishes the link between precarious living conditions in childhood and midlife social exclusion. In the second step, structural equation modelling is used to depict the pathways by which this association is mediated. The analysis produces tentative evidence that the long-term effect of financial poverty primarily runs via educational failure, whereas the effect of other social problems in the family of origin runs via deviant behaviour. In the third step, we analyse whether or not children who were raised in poor families or in families with other social problems are more sensitive to new risk exposures as adults. This is tested by examining the effect of long-term unemployment during the economic crisis of the 1990s on social exclusion risks 7-9 years later. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Minority Stress and Psychological Distress Among Asian American Sexual Minority Persons 1[Psi]7
AN  - 1928228769
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine multiple minority stressors (i.e., heterosexist events, racist events, heterosexism in communities of color, racism in sexual minority communities, race-related dating and relationship problems, internalized heterosexism or homophobia, outness to family, and outness to world) as they relate to the psychological distress of 144 Asian American lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) persons. When examined concomitantly, these minority stress variables accounted for approximately one third of the variance in psychological distress scores. Results indicate that heterosexism in communities of color, race-related dating and relationship problems in the LGBTQ community, internalized heterosexism, and outness to world were the only significant and unique predictors of Asian American LGBTQ persons' psychological distress. In addition, no support was found for the moderating or mediating roles of outness in the internalized heterosexism-distress link.
