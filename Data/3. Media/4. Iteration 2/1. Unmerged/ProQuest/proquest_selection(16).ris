T1  - The Effect of Pronatalist Rhetoric on Women's Fertility Preferences in Turkey
AN  - 2682274261
AB  - This paper analyzes the impact of pronatalist rhetoric on women's fertility preferences in Turkey using a mixed‐methods approach. Since 2008, Prime Minister (and since 2014 President) Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has given speeches about the necessity of increasing fertility and has demanded at least three children from families. This call was supported by monetary incentives in 2015. I analyze the impact of the rhetoric on women's fertility preferences between 2008 and 2013. In the first part of the paper, I use qualitative data I collected through in‐depth interviews in 2013 to show a relationship between women's political orientation and their acceptance of the rhetoric. Then, using quantitative data from the 2008 and 2013 rounds of the Turkey Demographic and Health Surveys, I analyze whether the pronatalist rhetoric had an independent effect on increasing fertility preferences. An individual‐level religiosity variable is used as a proxy to account for women's responsiveness to the rhetoric. I find that religiosity was positively related to women's desire to have a third child in both 2008 and 2013, but it was statistically significant only in 2013 after the rhetoric had been widely circulated in the media.

T1  - The politics of mask-wearing: Political preferences, reactance, and conflict aversion during COVID
AN  - 2695518674
AB  - The current project examines how psychological reactance and conflict orientation relate to the highly politicized debate over mask-wearing in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. We explore how psychological reactance and conflict orientation are related to self-reported mask-wearing, and how these same predispositions are correlated with political beliefs. We then assess how favorability towards President Trump in the context of the 2020 Election was uniquely correlated with these traits and how Trump favorability both mediated and moderated the effects of conflict orientation and psychological reactance on individuals' likelihood of wearing masks. Results from a national survey of U.S. adults from Nov–Dec 2020 suggest that Trump favorability was positively associated with trait reactance, negatively associated with conflict aversion, and negatively associated with self-reported mask-wearing. The opposite was true of favorability towards Joe Biden. Moderation analyses indicate that conflict-approaching Biden detractors were especially unlikely to report wearing masks, while mediation analyses show that political preferences significantly mediated the relationships between both psychological traits and self-reported mask-wearing. Implications for the politicization of health messaging and health behavior are discussed.

T1  - Testing the link between psychological contract, innovative behavior and multidimensional well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic
AN  - 2660214392
AB  - Purpose>The study investigates the impact of psychological contract breach on employees' innovative behavior and well-being (happiness, work engagement and mental well-being) who are working from home during this COVID-19 pandemic situation. Drawing on social information processing (SIP) and job-demand resource (JD-R) theory, job stress was proposed as a mediator explaining this relationship.Design/methodology/approach>Data were collected via a structured questionnaire through Google Docs from 258 respondents working at different capacity in Indian organizations. The study includes those respondents who are working from home during COVID-19 pandemic situation. The hypotheses were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM).Findings>Psychological contract breach was negatively impacting innovative behavior and well-being. Job stress mediated the relationship between psychological contract breach and innovative behavior as well as well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic situation and especially for those who are working from home only.Research limitations/implications>The data for the study were collected from the employees working from home during this COVID-19 pandemic situation was cross-sectional. The study implied or spoke about the unmet expectations leading to reduced innovative behavior harming the organization's effectiveness and it also reduces well-being which harms the individual in the era of social and financial uncertainty.Originality/value>The novel contribution of the study is integrating SIP and JD-R theory during the pandemic situation. The results highlighted meticulous empirical evidence which answers the question that how the unmet expectations cause a detrimental effect on the employees as well as the organizations in this COVID-19 pandemic situation.

T1  - The plight of the discredited: electoral effects of stigmatizing and prosecuting an anti-immigration politician
AN  - 2638858169
AB  - The emergence of anti-immigration parties in mature democracies has triggered various reactions. These reactions, including stigmatization of these parties and prosecution of their members for hate speech, may have unintended consequences. What are the effects of these responses on the electoral support for these parties? Using an experimental approach, we confront a sample representative of the Dutch electorate with one of six versions of a manipulated news video about a new anti-immigration party. We find that stigmatization of the party reduces the propensity to vote for that party, and even more so if it is mentioned that a prominent member is prosecuted for hate speech than if not. Either way, the effect is moderated by anti-immigrant attitude and mediated by the party’s perceived legitimacy.

T1  - Socially isolated and digitally excluded. A qualitative exploratory study of the lives of Roma teenage mothers during the COVID-19 lockdown
AN  - 2655165341
AB  - This paper explores the interlinks between multiple layers of exclusion and deprivation of Roma adolescents mothers in the context of COVID-19 pandemic, in order to understand: a) how different types of exclusion (e.g., digital, social, educational) overlap and how are those types of exclusion lived and perceived by teenage mothers; and b) whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic changed existing inequalities in their situation. In our paper, we refer to teenage mothers to describe mothers who gave birth before the age of 18. The study has a qualitative exploratory approach and relies on ten interviews conducted with Roma teenage mothers in peripheral urban areas in Romania during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in the Spring of 2020. As a theoretical framework, the study employs the Relative Digital Deprivation Theory, (Helsper, 2016) which touches upon three dimensions of digital divides while revealing different markers of agency that young mothers manifest. In our understanding, "agency" is not limited to active agency, but encompasses the "tacit or hidden agency" as well (Sniekers, 2018). Moreover, we relied on Maheshwari's work (2019) that developed the concept of positioning to understand how individuals' identities are shaped by different competing discourses (e.g. victimhood and agency). Although from an absolute‑objective perspective the results showed these young women as being digitally and socially excluded, from their subjective-relative perspective, with their lives gravitating around their new babies and partners, their exclusion is not perceived as unfair or illogical, but in line with the usual expectations and values of their communities. Unexpectedly, the lockdown period did not have too much of a disturbing effect on their already secluded and hugely marginalized lives (online or offline), although in some cases some changes occurred. Being already socially excluded, they continued living in their micro-universes of their homes in remote, already separated areas, only marginally connected to few parts of the rest of the world via digital technologies, many times restricted in their functionality and usage (i.e., by poor devices, poor connection, financially poor for data services, poor skills). We anticipate the study to have high stakes with regards to policies of social and digital inclusion of (Roma) adolescent mothers, not only by showing the picture of the digital exclusion of a population that is usually missing from digital research, but also by understanding their point of view on their state and by understanding the importance of a valid referent (e.g., more digitally included), which would represent a positive example to motivate them towards making a change.

T1  - Labour market marginalisation in young refugees and their majority peers in Denmark and Sweden: The role of common mental disorders and secondary school completion
AN  - 2629381343
AB  - Background 
Due to the circumstances of their early lives, young refugees are at risk of experiencing adverse labour market and health outcomes. The post-settlement environment is thought to play a decisive role in determining how this vulnerability plays out. This study compared trends in labour market marginalisation in young refugees and their majority peers during early adulthood in two national contexts, Denmark and Sweden, and explored the mediating role of common mental disorders and secondary school completions.
 Methods 
Using registry data, 13,390/45,687 refugees were included in Denmark/Sweden and 1:5 matched to majority peers. Inequalities in labour market marginalisation were investigated during 2012–2015 in each country using linear probability models and mediation analysis. Country trends were standardised to account for differences in observed population characteristics.
 Results 
The risk of marginalisation was 2.1–2.3 times higher among young refugees compared with their majority peers, but the risk decreased with age in Sweden and increased in Denmark for refugees. Birth-cohort differences drove the increase in Denmark, while trends were consistent across birth-cohorts in Sweden. Differences in population characteristics did not contribute to country differences. Common mental disorders did not mediate the inequality in either country, but secondary school completions did (77–85% of associations eliminated).
 Conclusions 
The findings document both the vulnerability of young refugees to labour market marginalisation and the variability in this vulnerability across post-settlement contexts. While the contrast in policy climates in Denmark and Sweden sharpened over time, the risk of marginalisation appeared more similar in younger cohorts, pointing to the importance of factors other than national immigration and integration policies. Institutional efforts to assist young refugees through secondary education are likely to have long-lasting consequences for their socio-economic trajectories.

T1  - Social conflict on the front lines of reform: Institutional activism and girls' education in rural India
AN  - 2626103735
AB  - How do states realize social reforms for marginalized groups in settings of entrenched inequality? This article argues that reform implementation is a conflict‐ridden process driven by the institutional activism of street‐level bureaucrats. Through an ethnographic case study of Mahila Samakhya, a novel government program for women's empowerment in Uttar Pradesh, India, I find that local fieldworkers committed to reform promoted girls' education by mobilizing marginalized citizens and mediating local conflicts. Organizational processes of gender‐based training and deliberation enabled fieldworkers to challenge village patriarchy and exclusion and forge programmatic ties with lower caste women. By altering rules to address the practical needs of households, fieldworkers effectively integrated disadvantaged girls into the education system. Institutional activism also engendered conflicts over rules within the bureaucracy, prompting senior officials to advocate for marginalized groups. The findings suggest that institutional commitment to activism is critical for agencies working on the front lines of reform.

AB  - We compared labor market marginalization (LMM), conceptualized as days of unemployment, sickness absence and disability pension, across occupational branches (manufacturing, construction, trade, finance, health and social care, and education), among young employees with or without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and examined whether sociodemographic and health-related factors explain these associations. All Swedish residents aged 19–29 years and employed between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2011 were eligible. Individuals with a first ADHD diagnosis (n = 6030) were matched with ten controls and followed for five years. Zero-inflated negative binomial regression was used to model days of LMM with adjustments for sociodemographic and health-related factors. In total, 20% of those with ADHD and 59% of those without had no days of LMM during the follow-up. The median of those with LMM days with and without ADHD was 312 and 98 days. Having an ADHD diagnosis was associated with a higher incidence of LMM days (incident rate ratios (IRRs) 2.7–3.1) with no differences across occupational branches. Adjustments for sociodemographic and health-related factors explained most of the differences (IRRs: 1.4–1.7). In conclusion, young, employed adults with ADHD had a higher incidence of LMM days than those without, but there were no substantial differences between branches, even after adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related factors.

T1  - A social virus: Intergroup dehumanization and unwillingness to aid amidst COVID-19 − Who are the main targets?
AN  - 2667854074
AB  - Previous studies have shown that external threats, such as financial crises and natural disasters, might fuel negative attitudes, emotions, and behaviors towards outgroup members. However, it is unclear what types of outgroups are likely to be targeted when an external threat is taking its toll. In this study, we examine two types of outgroups that might be at risk of becoming victims of intergroup hostility. The first is the "ultimate scapegoat" outgroup which has a long history of negative relations with the ingroup. The second is the "context-dependent" outgroup which is viewed as an outgroup only in certain contexts. We utilized the COVID-19 crisis and the highly diverse social makeup of Israeli society to explore the extent to which each type of outgroup would be targeted. Results from our study (N = 664), conducted during the first peak of COVID-19 in Israel, show that higher levels of exposure to COVID-19 predicted lower willingness to aid outgroups and that outgroup dehumanization mediated this association. However, this held true only when the target outgroup was a context-dependent outgroup. When the target group was the ultimate scapegoat, exposure to COVID-19 did not predict ingroup willingness to aid them. Our findings contribute to our theoretical and practical knowledge on how intergroup hostility proliferates during external threats and, as such, are valuable to scholars, practitioners, and policymakers working to reduce intergroup tensions during large-scale crises.

T1  - Refugees unwelcome: Narcissistic and secure national commitment differentially predict collective action against immigrants and refugees
AN  - 2667853531
AB  - Two studies (N1 = 193; N2 = 598) were conducted in Poland to examine the role of two types of ingroup commitment (i.e., national narcissism and national identification) as predictors of attitudes towards immigrants and refugees (disadvantaged groups) and intentions to engage in collective action against them. As predicted, national narcissism (but not national identification) was related to more hostile intergroup attitudes and greater willingness to engage in collective action against refugees and immigrants. The positive effect of national narcissism on intentions to engage in collective action against immigrants and refugees was mediated by attitudes towards those groups. These results show that applying a more fine-grained approach to ingroup commitment (e.g., national narcissism vs. national identification) among advantaged group members allows for a better understanding of their intergroup attitudes and behavioral intentions to actively oppose the rights of disadvantaged social groups via collective action.

T1  - “Not quite the struggle of normatives”: Belonging and entitlement in Swedish “body activism”
AN  - 2627373628
AB  - A “body activism” movement, with roots in fat activism and body positivity, has developed in Sweden during the last decade. As new forms of activism emerge, boundaries and approaches are being negotiated. Who is the movement for? Who can engage in it, and how? Through semi-structured interviews, we seek to understand how young Swedes who follow and engage in “body activism” on social media experience and reflect on the activism, belonging and entitlement, and their own participation. The informants discussed activism in terms of inclusiveness and political potential, where the most accessible activism is also the one ascribed with the least political potential. Entitlement is linked to collective identity, where an active participation requires belonging to the marginalised group. This article highlights the significance of boundary work in movements, where too narrowly drawn boundaries can lead to decreased participation and result in an unexploited potential for social change.

T1  - The plight of racialised minorities during a pandemic: migrants and refugees in Italy and Australia
AN  - 2625203347
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to draw on data from interviews with six Italian migrant service providers and media stories in Italy and Australia to weave a comparative snapshot of the plight of precarious migrant and refugee communities in these two countries during the COVID-19 pandemic.Design/methodology/approachThe article draws attention to prejudicial shortcomings towards vulnerable migrant communities enacted by the states of Italy and Australia in response to COVID-19.FindingsWhile the unequal ecology of the pandemic has flared up the need for the State to strengthen participation and inclusion policies, it has also provided opportunities to foreground the disadvantages vulnerable communities face that also demand policy attention and sustained funding. Governments in migrant-receiving countries like Australia and Italy need to articulate culturally sensitive and inclusive responses that foreground agencies give vulnerable migrants, asylum seekers and refugees clear, supportive messages of solidarity leading to practical solutions.Originality/valueThis paper relays preliminary data from the coalface (migrant service providers) and media as the pandemic evolved in the two countries, whose support mechanisms had never before been critically compared and evaluated through the lens of racial inequality in the face of a health and social crisis.

T1  - Place of Residence and Cognitive Function in Older Adults in China: The Mediating Role of Social Participation
AN  - 2618235843
AB  - Background: Cognitive impairment is a severe health problem faced by older adults and their families, as well as the countries in which they live. Differences in place of residence may contribute to differences in the cognitive function of older adults, and the mediating effect of social participation has rarely been studied in China. Methods: A total of 10,014 older adult participants were included, using data from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS). Place of residence was described as either a city, town, or rural area. The frequency of participation in organized social activities and visits and interactions with friends was used to assess both formal and informal social participation. The Chinese version of a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used as a measure of cognitive function. The mediation analysis was conducted using Hayes’ process version 3.4 on SPSS (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Results: Place of residence had a negative effect on cognitive function in older adults. The mediating functions of both informal (a1b1 = 0.199) and formal (a2b2 = −0.056) social participation indicate a suppression effect on the part of informal social participation and a partial mediation effect on the part of formal social participation in terms of the association between place of residence and cognitive function in older adults. Promoting both informal and formal social participation seems to be an important strategy for preventing a decline in the cognitive function of older adults, especially for those living in rural areas.

T1  - Do I support that it's good or oppose that it's bad? The effect of support-oppose framing on attitude sharing
AN  - 2622623992
AB  - The rise of social media has led to unprecedented opportunities for individuals to share, or express, their attitudes on social and political issues. What factors affect whether individuals choose to share? This research identifies a novel determinant of attitude sharing-support-oppose framing, defined as whether individuals think of their own attitude in terms of what they support or what they oppose. Support-oppose framing is distinct from attitude valence, as the same attitude can be framed in terms of support (e.g., I support that this policy is bad) or opposition (e.g., I oppose that this policy is good). Seven experiments, two correlational studies, and one field study provide evidence for a support-oppose framing effect, whereby individuals are more likely to share attitudes framed in terms of positions they support rather than positions they oppose. This effect occurs via two pathways. In the first, support-framed attitudes are viewed as more value expressive, which facilitates greater attitude sharing. In the second, support-framed attitudes are believed to promote more positive impressions, which also leads to greater sharing. This effect is attenuated when individuals' typical impression-management goals are relaxed.

T1  - The role of entitlement, social dominance orientation, and right‐wing authoritarianism in the prediction of homonegativity for heterosexual white men
AN  - 2614034738
AB  - We examined the role of right‐wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), psychological entitlement, and narcissistic entitlement in the prediction of White men's negative attitudes and behaviors toward lesbian women and gay men. The present study (a) simultaneously examines four predictors (i.e., psychological and narcissistic entitlement, RWA, and SDO) of attitudes toward lesbian women and gay men (ATLG) and rejecting behaviors, (b) examines psychological and narcissistic entitlement as distinct predictors of ATLG and rejecting behaviors, and (c) tests the potential mediating role of ATLG. A path model was tested using the survey data from 153 White, heterosexual, male college students. Findings indicate that only RWA and narcissistic entitlement were significant predictors of ATLG, which is a strong predictor of rejecting behaviors. Furthermore, ATLG mediates the relationship between RWA and rejecting behaviors (d = .35). In other words, higher RWA is associated with higher ATLG, which is associated with more self‐reported rejecting behaviors. Narcissistic entitlement also influences rejecting behaviors through ATLG and both psychological and narcissistic entitlement were found to directly predict gay and lesbian rejecting behaviors.

T1  - A public context with higher minority stress for LGBTQ* couples decreases the enjoyment of public displays of affection
AN  - 2598505728
AB  - This research investigated whether LGBTQ* minority stress and public displays of affection (PDA; e.g., kissing, hugging) among LGBTQ* couples are context-sensitive. We expected that (a) LQBTQ* minority stress would be more prevalent in a harmful (i.e., city center) versus a less harmful (i.e., university campus) context, and (b) PDA would be reduced for LGBTQ* couples in a harmful context. In three studies, LGBTQ* and Hetero/Cis students (NTotal = 517) reported LGBTQ*-specific minority stress and PDA in the city and on campus. The city center was higher in minority stress than the campus in all studies. Also, LGBTQ* participants’ PDA enjoyment was lower in the city than on campus (Studies 1 and 3). Minority stress mediated the context effect on PDA (Study 3). A qualitative analysis illuminated the harmful versus protective natures of public contexts. We conclude that a protective context can powerfully promote healthy LGBTQ* relationship behavior.

T1  - Candidate Advertisements and Afro-Brazilian Political Marginalization
AN  - 2643280790
AB  - A televisao é uma importante ferramenta política na América Latina. Reconhecendo sua habilidade em conformar uma opiniao pública e influenciar o comportamento político, a lei eleitoral brasileira concede tempo gratuito de TV para que os partidos políticos possam apresentar suas campanhas nas semanas anteriores ao período eleitoral. Enquanto o horario político eleitoral gratuito busca nivelar a competiçao entre esses partidos, ele expressa também as desigualdades internas a eles na distribuiçao do tempo de TV dentre seus candidatos. Nosso argumento neste artigo é que vieses raciais influenciam o modo como os dirigentes partidários distribuem o tempo de televisao gratuito e, assim, contribuem para a marginalizaçao política das candidaturas afro-brasileiras (pardas e pretas). Utilizando dados inéditos das eleiçoes municipais de 2012 no municipio do Rio de Janeiro, mostramos que dirigentes partidários distribuem menos tempo de televisao para candidatos afro-brasileiros do que para seus pares brancos, mesmo quando controlamos outras de suas características. Mais importante ainda, nós encontramos diferenças no modo como os candidatos utilizam o tempo de campanha que recebem. Candidatos afro-brasileiros tendem a focar dez vezes mais em questoes raciais do que brancos, por exemplo. Esses resultados trazem novas perspectivas sobre porque candidatos afro-brasileiros sao pouco eleitos e os tipos de questoes que eles abordam quando eleitos.Alternate abstract:Television is an important political tool in Latin America. In recognition of its ability to shape public opinion and influence political behavior, Brazilian electoral authorities provide political parties with free television airtime in the weeks preceding elections. While Brazil's publicly financed electoral program levels the playing field between parties, it may contribute to intraparty resource disparities. This article contends that racial considerations influence how party elites distribute television airtime and thus contribute to the political marginalization of Afro-Brazilians. Using original data from Rio de Janeiro's 2012 municipal elections, it shows that party officials provide Afro-Brazilian candidates significantly less airtime than their white counterparts, even after controlling for theoretically important nonracial candidate characteristics. Moreover, it shows that there are racial differences in how candidates use the airtime they are awarded. Afro-Brazilian candidates are nearly ten times more likely than whites to focus on racial issues in their campaign ads. These results provide new insight about why Afro-Brazilians are rarely elected to public office and, when elected, the types of issues they may address.

T1  - Teacher Attitudes Towards the Representation of Homosexuality in Film and Television: A New Self-report Questionnaire
AN  - 2568815931
AB  - The aims of the present research were to evaluate the preliminary psychometric properties of a new measure for evaluating teachers’ attitudes towards the representation of homosexuality in film and television, and to explore the association between moral disengagement and teachers’ negative attitudes towards homosexual representations. Participants were 241 Italian primary and secondary school teachers. The new self-report measure comprises 14 items or 8 items (brief version) scored on a 5-point Likert scale. Teachers completed three instruments: the new measure created to capture participants’ social and emotional evaluations of homosexuality in film and television, the latent and manifest prejudice scale, and the Italian moral disengagement scale. Exploratory factor analysis of the new measure suggested a single factor. The results demonstrated that the measure had satisfactory construct and convergent validity and reliability. Finally, we identified how teachers’ dehumanization of victims and euphemistic labelling were positively associated with their negative attitudes towards representations of homosexuality.

T1  - Poverty and Difficulties in Participation of Urban Social Life: Young Women in Istanbul
AN  - 2575925206
AB  - Women's poverty has long been a topic discussed in worldwide literature. However, no recent study has been conducted which examines the causes and outcomes of women's poverty in Turkey. The objective of this study is to reveal the obstacles young women in Istanbul's Bagcilar District face in seeking to develop urban lives due to poverty. Accordingly, there is a need to contextualize geographically and provide rationale for the case study area: Bagcilar was selected for the field study because it has one of the largest population of immigrants as well as one of the cheapest levels of rent in the city. Methodologically, one-to-one semi-structured, in-depth interviews were conducted with 23 young women aged between 18 and 24. All interviewees have attained only low educational levels and all are employed in the textile sector. In-depth interviews were analyzed and interpreted, and themes and codes were generated accordingly. Themes were derived from most common statements and the most common ciphers in the statements created the codes. The paper reveals the 7 themes obtained from the case study: T1- Lack of education due to financial difficulties; T2- Being responsible for domestic chores and earning a living for the family; T3- Women's lack of freedom in spending the money they earn; T4- Patriarchal family structure; T5- Socialisation limited to relatives; T6- Living within the geographical borders of the neighbourhood; and T7- Active social media usage. This study determined that young women in Bagcilar have difficulty in physically participating in social activities. Poverty and patriarchal family structure were determined to be contributing factors. The unique contribution of this study to the literature is that it reveals how young women in a society with a high poverty rate and gender inequality actively participate in civil society through virtual platforms.

T1  - Positive Religious Coping, Cultural Anthropology of Women Rights and Well-Being of Hindu Women in Bali Indonesia: Mediation of Socio-Economic Women Rights
AN  - 2573031221
AB  - International human rights organizations are working hard to protect women's cultural, social, and political rights by enforcing laws and amendments to safeguard women's well-being in society. Providing women with their fundamental rights is based on positive attitudes towards them in society. Hence it is important to study the factors impacting women's well-being. Established on the Theory of Moral Sentiments and the Normative Theory of Human rights, this study aims to determine the factors that underpin Hindu women's well-being in Bali, Indonesia. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 338 females of the Hindu religion (students, staff, and faculty members) from four public and private Indonesian higher education institutes/universities in Bali. Results revealed that positive religious coping and the cultural anthropology of women's rights, directly and indirectly, impacted women's well-being via women's socio-economic rights. This extended and more comprehensive model would help practitioners better understand how the blend of people's religious values, society, and cultural anthropology of women's rights can positively enhance their well-being.

T1  - The effects of COVID-19 on perceived intergroup competition and negative intergroup outcomes
AN  - 2556552582
AB  - This research examined the effects of the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic on perceived Black-White intergroup competition and negative intergroup psychological outcomes. Two datasets (collected before [2018] and after the onset of [April, 2020] COVID-19) were combined (N = 2,131) for this research. The data provided support for the hypothesis that perceptions of Black-White intergroup competition, and subsequently perceptions of discrimination, behavioral avoidance, intergroup anxiety, and interracial mistrust would be higher after the onset of COVID-19. Three additional predictors, a perceived interracial competition manipulation, political orientation, and population density at the ZIP-code level were examined to test for main effects and moderation of COVID-19 effects. All three predictors exhibited main effects on focal outcomes, and political orientation moderated COVID-19 onset effects: effects were stronger for conservatives. Lastly, perceived intergroup competition mediated the effect of COVID-19 onset on the four focal outcomes.

T1  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL INQUIRY ON GENDER INEQUALITY: THE CASE OF WOMEN SOCCER IN GELVANDALE, PORT ELIZABETH
AN  - 2649773110
AB  - Women for many centuries and during the Apartheid era in South Africa were marginalized from sport. The ability to participate in sport in South Africa is inherently linked to the political history ofthe country. Sport has played a dynamic role in the struggle against the diabolical system of apartheid in South Africa and has a powerful role to play in the transformation and nation building of South Africa. Women have made great strides in sport in recent years in South Africa. However, at times we find that there is unfair media coverage. The unfair coverage ofwomen's sport displaysgender-based attitudes which systematically disadvantage women 's position in society. Women 's participation in sport has grown dramatically but despite this growth coverage ofwomen in sport remains inferior. The objective of this study is to investigate if women are being marginalised in Gelvandale where soccer is concern as well as determining the meaning of gender inequality from an anthropological perspective within the context of soccer in the Gelvandale area. This study also seeks to contribute within the anthropology of soccer in South Africa particularly in the Eastern Cape Province and to come up with recommendations that will contribute towards improvement of soccer in Gelvandale and beyond. Finally, the researchers suggest some recommendations with the view to contribute to the improvement and development of soccer in Gelvandale and to ensure a brighter future for girls and women participating in soccer and sport in general.

T1  - Constructing a new role for family carers and volunteers providing care towards the end of life: an action research approach exploring a new model of hospice care
AN  - 2518872618
AB  - The objective of this study was to understand the conceptualisation and development of a novel way of providing end‐of‐life care in a Cottage Hospice setting, with a focus on the role of family carers and volunteers within this care model. A participatory action research design enabled a situational analysis, together with change processes. The study setting was a hospice in the South of England, and its network of wider associates in the local health economy. Participants were purposively sampled to provide relevant information. Data collection (2017–2018) included documents (e.g., meeting minutes) and interviews (individual and group) with external (e.g., GPs) and internal (e.g., staff, managers, volunteers, patients, family carers) stakeholders. These were followed by action cycles conducted by a core action group which explored issues related to family and young carers, the relationship between the main and Cottage Hospices and workforce engagement with the change process. Iterative, inductive, thematic analysis was followed by axial coding facilitated within NVivo. Twenty‐six individual and eight follow‐up interviews, two group interviews and five discrete action cycles were completed. At the core was a focus on disruption of the norm of professionally provided and mediated care, with three main themes: imagining the future of Cottage Hospice (growing demand, a home‐like space, innovative roles for families and volunteers); developing the role of family caregivers (making agreements, meeting needs, social inclusion and the ‘unknown’ expectations) and quality and safety issues (negative perceptions, personalised care and volunteer roles). Change was viewed as both a threat and an opportunity. Cottage Hospice represents the possibility of a truly new way of meeting the needs of dying people and their families, and could act as a template for progressive service developments elsewhere.

T1  - From diagnosis to action: Understanding youth strengths and hurdles and using decision-making tools to foster youth-inclusive sustainable agriculture intensification
AN  - 2543839848
AB  - By 2050, the youth population in Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) is expected to exceed 60%. To contain the ensuing youth bulge, reduce unemployment and 'flight' from rural areas, and increase agricultural productivity, countries seek policies to enhance youth engagement in agriculture. However, orthodox assumptions and locally-inappropriate policies keep youth engagement low. We use qualitative enquiry with focus group discussions and key informant interviews in Ghana and Malawi to examine youth strengths, aspirations, barriers to sustainable agriculture intensification (SAI), and implications for enhancing their inclusion. We further examine the potential of three equity-analysis tools to guide decision making on youth-inclusive SAI. Findings show that youth face limited access to land and capital, limited involvement in decision making and in farmer/development groups, and negative attitudes from community members and officials. Land access was complex, mediated by land-inheritance system, land type, population pressures, culture, and land markets. Land-access problems were acute in matrilineal Malawi, particularly for young men. Decision makers attested to the relevance and usefulness of selected youth-equity analysis tools, and to positive training outcomes on awareness, knowledge, and skills in using them. We contribute context-specific evidence on youth's positive contributions in SAI and the need to recognize them with more targeted and location-differentiated interventions on resources access, including land. Findings also inform the quest for pathways to move the youth-agriculture/SAI debate into tangible actions from below, equipped with youth-analysis tools for decision makers to foster youth-inclusive SAI in Ghana, Malawi, and other countries with similar contexts.

T1  - Understanding the effectiveness of advertisements about the long-term harms of alcohol and low-risk drinking guidelines: A mediation analysis
AN  - 2528237057
AB  - Rationale: Many people overestimate the amount of alcohol that increases their risk of harm and so may not perceive any need to change their drinking behaviour. Several countries have developed low-risk drinking guidelines, yet awareness of these guidelines remains low. Furthermore, mass media campaigns about alcohol-related harms may have limited impact if people do not perceive their current consumption as potentially harmful. Integrating drinking guidelines into media campaigns about alcohol's harms can concurrently provide drinkers with information about low-risk drinking levels and compelling reasons to comply. Objective: Our aim was to build understanding of the effectiveness of messages about the long-term harms of drinking and low-risk drinking guidelines, by testing the mediating effects of estimates of harmful drinking levels and attitudes towards drinking alcohol on subsequent intentions and behaviours. Method: In an online experiment conducted in 2016, n = 1156 Australian adult monthly drinkers were randomly assigned to view advertisements for non-alcohol products (NON-ALC; control), advertisements featuring long-term harms of alcohol (LTH), or LTH advertisements plus a guideline message (LTH + G). Immediately following exposure, we measured estimates of harmful drinking levels and attitudes towards drinking alcohol. One week later, we measured intentions to drink less and behavioural compliance with the guideline. Results: Compared to NON-ALC advertisements, exposure to LTH + G advertisements increased (i) the proportion of respondents who correctly estimated harmful drinking levels, which in turn, strengthened intentions to drink less (42% of the total effect was mediated), and (ii) negative attitudes, which in turn, also increased intentions to drink less (35% mediated) and behavioural compliance (24% mediated). Compared to NON-ALC, LTH advertisements increased negative attitudes, which in turn strengthened intentions to drink less (53% mediated). Conclusions: When paired with effective alcohol harm reduction television advertisements, messages promoting low-risk drinking guidelines can increase drinkers' intentions to reduce their alcohol consumption and compliance with low-risk drinking guidelines.

T1  - How Gender Is Recognised in Economic and Education Policy Programmes and Initiatives: An Analysis of Nigerian State Policy Discourse
AN  - 2612837591
AB  - Many African states are involved in the frontline discourse on the fight for gender equality through the adoption of public policies, aiming to improve the lives of women through social, economic, and political development. In Nigeria, despite the adoption of Article 42 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 adapted from the United Nations principles of gender equality, which provides for equality and elimination of all forms of discrimination against women, the Nigerian state still struggles with different forms of gendered marginalisation issues against women in various aspects of Nigerian society; these issues are mainly due to cultural, economic, and legislative challenges. Therefore, this article explores how gender is recognized through public policy programmes and initiatives using a qualitative content analysis of relevant policy documents. The documents were collected from various government ministries and cover policy areas that represent entrepreneurship and economic activities in Nigeria between 2000 and 2020. The analysis confirms the recognition of gender in public policies by subjective bias and mediating access to education for female gender advancement in Nigerian society. Some gender gaps were also recognized and discussed in the article.

T1  - Ostracism, Psychological Capital, Perceived Social Support and Depression among Economically Disadvantaged Youths: A Moderated Mediation Model
AN  - 2596023804
AB  - Mental health promotion of economically disadvantaged youths is a popular issue in current China. Economically disadvantaged youths are at greater risk of depression. Ostracism may be an important predictor of depression for them. However, no consensus has been reached on the underlying mechanism between ostracism and depression. A total of 1207 economically disadvantaged youths were recruited from six universities in China. These youths were asked to complete questionnaires measuring depression, ostracism, psychological capital, and perceived social support. A moderated mediation model was examined by using IBM SPSS STATISTICS 27macro program PROCESS version 3.5, in which psychological capital was a mediating variable, and perceived social support was a moderating variable. Lack of causal inferences and self-report bias due to the cross-sectional and self-report survey need to be considered when interpreting results. The results revealed that ostracism was positively associated with depression among economically disadvantaged youths. Psychological capital partially mediated the association. Perceived social support moderated the indirect association between ostracism and depression via psychological capital among economically disadvantaged females. Training and intentional practice of psychological capital could be the core to develop the depression interventions targeting economically disadvantaged youths with experience of ostracism. Gender and perceived social support need to be considered in developing the interventions.

T1  - Health Risks and Consequences of a COVID-19 Infection for People with Disabilities: Scoping Review and Descriptive Thematic Analysis
AN  - 2566033700
AB  - This study aims to synthesize the literature on any disproportionate health risks or consequences of a COVID-19 infection for people with disabilities. Scoping review with a descriptive thematic analysis was carried out. Up to mid-September 2020, seven scientific databases and three preprint servers were searched to identify empirical or perspective papers. Snowballing searches and expert’ consultations also took place. Two independent reviewers were used for the screenings and data extractions. Of 1027 references, 58 were included, 15 of which were empirical articles. The thematic analysis showed that: (1) People with disabilities living in residential or long-term care facilities were more likely to have greater infection rates; (2) Intersecting mediators of greater infection risks were multiple (e.g., lack of accessible information); (3) People with disabilities often face greater health problems when infected; and (4) Unethical disadvantages in the rationing of lifesaving and critical care can be experienced by people with disabilities. Conclusions: Beyond any health-related vulnerabilities (e.g., comorbidity rates), multiple yet modifiable environmental factors can provide disproportionate health risks and consequences of a COVID-19 infection for people with disabilities. Public health and policy measures must prevent or reduce modifiable environmental risks.

T1  - Peer phubbing and selfie liking: The roles of attention seeking and gender
AN  - 2550684857
AB  - We explored the relationship between being phubbed by one's peers and selfie liking, and examined the mediating effect of attention seeking and the moderating effect of gender in this relationship. An online survey was conducted with 427 university students. The results reveal that peer phubbing was positively related to attention seeking and selfie liking. Further, attention seeking was positively related to selfie liking, and attention seeking mediated the relationship between peer phubbing and selfie liking. The indirect pathways involved gender differences, with a stronger indirect effect for men compared to that for women. Thus, gender moderated the relationship between peer phubbing and attention seeking, as well as the relationship between attention seeking and selfie liking. These findings illustrate that selfie-related behaviors may function as a buffer for being phubbed. Moreover, phubbed individuals are prone to engage in attention-seeking behavior and frequent selfie liking.

T1  - Food Neophobia and Food Disgust: The Mediating Role of Perceived Vulnerability to Disease
AN  - 2532335455
AB  - Negative attitudes towards food are influenced by two factors, neophobia and often related disgust. Neophobia is the tendency to avoid new foods, while food disgust is the refusal of food that is considered potentially harmful to health. The study presented here aims to analyze the correlation between these two attitudes and the possible mediation operated by the perception of vulnerability to diseases, in order to understand if and how this contributes to the disgust towards certain unfamiliar foods. The study was developed through the administration of an anonymous questionnaire to a sample of 487 Italian citizens participating on a voluntary basis. Three tools were used: Food Neophobia Scale, Perceived Vulnerability to Disease, and Food Disgust Scale. The results showed a strong positive correlation between food disgust and food neophobia. Furthermore, through the application of structural mediation models, it has been shown that between food neophobia and food disgust, there is a mediation effect determined by perceived infectivity. The research aims to make a significant contribution to the understanding of the relationship between food disgust and some individual and psychological characteristics of people, demonstrating that the fear of disease transmission affects their food choices.

T1  - Translation as a Communication Strategy in Representing National Culture
AN  - 2511163156
AB  - The linguistic trinity policy, which has been implemented in Kazakhstan since its independence in the 1990s, is aimed at integrating translation into global processes. Kazakh-Russian bilingualism, caused by the historical and geopolitical proximity of the two countries, is now turning into trilingualism, joining up with English as the dominant language for international communication. Literary translation as a part of cross-cultural communication is also involved in social inclusion processes, contributing to the exchange of cultural values and a better understanding of modern multilingual Kazakhstani society. This article focuses on the issue of presenting Kazakh literature in translation through a mediating language and the research involves an analysis of culture-related lexemes as representations of a nomadic lifestyle in the mirror of intercultural communication. The authors highlight cultural and linguistic aspects of Kazakh transmitted from the mediatory Russian into the target English. Based on a review of previous findings on indirect literary translation, this article discusses whether a mediating language affects the inclusion of Kazakh culture in the globalization process.

T1  - Brexit: The influence of motivation to respond without prejudice, willingness to disagree, and attitudes to immigration
AN  - 2474519452
AB  - Britain’s unexpected vote to leave the European Union (Brexit) in June 2016 has proved divisive and damaging both within the United Kingdom and internationally. Across two correlational studies, the current research proposed a model to explain the Brexit vote, with attitudes to immigration and willingness to disagree (WD) as direct predictors of the referendum result, and internal (IMS) and external (EMS) motivation to respond without prejudice as indirect predictors. Study 1 (N = 353) and Study 2 (N = 363) both showed good fit with the model and, respectively, explained 48% and 46% of the referendum result. More positive attitudes to immigration predicted a vote to remain. Higher IMS and lower EMS predicted a vote to remain, fully mediated by attitudes to immigration. In Study 1, lower WD also predicted a vote to remain, both directly and indirectly via attitudes to immigration, although this was not replicated in Study 2. These results are discussed both in relation to the Brexit result, and the implications for motivation to respond without prejudice, WD, and political correctness more generally.

T1  - Predictors of decent work across time: Testing propositions from Psychology of Working Theory
AN  - 2479815885
AB  - The goal of the current study was to examine longitudinal relations among predictors of decent work within Psychology of Working Theory (PWT). Data were collected from a large group of employed adults (N = 1540) at three-time points over six months. Multilevel modeling was used to test for the between and within-person effects of four predictor variables (economic constraints, marginalization experiences, work volition, career adaptability) on decent work. Significant between and within-person effects on decent work existed for all four predictor variables. However, within-person effects of economic constraints and marginalization on work volition and career adaptability were nonsignificant. These findings indicate that when considering sample level averages (between-person effects), theory consistent effects were found in connecting these variables across time. Work volition, in particular, was the most robust predictor of decent work and was the most robust mediator connecting economic constraints and marginalization experiences to decent work. When considering individual participant variability across time (within-person effects), it appears that changes from mean scores in structural and psychological factors both predict fluctuations in decent work. However, psychological factors do not mediate the effects of structural factors. Implications for research, practice, and theory are discussed.

T1  - Mainstream Marginalization: Secret Political Organizing Through Social Media
AN  - 2474691648
AB  - Scholars have addressed how the socially marginalized, individuals with fringe viewpoints, or the politically marginalized in authoritarian regimes use social media to organize or connect in secret. Yet intensifying partisan polarization and prejudice in the United States has made it necessary to study how mainstream partisans in liberal democracies use social media to organize in secret. This study explores why mainstream partisans in the United States—average Republicans or Democrats—organize in secret online and analyzes the unique functions of social media for political organizing amid contextual marginalization. Through interviews with group leaders and a digital ethnography of a secret Facebook group in the United States, I find that mainstream partisans use social media to form secret political groups when they are the minority in their local community and that the online secret group serves several unique functions for members. First, the group operates as a community of solidarity for those reticent to disclose their political beliefs and as a community of contention to criticize and revitalize the minority Party in their region. The group also operates as a community of practice, allowing members to learn and rehearse communication among like-minded others. These findings hold implications for how scholars study communication in a digital and polarized era and how practitioners gauge public opinion.

T1  - INDIGENOUS PEOPLES OF BIAFRA (IPOB) AND THE RENEWED QUEST FOR BIAFRA
AN  - 2501927678
AB  - This paper tried to understand the unceasing agitation for actualisation of Biafra among those who did not experience the NigerianBiafran war (1967-1970); those on the margin of state power and the generation of those yet to recover from the traumas of the war. The renewed resurgence of Biafra as epitomised by the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB), brings to the fore the issues of post-civil war reconciliation in Nigeria. The official narrative is that Biafra ceased to exist on 15 January 1970. However, in the minds of millions of Igbo suffering from political and economic exclusion, the Biafran war rages on. Using both primary and secondary sources, this paper interrogates the disenchantment among the younger generation of the Igbo and how to build a new Nigeria that would be inclusive.

T1  - Meaning in life accounts for the association between long-term ostracism and depressive symptoms: The moderating role of self-compassion
AN  - 2416186716
AB  - According to the temporal need–threat model, ostracism results in three stages of responses. Research on the responses to ostracism has predominantly focused on the first two stages, and the literature needs further empirical evidence on responses to long-term ostracism. We conducted two studies to better understand the association between long-term ostracism and depressive symptoms. Study 1 found a positive association between long-term ostracism and depressive symptoms. More importantly, Study 1 found the threatened sense of meaning in life partially mediates the relationship. Study 2 further found that self-compassion, a positive and healthy trait, weakens the relationship between long-term ostracism and depressive symptoms. More specifically, self-compassion moderates the relationship between the threatened sense of meaning in life and depressive symptoms. Our findings not only further our understanding about the negative consequences of long-term ostracism but also suggest a possible way to mitigate depressive symptoms associated with long-term ostracism.

T1  - Will you shake my hand? Factors of noncompliance with COVID-19 behavioral rules in the framework of enforced social isolation in Russia
TT  - COVID-19 behavioral rules
AN  - 2476611331
AB  - PurposeThis research paper is devoted to the investigation of reasons for not complying with behavioral rules in the context of epidemiological situation aggravation because of COVID-19 spread.Design/methodology/approachThe study was conducted within the framework of a mixed methodology: a series of semistructured interviews and an online survey. In the first stage, 15 interviews were conducted to understand the possible reasons for not following the self-isolation rules or ignoring self-precaution recommendations. In the second stage, an online survey was conducted from 10th to 20th May 2020, gathering a total of 540 responses. This paper describes existing approaches for understanding the process of making a choice for not following recommended or obligatory behavioral rules as well as the significant reasons for making this choice.FindingsAs a result of the qualitative stage, the process of choosing to perform risky physical contact with another person was analyzed. Moreover, the possible factors that influence this behavior were discovered: primarily social environment and trust in the government, Internet, media. The way of coping with emerging conflict of making a traditional physical contact or staying in distance was also discussed. As a result of the quantitative stage, a significant contribution of trust toward institutions and official statistics on the number of people infected in different aspects of precautionary behavior was discovered, as well as other factors, such as the presence of infected in a social environment of a respondent.Originality/valueThis study contains valuable information about possible reasons for following or not following all precautions in the risky epidemiological situation and about the thinking process of an individual who does not follow precautions.

T1  - Uneasy passages between neoliberalism and feminism: Social inclusion and financialization in Israel's empowerment microfinance
AN  - 2412747754
AB  - This article focuses on feminist non‐governmental organizations advocating for economic empowerment of women (EEW) through microfinance, using Israel as a case study. Through fieldwork, interviews and documents, we investigate the institutional practices, cultural discourses and struggles that EEWs develop in order to expose the particular ways in which feminist organizations interact with the world of finance and state institutions. Our analysis points to the complex power dynamics of mediation, suggesting that there are ‘uneasy passages' between neoliberalism and feminism, ones that help re‐signify the meaning of financial discourses while re‐politicizing women's social and economic exclusions. Simultaneously, however, this relation induces a series of compromises, whereby EEWs adopt neoliberal modes of governance. Rejecting the notion that contemporary feminism has simply been co‐opted by neoliberalism or the perception of EEW microfinance as a mere expansion of neoliberal rationalities, we reveal new sites and ways in which feminism both colludes and collides with neoliberalism.

T1  - Redistribution and recognition: An analysis of gender in/equality discourse on Nigerian female blogs
AN  - 2415221046
AB  - This article examines the dynamics of representation between cultural and economic forms of gender inequality on Nigerian female blogs. Through a thematic analysis of 253 comments retrieved from five female-authored blogs, I draw on prominent cases of gender inequality in Nigeria, such as ‘President Muhammadu Buhari’s position on his wife’ and the ‘rejection of the Gender and Equal Opportunities Bill’. The analysis showed that blog discussions among females in Nigeria suggest extensive intolerance to cultural change, especially in comparison to the more positive attitude towards redistribution. To tackle this complexity, I argue that gender equality advocacy in Nigeria should commence mainly from a redistributive standpoint. This needs to be accompanied by the ulterior aim of achieving recognition. Overall, the study contests the idea that identity politics is threatening to replace the issue of redistribution on the global political agenda by highlighting the primacy of redistributive politics in blog discourse. It enriches media studies and gender research by providing rare insight into the practical connections between cultural and economic politics of gender inequality in an online discursive context.

T1  - “You’re such a pain!”: Investigating how psychological pain influences the ostracism of a burdensome group member: GPIR
AN  - 2407985156
AB  - Maintaining social relationships with others is essential for survival, but not all relationships are beneficial. Individuals exclude nonbeneficial burdensome group members, those who encumber group success. We investigated whether feeling psychological pain is a mechanism that prompts assessment of social threats―potentially putting the “brakes” on burdensome (nonbeneficial) relationships. Specifically, we investigated if interacting with burdensome individuals caused others to experience psychological pain, negative affect, and to dislike the burdensome individual. Across 5 studies, using 3 different paradigms, we found those who interacted with a burdensome individual experienced psychological pain, which influenced ostracizing (excluding and ignoring) the burdensome group member. In Studies 4 and 5, we found psychological pain mediated the relationship between burdensomeness and ostracism even when we accounted for negative affect and dislike of the burdensome individual. Our results suggest psychological pain can guide social interactions and should be the subject of future research involving social threat.

T1  - Preventing Child Sexual Abuse Using Picture Books: The Effect of Book Character and Message Framing
AN  - 2405024879
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate whether and how a picture book preventing child sexual abuse can improve children’s self-protection skills. The study was conducted in China with Chinese children. In a 2 × 2 between-subjects design, character in the book (human versus animal) and message framing (gain versus loss) were manipulated. Compared to a baseline group who were not exposed to the prevention book, children in the experimental groups significantly enhanced their ability to recognize a potential abuse situation and refuse an inappropriate touch request. Results suggest that the prevention picture books are more effective when using a human character and a gain-framed message. The explanation for this was that human characters simulated children’s perceived norm and gain-framed messages increased children’s message recall, perceived self-efficacy and positive attitude toward the message, all of which in turn positively affected children’s self-protection skills.

T1  - Markers of Online Privacy Marginalization: Empirical Examination of Socioeconomic Disparities in Social Media Privacy Attitudes, Literacy, and Behavior
AN  - 2429457341
AB  - This study explores how traditional socioeconomic markers of the digital divide interact with new markers of marginalization when it comes to online privacy protecting behaviors. To do this, we analyze data from a representative sample of social media users in the United States. Using hierarchical linear regression, we explore the relationships between established components of the digital divide, antecedents of privacy concerns, privacy-protecting behaviors, and privacy literacy. Our analysis highlights privacy literacy as a potentially understudied dimension of the digital divide and unpacks how traditional markers of marginalization explain distinct dimensions of privacy-protecting behaviors. Moreover, our findings suggest that the privacy literacy divide can amplify aspects of the second- and third-level digital divides, when translated into privacy-protecting behaviors.

T1  - Can Social Media News Encourage Activism? The Impact of Discrimination News Frames on College Students’ Activism Intentions
AN  - 2429457269
AB  - The marginalization of African Americans is a pervasive issue in American society. As African Americans are left on the fringes of economic, social, and political resources, social media news offers the potential for motivating action that combats the institutional policies contributing to societal disparities. Utilizing the lens of the Anger Activism Model (AAM), this experiment recruited undergraduate participants (N = 198) and tested the effects of implicit and explicit discrimination news frames on activism intentions. The findings indicate that news frames directly impact reported levels of activism intentions among college students. Unexpectedly, we found racial differences in perceptions of whether the news stories involved racial discrimination. The implications of these findings are discussed considering social media news, marginalization, and activism among college students.

T1  - Attitude toward rehabilitation as a key predictor for adopting alternative identities in deradicalization programs: An investigation of terrorist detainees’ profiles
AN  - 2350160977
AB  - Several studies have shed light on factors that contribute to radicalization. However, fewer studies have addressed the factors that contribute to deradicalization, especially with terrorist detainees as participants. The present study investigates the role of attitudes toward rehabilitation in deradicalization programs, and its role in predicting the outcome for these programs. We hypothesized that when terrorist detainees adopt alternative identities (identities alternative to their jihadist identity), their support for jihad as war will be lessened, even when they still hold jihadist ideology as their source of significance. To test this hypothesis, we obtained 89 interview profiles of actual terrorist detainees across 35 Indonesian prisons. We found that lesser support for jihad as war was predicted by a more positive attitude toward the deradicalization program, and this was mediated by the adoption of alternative identities. Further, the effect of the mediator on support for jihad as war was neither weakened nor strengthened by perceived significance of jihadist ideology. These findings suggest that even when a person possesses a strong ideological commitment to jihad, this may not manifest into violence when they adopt alternative identities and goals. These results were interpreted and discussed through goal systems theory and the multifinality account of radical behavior.

T1  - Examining Predictors and Outcomes of Decent Work Perception with Chinese Nursing College Students
AN  - 2562162430
AB  - Drawing on the psychology of working theory (PWT), the present study was performed to evaluate the predictor session of the PWT and career exploration behavior with a sample of Chinese nursing college students from diverse backgrounds. The research employed a cross-sectional research design and 854 nursing students were recruited from one health vocational college situated in Northwest China. Structural equation modeling was utilized to conduct the analysis; confirmatory factor analysis and structural model testing were performed accordingly. Moreover, mediation analysis that used bias-corrected percentile bootstrapping method and moderation analysis were carried out in accordance. Overall, most of the proposed direct paths were significant, but the mediation results were mixed. Proactive personality simply moderated the impact of economic constraints on career adaptability. The results suggest that PWT is applicable to nursing college students and the model is generally supported in the Chinese context. It is the first empirical work that used this model among nursing college students and future decent work perceptions contributed another important antecedent of career exploration behavior. The practical implications based on these findings are provided as well.

T1  - A New Player for Tackling Inequalities? Framing the Social Value and Impact of the Maker Movement
AN  - 2511165663
AB  - The Maker Movement has raised great expectations towards its potential for tackling social inequalities by mediating technology-related skills to everybody. Are maker spaces new players for social inclusion in digital societies? How can this potential impact be framed? While scientific discourse has so far identified broad value and impact dimensions of the Maker Movement, this article adds empirical insight into the potential for tackling social inequalities. The study is based on 39 interviews with makers and managers of maker initiatives and ten self-reporting surveys filled in by maker initiative managers throughout Europe, which have been analyzed qualitatively. We found four main domains in which makers address social inclusion: First, by mediating skills and competences not only in the field of digital technologies but in the broader sense of empowering people to “make” solutions for encountered problems. Second, we found that makers actively strive to provide democratized access to digital fabrication and the knowledge on how to use them. Third and fourth, we found different ambitions articulated by makers to change society and social practices towards a society providing better opportunities for individuals. As an entry point for further research and actions, we derived a maker typology that reflects the diverse and various types of relationships to be found in the maker community. This typology could be used for exploring further collaborations between social actors and the Maker Movement. We conclude with an outlook on potential trajectories of the Maker Movement and specify which could influence the inclusion of marginalized persons.

T1  - Perceptions of Tuberculosis Among Individuals Born in a High-Endemic Setting, Now Living in a Low-Endemic Setting
AN  - 2183928734
AB  - Of all individuals diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) in Sweden 2015 were 90% born in other countries. Early diagnosis and treatment is essential to avoid TB transmission. Lack of knowledge about TB and anticipated negative social consequences have proved to be significant contributing factors to delay in seeking health care. This study aimed to understand the perception of TB among people originating from a high-endemic region, currently living in a low-endemic region. A qualitative study design, with male and female participants from a high-endemic region divided into focus groups. A semi-structured interview guide was used to elicit their perceptions of TB. A qualitative content analysis was performed on the recorded material from the interviews. The informants noted that their attitude towards individuals with TB had changed, previously they had felt prejudiced towards them whereas now they felt supportive. It seems possible to diminish TB stigma by ensuring suitable health care is available in combination with correct information about transmission, infectiousness and treatment.

T1  - Living Compound Marginality: Experiences of a Japanese Muslim Woman
AN  - 2328376203
AB  - The present study is proposed as first step to constructing an analytical framework for the marginality experienced by ethnic Japanese Muslim women, on the basis of which the experiences of other ethnic Japanese Muslims and potentially those of converts to Islam in other non-Muslim-majority societies, can be analyzed, taking account of their differing social contexts.

In discussing the situations surrounding ethnic Japanese Muslims in general, reference is also made to the information obtained through the previous fieldwork (participant observations at mosques and interviews) I conducted on the activities of ethnic Japanese Muslims in 2014 and publications by and about ethnic Japanese Muslims, including those on Internet sites.

[...]this tendency does not apply to ethnic Japanese Muslims, especially those who do not have family ties with foreign-born Muslims.6 Due to their extremely small number, they do not usually have their own ‘ethnic’ mosque communities where they reside.7 This means that ethnic Japanese Muslims usually have to operate within a community (or communities) where the majority of community members are of foreign origins.8 As will be shown, such lack of ethnic independence may partly be behind the marginalization of ethnic Japanese Muslims within Japan’s Muslim community.

Recently published research covers such topics as the networks of migrant Muslims seeking employment or setting up businesses in Japan (Higuchi et al. 2007), the process of identity-building of Japanese women married to Pakistani Muslim men (Kudo 2008), the development of mosque-based communities (Tanada 2015) and the expansion of halal businesses (Numajiri 2017).9 A similar focus is found in the media coverage of Japan’s Muslim community, with common topics including the development and activities of migrant Muslim communities and their relationship with local Japanese communities, stories of couples or families involving a migrant Muslim and a Japanese spouse, as well as the increase of halal businesses and how schools deal with the increasing demand to cater for the needs of Muslim children.

T1  - Who Doesn’t Want Democracy? A Multilevel Analysis of Elite and Mass Attitudes
AN  - 2221125799
AB  - Despite its global rise in popularity, a significant number of people still oppose democracy. The current study evaluates three competing theories of opposition to democracy–developmentalist, culturalist, and elitist – using a series of multi-level regression models that combine individualand country-level variables. Results of our statistical analyses suggest that: 1) country-level indicators of social, political, and economic development are not consistently related to individual support for democracy; 2) macro-cultural factors have mixed effects on individual support for democracy; and 3) individual income and education have strong effects on individual support for democracy, but this relationship is mediated by country-level economic development. Specifically, we find that high-income individuals in relatively underdeveloped countries are more likely to oppose democracy than high-income individuals in wealthier countries. These results suggest that economic, social, and political development do not necessarily go together.

T1  - Perceptions of the Physical and Social Neighbourhood Environment and Youth Volunteerism: Canada's Capital Region: Revue Canadienne de Recherche sur les OSBL et l'Économie Sociale (ANSERJ)
AN  - 2269925561
AB  - Youth are embedded within various ecological systems that may impact their philanthropic behaviour. This study employed online data from a sample of undergraduate students and traced the various pathways through which neighbourhood perceptions (e.g., social cohesion, satisfaction with amenities) related to formal and informal volunteering intensities. Path analyses revealed that neighbourhood cohesion directly predicted formal and informal volunteer frequency; as well, it mediated the relationship between satisfaction with neighbourhood amenities and informal volunteerism. Neighbourhood cohesion was strongly associated with informal volunteer intensity, whereas satisfaction with neighbourhood attractiveness did not relate to any volunteer outcomes. Neighbourhood characteristics may be important drivers of youth volunteerism, and thus stakeholders, organizations, and individuals should consider the impact of the social environmental context on shaping youths’ helping behaviour.Alternate abstract:Les jeunes font partie de divers systèmes écologiques qui peuvent influencer leur comportement philanthropique. Cette étude utilise des données recueillies en ligne à partir d’un échantillon d’étudiants de premier cycle afin de retracer les divers parcours par lesquels leur perception de leur quartier (par exemple, sa cohésion sociale, leur satisfaction par rapport aux services offerts) a une incidence sur leurs activités bénévoles formelles et informelles. L’analyse révèle que la cohésion sociale a comme effet d’augmenter le bénévolat formel et informel. En outre, la cohésion semble augmenter le bénévolat informel là où il y a satisfaction par rapport aux services offerts dans la communauté. En effet, il y a une forte corrélation entre la cohésion d’un quartier et le bénévolat informel. En revanche, la satisfaction à l’égard du pittoresque d’un quartier ne paraît pas avoir d’incidence sur le niveau d’implication philanthropique. Il n’empêche qu’en général un bon quartier peut motiver les jeunes à faire du bénévolat. Ainsi, les parties prenantes, les organisations et les individus devraient tenir compte du contexte socioenvironnemental sur le comportement philanthropique des jeunes.

T1  - Marketing innovations to old-age consumers: A dynamic Bass model for different life stages
AN  - 2210874389
AB  - To identify context-dependent opportunities to market innovations to the elderly, this study empirically analyzes the most prevalent pathways through advanced age, demonstrating which circumstances in the old-age life course provide the strongest potential for specific targeting strategies. First, using a latent Markov model and longitudinal survey data spanning 15 years, we produce a dynamic life course model with transitions over time. Second, we link a modified Bass diffusion model - using both static and dynamic parameters - to our model, augmenting it with a second cross-sectional consumer behavior data set. The results show comparatively strong consumption spending, high media interaction, but diminishing social inclusion in old age, though all factors exhibit heterogeneity among old-age clusters. Employing dynamic diffusion models, we find that a static view of the elderly market that ignores life course transitions generally overestimates their spending power. Forecasts of cluster-specific adoption dynamics draw a differentiated picture of individual clusters' attractiveness. Our analysis underscores the influence of life events on individual behavior and shows that a dynamic view of elderly markets yields a more nuanced and accurate assessment of their potential and attractiveness. It also confirms that social status and income strongly affect consumer behavior and spending, though we identify several exceptions.

T1  - The Cancer’s Margins Project: Access to Knowledge and Its Mobilization by LGBQ/T Cancer Patients
AN  - 2300626335
AB  - Sexual and/or gender minority populations (LGBQ/T) have particular cancer risks, lower involvement in cancer screening, and experience barriers in communication with healthcare providers. All of these factors increase the probability of health decisions linked with poor outcomes that include higher levels of cancer mortality. Persistent discrimination against, and stigmatization of, LGBQ/T people is reflected in sparse medical curriculum addressing LGBQ/T communities. Marginalization makes LGBQ/T persons particularly reliant on knowledge derived from online networks and mainstream media sources. In what is likely the first nationally-funded and nation-wide study of LGBQ/T experiences of cancer, the Cancer’s Margins project (www.lgbtcancer.ca) conducted face-to-face interviews with 81 sexual and/or gender minority patients diagnosed and treated for breast and/or gynecological cancer in five Canadian provinces and the San Francisco Bay area (US). With specific attention to knowledge access, sharing, and mobilization, our objective was to document and analyze complex intersectional relationships between marginalization, gender and sexuality, and cancer health decision-making and care experiences. Findings indicate that cancer care knowledge in online environments is shaped by cisnormative and heteronormative narratives. Cancer knowledge and support environments need, by contrast, to be designed by taking into account intersectionally diverse models of minority identities and communities.

T1  - The emotional costs of computers: an expectancy-value theory analysis of predominantly low-socioeconomic status minority students' STEM attitudes
AN  - 2116068275
AB  - There is a strong push to increase American students' interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematic (STEM) careers. However, minority and female students remain underrepresented in the STEM fields. Therefore, it is essential that we continue to examine the potential factors that both incite and dissuade STEM interest. We apply Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) to examine STEM attitudes of predominantly low-socioeconomic status minority elementary school students over the course of a computing intervention. Furthermore, we integrate the digital inequality mental access conceptualization of 'emotional costs' into the EVT model in order to predict students' negative STEM attitudes. Data are from a large-scale computing intervention that took place in a primarily minority, high poverty, urban elementary school district located in the southeastern USA. Results indicate that positive expectancies for success and subjective task values predict students' positive STEM attitudes. Emotional costs toward technology primarily predict negative STEM attitudes. Students' expectancies/values and emotional costs may have a 'push-and-pull' effect on the formation of STEM attitudes. This study successfully links digital disparities to STEM disparities by integrating the digital inequality concept of emotional costs. Practically, we conclude that future computing interventions should increase students' academic-related expectancies and values while also minimizing their emotional costs in order to address both digital and STEM inequalities. Theoretically, we conclude that broad conceptualizations of emotional costs should be included in future studies to help explain negative attitudes/motivations toward STEM-related topics.

T1  - Parenting during Ferguson: making sense of white parents’ silence
AN  - 2066658645
AB  - This paper examines what white, middle-class parents report saying to their children about racial tension and racial protest when events like Michael Brown’s death and the Ferguson protests are the top news stories. The data come from interviews with forty white, middle-class parents in 2014–15. The study results indicate that few parents recalled speaking with their children about racial tension or racial protest even when such discussions were highly visible in the news and on social media. I argue parents’ silence stemmed from a desire to create a protected, worry-free childhood combined with an inability to understand how such subjects related to their white life. However, not all parents were silent. Twelve participants reported speaking with their children about these subjects via a neutral or a defensive colour-blind frame. Only two participants drew attention to issues of power and privilege.

T1  - A Brief Introduction to the Multidimensional Intercultural Training Acculturation Model (MITA) for Middle Eastern Adolescent Refugees
AN  - 2108437513
AB  - The large number of adolescent refugees around the world constitutes a great challenge for societies. However, current models of acculturation have been developed for migrants, but not specifically for adolescent refugees. Crucial factors to describe adolescent refugee acculturation, such as intentions to return to their homeland, especially with respect to adolescent refugees with temporary residency and experiences of potentially traumatic events, are missing. Hence, the Multidimensional Intercultural Training Acculturation (MITA) model is introduced. The model proposes that two major concerns for adolescent refugees, which are socio-cultural adjustment and mental health, are predicted by intercultural and social–emotional competence, intentions to return to their homeland, and experiences of traumatic events. Moreover, the effects of three modes of acculturation are also proposed in the model. It is expected that these variables mediate the effects of intercultural competence, social–emotional competence, intentions to return to the homeland, and experiences of traumatic events on socio-cultural adjustment as well as mental health. Finally, it is also expected that in-group social support and out-group social support moderate the direct connection between the experiences of traumatic events and mental health.

T1  - African American Elders, Mental Health, and the Role of the Church
AN  - 2086655612
AB  - The African American church has played a major role in African American communities, and church relationships represent an important stress-coping resource for older African Americans. African Americans rely on the church and church members for assistance, in part because of difficulties accessing formal resources due to social and economic marginalization. Church can buffer against the negative effects of discrimination upon generalized anxiety disorder among older African Americans. Interventions that focus on the use of church members for support capitalize on a major strength among older African Americans.

T1  - Implications of Sex Guilt: A Meta-Analysis
AN  - 2019389382
AB  - A meta-analysis of the literature examining the outcomes related to feelings of sex guilt was conducted. The analysis demonstrates gendered differences in the experience of sex guilt and myriad attitudinal and behavioral impacts. Specifically, men report lower levels of sex guilt, r = -.227 than do women and implications of sex guilt experience are vast, including its association with engagement in less sexual activity, r = -.337, less favorable attitudes toward sex and lessened use of contraceptives, r = -.276, reduced reports of sexual arousal in response to an explicitly sexual media content, r = -.308, less positive emotional response to sexually explicit media content, r = -.367, reduced level of sexual information accuracy, r = -.324, and less positive attitudes toward sexual behavior, r = -404. Sex guilt is positively related to level of religiosity/religious behavior, r = .439. The findings suggest that sex guilt provides a consistent set of responses to sexual information and media content as well as a motivational basis for behavior. These outcomes are further explicated and discussed.

T1  - A dual process model of post-colonial ideology
AN  - 2085137785
AB  - We present an integrative model outlining how the threat and competition-based motives identified in the Dual Process Model of Ideology and Prejudice are linked to the context-specific ideologies of historical negation and symbolic exclusion identified by the Dark Duo Model of post-colonial ideology. Using nationally representative data from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (N = 12,586), we found reasonable support for the integrative model. Social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism were each independently and positively associated with historical negation and symbolic exclusion. These post-colonial ideologies in turn were associated with greater resource-specific policy opposition, and mediated associations between social dominance orientation and right-wing authoritarianism with policy attitudes. The results show that broader ideological motives that maintain inequalities may also act as antecedents to culturally specific ideologies which provide more effective, context-specific means to legitimise inequalities faced by Indigenous groups.

T1  - Crafting messages to promote water conservation: Using time‐framed messages to boost conservation actions in the United States and China
AN  - 2047355639
AB  - Grounded in construal‐level theory (CLT), this experiment examines how messages with different temporal frames (i.e., present‐ vs. future‐framed) influence individuals' perceptions of, and reactions to, water conservation. One hundred ninety‐three participants, 99 from China and 94 from the United States, participated in this study. Results indicated that a present‐framed message results in more positive attitudes toward water conservation than the future‐framed message. Participants who scored higher on individual future‐time orientation show stronger behavioral intention to conserve water than participants who scored lower. A significant interaction between temporal message framing and country emerged such that the future‐framed message resulted in greater behavioral intention for Chinese participants than their U.S. counterparts whereas the present‐framed message did not differentially influence Chinese and U.S. participants. Implications of findings for theory‐building and application are discussed.

T1  - “Life Isn't Some Cartoon Musical”: Neoliberal Identity Politics in <i>Zootopia</i> and <i>Orange Is the New Black</i>
AN  - 2023533129
AB  - Neoliberal identity politics in "Zootopia" and "Orange Is the New Black" are discussed. Two popular texts exemplify the contradictory logic of neoliberal popular media and the coexisting types of media‐industrial production: Disney's Zootopia (2016) and Netflix's Orange Is the New Black (2013–). Both strongly foreground “progressive” attitudes toward identity politics in their representational strategies of race and gender. On one hand, the reception of Zootopia (2016), a traditionally “mainstream” media text, has clearly been shaped by gestures of progressive representational politics which clearly added to their status among the most desirable audience groups. Orange Is the New Black, on the other hand, provides a striking example of popular “niche” media, which circulates as a cultural text within a much more limited audience, and which also appears to embrace a more radical politics.

T1  - The promise to the Arab World: Attributes of U.S. President Obama in Arabic-language tweets: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2000683740
AB  - U.S. President Barack Obama's much-anticipated address in Egypt in 2009 promised a new beginning between the U.S. government and the Arab world but only a few years later there were many criticisms that the U.S. President did not live up to his promises, driving Arab attitudes toward the United States to their lowest point in years. Five years later, we analyzed Arabic-language twitter messages involving President Obama to examine cognitive and affective attributes. Results show that tweets by members of the media differed greatly from tweets by members of the public. The public tweets held more negative attitudes towards the U.S. President than tweets by news organizations. Members of the public also were more likely to link the President to a wider range of countries, suggesting a greater diversity of attributes, while primarily fixating on the Palestinian issue.

T1  - OFF THE HOOK: EXPLORING REASONS FOR QUITTING PLAYING ONLINE GAMES IN CHINA
AN  - 2153630989
AB  - China is now one of the biggest online game markets, and the games are seen as both an economic opportunity and a social threat, especially to the young. I investigated the nature of, reasons for, and influences of online game quitting in China with 176 participants selected using deviant case sampling. I examined the relationships between the attitudes of those who were quitting playing toward online games, their perception of media portrayal of online games, family pressure, peer influence, functional alternatives, self-esteem, loneliness, online game quitting, and satisfaction with life after quitting. Results showed that the more negatively the participants felt about online games, the more likely they were to quit, and perception of peers' negative attitude toward online gaming, perception of alternatives, and lower income were significant predictors of online game quitting. These findings could help policy makers rethink healthy gaming and antiaddiction strategies.

T1  - Shallow Inclusion (or Integration) and Deep Exclusion: En-Dis-Abling Identities through Government Webpages in Hong Kong
AN  - 2089849458
AB  - This article is primarily concerned with how government webpages in Hong Kong claiming to embrace social inclusion and provide services and support for persons with disabilities construct issues relating to disability. These texts are not read in isolation. Instead, they are considered in conjunction with discourse produced in several United Nations documents, especially the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, to which Hong Kong is a signatory. These documents appear to both proffer and retract social inclusion in ways that complicate, if not undermine entirely, their purportedly inclusionary intentions. This article also reflects upon commentary produced by university students at a public university in Hong Kong responding to government discourse. Such focus upon ‘non-disabled’ readers reveals how texts do more than merely mediate pre-existing messages. Instead, they constitute a “social location and organizer for the accomplishment of meaning”, thereby counting as “a form of social action” (Titchkosky, 2007, p. 27). Through the texts they conspire to make about disability, authors and readers become complicit in the production, maintenance, and reinforcement of non-disabled (or abled)/disabled identities and dis/ableist ideology in ways that implicate the entire population in exclusionary processes.

T1  - Evaluations of Antigay Hate Crimes and Hate Crime Legislation: Independent and Differentially Predicted
AN  - 2002462527
AB  - Minimal studies have investigated individuals' evaluations of antigay hate crimes and hate crime legislation simultaneously, with most research focusing on one or the other. In a sample of 246 heterosexual undergraduates, the present study found that evaluations of antigay hate crimes and hate crime legislation were unrelated. Higher social dominance orientation (SDO) and crime control orientation scores were associated with more positive evaluations of antigay hate crimes. Positive evaluations of hate crime legislation were associated with more positive attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. We also found that the relationship between SDO and evaluations were mediated by crime control beliefs (for hate crimes evaluations) and antigay attitudes (for hate crime legislation evaluations). The present findings have possible implications for the manner in which organizations advocate for the extension of hate crime legislation to include sexual orientation.

T1  - Compassionate Canadians and conflictual Americans? Portrayals of ageism in liberal and conservative media
AN  - 1926876868
AB  - Building upon earlier studies on ageism in the media and the polarised ageism framework, this contribution compares the prevalence of three forms of ageism - intergenerational, compassionate and new ageism - in four Canadian and American newspapers. The analysis has three objectives. First, it adapts the polarised ageism framework to a comparative case study to assess its usefulness beyond Canada. Second, it analyses which form of ageism occurs more frequently in the coverage of ageing-related stories in Canadian or American newspapers. Third, it studies the importance of the political orientation of news media across both countries by comparing the portrayal of ageing-related stories in conservative and liberal newspapers. Core findings include the presence of a stronger focus on intergenerational ageism in American and conservative newspapers and more frequent prevalence of compassionate ageism in Canada and liberal newspapers. American newspapers also typically employ more pejorative and sensational language.

T1  - Acts of homonationalism: Mapping Africa in the Swedish media
AN  - 1925619350
AB  - Gay-friendliness and gender equality have been taken as signs of modern Western superiority over other cultural spheres and geographical spaces, particularly those of the Muslim world. In a similar manner, the promotion and defense of gay rights has become the crucible of othering discourses in relation to Africa. Across different cultural and national spaces, the meanings of citizenship, nationalism, modernity, colonialism and sovereignty are being negotiated in debates about anti-homosexuality on the continent. The focus of this article is the politics of mapping anti-homosexuality legislation in Africa in Swedish daily newspapers. Drawing on the work of Jasbir Puar and other feminist and queer scholars theorizing race and sexuality in relation to processes of nation-building, the authors analyze the mapping of the regulation of homosexuality in Africa as an instance of imaginative geographies. They investigate how journalistic rhetoric about homophobia on the African continent in Swedish daily newspapers relies on a politics of homonationalism and sexual exceptionalism in 'gay liberation' discourses.

T1  - Promotion Beyond Tenure: Unpacking Racism and Sexism in the Experiences of Black Womyn Professors
AN  - 1983450206
AB  - This study examined seven Black womyn full professors' experiences of promotion beyond tenure. Using a critical race feminist theoretical framework, findings suggest that a meritocratic ideology undergirds a dominant narrative about the Professor rank. However, racism and sexism mediated the participants' opportunities to access the status and benefits constructed in the full professor narrative. Implications for practice include an inclusive promotion review process that acknowledges the existence of racialized and gendered implicit biases, values experiential knowledge of Black womyn, identifies motivating factors for advancement, and challenges merit as a neutral idea in the promotion process to Professor.

T1  - "Whosoever Looketh on a Person to Lust After Them": Religiosity, the Use of Mainstream and Nonmainstream Sexually Explicit Material, and Sexual Satisfaction in Heterosexual Men and Women
AN  - 1911188057
AB  - While previous research has generally found that religiosity is associated with negative attitudes toward sexually explicit material (SEM) and a lower frequency of SEM use, no studies have examined the relationship between SEM type and religiosity. In addition, it is unknown how the interrelations between religiosity and type and frequency of SEM use influence the relationship between SEM use and sexual satisfaction. Here, associations among a multi-item religiosity scale (consisting of measures of self-reported faith in God, religious services attendance, and the religiosity of the respondent's social network), SEM use, type of preferred SEM, and sexual satisfaction were explored using a large online sample of Croatian adults (N = 2,580). In both men and women, religiosity was associated with less frequent SEM use and more SEM-negative attitudes. Guilty feelings following SEM use and SEM-negative attitudes fully mediated the association between religiosity and SEM use among women and partially mediated the relationship for men. Religiosity was also negatively correlated with women's nonmainstream SEM use. For women, religiosity significantly moderated the association between SEM use and sexual satisfaction, as well as the relationship between nonmainstream SEM use and sexual satisfaction. In line with the erotic plasticity theory, the findings suggest that religiosity affects SEM use and related sexual satisfaction more substantially among women than men.

T1  - The Impact of Police Deployment on Racial Disparities in Discretionary Searches
AN  - 1907053307
AB  - A large and growing body of research finds racial disparities in discretionary searches of drivers during traffic stops with Black drivers disproportionately involved in these investigations. Among the explanations for these disparities is the deployment hypothesis which suggests that as police departments increasingly adopt hot spots policing strategies, proactive traffic stops and discretionary searches may spatially cluster around crime hot spots contributing to racial disparities. The present study builds on the existing research literature by identifying hot spots using reported crime data from a police department and examining whether these crime hot spots function as a mediating factor to the relationship between driver race and discretionary searches. Findings provide partial support for the deployment hypothesis. While nearly half of all traffic stops transpired within one quarter mile of hot spots and more frequently involved Black drivers, stops involving Black drivers remained more likely to include discretionary searches and increased concomitantly with distance from the nearest hot spot.

T1  - Bridging the Partisan Divide? Exploring Ambivalence and Information Seeking Over Time in the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election
AN  - 1891393124
AB  - Research has shown that holding conflicted attitudes (ambivalence) about political decisions may lead people to act as ideal citizens. One example of this normatively ideal behavior is seen in research linking ambivalence to information seeking. To expand on this line of inquiry, this study examines the over-time relationship between ambivalence and information seeking. We use three-wave panel data collected during the 2012 election to determine whether over-time relationships exist between these variables and test the causal direction of these relationships. We find that use of counterattitudinal information increases ambivalence, which leads people to seek out more counterattitudinal information. We also find that use of pro-attitudinal media decreases levels of ambivalence.

T1  - Religious Identity and Borderless Territoriality in the Coptic e-Diaspora
AN  - 1865258027
AB  - In recent decades, Coptic Egyptian immigrants have steadily adopted new homelands throughout the world, most significantly in Europe, North America, and Australia. Their efforts perpetuate their religious and cultural identity and connect diaspora communities and experiences to the mother church as well as to the realities of marginalization and persecution of their co-religionists in Egypt. However, relatively little research has been carried out on the virtual or digital presences of diaspora Copts, all the more significant in the wake of the so-called Arab Spring. Focusing on religious identity, this article fills a lacuna by analyzing three case studies of electronic identity mediation and preservation in the Coptic diaspora: (1) the online ecclesiastical-pastoral and educational presence of Bishop Suriel of Melbourne, (2) the spiritual-social-cultural mission of the Los Angeles-based Coptic television station LogosTV, and (3) the global collaborative academic project of the digital Claremont Coptic Encyclopedia. These are part of an emerging electronic Coptic diaspora (e-diaspora)--a form of borderless territoriality--that functions to compensate for the loss of territorial and socio-religious-cultural-political control in Egypt and provide Copts with virtual territorial gains and borderless space for community and consciousness raising.

T1  - A Reflexive Inquiry on the Effect of Place on Research Interviews Conducted With Homeless and Vulnerably Housed Individuals
TT  - Eine reflexive Analyse der Bedeutung der Ortswahl in Interviews mit wohnungslosen oder vulnerabel untergebrachten Menschen
AN  - 2539301999
AB  - In diesem Beitrag befasse ich mich mit dem Effekt, der spezifischen Orten bei der Durchführung von Interviews mit wohnungslosen oder vulnerabel untergebrachten Menschen zukommt. Bisher haben Interviewörtlichkeiten in der gemeindespsychologischen Literatur vergleichsweise wenig Aufmerksamkeit erfahren. Dementgegen reflektiere ich, welche Herausforderungen und Potenziale mit Ortswahlen für Interviews mit diesen Personengruppen einhergehen und welche Machtstrukturen eine Rolle spielen. Ich verwende Einträge aus meinem Forschungstagebuch, um zu analysieren, welche Konsequenzen die Entscheidung für spezifische Orte für die Untersuchungsteilnehmer/innen und für mich als Forscher hatte. Es wird deutlich, dass Orte sehr machtgeladen sein oder Gelegenheiten für eine holistische Herangehensweise an ein Forschungsthema bieten können.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs170151Alternate abstract:In this study, I utilized a process of reflexivity to examine the effect of location when conducting interviews with homeless and vulnerably housed individuals. The impact of interview locations has received limited attention in the community psychology literature, despite the majority of research being community-based. The study provides insights into the challenges, benefits, and power relations involved in selecting a research interview site and in conducting interviews. Personal journal entries were used to analyze the effect of location on the participants and I as the researcher, through a comparative analysis of interviews conducted in the community and a research center. Results demonstrate that interview locations hold great amounts of power and can provide the opportunity for holistic understandings of research topics. Lessons learned and methodological implications are discussed.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs170151

T1  - Role of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness in the relationship between violent daydreaming and suicidal ideation in two adult samples
TT  - Role of TB and PB
AN  - 2533894149
AB  - PurposeDespite evidence that violent daydreaming is a correlate of suicidal ideation, no research has examined the mechanisms underlying this association. The interpersonal theory of suicide may provide insight. This theory postulates that individuals with high suicidal desire experience intractable feelings of perceived burdensomeness (PB) and thwarted belongingness (TB). Violent daydreaming may fuel negative attitudes toward others and oneself and turn attention away from loved ones, thereby increasing feelings that one is a burden on others (PB) and socially disconnected (TB). However, no studies have tested TB and PB as explanatory mechanisms. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships between violent daydreaming, PB, TB, suicidal ideation, and depression in two samples (n=818).Design/methodology/approachStudy 1 was comprised of general undergraduates, and Study 2 selected for undergraduates with a history of ideation. Self-report measures were administered and indirect effects analyses were conducted.FindingsIn both studies, violent daydreaming was associated with increased feelings of PB, TB, and ideation severity. Consistent with the interpersonal theory, TB and PB were significant parallel mediators of the relationship between violent daydreaming and suicidal ideation, beyond sex and age. In contrast to Study 1, results were no longer significant in Study 2 after accounting for depression.Originality/valueThis was the first study to test TB and PB as mechanisms underlying the relationship between violent daydreaming and suicide risk. Findings highlight the importance of monitoring and addressing violent daydreams and interpersonal functioning throughout treatment to mitigate risk.

T1  - The Relationship of Acculturation Strategies to Resilience: The Moderating Impact of Social Support among Qiang Ethnicity following the 2008 Chinese Earthquake
AN  - 1829040771
AB  - International research has mostly confirmed the positive association between acculturation strategies and resilience in ethnic groups, but the mediating and moderating mechanisms underlying the relationships are still under-investigated. The present study aimed to investigate the associations between acculturation strategies (based on two cultural identities) and resilience of 898 Qiang ethnicity volunteers (mean age = 29.5), especially exploring the mediating and moderating effects of personality, spiritual belief and social support on the relationship between acculturation strategy (using two cultural identities as latent variables in model analysis) and resilience following the occurrence of 2008 Wenchuan earthquake in Sichuan, taking such mechanisms into account. Results were as follows: (1) All variable presented significant positive correlations; (2) Consistent with the mediating hypotheses, personality and spiritual beliefs played a partial mediating role in the relationship between two cultural identities and resilience; (3) High or low level of perceived social support had a moderating effect on cultural identities and resilience; (4) The integration strategy was the most optimal style to promote the development of resilience, but marginalization was the least effective style.

T1  - 'Breathing the smells of native-styled English': a narrativized account of an L2 sojourn
AN  - 1798791122
AB  - This article centers on the developmental trajectory of a young woman who took part in a study that tracked the language and intercultural development of international exchange students from a Hong Kong university. 'Serena', a translation (Chinese-English) major, took steps toward a more intercultural mindset while studying in England. Compared with many of the other participants, she displayed a more positive attitude toward the host language and culture, developed a more diverse social network, and gained more access to local communities of practice. Over time, she became more open-minded and invested in her intercultural relationships which she mediated through English. Weaving together the rich oral and written data related to her case, this paper presents a narrative of her 'international story'. Her lived experiences and the subjective meanings invoked raise awareness of individual characteristics, attributes, and agency that can facilitate second language learning and intercultural development. By drawing comparisons with the stories of her peers, this narrativized account also points to the impact of external elements on sojourn outcomes.Alternate abstract:本文聚焦于一名參加國際交換項目的年輕女性的個人發展軌跡, 該女性參加了香港某大學對於國際交換學生的語言及跨文化發展的追蹤研究。塞麗娜, 中英翻譯專業學生, 在英國學習期間逐漸拓展了其跨文化思維方式。與其他個案相比較, 塞麗娜對主體語言及文化展現了更積極的態度, 建立了更多樣化的社交網絡, 尋求了更多的機會接觸當地社交文化。隨著時間的推移, 她的思想更加開放, 并用英語建立了跨文化友誼。綜合收集到有關塞麗娜案例的口筆頭數據, 本文呈現了對塞麗娜的“國際故事”的敘述。她的國外生活經驗的及其背後的個人意義提升了對於促能夠進第二語言學習及跨文化發展的個體特征、特質、及誘因的認識。透過與她同齡人的故事相比較, 本篇敘述也表明了外界因素對於海外逗留成果的影響。關鍵詞, 學術流動, 國際交換項目, 跨文化過度, 第二語言學習, 個人身份, 案例研究, 叙述研究

T1  - From political opponents to enemies? The role of perceived moral distance in the animalistic dehumanization of the political outgroup: GPIR
AN  - 1786223700
AB  - In this paper, we analyzed the relationships among political identity, the perception of moral distance between the political ingroup and the political outgroup, and outgroup animalistic dehumanization. One correlational and one experimental study revealed a positive correlation of ingroup identification (Study 1, N = 99) and salience of ingroup membership (Study 2, N = 96) with the degree to which participants dehumanized the outgroup. This relationship was mediated by the perceived moral distance between the ingroup and the outgroup. The limitations, implications, and possible developments derived from the present findings are discussed. [web URL: http://gpi.sagepub.com/content/19/3/360.abstract]

T1  - Attachment Status Affects Heart Rate Responses to Experimental Ostracism in Inpatients with Depression
AN  - 1770505004
AB  - Depression is assumed to be both a risk factor for rejection and a result of it, and as such constitutes an important factor in rejection research. Attachment theory has been applied to understand psychological disorders, such as depression, and can explain individual differences in responses to rejection. Research on autonomic nervous system activity to rejection experiences has been contradictory, with opposing strings of argumentation (activating vs. numbing). We investigated autonomic nervous system-mediated peripheral physiological responses (heart rate) to experimentally manipulated ostracism (Cyberball) in 97 depressed patients with organized (n = 52) and disorganized attachment status (n = 45). Controlling for baseline mean heart rate levels, depressed patients with disorganized attachment status responded to ostracism with significantly higher increases in heart rate than depressed patients with organized attachment status (p = .029; ηp2 = .051). These results suggest that attachment status may be a useful indicator of autonomic responses to perceived social threat, which in turn may affect the therapeutic process and the patient-therapist relationship.

T1  - Presentation of China in online West European media: More fairness and accuracy required: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2039037807
AB  - This article focuses on the presentation of China in online West European media and examines reporting on China in British, Dutch and Belgian online newspapers and weblogs. Through concrete case studies he uncovers the reasons for the predominantly negative coverage of China-related topics in the above-mentioned sources, in particular, to explain the inaccuracy, bias and partisanship. It further studies the complex relationship between journalism and activism and presents a number of analyses that shed light upon the process of construction of an unfavourable opinion about China that the attitudes of the media industry have contributed to. By showing the weaknesses in the coverage of China of the West European media such as distortion of the information or self-censorship, the article criticizes the absence of objectivity in reporting, and proposes a number of measures that both European and Chinese journalists could take so as to overcome the imbalance and prejudice in reporting and move towards more fairness and accuracy.

T1  - 'Now I'm Part of Australia and I Need to Know What Is Happening Here': Case of Hazara Male Former Refugees in Brisbane Strategically Selecting Media to Aid Acculturation
AN  - 1724872529
AB  - Given the steady rise in the number of Hazara seeking asylum in Australia, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of media in their acculturation and to explore whether their level of English language proficiency played a mediating role in selecting certain media platforms over others. Data were collected through 29 participants completing a survey, followed by in-depth interviews with ten Hazara male youths (age [less than or equal to] 18 years) in Brisbane, Australia. The findings suggested that young Hazara men were very selective in their media choice. While some used media to improve their integration into Australia, others consciously chose to separate and be more "Afghan" than "Australian". In this selection process, their self-awareness with regard to English language proficiency, coupled with how motivated they were to learn English, played a critical mediating role; certain participants who had limited English proficiency and wanted to improve it watched English language media to improve their proficiency. These media were avoided by participants with a similar proficiency who had no interest in improving it; participants representing this group resorted to Hazaragi/Dari media for information and news, instead of the local media. In this study, the latter group also displayed a separation approach of acculturation.

T1  - The Role of Secularism of State on the Relationship Between Catholic Identity, Political Orientation, and Gay Rights Issues
AN  - 1703589628
AB  - In discussions of regulations governing same-sex marriage and adoption by gays and lesbians, the issue of state secularism is often called into question. This study aims to test the mediating effects of state secularism on the relationship between Catholic identity, political orientation, and gay civil rights. Participants were Catholic Italians who completed a questionnaire measuring the constructs under investigation. Results showed that state secularism mediates the effects of Catholic identity and political orientation on attitudes toward same-sex marriage and adoption by gays and lesbians.

T1  - Embodied prejudices: a study on diversity and practices
AN  - 2084926027
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to analyze organizational diversity with a focus on the concept of socially sustained practices, grounding the analyses in a practice-based approach. Design/methodology/approach – Based on data from ethnographic research, the author seeks to explain how the body and embodied marks that indicate an unequal distribution of power in society interfere with access to knowledge and in the organization of work. Findings – Data analyses suggest that embodied prejudices affect the division of labor and access to knowledge in organizational settings, contributing to perpetuating cultural and historical structures of domination that spark conscious attempts to manage race and gender diversity. Originality/value – Little research has investigated diversity from a practice-based standpoint. The originality of this paper is in its adoption of a phenomenological perspective to explain the experience of diversity as an ongoing bodily and embodied process.

T1  - Public Knowledge of, and Attitudes to, Frogs in Colombia
AN  - 1752994992; 201601587
AB  - People's response to the decline of biodiversity and their support for conservation measures depends on their knowledge of biodiversity and their attitudes to local species. This study is one of the first to investigate public knowledge of, and attitudes to, frogs in South America. We chose two study regions, the semi-urban region of Pensilvania and the rural region of Florencia. In spring 2011, 565 individuals completed a written questionnaire and a subsequent picture test. Overall, the public's attitudes to, and knowledge of frogs, were rather poor. Direct experiences and community elders were the major source of knowledge of frogs for participants in Florencia, whereas electronic media was the main source of knowledge in Pensilvania. Most participants felt that frogs are of high conservation value and important for medical and ecological purposes. The more strongly participants agreed that frogs are useful, of medicinal value, and beautiful, the more strongly they agreed that they should be conserved. Our results indicate that conservation education activities in schools and elsewhere are needed to improve people's knowledge of, and attitudes to, frogs. More positive attitudes toward local amphibian species might lead to an appreciation of their value and willingness to conserve them. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Media-Induced Elevation as a Means of Enhancing Feelings of Intergroup Connectedness
AN  - 1708525390; 201528944
AB  - The majority of research on media counter-stereotyping of race/ethnicity has tended to employ positive portrayals or counter-stereotypical exemplars as a primary strategy in eliciting positive attitudes among White participants. In contrast, this article reports the results of an experiment on the unique role of affective responses to media messages as a mechanism in inducing greater feelings of connectedness with a diversity of racial/ethnic groups. Our focus is on the affective response of elevation specifically, which refers to feelings of being moved, touched, and inspired by images of people engaged in morally beautiful acts such as love, generosity, and kindness. Results show that the experience of elevation in response to inspiring videos was associated with heightened feelings of overlap between the self and humanity, with this overlap associated with greater feelings of connectedness with those from a diversity of racial/ethnic groups. This connection was also associated with more favorable attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Brand interactivity and its effects on the outcomes of advergame play
AN  - 1718065796; 201532419
AB  - This study develops the concept of brand interactivity based on the characteristics and definitions of interactivity and applies it to advergames. Brand interactivity is significant in advertising research and practice because this concept extends the perspective of interactivity from media to brands. The results of an experiment indicate that consumers have more positive attitudes toward a brand and stronger purchase intentions when playing advergames with brand interactivity rather than without brand interactivity. As this study shows, the role of brand interactivity in advergames provides insights for advertising scholars and practitioners seeking ways to improve consumers' experience with brands through interactive media.

T1  - Organized crime and group-based ideology: The association between masculine honor and collective opposition against criminal organizations
AN  - 1700674062; 201524908
AB  - What is the role of culture in establishing young people's pathways into gang membership? Italian criminal organizations (COs) exhibit adherence to codes of honor and masculinity, important values in the context where they originated. Here it is proposed that the embedding of these values at an individual level may lessen young people's group-based opposition to such organizations, and indirectly, create a space in which such organizations can persist and recruit. In a study of young Southern Italians (N = 176; Mage = 16.17), we found that those who endorsed ideological beliefs related to the honorableness of male violence reported lower intentions to engage in antimafia activities. Consistent with the hypothesized mechanisms, this relationship was mediated by more positive attitudes toward COs, and lower reported vicarious shame in relation to the activities of COs. Directions for future research and implications for research on gangs are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Unpacking Solidarities of the Oppressed: Notes on Trans Struggles in India
AN  - 1616153010
AB  - Solidarity is a fundamental concern of feminist theory and politics. The trope of global sisterhood is especially powerful today; its affective power allows for its reinvention in different idioms at different times. Most recently, neoliberal discursive regimes in Euro-America have revived both global sisterhood and a politics of salvation/caring, deftly folding them into corporate marketing strategies. In this short essay, the author mainly interested in the discourses of solidarity and sisterhood opened up by the collapse of Rana Plaza in Savar, Bangladesh, in 2013, in which over eleven hundred garment factory workers were killed. Not surprisingly, First World solidarity with Third World workers figured centrally in the coverage following the disaster. As horrifying images of the tragedy and its aftermath circulated across global media, the incident was rendered a spectacle for consumption. Like other such events, it was open to the most incendiary mobilizations.

T1  - Neural Correlates of Gender Differences in Reputation Building
AN  - 1559041548
AB  - Gender differences in cooperative choices and their neural correlates were investigated in a situation where reputation represented a crucial issue. Males and females were involved in an economic exchange (trust game) where economic and reputational payoffs had to be balanced in order to increase personal welfare. At the behavioral level, females showed a stronger reaction to negative reputation judgments that led to higher cooperation than males, measured by back transfers in the game. The neuroanatomical counterpart of this gender difference was found within the reward network (engaged in producing expectations of positive results) and reputation-related brain networks, such as the self-control network (engaged in strategically resisting the temptation to defect) and the mentalizing network (engaged in thinking about how one is viewed by others), in which the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the medial (M)PFC respectively play a crucial role. Furthermore, both DLPFC and MPFC activity correlated with the amount of back transfer, as well as with the personality dimensions assessed with the Big-Five Questionnaire (BFQ-2). Males, according to their greater DLPFC recruitment and their higher level of the BFQ-2 subscale of Dominance, were more focused on implementing a profit-maximizing strategy, pursuing this target irrespectively of others' judgments. On the contrary, females, according to their greater MPFC activity and their lower level of Dominance, were more focused on the reputation per se and not on the strategic component of reputation building. These findings shed light on the sexual dimorphism related to cooperative behavior and its neural correlates.

T1  - Traits and Roles in Gender Stereotypes: A Comparison between Moroccan and Spanish Native Samples
AN  - 1680152612; 201517779
AB  - This study examines gender role attitudes and attitudes toward 'man' and 'woman' in two native samples from Spain and Morocco. The samples were made up of 400 participants, 200 in each country, containing the same number of men and women and selected with a similar procedure. We expected differences based on the independent variables of nationality, gender and educational level. The Spanish sample, female and student participants were predicted to present more egalitarian gender role attitudes and more positive attitudes toward 'woman' than participants in the Moroccan sample, male and non-student participants. Overall MANOVAs were used to show the differences in gender role attitudes and attitudes toward 'man' and 'woman'. Results confirmed the role of the nationality variable in the expected way. The Spanish sample showed a more egalitarian view and more favorable attitudes toward 'woman' than the Moroccan one. Educational level and gender showed significant effects on the Moroccan sample but only partially. Moroccan student females and non-student males presented a more egalitarian view than non-student females and student males respectively. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Late Abrahamic reunion? Religious fundamentalism negatively predicts dual Abrahamic group categorization among Muslims and Christians
AN  - 1559006334; 201431835
AB  - Although extensive research has documented the effectiveness of common or dual in-groups on improving intergroup relations, little is known about how individual-difference variables affect people's willingness to make such re-categorizations in the first place. Here, we demonstrate that individual differences in religious fundamentalism predict willingness to categorize in terms of the common Abrahamic religious origins of Christianity and Islam among Christians and Muslims. Study 1 (n = 243 Christians, 291 Muslims) uses multigroup structural equation modeling and Study 2 (n = 80 Christians) an experimental manipulation to show that religious fundamentalism causes lower dual Abrahamic categorization, which, in turn, predicts more positive attitudes toward the respective out-group, mediating the negative effects of religious fundamentalism on religious intergroup bias. While making the general case that individual differences may play important roles for dual categorizations, these results also highlight the specific positive potential of dual ecumenical categorizations for improving interreligious relations. Research and societal implications are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Pornography Consumption and US Adults' Attitudes toward Gay Individuals' Civil Liberties, Moral Judgments of Homosexuality, and Support for Same-Sex Marriage: Mediating and Moderating Factors
AN  - 1531931840; 201423404
AB  - This study compared views on homosexuality among US adults who varied in their consumption of pornography. Nationally representative cross-sectional data generated by the General Social Survey (GSS) between 2000 and 2012 were employed. Pornography consumers expressed more positive attitudes toward gay individuals' civil liberties, more moral acceptance of homosexuality, and more support for same-sex marriage. Moderation analyses indicated the importance of consumers' views on personal freedom and morality. Associations between pornography consumption and positive views on homosexuality were strongest when consumers placed a premium on personal freedom and adopted a relativistic perspective on morality. Mediation analyses indicated that pornography consumption indirectly predicted more positive views on homosexuality through a nontraditional attitude toward sex. Supplementary analysis of nationally representative three-wave GSS panel data confirmed the temporal sequencing of these links. Prior pornography consumption predicted a more positive subsequent attitude toward nontraditional sex, which in turn predicted more positive subsequent views on homosexuality.

T1  - VHA Primary Care Providers' Perspectives on Screening Female Veterans for Intimate Partner Violence: A Preliminary Assessment
AN  - 1504423702; 201407818
AB  - Female Veterans experience intimate partner violence (IPV) at alarming rates. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) requires foundational research to guide the development of policy and programs to detect IPV among women Veterans and provide interventions. This pilot study reports findings from in-depth qualitative interviews conducted with 12 VHA primary care providers treating female Veterans in the New England region. Although most providers indicated that they were not currently routinely screening for IPV, they expressed positive attitudes and beliefs about screening in VHA primary care settings. Themes also included the importance of a comprehensive health care response to IPV, such as interdisciplinary coordination of care and team-based approaches to detection and intervention. Barriers to routine screening were identified, as well as recommendations for training programs and clinical tools to inform the successful implementation of a standardized IPV screening and response program in VHA. Although preliminary, these findings represent an initial step in an essential line of research. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Role of Social Support in Students' Perceived Abilities and Attitudes Toward Math and Science
AN  - 1429628029; 201338062
AB  - Social cognitive models examining academic and career outcomes emphasize constructs such as attitude, interest, and self-efficacy as key factors affecting students' pursuit of STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) courses and careers. The current research examines another under-researched component of social cognitive models: social support, and the relationship between this component and attitude and self-efficacy in math and science. A large cross-sectional design was used gathering data from 1,552 participants in four adolescent school settings from 5th grade to early college (41 % female, 80 % white). Students completed measures of perceived social support from parents, teachers and friends as well as their perceived ability and attitudes toward math and science. Fifth grade and college students reported higher levels of support from teachers and friends when compared to students at other grade levels. In addition, students who perceived greater social support for math and science from parents, teachers, and friends reported better attitudes and had higher perceptions of their abilities in math and science. Lastly, structural equation modeling revealed that social support had both a direct effect on math and science perceived abilities and an indirect effect mediated through math and science attitudes. Findings suggest that students who perceive greater social support for math and science from parents, teachers, and friends have more positive attitudes toward math and science and a higher sense of their own competence in these subjects.

T1  - Pronouns and intersubjectivity in Lebanese Arabic gossip
AN  - 1429623713; 201337302
AB  - Lebanese Arabic allows the use of optional 1st and 2nd person dative pronouns. These are pronouns embedded in sentences without being linked to any participant roles. Their task is to express a positive or negative attitude toward the events depicted in utterances. In this paper, I present examples of such pronouns as used in gossip constructions. I show that these pronouns allow the speaker to communicate changes of footing or participation roles as animator, author, and/or principal during a speech event. I also analyze them within Cognitive Grammar, suggesting that they allow the speaker to move the speech participants from the offstage region where they function as conceptualizers to the onstage region where they are conceptualized as attitude holders. By so doing, the speaker explicitly anchors the event of gossip construction to the attitudes of the speech participants. In this sense, the pronouns become cultural tools of social influence.

T1  - Facing Up to Aging: Mid-Life Women's Attitudes toward Cosmetic Procedures
AN  - 1567049158; 201437033
AB  - Despite the fact that mid-life and older women are a major consumer group for cosmetic procedures (e.g., botox, face lifts), few studies have been done on their attitudes toward these procedures and their willingness to undergo them. The purpose of the present study was to gather information about the popularity of these procedures among a group of 57 mid-life American women, examine whether some personality and attitudinal measures might predict attitudes toward these procedures, and consider the ramifications of the data for the treatment of women in feminist therapy. About one third (38.5%) of our sample had had one or more cosmetic procedures, and 81% said that they would have a procedure if cost were not an issue. Positive attitudes toward cosmetic surgery and preoccupation with being over-weight best predicted women's interest in cosmetic procedures. The popularity of these procedures is discussed in light of the double standard of aging and age discrimination, weight as a 'normative discontent,' and the ubiquity of advertisements for, and normalization of, these procedures in the popular media.

T1  - Wife Abuse in Tamil Nadu
AN  - 1283640746; 201306390
AB  - Wife abuse is a major public health and human rights problem. Using an ecological framework, data from National Family Health Survey (NFHS 2005-2006) of 3446 women were analyzed to determine the factors associated with wife abuse in urban and rural Tamil Nadu, India. The prevalence rate of wife abuse in the year prior to the interview was 25.8% and was similar across urban and rural areas. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that in urban and rural Tamil Nadu, the micro level variables explained the highest percentage of variance in wife abuse followed by the ontogenetic, the exo system, and the macro system variables. Some of the variables that were significantly associated with wife abuse in Tamil Nadu were witnessing parental violence, drinking habit in husbands, emotional abuse, patriarchal ideology, and positive attitudes towards abuse. Implications of the results are discussed within the socio-cultural milieu of the respondents. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Masbirim Israel: Israel's PR Campaign as Glocalized and Grobalized Political Prosumption
AN  - 1221412983; 201244631
AB  - In 2010, Israel's Ministry of Information and Diaspora Affairs launched a new campaign: Masbirim Israel. Its purpose was to "recruit" Israeli citizens to the task of improving the nation's public image in the world. It was the first time a well-organized campaign was launched, systematically employing new-media tools and calling on Israeli citizens to independently take part in improving their country's international image-all at the behest of a government ministry. The executive authority in effect delivered some of its responsibilities and obligations to private hands. This article discusses prosumption in the political sphere and expands the idea of prosumption to a domain in which the state itself is the producer and its citizens are the consumers. Prosumption is perceived as acts conducted by citizens who operate to fulfill aims (i.e., produce products) that traditionally have been in the purview of the state. The article presents two arguments: First, the campaign is an expression of the idea of prosumption in the political sphere. By integrating Israel's citizens in the process of public relations (PR), they become prosumers in the sense that they participate in the production of a public good that traditionally has been supplied by the state. Second, the Masbirim Israel campaign is an expression of a glocalized and grobalized condition in Israeli reality, as it reflects trends of neoliberal values and practices of privatization and expresses the political opinions of (extreme) nationalism and particularism to nonformally "recruit" its citizens to the national PR effort.

T1  - Racism: Continuity and metamorphosis
TT  - Il razzismo: Continuità e metamorfosi
AN  - 2434553817
AB  - Racism is primarily a system of social relationships, characterized by inequality and power differences between social groups involved, and supported by a symbolic apparatus that is a constitutive part of it. This system tends to recycle some "classic" racist repertoires, especially the topoi of anti-semitism. The symbolic apparatus acts directly on the social, producing and reproducing discrimination, inequality, domination. To build or strengthen this system, the role of the media is crucial. Through them the “welding” between institutional racism and various forms of popular xenophobia or racism is realized.

T1  - NEW FRONTIERS OF ASIAN AND LATINO AMERICA IN POPULAR CULTURE: Mixed-Race Intimacies and the Global Police State in Miami Vice and Rush Hour 2
AN  - 905246885
AB  - There are few instances of intimate encounters between Latinos and Asians in Hollywood film and media.1 While there may be independent or art house productions that venture into this territory- for example, Ethan Mao (2004) and Walkout (2006)-there are scant few major Asian-Latino storylines in popular culture, much less blockbuster hits.  Rush Hour 2 partakes in the Hong Kong martial arts media aesthetic- with Jackie Chan as Inspector Lee and Puerto Rican actress Roselyn Sanchez as Secret Service agent Isabella Molina-in a transnational plot that links the United States' economy to China, while Miami Vice locates the Chinese-Cuban crime boss Isabella-played by mainland Chinese actress Gong Li-in an international smuggling ring.

T1  - Experiences of Young Bisexual Women in Lesbian/Bisexual Groups on MySpace
AN  - 859361405
AB  - This exploratory study examined Topic threads in Lesbian/Bisexual Groups on MySpace to examine how young biwomen self-identify in online exchanges with other bisexuals and lesbians, as well as what attitudes and beliefs about bisexuality emerge from those exchanges. Four Topic threads from three Groups suggested that young biwomen use social networking sites to connect with others and create inclusive communities for biyouth. Although acceptance of bisexuality was strongly endorsed by many, they were sometimes met with antagonism from their lesbian peers. Together with lesbian allies, they were able to challenge such prejudice but remain keenly aware of its existence. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]
