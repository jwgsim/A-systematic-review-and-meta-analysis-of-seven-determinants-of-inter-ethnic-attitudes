T1  - Knowledge and perceptions of the genetic counseling profession among a national cross‐sectional sample of U.S. adults
AN  - 2625584563
AB  - Awareness of the genetic counseling (GC) profession may influence access to genetic services, yet awareness among the U.S. population is unknown. A survey of U.S. adults was conducted using age‐ and sex‐based quotas. Participants were asked if they had heard of the GC profession and to describe what genetic counselors (GCs) do. After reading a brief description of what GCs do, participants were asked the likelihood they would request to see a genetic counselor if they were concerned about a genetic condition. We used descriptive statistics to characterize the population, logistic regression to determine factors related to awareness of the GC profession, and ordinary least squares regression to identify which factors correlated with likelihood of seeking GC services. Thematic analysis was used to code open‐ended responses. Among the final sample of 543, the majority were White individuals (79.7%) with an average age of 46.5 and median income between $60,000 and $69,999. Although 20% indicated they had heard of the GC profession, further analysis of the qualitative follow‐up question suggested only 13.4% understood the role of GCs (CI 10.6%–16.3%). Factors positively and significantly correlated with knowledge of the GC profession included identifying as White or female and having higher educational attainment or higher science knowledge after controlling for income, age, and political views. Approximately 45% of respondents indicated they would likely or very likely seek GC if concerned about a genetic condition. Biological sex, age, religious affiliation, science knowledge, and awareness of the GC profession were significantly correlated with likelihood of seeking GC services while controlling for race, income, educational attainment, and political views. Curiosity/interest, the perception of benefits, and trust in GCs were all major themes that emerged to explain reasons for seeking an appointment with GCs. Lack of awareness, lack of perceived benefit, and lack of trust in GCs or greater trust in other healthcare providers were reasons for not wanting a GC appointment. Despite the 50‐year existence of the GC profession, awareness remains low and negative attitudes exist.

T1  - #ThisIsMeChallenge and Music for Empowerment of Marginalized Groups on TikTok
AN  - 2638752109
AB  - Media convergence is generating many collective performances on social media, where the rise of short-form videos has created a new opportunity for the empowerment of society on online platforms. In this context, TikTok appears as an application for creative expression through music clips and lip-syncs. Through the #ThisIsMeChallenge hashtag, which introduces the musical theme of The Greatest Showman film, we analyze a new online practice within messages from traditionally marginalized groups throughout individual and collective life events. In order to understand TikTok as a music venue for social empowerment, we conducted a quantitative content analysis of 100 TikTok posts under the hashtag, and an artificial intelligence sentiment analysis across 8,877 comments. The results show a wide range of performance work that addresses issues of gender, sexual orientation, racial discrimination, and other types of current hate speech. In short, we conclude that TikTok has become a platform that seems to motivate activism and empowerment of marginalized groups through music frameworks that challenge social discrimination.

T1  - Varieties of Populist Attitudes and Their Link to Islamophobia in Switzerland
AN  - 2617958026
AB  - The aim of this article is to show whether distinct varieties of populist attitudes emerge within a society, and how they relate to citizens’ Islamophobic attitudes. The study is based on a representative survey conducted in Switzerland in 2019. We used latent class analysis and multinomial regression analyses to identify latent subgroups, yielding five classes of populist attitudes: direct democracy devotees, individuals with populist tendencies, moderate populists, radical anti-elite populists, and radical-universal populists. Compared with the direct democracy devotees class, members of the moderate and the radical-universal populists classes are significantly more likely to hold anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant attitudes and to be politically right-wing, while radical anti-elite populists are not associated with either anti-Muslim attitudes or a right-wing ideology.

T1  - nic Identity and Acculturation Orientation of Chinese Yi Villagers in the Context of Social Media
AN  - 2620027950
AB  - In the information age, the widespread application of social media will impact the ethnic identity and acculturation of ethnic minority individuals. In this study, 522 Yi people from different Yi branches were selected to investigate the relationship between their ethnic identity and acculturation orientation and the role of social media and social support. The results showed that :(1) the acculturation patterns of Yi villagers were mainly integrated, and experienced from separation to integration, then assimilation and marginalization after mixed; (2) The individual differences of acculturation orientation were significant, but the individual differences of ethnic identity were not; (3) Ethnic identity had a positive impact on original acculturation attitude but had no significant effect on mainstream acculturation attitude; (4) Social media had a negative predictive effect on the original acculturation attitude, a positive predictive effect on the mainstream acculturation attitude, and a negative moderating effect on the relationship between ethnic identity and original acculturation attitude; (5) Social support has a positive predictive effect on both acculturation attitudes. Therefore, the government and relevant departments should strengthen social media's popularization in pure Yi areas, enhance social support in mixed areas, and improve education and economic development to improve the acculturation of the Yi villagers effectively.

T1  - Introduction to the Special Issue: Disproportionate trauma, stress, and adversities as a pathway to health disparities among disenfranchised groups globally
AN  - 2583565352
AB  - Globally, individuals and communities that are marginalized based on their identities are at heightened risk for exposure to traumatic stress and socioeconomic hardship. Marginalization and disproportionate risk for many types of adversities correspond with disparities in physical health, mental health, and overall well‐being. Together, the 12 empirical studies, one systematic review, and commentary in this special issue of the Journal of Traumatic Stress highlight the impact of discrimination and disproportionate adversity among groups marginalized based on race, ethnicity, nativity, caste, gender identity, sexual orientation, economic status, and medical status. Although most studies in this issue focus on the United States, the articles that focus on disparities and risk factors in India, El Salvador, Uganda, and Burundi provides a multicontinent global perspective. The global perspective, including the impact of the global pandemic, invites further examination of how disproportionate exposure to traumatic stress and adversity are associated with inequitable burden and health disparities worldwide. This special issue further highlights the developmental and multigenerational burden of systemic marginalization by including studies of children, young adults, adults, and parent–child dyads. Pathways for change and intervention are illustrated through a liberatory consciousness perspective, with one study utilizing liberatory media skills (e.g., positive media images and messages) to mitigate the adverse effects of trauma exposure on at‐risk young adults of color. Worldwide, research on the effects of trauma, stress, and adversities must examine contextual factors (e.g., economic hardship), marginalization (e.g., discrimination, identity factors), and the differential impact on health among individuals and communities.Alternate abstract:抽象Traditional and Simplified Chinese Abstracts by the Asian Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (AsianSTSS)簡體及繁體中文撮要由亞洲創傷心理研究學會翻譯Traditional Chinese專題導論:全球被剝奪權利群體中不成比例的創傷、壓力及逆境是導致健康不平等的途徑摘要在全球範圍內, 因其身份而被邊緣化的個人及社區比未被邊緣化的個人及社區面臨更大的創傷性壓力及社會經濟困難的風險。許多類型的逆境被邊緣化及風險過高, 與身體健康、心理健康及整體福祉方面的不平等相對應。 《創傷後壓力症雜誌》特刊刊登的12項實證研究及一項系統綜述強調了歧視及不相稱的逆境對因種族、民族、出生、種姓、性別認同、性取向、經濟地位及醫療狀況而被邊緣化的群體的影響。雖然這一問題的大多數研究集中在美國, 但聚焦印度、薩爾瓦多及布隆迪的差異及風險因素的文章提供了一個多大陸的全球視角。從全球視角出發, 需要進一步研究歧視、過度遭受創傷性壓力及逆境如何與世界範圍內的不公平負擔及健康差距聯繫在一起。本期特刊通過對兒童、年輕人、成年人及父母‐孩子二人組的研究, 進一步強調了系統性邊緣化的發展及多代負擔。通過一項利用解放主義媒體技巧(例如, 積極的媒體形象及信息)來減輕暴露在創傷中對有危險的有色青年的不利影響的研究, 改變及干預的途徑通過解放主義意識的視角來說明。在世界範圍內, 關於創傷、壓力及逆境影響的研究必須審查環境因素(如經濟困難)、邊緣化(如歧視、身份因素)以及個人及社區之間對健康的不同影響。Simplified Chinese专题导论:全球被剥夺权利群体中不成比例的创伤、压力及逆境是导致健康不平等的途径摘要在全球范围内, 因其身份而被边缘化的个人及小区比未被边缘化的个人及小区面临更大的创伤性压力及社会经济困难的风险。许多类型的逆境被边缘化及风险过高, 与身体健康、心理健康及整体福祉方面的不平等相对应。 《创伤后压力症杂志》特刊刊登的12项实证研究及一项系统综述强调了歧视及不相称的逆境对因种族、民族、出生、种姓、性别认同、性取向、经济地位及医疗状况而被边缘化的群体的影响。虽然这一问题的大多数研究集中在美国, 但聚焦印度、萨尔瓦多及布隆迪的差异及风险因素的文章提供了一个多大陆的全球视角。从全球视角出发, 需要进一步研究歧视、过度遭受创伤性压力及逆境如何与世界范围内的不公平负担及健康差距联系在一起。本期特刊通过对儿童、年轻人、成年人及父母‐孩子二人组的研究, 进一步强调了系统性边缘化的发展及多代负担。通过一项利用解放主义媒体技巧(例如, 积极的媒体形象及信息)来减轻暴露在创伤中对有危险的有色青年的不利影响的研究, 改变及干预的途径通过解放主义意识的视角来说明。在世界范围内, 关于创伤、压力及逆境影响的研究必须审查环境因素(如经济困难)、边缘化(如歧视、身份因素)以及个人及小区之间对健康的不同影响。

T1  - The SciPop Scale for Measuring Science-Related Populist Attitudes in Surveys: Development, Test, and Validation
AN  - 2572568104
AB  - Populism typically pits political elites against “the virtuous people.” A distinct variant of populism (“science-related populism”) extends beyond politics, targeting academic elites and suggesting they ignore people’s common sense and will. Individual endorsement of such a worldview (“science-related populist attitudes”) has been conceptualized but not yet measured. Hence, we developed the SciPop Scale, a survey instrument to measure science-related populist attitudes. We tested 17 survey items in a first representative survey and developed an 8-item scale. We then tested German, French, and Italian versions of this scale in a second representative survey, employing confirmatory factor analysis, Item Response Theory, and external validity tests. Findings show that the SciPop Scale is a robust and reliable measure of populist demands toward science.

T1  - The other other. Representations and rhetorical estrangement of anti-immigration positions in Scandinavian print media, 1970 – 2016
AN  - 2556882683
AB  - This is a qualitative text-analytic study of the discursive representations of anti-immigration positions in Scandinavian press 1970–2016. Our study shows how immigration critics textually are estranged and constituted as an other throughout the period. We examine how three main categories of immigration critics are estranged: extremists, populist politicians, and critical citizens. Within these categories, we find manifest estrangement through demonizing and ridiculing. We call this category of rhetorical work for conspicuous estrangement. However, we also find more subtle hints of illegitimacy or alienation in the portrayals. We call this category of rhetorical work of marginalization for inconspicuous estrangement. While other studies have argued that such forms of soft oppression may prepare the ground for forms of hard oppression and increased marginalizing, our study demonstrates that representations instead move toward legitimation, indicating a normalization of populist politics and anti-immigration attitudes in Scandinavia. Our findings thus support research arguing that a mainstreaming of the radical right has occurred.

T1  - The impact of innovation attributes and the mediating effect of environmental attitudes towards environmental management practices among SMEs
AN  - 2517794128
AB  - There is growing concern about the disastrous effect of the food manufacturing sector on the environment, making environmental management practices (EMPs) a potential solution that cannot be ignored. In order to deepen the knowledge related to environmental attitude and the relationship between this attitude and the intention to adopt EMPs, the owner‐managers of small‐ and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs), which are the primary decision‐makers in the organisation, are the best area of interest to be tested. This paper aims to investigate the influence of owner‐managers’ environmental attitude and its mediation effect, as well as the influences of attributes of innovation toward the intention to adopt EMPs. This study was conducted on 367 food manufacturing SMEs in Malaysia, and the data collected were analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings revealed that environmental attitude, relative advantage, compatibility, and complexity have significantly influenced the owner‐managers’ intention to adopt EMPs. Furthermore, the owner‐managers’ environmental attitude proved to have partial mediation effects in the structural model. The paper has significant implications as it shows the vital role of the owner‐managers’ environmental attitude, not only as a driver that nurtures the intentions of EMPs, but also as an intervening variable that mediates the relationship between the attributes of innovation and the intention to adopt EMPs.

T1  - Economic conditions and perceptions of immigrants as an economic threat in Europe: Temporal dynamics and mediating processes
AN  - 2533167420
AB  - This article addresses the extent to which economic downturns influence the perception of immigrants as an economic threat and through which channels this occurs. Our primary objective is an investigation of the specific mechanisms that connect economic conditions to the perception of immigrants as a threat. We therefore also contribute to theoretical discussions based on group threat and realistic group conflict theory by exposing the dominant source of competition relevant to these relationships. Furthermore, we investigate whether people react more sensitive to short-term economic dynamics within countries than to the long-term economic circumstances. Our database comprises all waves of the European Social Survey from 2002 to 2017. The macro-economic indicators we use include GDP per capita, unemployment, and national debt levels, covering the most salient economic dimensions. We furthermore control for the country’s migration situation and aggregate party positions toward cultural diversity. Our results show that the dynamic short-term developments of the economy and migration within countries are of greater relevance for perceived immigrant threat than the long-term situation. In contrast, the long-term political climate appears to be more important than short-term changes in the aggregate party positions. Further mediation analyses show that objective economic conditions influence anti-immigrant attitudes primarily through individual perceptions of the country’s economic performance and that unemployment rates are of primary importance.

T1  - Who Believes in Conspiracy Theories about the COVID-19 Pandemic in Romania? An Analysis of Conspiracy Theories Believers’ Profiles
AN  - 2612842793
AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by the circulation of an unprecedented amount of “polluted” information, especially in the social media environment, among which are false narratives and conspiracy theories about both the pandemic and vaccination against COVID-19. The effects of such questionable information primarily concern the lack of compliance with restrictive measures and a negative attitude towards vaccination campaigns, as well as more complex social effects, such as street protests or distrust in governments and authorities in general. Even though there is a lot of scholarly attention given to these narratives in many countries, research about the profile of people who are more prone to believe or spread them is rather scarce. In this context, we investigate the role of age, compared with other socio-demographic factors (such as education and religiosity), as well as the role of the media (the frequency of news consumption, the perceived usefulness of social media, and the perceived incidence of fake information about the virus in the media) and the critical thinking disposition of people who tend to believe such misleading narratives. To address these issues, we conducted a national survey (N = 945) in April 2021 in Romania. Using a hierarchical OLS regression model, we found that people who perceive higher incidence of fake news (ß = 0.33, p < 0.001), find social media platforms more useful (ß = 0.13, p < 0.001), have lower education (ß = −0.17, p < 0.001), and have higher levels of religiosity (ß = 0.08, p < 0.05) are more prone to believe COVID-19-related misleading narratives. At the same time, the frequency of news consumption (regardless of the type of media), critical thinking disposition, and age do not play a significant role in the profile of the believer in conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic. Somewhat surprisingly, age does not play a role in predicting belief in conspiracy theories, even though there are studies that suggest that older people are more prone to believe conspiracy narratives. As far as media is concerned, the frequency of news media consumption does not significantly differ for believers and non-believers. We discuss these results within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

T1  - Political Rhetoric and Hate Speech in the Case of Shamima Begum
AN  - 2584477853
AB  - The relationship between political rhetoric and hate crime has been a topic of growing concern in recent years, with the narratives promoted by politicians widely seen as legitimating and inspiring hate crime as well as soothing or inflaming the tensions that result from antecedent hate crime events such as terrorist attacks. The potential return of so-called ‘IS bride’ Shamima Begum from a Syrian refugee camp in 2019, following her high-profile departure four years earlier, led to intense debate within the UK, particularly over the controversial removal of her citizenship by Home Secretary Sajid Javid. As an Islamist terrorism case with clear gendered dimensions, the Begum case was well-positioned to function as a hate crime trigger event. The divisiveness of this case was reflected in partisan political argument within the UK, and accompanied by high volumes of toxic and Islamophobic social media discussion alongside input from a variety of UK politicians. This paper offers a qualitative analysis of the political rhetoric promoted in the Twitter accounts of leading UK politicians in response to the citizenship decision, and subsequent developments between February and April 2019, such as the death of Begum’s child and the granting of legal aid to support her ongoing legal challenge. Through a Critical Discourse Analysis of politicians’ online rhetoric, this study aims to establish the contribution of UK political rhetoric to the hate speech discourses that emerged online in response to this case.

T1  - Fake News Is Real: The Significance and Sources of Disbelief in Mainstream Media in Trump’s America
AN  - 2441436794
AB  - Are appeals to discredit mainstream media reporting of political news in the guise of “fake news” merely a diversion from more fundamental threats to democratic politics and policymaking? Or is the emerging belief in “fake news” itself a looming threat? Using data from the Voter Study Group’s panel survey, we examine the relationship between disbelief in mainstream media and a wide range of social attitudes and policy preferences. We find that in December 2016, just after Trump’s election, belief in fake news wields an outsized influence, independent of partisanship, ideology, media consumption, and other established foundations of public opinion. The effects of fake news beliefs are especially pronounced on key elements of Trump’s rhetoric as candidate and as president—hostility toward immigrants, racial and religious minorities, gender equality, perceptions of America’s “greatness,” and even support for democratic norms and institutions itself. We also find some evidence that by January 2019, the belief in fake news has become even more focally associated with Trump. These findings portend the possibility of an emerging exclusionary, populist variant of American conservatism, of which disbelief in media institutions is a key component.

T1  - Intention to be screened for Alzheimer’s disease in nondemented older adults: Integrated behavioral model and self-efficacy as mediation effect
AN  - 2434474748
AB  - The study explored factors associated with intention to be screened for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The study also examined whether self-efficacy mediates the relationship between knowledge about screening and the intention to be screened for AD. A population-based, random-digit dialing survey was performed and 1,043 responses were collected from a sample of nondemented persons (50 years or older) living in urban, suburban and rural areas in a Midwestern state. The findings showed that participants who were younger and who had higher levels of (a) perceived benefits and barriers, (b) social support and (c) self-efficacy reported higher levels of intention to be screened for AD. Older adults with positive life orientation reported greater intention to be screened for AD, whereas depressed participants were more likely to report a plan to be screened for AD. Self-efficacy mediated the relationship between knowledge about screening and intention to be screened. Older adults were more likely to report intention to be screened when they had positive attitudes about the screen and believed that they could receive the screen. The intention to be screened for AD could serve public awareness by defining effective ways to assist older adults to seek a cognitive screen.

T1  - Dignity in the Time of Precarity
AN  - 2407267653
AB  - “Money is both everything and nothing,” said Bahman, a recycling picker in Lorestan, Iran. “Money is wealth, but it's not reputation. Money is credit, but it's not character. Money is good, it's not bad. But it's not everything.” As Iran's socioeconomic climate has steadily deteriorated over the past year as a result of mounting international tensions and crippling US-led smart sanctions, comments like these infuse daily conversations and discourses. The spiraling devaluation of the Iranian rial, delayed wages for those lucky enough to have a formal job, and flagrant inflation have meant that precarity has become a way of life for many ordinary Iranians, particularly those located at the bottom of the social hierarchy. In this short reflective essay, I would like to consider what happens when hardship becomes the new status quo and economic success is increasingly seen as a pipe dream. How do marginalized, disparaged groups make claims to belonging in settings marked by the normalization of economic suffering? Although much can be gleaned about the nature of contemporary citizenship and the social order through intimate understanding of how the sidelined respond to affronts to their livelihoods and dignity, systematic research into the everyday lives and beliefs of the Iranian working poor has been sparse. The anecdotal evidence that we have—informed by inconsistent media coverage of the country—largely reinforces a narrative of despair and lost hope that can then presumably be channeled into rebellion. But surely there is more to the story. Those utterly disabused of hope would not start their own ventures, highlight the social value of their work, or believe they are living a good life.

AB  - We investigate a popular but underresearched concept, the fear of missing out (FOMO), on desirable experiences of which an individual is aware, but in which they do not partake. Through laboratory and field studies, we establish FOMO’s pervasiveness as a psychological phenomenon, present real-life contexts wherein FOMO may be experienced, and explore its behavioral consequences. Specifically, we show that FOMO poses a threat to loyalty by decreasing one’s intentions to repeat a current experience and may decrease the valuation of the current experience.

T1  - Counting Migrants’ Deaths at the Border: From Civil Society Counterstatistics to (Inter)Governmental Recuperation: PROD
AN  - 2377905535
AB  - Migrant deaths in border-zones have become a major social and political issue, especially in the context of the Euro-Mediterranean refugee/migrant crisis. While media, activists, and policy makers often mention precise figures regarding the number of deaths, little is known about the production of statistical data on this topic. This article explores the politics of counting migrant deaths in Europe. This statistical activity was initiated in the 1990s by civil society organizations with the purpose of shedding light on the deadly consequences of “Fortress Europe” and of challenging states’ control-oriented political strategies. In 2013, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) started to count migrants’ deaths: while this intergovernmental organization seems to follow up on civil society initiatives, it actually works with different political objectives. Rather than criticizing states, IOM aims at conciliating the control of irregular migration with the prevention of deaths. IOM’s statistics on border deaths illustrate the humanitarianization of the border, as denunciation of migrants’ deaths and life-saving activities become integrated in border management and border control. In producing statistics on border deaths, IOM depoliticizes this data and challenges the critical framework that was central to earlier civil society initiatives. Finally, the article explores ways in which statistics on border deaths are being repoliticized to challenge European states’ immigration policies.

T1  - Autonomy, productiveness, and community: the rise of inequality in an Amazonian society
AN  - 2354587422
AB  - In Amazonian societies, autonomy is said to be a core value motivating egalitarian politics. This article shows how the quest for autonomy and productiveness presently sets in motion processes that encroach upon these very values. Among the Shuar of Amazonian Ecuador, the realization of autonomy and productiveness increasingly depends on the capture of state resources. Shuar interact with the local state as members of relatively recent sedentary communities and through the mediation of elected leaders. In these processes, ‘community’ itself is transformed: being a channel to regenerate domestic livelihoods, it also becomes an end in itself, giving rise to new economistic attitudes while legitimizing inequalities between commoners and leaders. The article suggests that the pursuit of autonomy and productiveness within a process of village formation is central to the transformation of egalitarianism that occurs when small‐scale Amazonian polities engage with nation‐state politics.Alternate abstract:AbstraitAutonomie, productivité et communauté : l'essor de l'inégalité dans une société amazonienneRésuméL'autonomie est présentée comme une valeur centrale motivant des politiques égalitaires dans les sociétés amazoniennes. Le présent article montre comment la quête d'autonomie et de productivité met aujourd'hui en branle des processus qui compromettent ces valeurs mêmes. Chez les Shuars d'Amazonie équatorienne, la réalisation de l'autonomie et de la productivité dépend de plus en plus de la captation de ressources étatiques. Les Shuars interagissent avec l’État local en tant que membres de communautés assez récemment sédentarisées et par l'intermédiaire de chefs élus. Par ces processus, la « communauté » elle‐même se transforme : de canal de régénération des moyens de subsistance domestiques, elle devient aussi une fin en soi, suscitant de nouvelles attitudes économistes tout en justifiant les inégalités entre la population et les chefs. L'article suggère que la poursuite de l'autonomie et de la productivité dans le cadre d'un processus de formation de villages est au cœur de la transformation de l'égalitarisme qui se produit lorsque les petites collectivités amazoniennes s'engagent dans la politique de l'État‐nation.

T1  - In pursuit of happiness: Life satisfaction drives political support
AN  - 2341350389
AB  - It is argued in this article that citizens in democracies use their subjective well‐being (SWB) as an evaluative criterion when deciding how willing they are to support and comply with government dictates (political system support). When life is satisfactory, government authorities are rewarded with support, when it is not, citizens punish authorities by withholding their support. To make sense of the relationship, it is suggested that citizens act as if they have signed a happiness contract with ‘those in power’. In support of this argument, comparative survey data shows that SWB predicts attitudes on political system support across country contexts and under strong control conditions. Establishing that the relationship is causal, panel data documents that attitudes on political system support can be undermined following the termination of a close personal relationship, and that the causal effect is mediated via changes in SWB. Finally, as predicted, the happiness‐support relationship is weaker among individuals who are high on spirituality/religiousness and attribute blame for external events to both worldly and non‐worldly powers.

AB  - Cet article se base sur une enquête monographique de dix-neuf mois dans la marina de Dzaoudzi (Mayotte). Le lieu de l'enquête est à la fois un point de circulation et un point d'ancrage où se croisent et se distinguent différents parcours de vie. Les données empiriques obtenues par observation participante mettent en évidence ces trajectoires individuelles et les raisons multiples, mais convergentes, ayant poussé les enquêtés à faire ce choix de mode de vie qualifié d'atypique. L'apport de cette étude est de démontrer que, si les modes de vie mobiles (lifestyle mobilities) sont un but pour la majorité des enquêtés, elles peuvent se transformer en migrations motivées par la recherche d'un style de vie (lifestyle migrations) ou en mobilité temporaire. En présentant les différentes facettes de la socialisation au sein de cette communauté, l'article met également en lumière les rapports entre personnes du milieu/étrangères à ce milieu et s'interroge sur les phénomènes de précarisation et marginalisation au sein du groupe. L'étude permet également de mettre en avant les distinctions intergénérationnelles concernant les motivations liées à ce choix de mode de vie nomade. La cohésion intergénérationnelle transcende ces distinctions, les enquêtés se reconnaissant comme des pairs liés par un mode de vie basé sur une passion commune pour l'océan et l'idéal de liberté ainsi que par un rejet de la société postmoderne.Alternate abstract:This article is based on a nineteen-month monographic ethnography in the marina of Dzaoudzi (Mayotte). The research site is both a point of circulation and an anchoring point where different life paths intersect and distinguish each other. Empirical data obtained through participatory observation highlights these individual trajectories and the multiple but converging reasons that led to this lifestyle choice described as atypical. The contribution of this study is to demonstrate that, although lifestyle mobilities are a goal for the majority of respondents, they can be transformed into lifestyle migrations or temporary mobility. By presenting the different facets of socialization within this community, the article also highlights the insider/outsider relationships and questions the phenomena of precariousness and marginalization within the group. The study also emphasizes on the intergenerational distinctions concerning the motivations of this choice of a nomadic lifestyle. Intergenerational cohesion transcends these distinctions, with respondents recognizing themselves as peers, bound by a lifestyle based on a common passion for the ocean and the ideal of freedom, as well as a rejection of the postmodern society.Alternate abstract:Este artículo se basa en una encuesta etnográfica de diez y nueve meses en la marina de Dzaoudzi (Mayotte).

La cohesión intergeneracional transciende dichas distinciones, los encuestados se reconocen como pares ligados por un modo de vida basado en una pasión común por el mar y la idea de libertad, así como por un rechazo de la sociedad postmoderna.

T1  - Marginal Youths or Outlaws? Youth Street Gangs, Globalisation, and Violence in Contemporary Sierra Leone
AN  - 2531343573
AB  - Sierra Leoneans were shocked when video clips of the Central Correctional Centre gallows began circulating on social media after the Minister of Internal Affairs instructed the prison authorities to get ready to take life. The Minister's pronouncement came hot on the heels of a series of alleged gang-related murders that rocked Freetown in 2016. What are the complex linkages between street violence and youth marginalisation? How might violence among marginal youth relate to unplanned urbanisation, the retreat of the state, the neoliberal paradigm, and the wider political economy – all trappings of an exclusionary globalisation process that continues to exclude those at the periphery? This article describes the appropriation by marginal actors of global cultural influences and their transcription into deadly weapons of the weak in furtherance of a survivalist objective anchored in citizenship. The research is based on fieldwork conducted in five cities in Sierra Leone – group discussions and in-depth interviews with over 300 participants, all identifying themselves as gangsters belonging to one of the three dominant team/ set federations: Crip, Blood, and Black (Black Hood or Black Game). Problematising their quotidian existence in contemporary Africa raises fundamental questions about globalisation and citizenship in the making of subaltern subjectivities.Alternate abstract:Les Sierra-Léonais ont été choqués lorsque des clips vidéos de la prison du Centre correctionnel central ont commencé à circuler sur les réseaux sociaux, à la suite de l'ordre donné par le ministre de l'Intérieur aux autorités pénitentiaires de se préparer à prendre des vies. La déclaration du Ministre fait suite à une série de meurtres présumés liés à des gangs qui ont secoué Freetown en 2016. Quels sont les liens complexes entre violence dans la rue et marginalisation des jeunes? La violence chez les jeunes marginalisés pourraitelle être liée à l'urbanisation sauvage, à la démission de l'État, au paradigme néolibéral et à l'économie politique en général, autant de pièges dans un processus de mondialisation de l'exclusion qui continue d'évincer ceux qui se trouvent à la périphérie ? Cet article décrit l'appropriation par des acteurs marginaux des influences culturelles mondiales et leur transcription en armes mortelles des faibles dans la poursuite d'un objectif survivaliste ancré dans la citoyenneté. Il est basé sur une recherche de terrain mené dans cinq villes au Sierra Leone (discussions de groupe et entretiens approfondis avec plus de 300 participants, tous s'identifiant comme des gangsters appartenant à l'une des trois fédérations d'équipes/ensembles : Crip, Blood et Black (Black Hood ou Black Game). La problématisation de leur existence quotidienne en Afrique contemporaine soulève des questions fondamentales sur la mondialisation et la citoyenneté dans la fabrication de subjectivités subalternes.

TT  - El envejecimiento activo en residencias para personas mayores: su efecto en el bienestar psicológico y la satisfacción vital
AN  - 2478115507
AB  - A great number of intervention strategies that provide opportunities to maintain physical, psychological, and social wellbeing have been carried out in order to promote active aging. Most of these strategies are aimed at people without physicalor cognitive dependence, while institutionalized older people have not been considered as a target group. The main objectiveof this study was to analyze the effect of an active aging program on the psychological well-being and life satisfaction ofinstitutionalized older people. A total of 141 participants with adequate psychomotor skills were selected (Mage = 85.50 years,SD = 8.47), and a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design with a control group and an experimental group was used. Thecontrol group participated in the traditional limited active aging program offered in long-term care facilities – cognitivestimulation and physical activity – while the experimental group participated in a comprehensive active aging program. Afterthe intervention, participants from the experimental group showed improvements in the mean values of psychological wellbeing and life satisfaction, while no change was found in the control group. The improvements in psychological well-beingand life satisfaction were maintained 12 months later in the follow-up evaluation. This study suggests that the inclusionof a comprehensive active aging program in nursing homes, that comprises actions aimed at promoting empowerment,participation, and social openness, contributes to the maintenance of perceived well-being.Alternate abstract:

TT  - Media pluralism and social inclusion: the accessibility of RTP children and youth programming for minors with disabilities
AN  - 2463166882
AB  - Este artículo investiga la accesibilidad de la programación infanto-juvenil de Rádio e Televisão de Portugal (RTP) en televisión lineal y online, tanto en su emisión en directo como en los contenidos a la carta. La accesibilidad de los contenidos para menores es esencial para el disfrute de los derechos fundamentales en igualdad, para conseguir la inclusión social de este colectivo y como reflejo del pluralismo mediático y del carácter de servicio público de la televisión. Además, el subtitulado, la audiodescripción y la lengua de signos son también herramientas de aprendizaje altamente valiosas para los menores y jóvenes con discapacidad visual o auditiva. El estudio parte de un análisis bibliográfico y documental sobre el marco regulatorio portugués que dicta cómo de accesible debe ser la programación televisiva en este país. Tomando como base la legislación, analiza su puesta en práctica en los contenidos infanto-juveniles de RTP mediante un análisis de contenido; discute los resultados a través de entrevistas cualitativas a la propia televisión, a la Entidade Reguladora para a Comunicação Social (ERC) y a la Federação Portuguesa das Associações de Surdos; y contextualiza la situación de la accesibilidad de los contenidos infanto-juveniles de RTP en el marco internacional actual comparándola con las televisiones públicas de Reino Unido y España. Las conclusiones apuntan a que la accesibilidad de los contenidos de RTP dirigidos a la infancia y la juventud es insuficiente para garantizar su accesibilidad en igualdad y debe ser mejorada, aunque se aprecian iniciativas altamente positivas en la implantación de la Língua Gestual Portuguesa (LGP).Alternate abstract:This article investigates the accessibility of Rádio e Televisão de Portugal (RTP) children's and youth programming on linear and online television, both in its live broadcast and on-demand. The accessibility of content for minors is essential for the enjoyment of fundamental rights on an equal footing, to achieve the social inclusion of this group and as a reflection of media pluralism and the public service character of television. Furthermore, subtitling, audio description and sign language are also highly valuable learning tools for children and young people with visual or hearing disabilities. The study is based on a bibliographic and documentary analysis of the regulatory framework that dictates how accessible television programming should be in Portugal. Based on the legislation, it analyses its implementation in RTP children's and young people's programming through a content analysis; discusses the results through qualitative interviews with the RTP itself, the Entidade Reguladora para a Comunicação Social (ERC) and the Federação Portuguesa das Associações de Surdos (FPAS); and contextualises the situation of accessibility of children's contents of RTP in the current international context by comparing it with public television channels in the United Kingdom and Spain. Conclusions suggest that the accessibility of RTP content aimed at children and young people is insufficient to guarantee their accessibility on an equal footing and must be improved, although highly positive initiatives can be seen in the implementation of the Língua Gestual Portuguesa (LGP).

T1  - The dual causes of fragmentation: Democratic security and the communitarian state in Colombian politics
AN  - 2327863069
AB  - This chapter analyzes speeches delivered by former Colombian President, Álvaro Uribe Vélez, between August 2002 and August 2009, which can be found on the official website of the presidency: (http://web.presidencia.gov.co/discursos/). We attempt to identify the webs of meaning surrounding the concepts of ‘Democratic Security’ and ‘Communitarian State’ with awareness of the relationship between discourse, ideology and power. The aim is to better understand the political power of the plans, programs and projects developed by Uribe’s administration, and how this was affected by widespread deployment of the media. These policies are conditioned by a set of colonialist principles that are embodied in symbolic-discursive strategies that result in representations, by means of which mechanisms of marginalization, discrimination and polarized hierarchy are legitimized from the different social spheres. During the 7-year period analyzed there were controversial debates over the commission of crimes against humanity by national security agents, as well as corruption scandals over topics like ‘para-politics’, ‘false positives’, selective arrests, extrajudicial killings and violations of the sovereignty of bordering countries. Within this political context, we attempt to identify the inherent tensions and social conflicts. It is argued that the analyzed discourses reproduce colonialist thoughts, in relation to neoliberal principles and the application of global policies. Using the principles of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), we explore the strategies and resources used in Uribe’s speeches and how major themes are positioned to reproduce systems of beliefs, values and attitudes.

T1  - Dissolving into the sea: cinematic migrants and the problem of agency
AN  - 2336171133
AB  - Films about irregular migration to Europe that centre on the Mediterranean sea crossing often unwittingly strengthen the regime of migrant (in)visibility furthered by sensationalist media, which include topoi of shipwrecks, dramatic rescues, and body bags. Such films’ imagery of the Mediterranean as a metaphorical space of transformation into living death, actual death, or paradisiacal life also suggests that the identity of the migrant is indeterminable, zombie-like, even monstrous. Finally, focusing on the sea as central to the migrant journey makes invisible the broader geopolitical context, especially the continuing neocolonial relationship between the global North and the global South. My essay examines the political implications of focusing on migrant bodies in the middle of the sea, especially in sympathetic accounts which portray the Mediterranean as a gothic space where the perished yet ghostly migrants haunt Europe like revenants of its colonial past. Gianfranco Rosi’s acclaimed docudrama Fire at Sea (2016) exemplifies this approach. I analyse it in the context of similar visual representations before briefly contrasting it with Želimir Žilnik’s Logbook Serbistan (2015), which situates migrants in a broader geopolitical context and portrays them as non-idealised people with complex backgrounds, political opinions, and agency.

T1  - Refugees in the media: Exploring a vicious cycle of frustrated psychological needs, selective exposure, and hostile intergroup attitudes
AN  - 2310141562
AB  - Two research objectives underlay the present research. First, we tested how frustrated psychological needs caused by the refugee‐influx influence the endorsement and selection of refugee‐relevant information. Second, we tested how information selection processes contribute to the development of exclusionary attitudes that counteract the integration of refugees into host countries. In a laboratory study (n = 181), frustrated psychological needs decreased participants’ endorsement of a refugee‐friendly essay (vs. a control essay). Additionally, frustrated needs led to a biased selection of refugee‐hostile over refugee‐friendly information and such selection biases, in turn, predicted higher levels of ingroup defense and prejudice toward refugees. The findings imply that host societies’ receptiveness to refugees is influenced by the maintenance of basic psychological needs.

T1  - Divided loyalties: Perceptions of disloyalty underpin bias toward dually-identified minority-group members
AN  - 2300158983
AB  - Majority-group members often hold negative attitudes toward minority-group members who identify with both the majority and their minority group. Integrating perspectives from social identity theory and acculturation research with a coalitional psychology framework, we show that an underlying mechanism for such bias is the perception that dual identifiers are disloyal to the majority group. In Study 1, majority-group participants in the U.S. questioned the loyalty of a dually identified Arab immigrant more than one who identified solely with the (American) majority group, especially under intergroup threat, which in turn predicted less favorable feelings toward the immigrant. Study 2 conceptually replicated the effect of the identity manipulation and the mediating influence of perceived loyalty on judgments about an immigrant being allowed to enlist in the U.S. military. Study 3, partially replicated the findings in Poland, focusing on Russian immigrants as targets. In Study 4, which independently manipulated both the identity expressed by immigrants and their loyalty, a dually identified immigrant whose loyalty to the majority group was portrayed as high was not judged as less qualified than an immigrant who identified only with the majority group for jobs with the potential to inflict damage on the majority group. Study 5, replicated and extended the previous studies in the context of fans of allied or rival soccer teams in Germany, revealing the moderating role of existing group relations on the hypothesized loyalty processes. In summary, coalitionally driven perceptions of (dis)loyalty appear to undergird bias toward minority-group members who hold dual identifications.

T1  - “Sticks and Stones May Break My Bones, But Bullying Will Get Me Bangin’”: Bullying Involvement and Adolescent Gang Joining
AN  - 2281284582
AB  - Studies have shown that adolescents’ involvement in bullying (as perpetrators, victims, or both) is related to more negative outcomes than noninvolvement, and a small subset of studies has connected bullying to the specific outcome of gang involvement. However, most of these studies have been cross-sectional and have not examined causal pathways by which bullying and gang involvement may be related. Furthermore, some studies find sex differences in prevalence, type, and outcomes of bullying as well as in the relationship between bullying and gang involvement, suggesting important prevention implications, yet this remains under examined. Our study explicitly examines these issues identifying the overlap in bullying outcomes with antecedent gang risk factors, and suggesting potential direct and indirect effects of bullying on gang involvement; we test these relationships, and potential sex differences, using longitudinal data from the second National Evaluation of Gang Resistance Education and Training to overcome limitations of prior research. Consistent with our expectations, we find that (1) bully-victims exhibit the highest levels of risk; (2) bullies, victims, and bully-victims have increased odds of later gang joining, compared to uninvolved youth; (3) the inclusion of risk factors partially mediates the effect of bullying involvement on gang onset for bullies and victims and fully mediates the effect for bully-victims; and (4) some evidence of sex differences exists. Given these insights, greater connections between bullying and gang prevention efforts may be worthwhile.

T1  - The media factor influencing the effect of organ donation advocacy in South Korea
AN  - 2336248827
AB  - In this study, we investigated the influence of the media factor on the effect of and resistance to media advocacy for organ donation by conducting a web-based experiment with a 2 (media: conservative vs. progressive) by 2 (political orientation: conservative vs. progressive) factorial design with media and political orientation as between-subjects factors. The results demonstrate that organ donation intention after exposure to a message advocating organ donation was greater for conservatives in the conservative media group than for those in the progressive media group. The effect of participant–media agreement in regard to political orientation on organ donation intention was explained by perceived media credibility and psychological reactance.

T1  - Politics, power, and performativity in the newsroom: an ethnography of television journalism in Turkey
AN  - 2250554161
AB  - How do political divisions within the newsroom shape negotiations around news production? This article addresses this question by examining how Turkish journalists, in their discourse and practices, represent Kurds and Arabs when interpreting and discussing current events related to the Kurdish question and the Arab Spring. The study draws upon a year of ethnographic fieldwork, and interviews conducted in 2011 and 2012, in the newsrooms of two mainstream national television channels in Turkey. It reveals how journalists with opposing political beliefs perform their representational practices by continuously modifying them according to the opinions of managerial boards. In negotiations on the portrayal of Kurds and Arabs in news reports, journalists mask or modify ‘undesired’ aspects of their individual interpretations to fit them into a dominant news frame. However, they can also challenge that frame. Based upon the observation of such negotiations, this article advances a novel definition of journalistic performance as a purposeful, strategic, and staged form of symbolic communication: an essential tool for navigating ideological conflicts in the power structure of the newsroom.

T1  - When political values and perceptions of deservingness collide: Evaluating public support for homelessness investments in Canada
AN  - 2236074077
AB  - Citizen attitudes toward welfare state investments are often explained by their ideological values and their perceptions of deservingness of welfare recipients, yet recent experimental research has led to the theorization that clear deservingness cues can overwhelm otherwise strong ideological beliefs. We tested these claims with respect to homelessness in Canada using a vignette survey experiment and found evidence that citizens with very different political beliefs can support similar government investments, indeed from a shared sense of deservingness as suggested by recent experimental studies, but that support is anchored by rather different reasons.Key Practitioner Message:• Citizen support for homelessness investments is jointly mediated by ideology and a sense of the “deservingness” of the beneficiary.• Emphasizing the broader cost savings to taxpayers from “Housing First” does not make conservative‐leaning citizens more supportive of investments.• Emphasizing the personal attributes of persons experiencing homelessness rather than abstract statistics may unite progressives and conservatives on “deservingness”.

T1  - Developing participation opportunities for young people with disabilities? Policy enactment and social inclusion in Australian junior sport
AN  - 2207661690
AB  - Interventions aimed at increasing the participation of young people with disabilities in recreational sport have had mixed success. The authors draw on in-depth interviews with representatives from State Sporting Associations, local government officers and volunteers within community sports clubs in Victoria, Australia, to examine why some sports clubs are unable or unwilling to translate policy ambitions into practice. The findings indicate how by framing disability provision as 'too difficult', 'not core business' and antithetical to competitive success, community sports clubs are able to resist policy ambitions to modify existing structures and develop more inclusive practice. Greater priority needs to be given to transformational inclusion objectives and challenging ableism if clubs are to structurally progress the development of participation opportunities for young people with disabilities.

T1  - Framing the Issue of Asylum Seekers and Refugees for Tougher Refugee Policy—a Study of the Media’s Portrayal in Post-colonial Hong Kong
AN  - 2109029684
AB  - Policy-makers often refer to media reports and public opinion polls when advocating immigration policies. A good example of this is provided by Hong Kong, an international financial hub that prides itself on its multiculturalism and pluralism, but whose government officials and pro-establishment legislators have been calling for tougher measures because of a plethora of negative news reports on immigrants. This study examines how print media frames the issue of asylum seekers and refugees, with the findings indicating that the majority of local Chinese news articles portray asylum seekers negatively as “fake refugees” and “criminals.” The study also examines newspapers’ framing of the causes of requests for asylum and their recommendations for dealing with the “problem”: (1) setting up detention camps, (2) enforcing stricter border control, and (3) withdrawing from the UNCAT. It argues that the negative framing provides justifications for anti-refugee policy-makers to suggest tougher policy solutions to the issue of asylum seekers and refugees. Policy implications are discussed which may affect Hong Kong’s position as a first-class global city.

T1  - Satirical Narrative Processing: Examining the Roles of Character Liking and Media Enjoyment on Narrative-Consistent Attitudes
AN  - 2430088232
AB  - This study uses online survey data (n = 127) with an embedded media manipulation to examine relationships between character liking, media enjoyment, and narrative consistent attitudes with late-night political comedian, Stephen Colbert’s satirical campaign finance narrative. The data offer empirical support for the notion that narratively structured political satire processing models should consider relevant entertainment psychology and narrative persuasion concepts such as how audiences respond to the main characters and the role enjoyment plays in the process. Using structural equation modeling, media enjoyment significantly mediated the relationship between character liking and narrative consistent attitude formation (about the antagonist), but appears to have functioned as a suppressor variable. Competing models are offered in an Online Appendix.

T1  - Considering the Marginalisation of Majority Groups: Injecting Subaltern Studies Insights into Normative Media Theory
AN  - 2275896435
AB  - In 2014, the failure of South African mainstream media to anticipate the African National Congress retaining its electoral majority despite numerous scandals inspired a brief period of soul-searching. Two years later, failure by American and British mainstream media to discern the loyalties of their respective majorities prompted a similar reaction when both groups failed to track Donald Trump winning the US election and the Brexit vote. The surprise electoral gains made by the unfancied Labour Party a year later provided another major example of the gap between the media and the general populace. These events gave strong evidence of the disconnect between the media, its current normative models, and ordinary citizens. This paper furthers a radical critique of the mainstream media that argues the sector is out of touch. In order to reverse the current trajectory, the argument advanced is that a discussion of roles of the media or normative theory needs to be cognisant of the missing voice of subaltern groups. Using a combination of subaltern and postcolonial theory, the article recommends that in order to comprehend the role the media should play in the future of the country; the context lived by silent majority must be factored in.

T1  - Disabled people and disaster management in New Zealand: examining online media messages
AN  - 2212029608
AB  - This article explores how disability and disabled people were portrayed in New Zealand online media between 2006 and 2016, with specific reference to disasters. Following a process of content analysis, the findings indicated that post disaster, persistent advocacy was required and ensuring accessibility, immediately following a disaster as well as in the recovery phase, was a significant issue. Disabled people were also primarily presented as a vulnerable cohort and the wide-ranging issues highlighted in the media suggest they currently have minimal voice in the four disaster management stages of risk reduction, readiness, response and recovery. This article emphasises the utilisation of relationships, skills and knowledge between individuals and Disabled People's Organisations to strengthen the disability and disaster management discourse and activity. Increased inclusion of disabled people across all phases of disaster management will assist with the New Zealand government meeting its aspiration of a non-disabling society, especially during future disaster events.

T1  - Health care equity and access for marginalised young people: a longitudinal qualitative study exploring health system navigation in Australia
AN  - 2193663507
AB  - Background 
Young people have unique social, emotional and developmental needs that require a welcoming and responsive health system, and policies that support their access to health care. Those who are socially or culturally marginalised may face additional challenges in navigating health care, contributing to health inequity. The aim of this study was to understand health system navigation, including the role of technology, for young people belonging to one or more marginalised groups, in order to inform youth health policy in New South Wales, Australia.
 Methods 
This qualitative longitudinal study involved 2–4 interviews each over 6 to 12 months with marginalised young people aged 12–24 years living in NSW. The analysis used Nvivo software and grounded theory.
 Results 
We interviewed 41 young people at baseline who were living in rural or remote areas, sexuality and/or gender diverse, refugee, homeless, and/or Aboriginal. A retention rate of over 85% was achieved. Nineteen belonged to more than one marginalised group allowing an exploration of intersectionality. General practitioners (family physicians) were the most commonly accessed service throughout the study period.
Participants were ambivalent about their healthcare journeys. Qualitative analysis identified five themes:
1.  1.
Technology brings opportunities to understand, connect and engage with services
2.  2.
Healthcare journeys are shaped by decisions weighing up convenience, engagement, effectiveness and affordability.
3.  3.
Marginalised young people perceive and experience multiple forms of discrimination leading to forgone care.
4.  4.
Multiple marginalisation makes health system navigation more challenging
5.  5.
The impact of health system complexity and fragmentation may be mitigated by system knowledge and navigation support
 Conclusions 
The compounding effects of multiple discrimination and access barriers were experienced more strongly for young people belonging to mutiple marginalised groups. We identify several areas for improving clinical practice and policy. Integrating technology and social media into processes that facilitate access and navigation, providing respectful and welcoming services that recognise diversity, improving health literacy and involving professionals in advocacy and navigation support may help to address these issues.

T1  - Brief Textual Indicators of Political Orientation
AN  - 2154457092
AB  - Language reflects one’s thoughts, feelings, and worldview. Technology has led to a proliferation of brief communications. Is this brief text meaningful? We examine whether text from brief political and nonpolitical communications reflect political ideology. Student responses to their ideological foundations (Study 1), brief snippets of unanimous Supreme Court verdicts (Study 2), and celebrity tweets (Study 3) were textually analyzed to examine whether they contained perceived threat and resistance to change content and whether this predicted the authors’ political affiliation. Across three studies, words related to resistance to change, but not perceived threat, were related to political ideology such that conservatives were more likely to include resistance-to-change-related words in their responses compared with liberals. These results suggest that brief text, even when not overtly political, reflects one’s political ideology. The increase in brief text production via new technology and its ability to predict political ideology make these findings particularly meaningful.

T1  - Identifying Challenges: Minority Identity Formation and Media Cultural Isolation in India
AN  - 2162427844
AB  - 'Secular' India has around 79.8% of the population of Indians practicing Hinduism and 14.2% adheres to Islam, while the remaining 6% adheres to other religions (Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, Jainism and various indigenous ethnically-bound faiths). The minority population has always tried to maintain amiable relationship by sharing their culture and history with all other communities. This is apparent through the fact that Indian films based on the largest minority background have always remained extremely popular among viewers and has been treated as one of the leading parameters of cultural and sociological expression throughout the world. It is not difficult to imagine and experience the effects of films in various aspects of societies - cultural, sociological, psychic and political. The Hindi mainstream cinema undoubtedly has a tremendous influence on Indian psychology. Literature behind the history of Indian cinema can be traced back from the 1920s when the era had seen the colonial rule. On top of this, observers claimed that during this period the Hindi film was a melting pot of cultures and Indian 'secularism'. Hindi cinema is neither politically innocent nor conveys an unequivocal secularism. It has many times predicated the politics of inequality and escapism. 'Minority' in India have faced marginalization and discrimination since postcolonial foundation. The situation in India can thus function as an example for the West, as the effects of the war on terror may replicate the transformations Indian 'Minority' go through elsewhere. Despite the nation's proud self-identification as secular and democratic, 'Minority' who defied partition and remained in India are tacitly considered second-class citizens and their loyalty is always questioned.

T1  - It Runs in the Family
AN  - 2129849685
AB  - What motivates citizens to run for office? Recent work has shown that early life parental socialization is strongly associated with a desire to run for office. However, parents not only shape their children’s political environment, they also pass along their genes to those same children. A growing area of research has shown that individual differences in a wide range of political behaviors and attitudes are linked to genetic differences. As a result, genetic factors may confound the observed political similarities among parents and their children. This study analyzes Swedish register data containing information on all nominated and elected candidates in the ten parliamentary, county council, and municipal elections from 1982 to 2014 for a large sample of adoptees and their adoptive and biological parents. By studying the similarity in political ambition within both adoptive and biological families, our research design allows us to disentangle so-called “pre-birth” factors, such as genes and pre-natal environment, and “post-birth” factors like parental socialization. We find that the likelihood of standing as a political candidate is twice as high if one’s parent has been a candidate. We also find that the effects of pre-birth and post-birth factors are approximately equal in size. In addition, we test a number of potential pre- and post-birth transmission mechanisms. First, disconfirming our expectations, the pre-birth effects do not seem to be mediated by cognitive ability or leadership skills. Second, consistent with a role modeling mechanism, we find evidence of a strong transmission in candidacy status between rearing mothers and their daughters.

T1  - Reimagining publics and (non) participation: Exploring exclusion from science communication through the experiences of low-income, minority ethnic groups
AN  - 2111036139
AB  - This article explores science communication from the perspective of those most at risk of exclusion, drawing on ethnographic fieldwork. I conducted five focus groups and 32 interviews with participants from low-income, minority ethnic backgrounds. Using theories of social reproduction and social justice, I argue that participation in science communication is marked by structural inequalities (particularly ethnicity and class) in two ways. First, participants’ involvement in science communication practices was narrow (limited to science media consumption). Second, their experiences of exclusion centred on cultural imperialism (misrepresentation and ‘Othering’) and powerlessness (being unable to participate or change the terms of their participation). I argue that social reproduction in science communication constructs a narrow public that reflects the shape, values and practices of dominant groups, at the expense of the marginalised. The article contributes to how we might reimagine science communication’s publics by taking inclusion/exclusion and the effects of structural inequalities into account.

T1  - The politics of the untranslated: an affective-discursive approach to Somali pirates in A Hijacking
AN  - 2092925775
AB  - Adopting an Affective-Discursive approach, this article explores the visual and textual representations of Somali Pirates in the Danish Film A Hijacking, which is based on true events. I argue that the lack of subtitles for exchanges in the Somali language, camera treatment of the pirates, and the juxtaposition between sound and editing techniques used to capture the pirate and the western crew, have resulted in a screen production that not only masks the complexities of the piracy enterprise but also marginalizes Somali pirates and their truths, portraying them as little better than savages. This irreducibility between image and text will also be a key point of departure for examining the figure of the pirate as an affective/abjective/monstrous construction, rather than simply a discursive/textual one.

T1  - Brainwashing paranoia and lay media theories in China: the phenomenological dimension of media use (and the self) in digital environments
AN  - 2082932799
AB  - Drawing on the phenomenological tradition, this article focuses on the ‘lay media theories’ that ordinary people rely on to orient their media use. Existing scholarship on certain perceptions users hold about media and their behavioral consequences tends to assume that these perceptions by default rest on a sense of self that is pre-existing and immune to media. My empirical research troubles this theoretical assumption. Analyzing interviews and ethnography in China, I investigate the media practices of certain individuals under the influence of ‘brainwashing paranoia’. Through their engagements with the information abundance on the Chinese Internet, these individuals had, over time, revamped rather than enhanced their established political beliefs. I argue that in today’s high-choice environments, users’ lay media theories, especially their conceptions about media in relation to the self, should be taken into account as one major sociocultural factor that moderates or mediates the age-old tendency for selective exposure.

T1  - Portugal’s Immigration and Integration Policies: a Case Apart?
AN  - 2034503698
AB  - Most countries in Europe have seen the rise of anti-immigrant political parties in recent years and many have implemented more restrictive immigration measures. Portugal has moved in the opposite direction, seeking to produce some of the best practices and laws on immigration and immigrant integration. Traditional theories of immigration policy fail to account for the Portuguese case, and regional models of immigration overlook ways in which Portugal diverges. Instead, Portuguese policies are best understood as the product of (1) a political consensus on immigration that derives in part from Portugal’s social-revolutionary democratic transition; (2) innovative institutions that enjoy both autonomy and political support, enable a “whole-of-government” approach, and mediate social pressures created by immigration; and (3) leadership choices made by politicians, bureaucrats, and civil society groups to forge consensus and seek inclusion. The Portuguese case signals the importance of adopting other lenses for the comparative study of immigration policies that go beyond regional models and highlight policy similarities among countries from distinct regions.

T1  - Religion and Mental Health among Central Asian Muslim Immigrants in Chicago Metropolitan Area
AN  - 2148529923
AB  - Migration creates opportunities but also bring challenges that cause stress and affect mental health of migrants. Stress among Muslim immigrants can be intensified by experiences of discrimination. This study addressed the meaning and role of religion as a mediator of stress and mental health among Central Asian Muslim immigrants. This paper explored whether religious coping worked for recent Muslim immigrants in the US, and how religion buffered migration and discrimination-related stress that negatively affected mental health of Central Asian immigrants. Drawing from different types of ethnographic and biological data, collected in Chicago Metropolitan Area, this study explored culturally embedded stress responses, and tested the religious coping framework upon experiences of a new minority group of Muslim immigrants in the US, expanding our knowledge on factors that inform health outcomes of immigrant population.

T1  - Connecting in the Twitterverse: Using Twitter to satisfy unmet belonging needs
AN  - 2041718573
AB  - The current study explored how social media can satisfy unmet needs for belonging. We predicted that, of those who experience chronic ostracism (feeling excluded and ignored frequently), people high in need to belong would utilize Twitter to satisfy their unmet belonging needs more than those low in need to belong. Specifically, individuals high in need to belong and chronic ostracism should use Twitter to form and maintain parasocial relationships (one-sided relationships with media figures). Participants (n = 315) completed a survey assessing their chronic ostracism experiences, dispositional need to belong, and Twitter behavior, particularly regarding potential parasocial relationship targets (n = 229). As expected, when participants reported experiencing high rates of chronic ostracism, participants high in need to belong used Twitter more than those low in need to belong, particularly following more parasocial relationship targets. Thus, maintaining parasocial relationships on Twitter may be an effective way to satisfy unmet belonging needs.

T1  - Ikebukuro in-between: mobility and the formation of the Yamanote's heterotopic borderland
AN  - 2332076885
AB  - Ikebukuro, one of the major stations along the Yamanote line, is ambiguously placed in Tokyo, both spatially and discursively. Serving as a black-market in the immediate post-1945 era, and situated as a major hub leading to Tokyo's Northwestern suburban sprawl today, its position as an in-between space is mirrored in its image as a site of excessive consumption and play. This position has also meant it has become home to many marginalised groups and consumption practices in Tokyo. This article demonstrates the ways that thinking from the Yamanote inspires thinking about mobility, heterotopia and the interstices they create. Specifically, it explores the different forms of mobility, from transportation, to people and media, which have produced Ikebukuro's place as a borderland. Understanding these mobilities as historically cumulative, it shows how the Yamanote in many ways made Ikebukuro, and how in turn Ikebukuro exemplifies the heterotopic nature of Tokyo more generally. Today, Ikebukuro is one of the largest sites of social activity among recent Chinese migrants in Japan, with its Northwestern area unofficially referred to as Tokyo Chinatown by some. At the same time, it is home to many other migrant groups and constitutes the second largest adult entertainment district in Tokyo. It attracts waves of consumers on their way home to neighbourhoods in Saitama, and is only second to Akihabara as a space that 'rotten girls' and 'otaku' frequent. These practices and groups are also reflected upon in popular culture, where Ikebukuro is portrayed as a site of danger and excitement. Through these analyses, the importance of heterotopias to marginalised groups in Japan is explored, as well as the crucial role the Yamanote plays in making heterotopias possible.

T1  - Film literacy in secondary schools across Europe: A comparison of five countries’ responses to an educational project on cinema
AN  - 2087922686
AB  - We present the results of an exploratory study framed within a large film literacy project carried out simultaneously in five European Union countries (Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom). The study looks at students’ responses to an educational project on cinema designed to be implemented regionally for five months in high schools to increase film literacy and to favour more positive attitudes towards European cinema. The results show that students’ film preferences remain stable after the programme and vary only slightly. Major changes occur in their knowledge about film production and expression. The aspects that change the least are their conceptions about cinema and their preferences. Moreover, the student attitudes towards national and European cinema are more positive. However, the results also show that the implementation of a film literacy programme at a cross-cultural level can affect different aspects depending on the cultural context (country) in which it occurs. Indeed, they provide data about the specific impact of the programme in each country. The information offered by this study could enhance film literacy programmes, inform theory, and nurture the debates about the common European identity and the particular traits of the diverse cultures of the European Union.

T1  - Racial (vs. self) affirmation as a protective mechanism against the effects of racial exclusion on negative affect and substance use vulnerability among black young adults
AN  - 2015520560
AB  - Affirming one’s racial identity may help protect against the harmful effects of racial exclusion on substance use cognitions. This study examined whether racial versus self-affirmation (vs. no affirmation) buffers against the effects of racial exclusion on substance use willingness and substance use word associations in Black young adults. It also examined anger as a potential mediator of these effects. After being included, or racially excluded by White peers, participants were assigned to a writing task: self-affirmation, racial-affirmation, or describing their sleep routine (neutral). Racial exclusion predicted greater perceived discrimination and anger. Excluded participants who engaged in racial-affirmation reported reduced perceived discrimination, anger, and fewer substance use cognitions compared to the neutral writing group. This relation between racial-affirmation and lower substance use willingness was mediated by reduced perceived discrimination and anger. Findings suggest racial-affirmation is protective against racial exclusion and, more generally, that ethnic based approaches to minority substance use prevention may have particular potential.

T1  - Fighting ageism through nostalgia
AN  - 2011520343
AB  - Two experiments tested whether nostalgia is a resource for fighting ageism. In Experiment 1, younger adults who recalled a nostalgic (vs. ordinary) encounter with an older adult showed a more positive attitude towards older adults, mediated by greater inclusion of older adults in the self (IOGS). In Experiment 2, these findings were replicated and extended with a subtle nostalgia manipulation. Younger adults identified an older, familiar adult, before writing about an encounter with this person that was characterized by either central (e.g., keepsakes and childhood) or peripheral (e.g., wishing and daydreaming) features of the construct of nostalgia (i.e., prototype). Participants who recalled a central (vs. peripheral) nostalgic encounter reported greater social connectedness, which predicted increased IOGS. In turn, increased IOGS was associated with a lower desire to avoid older adults. Several alternative explanations for the intergroup benefits of nostalgia were ruled out. The research established that nostalgia qualifies as a resource for combatting ageism.

T1  - Bringing Grievances Back In
AN  - 2132696235
AB  - Over the past 10 to 15 years a pertinent critique has been formulated against the dominant framing of violent conflict in Muslim Mindanao as a mere struggle for autonomy or independence by a Muslim minority against the Philippine nation-state. This critique demonstrates how a wide range of coercive organizations compete over gaining access to rents, and how this competition is the main source of violent incidents. Furthermore, it is discussed how this violent competition over rent access has a clear subnational, intra-Muslim character. This article argues that, despite its obvious merits, this literature has come to overestimate the greed-related features of contemporary conflict in Muslim Mindanao and the coercive qualities in the build-up of political authority in the region. As an alternative, we wish to bring grievances and ideology back in, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of conflict and politics in the region. This will be done by illustrating how the spread of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (<sc>MILF</sc>) as a legitimate and morally just alternative against injustices and inequalities within Muslim society has been crucial to the organization’s extraordinary growth in recent decades.

T1  - In-Group and Out-Group in Russian Political Cartoons: Research of the Latent Meanings of Narrative Conflict between Russia and the West: Politicheskie Issledovanii︠a︡
AN  - 2099450135
AB  - The article examines the invariant contents of Russian political cartoons, the representation of actual political processes in it and, most significantly, the implicit or masked aspects of sociopolitical life identified via content analysis of the caricature image. The author claims that the virtualization of politics has given humor an additional significance for contemporary political discourse. Despite the emergence of new genres, professional cartoons in the media are still the static-visual humor direction most in demand. Plots of political cartoons as well as of political humor in general often reflect conflict episodes of the relationship between in-group (for the artist and audience) and out-group. This is also true for the Russian cartoons, given the relatively high importance of state, cultural and national identity for Russian collective identity. As shown by the comparative-historical analysis, the representation of conflicts between Russians as in-group and the West / representatives of Western societies as out-group is typical for Russian cartoons. The profound meanings of the reflection of Russian cartoonists over this antagonism and the dynamics of the concentration on it are studied by the method of content analysis. This study revealed that since the “perestroika” time the interest to represent Western political actors in cartoons has decreased – the domestic events and processes became a priority. The attractiveness of the in-group representation declines over time, which indicates a more critical attitude to the Russian internal problems. With a greater overall attractiveness of Russian in-group, it is important to note that, as a result of content analysis, out-group representatives are shown as more impressive and presentable. The transfer of the in-group and the out-group antagonism from the foreign policy field to the internal policy field which is characteristic of the last decades, coupled with the polar ideological orientation of contemporary Russian cartoonists (including the attitude toward the West), indicates a low consolidation of Russian society.

T1  - Post-Communism in Institutional, Ideological and Communicative Dimensions: Critical Notes. Part II: Politicheskie Issledovanii︠a︡
AN  - 2096656682
AB  - The second part of the article is devoted to the question of the role played by political communication and the mass media in the development of social processes in the Central and Eastern Europe. The study of paradoxical properties of the phenomenon of post-communism has become one of the most important incentives for the turn of the humanities in the direction of analyzing the specifics of the new communicative and rhetorical properties of political texts in the structure of ideological discourses both in Europe and outside it. The specific nature of post-communist social communication when ideological labels are often meaningless and exchangeable, and citizens remain unengaged in the political process, increased the role of manipulative factors realized through the media. This tendency initially manifested itself in various “mediocratic” projects and utopias based on the desire of politicized intellectuals to form a “new political language” and thereby strengthen their positions in political discourse, ultimately winning the legitimate right to power. The rapid evolution of the post-communist political discourse from “liberal humanism” and “universal values” to reactionary myth-making, nationalist rhetoric and xenophobia, clearly demonstrates that one of the main sources of constant ideological transformations in the public consciousness is the extremely contradictory political ideas and attitudes of intellectuals rushing into power already at the initial stage of reforms. At the same time, crisis situations, the growth of traditionalist nationalism indicate that pathological tendencies and changes in the structures of post-communist regimes have a systemic and global character.

T1  - Cultural stressors, identity development, and substance use attitudes among Hispanic immigrant adolescents
AN  - 1977210060
AB  - The goal of this investigation was to determine whether various cultural stressors (bicultural stress, perceived discrimination, and perceived negative context of reception [PNCR]) predict positive and negative substance use attitudes, directly and indirectly through personal identity, in a sample of immigrant Hispanic adolescents. Data on cultural stressors, substance use attitudes, and covariates were collected from 302 Hispanic immigrant adolescents (152 from Miami [61% Cuban] and 150 from Los Angeles [70% Mexican]) at 3 time points. PNCR was associated with identity confusion ([beta] = .175, p = .033). Identity confusion significantly predicted higher positive attitudes toward alcohol and other drug (AOD; [beta] = .216, p < .001) and cigarette use ([beta] = .191, p = .015) and mediated the relationship between PNCR with unfavorable AOD attitudes ([beta] = -.019, 95% confidence interval [CI] [- 0.052, - 0.001]) and favorable AOD attitudes ([beta] = 0.038, 95% CI [0.003, 0.086]). Perceptions of a negative context of reception may hinder successful personal identity formation and impact health outcomes for immigrant youth.

AN  - 2013947257
AB  - The mass arrivals of political and economic migrants in Slovenia started when Hungary closed its border with Croatia. In this article, we analyze the reactions of parliamentary parties in Slovenia, focusing on the media statements of their leaders and members on the significant events since the beginning of mass arrivals of migrants to date: first arrivals of migrants to Slovenia, erection of fences on Slovenian-Croatian border, November 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, protests against accommodation of minor migrants unaccompanied by adults in Student dorm in Kranj, proposal for consultative referendum on the acceptance of migrants in Slovenia and Act on amendments to the Aliens Act. We point out some of the most defining statements to show the political opinions of individual parties and compare the responses of these parties in the light of the political division between left-wing and right-wing politics as well as political division based on the urban-rural cleavage.Alternate abstract:Masovni prihodi političnih in ekonomskih migrantov v Slovenijo so se začeli, ko je Madžarska zaprla svojo mejo s Hrvaško. V tem članku avtorja analizirava reakcije parlamentarnih strank v Republiki Sloveniji s poudarkom na medijskih izjavah njihovih voditeljev in članov o pomembnih dogodkih od začetka množičnih prihodov migrantov do danes: prvi prihodi migrantov v Slovenijo, postavitev ograj na slovensko-hrvaški meji, pariški teroristični napadi novembra 2015, protesti proti nastanitvi mladoletnih migrantov brez spremstva odraslih v dijaškem domu v Kranju, predlog posvetovalnega referenduma o nastanitvi migrantov v Republiki Sloveniji in Zakon o spremembah in dopolnitvah Zakona o tujcih. Izpostavljava nekatere najbolj odmevne izjave, ki odražajo politična stališča posameznih strank, in primerjava odzive teh strank glede na levo in desno politično usmeritev ter tudi glede na politično delitev, osnovano na razlikah med urbanim in ruralnim.

T1  - Clinical implications from research exploring parent and family perspectives of the August 2011 London riots
AN  - 2296176179
AB  - Political rhetoric and media reports following the August 2011 London riots in the UK drew attention to poor parenting to explain the cause of the riots, thus, a parent‐blaming discourse emerged. This article presents findings from a PhD thesis about how London parents and families constructed the riots and relevant clinical implications. A separate paper focuses on the method and findings from the PhD thesis with an aim to include parent and family perspectives on the riots in the academic literature. A Foucauldian‐informed thematic analysis indicated that social exclusion, gentrification, criminality, parenting, morality and neighbourhood were relevant to the 2011 London riots from interviews with parents and families. This article aims to support clinical work with parents and families, especially as clinicians were positioned as useful in supporting such groups, through the Troubled Families Programme following the London riots. Clinical implications were developed from themes about socio‐political issues and parent‐blaming discourses and the notion of positioning, as influenced by the Foucauldian‐informed analysis adopted.Practitioner pointsConsider the relevance of socio‐political issues and parent‐blaming discourses to the August 2011 London riots.Use ‘social context’ questions to explore socio‐political issues when conducting therapy.Use ‘parenting expectations’ questions to explore possible parent‐blaming discourses when conducting therapy.Consider the ways in which clients may be positioned within their relationships.Alternate abstract:抽象研究关于2011年8月伦敦暴乱事件的家长和家庭视角的临床应用意义2011年8月, 英国伦敦发生暴乱之后, 政治言论和媒体报道都将关注点聚焦于不良的家庭教育, 以此解释暴乱的发生。因此, 一种声讨家长的言论出现了。本文呈现了一篇关于伦敦家长和家庭对暴乱理解的博士论文的研究结果, 以及它的临床应用意义。另一篇文章则聚焦于该博士论文的研究方法和研究结果, 目的是在在学术文献中纳入家长和家庭关于暴乱的视角。通过福柯式的主题分析方法分析了与家长和家庭的访谈, 结果显示, 社会排斥、地区贵族化、犯罪活动、家庭教育、道德状况和社区这些因素与2011年伦敦暴乱相关。本文的目的是支持针对家长和家庭开展的临床工作, 尤其是像暴乱之后的“困难家庭项目”一样将临床医师置于支持这些群体的立场之上。在福柯式分析的影响下, 本文讨论了关于社会政治话题、声讨家长的言论和确定立场等主题的临床应用意义。对实务工作者的启示思考社会政治话题和声讨家长的言论与2011年8月伦敦暴乱的相关性。在开展治疗时, 使用 “社会环境” 问题来探索社会政治话题。开展治疗时, 使用 “家长期望” 问题来探索可能的声讨家长的言论。思考来访者在其家庭关系中的可能立场位置。Alternate abstract:AbstractoImplicaciones clínicas de la investigación que explora las perspectivas de los padres y las familias sobre los disturbios de agosto de 2011 en LondresLa retórica política y los informes de los medios después de los disturbios de Londres de agosto de 2011 en el Reino Unido llamaron la atención sobre la parentalidad deficiente para explicar la causa de los disturbios, por lo que surgió un discurso que culpa a los padres. Este artículo presenta los resultados de una tesis doctoral sobre cómo los padres y las familias de Londres interpretaron los disturbios y las implicaciones clínicas relevantes. En un trabajo separado se describe el método y los resultados de la tesis doctoral con el objetivo de incluir las perspectivas de los padres y la familia sobre los disturbios en la literatura académica. Un análisis temático Foucaultiano indicó que la exclusión social, la gentrificación, la criminalidad, la crianza de los hijos, la moralidad y el vecindario eran relevantes para los disturbios de Londres de 2011 a partir de entrevistas con padres y familias. Este artículo tiene como objetivo apoyar el trabajo clínico con los padres y las familias, especialmente como los clínicos se posicionaron como útiles en el apoyo a estos grupos, a través del programa denominado Troubled Families Programme, después de los disturbios de Londres. Las implicaciones clínicas se desarrollaron a partir de temas sobre debates sociopolíticos y discursos de culpabilidad de padres y la noción de posicionamiento, influenciada por el análisis basado en el enfoque de Foucault.Puntos de implicación práctica:Considerar la importancia de las cuestiones sociopolíticas y los discursos que culpan a los padres en relación con los disturbios de Londres de agosto de 2011.Utilice preguntas de “contexto social” para explorar cuestiones sociopolíticas al realizar la terapia.Utilice preguntas sobre las “expectativas de los padres” para explorar posibles discursos de culpabilidad de los padres al realizar la terapia.Considerar las diferentes maneras en que los clientes pueden ser posicionados dentro de sus relaciones.

T1  - Shooting the Isolation and Marginality of Masculinities in Iranian Cinema
AN  - 1938641614
AB  - This article examines the isolation and marginality of Iranian men living in contemporary Iran with a focus on three post-2005 films. As a patriarchal society, Iran has been the subject of many studies on the subjugation and marginality of women. This study demonstrates how recent Iranian films have skillfully employed the cinematic language to narrate men's stories of alienation and despair. These filmic constructions provide a valuable and complex insight into masculine identities, challenging perceptions of the essentialized image of the Middle Eastern male. By employing Connell's hierarchy of masculinities, the article demonstrates the position of marginalized men in relation to the dominant ideals of masculinity and the influence of these discourses on the lives of such men. The films discussed here do not perpetuate the construction of the 'true' gender, but instead challenge ideas of heroism, manliness and patriarchy.

T1  - Navigating Spaces: Moving Along the (Dis)enfranchisement Spectrum through a High School GSA
AN  - 1965551604
AB  - This paper identifies the components needed for new organizations to create programs that support inclusivity and enfranchisement by working within pre-existing power structures. The researcher considers how to bring to bear the resources of those already in positions of power to provide a voice for those without a means of advocating for themselves. While this paper seeks to provide a model for success across multiple modalities, the research focuses on enfranchisement within educational contexts through the development of a high school GSA (Gay-Straight Alliance). Seen through this lens, the researcher has identified four key elements necessary for progress towards enfranchisement. [Article copies available for a fee from The Transformative Studies Institute.

T1  - We're all transnational now: sport in dynamic sociocultural environments
AN  - 1947105010
AB  - Sport has a deep, enduring attachment to nation as spatial anchor, governmental principle and romantic ideal while being simultaneously implicated in processes that strain, challenge and disrupt the sport-nation nexus. Sport institutions, practices and tastes move into new territories and, correspondingly, people relocate to national spaces where they must negotiate the terms of an established sporting-societal order in the context of a global 'media sports cultural complex'. Sport, therefore, is compulsively transnational, unevenly global, and reflexively national in character by means of multi-dimensional, dynamic interplay. This article focuses on how the lives of ethnically diverse, urban and mobile human subjects in Australia are interwoven with sport in ways that illuminate its capacity symbolically to bind and separate citizens/residents to extant national formations. In addressing sport's role in social inclusion/exclusion and cultural citizenship in demographically diverse societies, the article explores its positioning at the intersection of national symbols and material processes.

T1  - Institutional apologies and socio‐emotional climate in the South American context
AN  - 2008938123
AB  - This study examined perceptions of institutional apologies related to past political violence and socio‐emotional climate among victims and non‐victims in Argentina (n = 518), Chile (n = 1,278), and Paraguay (n = 1,172) based on quasi‐representative samples. The perceptions of apology as sincere and efficient in improving intergroup relations were associated with a positive socio‐emotional climate across the three nations. Victims evaluated apologies more positively and perceived a more positive socio‐emotional climate compared to non‐victims in Paraguay and Argentina, whereas the opposite was true in Chile where the government opposed the victims’ leftist political orientation. The evaluations of apologies also mediated the effects of exposure to violence on the perception of socio‐emotional climate, but these effects were moderated by the context. Together, these findings suggest that apologies reinforce positive sociopolitical climate, and that, personal experience of victimization is an important factor determining these effects.

T1  - Resilience mediated the association between acculturation and psychological growth in college students from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, China
AN  - 2009340372
AB  - Background: The number of Hong Kong citizens living in mainland China is increasing. The process of acculturation may create opportunities for psychological growth.Aims: This study aimed at examining whether resilience mediated the effects of acculturation on psychological growth in college students from Hong Kong to Guangzhou.Method: In this cross-sectional survey, 164 college students in Guangzhou who were Hong Kong permanent residents (female: 46%, age: 21.09 ± 1.50) joined the study.Results: The integration group reported more psychological growth than the assimilation, separation, and marginalization groups. Resilience partially mediated the effect of integration on psychological growth and fully mediated the effect of marginalization on psychological growth.Conclusions: Resilience represents one of the mechanisms to explain beneficial effects of integration on psychological growth in college students from Hong Kong to Guangzhou. Theoretical considerations to rethink the acculturation model, implications for developing intervention programs, and recommendations for future research are discussed.

Building on these insights, through an analysis of 123 content analyses published in Political Communication between 2003-2016, we demonstrate gaps in our field and argue that scholarship can grow analytically and empirically by accounting for the findings of these books. We conclude with suggestions for future research into people's perceptions of identity, group status, deprivation, and political power, as well as the role of media, political actors, and social groups in creating these narratives of American politics.

T1  - Introduction: Vulnerability and Social Justice
AN  - 1905639864
AB  - At the same time as failures to adequately protect 'the most vulnerable' seem to have become a pervasive feature of the political landscape, policies which seek to address vulnerability have proliferated. Government actors, public officers, researchers, media commentators, charities and members of the public alike use vulnerability to articulate an array of personal and political troubles, yet alongside this seemingly shared narrative a multitude of ideologically inclined assumptions and agendas operate by stealth. How vulnerability is drawn upon to frame social issues reworks and reconfigures long-running contestations related to moral dimensions of the welfare subject, understandings of the 'self' and wider beliefs about human behaviour. At a time when the pressures of contemporary life increasingly find release through aggression against the socially marginalised (see Wacquant, 2009; Harrison and Sanders, 2014; Atkinson, 2015), vulnerability has become a key concept for social policy research. As I have argued elsewhere, the concept of vulnerability appears to be something of a zeitgeist or 'spirit of the time' (Brown, 2014a, 2014b,2015), extending into and shaping responses to a vast array of policy matters.

T1  - Marginalisation, Communication and Media Life: An Explorative Study of Santal Community in India
AN  - 1936202299
AB  - In the era of globalisation, the production and consumption of media and communication varies from individual to individual as well as group to group. Some groups live with a highly technocratic media life, some groups still live with a traditional media life. Nevertheless, it is assumed that media life has affected irrespective of social groups in every parts of the world, though the divide between the information rich and the information poor has grown exponentially. Thus, the process of social development among different social and marginalised communities in India differs according to the nature of consumption of mediated information and communication. This paper seeks to analyze media life in the context of access and consumption to modern mass media and as well as the cultural life of Santal. What are these symbiotic relations between the media life and marginalisation among Santal community? Study suggests that due to the globalisation and the intervention of state's policy, both form of media life emerged and prevalent in Santal villages where it has substantially occupied and captured the everyday life. It also creates new form of communication, information and knowledge in Santal society. Thus, the symbiotic relation between media life and marginalisation among Santals has narrowed down to some extent. Thus, the study implicates to highlight the different aspects of marginalisation among Santal tribal community and explored their mediated life as well.

T1  - Beyond Acceptance: Serving the Needs of Transgender Students at Women’s Colleges
AN  - 2116061047
AB  - The inclusion of transgender students in women’s colleges has been widely debated on campuses and in the media. Despite some opposition, transgender students at women’s colleges are growing in number and visibility. This study examines the ways that transgender students’ experiences differ from the experiences of cisgender students in both single-sex and co-educational environments. Conclusions are based on assessments of support, reported attitudes towards transgender students, and reported knowledge about transgender history and social issues using responses to a survey completed by 184 students at a variety of colleges and universities. The study found significant differences between women’s colleges and co-educational universities such that women’s colleges were rated as more supportive for all students and students at women’s colleges reported significantly more positive attitudes towards transgender students. Additionally, transgender students at women’s colleges reported more positive overall experiences of college, as compared to transgender students at co-educational colleges. Given that the sample was majority white, cisgender, women’s college students, the measures used should be replicated in order to determine the generalizability of these results.

T1  - A Network of One's Own: Young Women and the Creation of Youth-only Transnational Feminist Spaces
AN  - 1923950521
AB  - In the last decade, young people have been at the fore of spectacular global protests, from revolutions across North Africa to the Occupy Wall Street movements spreading across Europe and North America. Youth involvement in these protests has interested major media and the scholarly community, but few have thoroughly interrogated young women's distinct formations of transnational, youth-only feminist networks. This study, which employed qualitative methods influenced by grounded theory, offers insight into the motivations and operations of five young women's transnational feminist networks (TFNs). Key findings include young feminists' articulations of encountering marginalization, both age and gender based, in existing and established networks, and creating 'youth-only' feminist networks in response. Coalescing around these experiences of marginalization, young women perceive their networks to constitute a 'counter-public sphere' through which they can engage in praxis-oriented discourses, and to constitute a space in which to experiment with and deliberate new or alternative movement repertoires.

T1  - Nostalgia in response to group-based exclusion: The role of attachment-related avoidance
AN  - 1928613391
AB  - We proposed that nostalgia, by virtue of its sociality, can be an indirect strategy to counteract relational deficiencies stemming from group-based exclusion. We instructed Greek participants to recall an event in which they experienced exclusion on the basis of their nationality versus a control event. We anticipated that participants would react to group-based exclusion with increased nostalgia. Specifically, because low attachment-related avoidance facilitates proximity-seeking in response to distress, we hypothesized that group-based exclusion would increase nostalgia (a form of proximity-seeking) more strongly when avoidance is low. Results supported this moderation hypothesis. In turn, increased nostalgia in response to group-based exclusion predicted stronger ingroup identification. For low-avoidants, then, group-based exclusion fortified ingroup identification via increased nostalgia (moderated mediation).

T1  - Separated Same-Sex Parents’ Experiences and Views of Services and Service Providers
AN  - 2647680609
AB  - Same-sex parents are compelled to be more reflective, to plan, and to negotiate their contact with mainstream service providers and professionals in an effort to find those whom they feel comfortable with disclosing their sexuality and/or to find a service provider who would adequately understand their unique needs. This paper presents findings from an Australian qualitative study of separated same-sex parents and explores their experiences with professionals and service providers during and after their separation. As a consequence of their separation, same-sex parents encountered new service providers with whom they had to navigate relationships with; this paper will focus on their experiences with the legal profession, mediation services, counseling, and mental health services. Findings demonstrated ongoing challenges for parents in finding service providers who they believed could meet and/or understand their specific needs. Heteronormativitiy, whether experienced or perceived, often created an added layer of marginalization for same-sex parents as they navigated the already difficult terrain of separation. Consequently, some parents did not access service providers and missed out on the help that they needed during their separation. Those that did visit professionals and service providers reported mixed experiences, with some participants describing encounters fraught with difficulty, while for others, their experiences were much better than they had anticipated. While some participants had a preference for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex (LGBTI) specific service providers, some discovered a lack of understanding among LGBTI providers towards separating parents or non-biological mothers. This study highlights the need for better education and training for separation related service providers, both mainstream and LGBTI, and the need for more research exploring separation experiences of same-sex parented families.
 Key Take Away Points  
 Separated same-sex parents have ongoing challenges finding service providers who they believed can meet and/or understand their specific needs.   Heteronormative services (experienced or perceived) can create an added layer of marginalization for same-sex parents as they navigated the already difficult terrain of separation.   Parents may not access service providers due to negative perceptions and miss out on the help that they needed during their separation.   LGBTI service providers may also lack understanding of separating same-sex parents.   There is a need for better education and training for separation related services - both mainstream and LGBTI providers

AB  - Objective To understand the prevalence of bullying, by gender and educational level, in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, a city with high rates of violence and migration. Methods This was a cross-sectional, observational study conducted in 2012 – 2014 using a questionnaire known as the Bullying-Mexican. A probabilistic multistage cluster-sampling method obtained a study sample of 2 347 students (10 – 27 years of age) from the 400 000 enrolled in grade 5 – university level at the 611 public schools in Ciudad Juárez. Bullying prevalence and frequency (never, rarely, sometimes, often, every day) were analyzed with descriptive statistics. The statistical differences between males and females was assessed using a chi-square test; associations between frequency and academic level were determined by correspondence analysis and the Spearman Rho correlation. A multinomial logistic regression was performed to analyze whether gender and academic level acted independently in the frequency of bullying. Results Bullying prevalence was reported by 38% of females and 47% of males: ‘only victim’ represented 8.7%; ‘only aggressor,’ 13.2%; and ‘victim and aggressor,’ 21%. At higher levels of education, bullying prevalence declined; however, at the university, prevalence increased in the last semesters. Mockery and social exclusion were the two most dominant types of bullying, followed by beating, threats, and punishment. Conclusions The prevalence of bullying in Ciudad Juárez public schools is among the highest compared to other random studies and surveys. Bullying diminishes with age and educational level.Alternate abstract:Objetivo Comprender la prevalencia de intimidación o bullying, desglosada en función del sexo y el nivel de escolaridad, en Ciudad Juárez (México), ciudad con índices altos de violencia y migración. Métodos Este estudio transversal de observación se realizó entre el 2012 y el 2014 con el cuestionario mexicano sobre la intimidación (Bull-M). Tras aplicar el método probabilístico polietápico de muestreo por conglomerados, se obtuvo una muestra de 2 347 estudiantes (de 10 a 27 años) de los 400 000 matriculados entre el quinto grado y el nivel universitario en las 611 instituciones de educación pública de Ciudad Juárez. Se analizaron la prevalencia y la frecuencia de la intimidación (nunca, rara vez, a veces, a menudo, todos los días) mediante estadísticas descriptivas. Se evaluó la diferencia estadística entre los hombres y las mujeres con la prueba de la ji al cuadrado y se determinó la asociación entre la frecuencia y el nivel académico mediante el análisis de correspondencias y la correlación ro de Spearman (R). Se aplicó una regresión logística polinómica para analizar si el sexo y el nivel académico eran variables independientes respecto de la frecuencia de la intimidación. Resultados La intimidación tuvo una prevalencia del 38% en las mujeres y del 47% en los hombres: refirieron ser “solo víctimas” el 8,7%; “solo agresores” el 13,2%; y “víctimas y agresores” el 21%. La prevalencia de la intimidación disminuye a medida que aumenta el nivel de escolaridad, aunque se registró un incremento en los últimos semestres de la universidad. Los dos tipos más predominantes de intimidación son la burla y la exclusión social, a los que siguen la agresión física, la amenaza y el castigo. Conclusiones La prevalencia de intimidación en las instituciones de educación pública de Ciudad Juárez se encuentra entre las más altas cuando se la compara con otros estudios y encuestas de diseño aleatorizado. La intimidación disminuye a medida que avanza la edad y aumenta el nivel de escolaridad.Alternate abstract:Objetivo Compreender a prevalência de bullying, estratificada por gênero e escolaridade, em Ciudad Juárez, México, um município com altos índices de violência e migração. Métodos Estudo transversal observacional realizado em 2012-2014 usando o instrumento Bullying-Mexican. Utilizando um método probabilístico de amostragem multietápica por conglomerados, obteve-se uma amostra de 2 347 estudantes (10-27 anos de idade) do universo de 400 000 estudantes matriculados da 5ª série ao ensino superior nas 611 escolas públicas de Ciudad Juárez. A prevalência e frequência (nunca, raramente, às vezes, frequentemente, todos os dias) de bullying foram analisadas mediante estatísticas descritivas. A diferença estatística entre homens e mulheres foi avaliada através do teste qui-quadrado; associações entre frequência de bullying e escolaridade foram determinadas mediante análise de correspondência e coeficiente de correlação de Spearman (R). Foi realizada análise de regressão logística multinomial para determinar se gênero e escolaridade influenciaram independentemente a frequência de bullying. Resultados O bullying foi relatado por 38% das mulheres e 47% dos homens: 8,7% identificaram-se como “somente vítimas”, 13,2% como “somente agressor”, e 21% como “vítima e agressor”. Nos níveis mais altos de escolaridade, a prevalência de bullying foi menor; porém, no ensino superior, aumentou novamente nos últimos semestres. Assédio verbal e exclusão social foram os dois tipos mais comuns de bullying, seguidos de agressão física, ameaças e castigos. Conclusões A prevalência de bullying nas escolas públicas de Ciudad Juárez está entre as mais elevadas já relatadas em estudos randomizados e levantamentos. O bullying diminui conforme a idade e escolaridade aumentam.

AB  - This paper explores how undocumented migrants have struggled and dealt with the UK inner borders while living in London. Based on empirical findings collected in London and Minas Gerais, it shows how Brazilians tactically adapt themselves in temporary dwellings to escape from the harsh British immigration policies and the Home Office raids across London. This study particularly uses the concepts of inner borders, deportation and citizenship discussed by contemporary Border studies. Living in a multicultural city where identity controls are a social practice that permeates various daily activities, Brazilians have to constantly negotiate their existence through the inner borders of London without being denounced by their lack of visa.Alternate abstract:Este artigo explora como migrantes não documentados lidam com as fronteiras internas do Reino Unido enquanto vivem em Londres. Através de dados empíricos coletados em Londres e Minas Gerais, demonstramos como brasileiros taticamente adaptam suas vidas em moradias temporárias para escapar das políticas migratórias do Reino Unido e das blitzes migratórias do Home Office em domicílios. Este estudo vale-se, particularmente, dos conceitos de fronteiras internas, deportação e cidadania discutidos por estudos de fronteira contemporâneos. Almejando viver em uma cidade multicultural, onde os controles de identidade são uma prática social que permeia o cotidiano, migrantes não documentados têm de negociar constantemente sua existência através das fronteiras internas de Londres para não serem denunciados por seu status migratório irregular.

T1  - Correlates of Political Ideology Among U.S.-Born Mexican Americans
AN  - 1851016959
AB  - Latino Americans have to navigate involvement and identification with two cultural groups--their ethnic culture and the dominant American culture. Differences in cultural identifications have been found to correlate with political affiliation and attitudes toward acculturation. Using a sample of U.S.-born Mexican Americans, we examined several correlates of political ideology including the strength of identification with both Mexican and Anglo-American cultures, acculturation attitudes, and socioeconomic status (SES). Strength of Mexican identity, stronger integration acculturation attitudes, weaker assimilation attitudes, and lower SES were associated with holding a more liberal political ideology. Furthermore, we found that integration acculturation attitudes mediated and SES moderated the relationship between Mexican identification and political ideology. These findings suggest that political campaigns should be mindful of differences in cultural identifications and acculturation attitudes when addressing their Latino constituents.

T1  - Hailing Hitler with the Red Hand: The Link in Northern Ireland 1937-40
AN  - 1807164669
AB  - Loughlin's article assesses the activities of The Link, a British pro-Nazi organization promoting Anglo-German conciliation in Northern Ireland in the years leading up to the Second World War. It situates the Ulster branch of the movement within the context of the domestic politics of the region, the British state, Anglo-Irish relations and wider European developments. As a field of activity for The Link, Northern Ireland posed unique and complex problems. The regional branch's prospects for development were complicated, for instance, by how, for nationalists, the aggression of Nazi domestic and foreign policies was reflected in the Northern Ireland government's domestic policies, and also in the way in which Nazi policy towards religion alienated the region's Catholic and Protestant communities. Loughlin also illustrates how the government's approach towards the local Jewish community and Jewish refugees-in a region largely without the levels of antisemitism found in both British and southern Irish public opinion-was informed by a combination of sympathy and local political considerations. Perhaps most uniquely, he illuminates the singularity of the Ulster branch within The Link organization, especially the attitude of its chairman, Admiral Sir Barry Domvile, who regarded Northern Ireland as an obstacle to the establishment of an effective Anglo-Irish defence policy and wished to see the region united with Eire.

T1  - The Nouvelle Droite in Portugal: a new strategy for the radical right in the transition from authoritarianism to democracy
AN  - 1807164657
AB  - Marchi examines how the French Nouvelle Droite (ND) was introduced into Portugal at the end of the Salazarist regime and during the transition to democracy. The relevance of the Portuguese case lies in the fact that the early diffusion of the ND in Europe coincided with the profound crisis of the radical right in Portugal as it faced the liberalization of the authoritarian regime and repression during the revolutionary transition. For that reason the far right in Portugal, in comparative terms, can be seen to have been subject to historical constraints quite different from those in Spain and other Western European democracies. Marchi describes the groups on the Portuguese radical right, and certain figures who were inspired by the ND and disseminated its ideas in Portugal. His analysis of their main publications, their statements and the media campaign to promote the ND from the end of the 1960s to the beginning of the 1980s highlights the different reasons for and ways in which Portuguese radicals engaged and dealt with the ND. Marchi also looks at the reactions of the national right-wing milieu to the spread of ND ideas. As part of his paper's contribution to comparative studies on the transnational radical right, it also provides new evidence, derived from the Portuguese case, of the way in which one of the most important schools of right-wing thought at the end of the twentieth century has influenced extreme-right milieux all over Europe. In light of Tamir Bar-On's analysis of the ND's cultural and pan-European impact, the findings presented here confirm its transnational character while drawing on this and other cases from southern Europe to question the French movement's long-term effectiveness in reorienting the culture of the right-wing milieu.

T1  - The Meaning of Students' Personal Belief in a Just World for Positive and Negative Aspects of School-Specific Well-Being
AN  - 1774178514
AB  - In two cross-sectional questionnaire studies with N = 1792 German and Indian students, aged between 12 and 17 years, we investigated the relation between personal belief in a just world (BJW) and positive as well as negative dimensions of school-specific well-being. Furthermore, we considered students' personal experience of teacher justice as possible mediator in this relation and controlled for confounding effects of gender, neuroticism, and locus of control. In Study 1, we used multilevel modeling to analyze the German data and to control for class-level effects. In accordance with our hypotheses, Study 1 showed that the more students believed in a personal just world, the better their positive attitudes toward school, their academic self-esteem, and their enjoyment in school were, and the less somatic complaints in school, social problems in school, and worries toward school they experienced. These associations partly differed between classes, but generally persisted when controlled for sex, neuroticism, and locus of control. Finally, the association between personal BJW and well-being was at least partly mediated by students' personal experience of teacher justice. In Study 2, we focused on the generalizability of the pattern of results across different cultural contexts. However, we did not aim to carry out comparative research. Results from bootstrap mediation analyses were predominantly the same as in Study 1. The adaptive functions of BJW and implications for future school research are discussed.

TT  - Die Nutzung partizipativer, visueller und biografischer Methoden in Studien mit Roma-Jugendlichen. Utilizando métodos biográficos, participativos y visuales con jóvenes romaníes

AB  - Dieser Beitrag behandelt die Drogennutzung von jungen Roma als Teil einer marginalisierten Bevölkerungsgruppe. Reflektiert wird der Gebrauch von Kollagen und Metaphern, die Jugendliche  in einem Aktionsforschungsansatz produziert haben. Zusätzlich wurden unterschiedliche Stakeholder partizipativ an der Formulierung der Forschungsfragen, von Prioritäten und Forschungsstrategien beteiligt.Um das Verständnis der Jugendlichen von deren Drogenkonsum nachvollziehen zu können, wurden insgesamt 23 visuelle Fokusgruppen und 58 biografische Interviews in fünf europäischen Ländern durchgeführt. In den Fokusgruppen erstellten die Jugendlichen Kollagen und erläuterten deren Bedeutung; zur Auswertung der hierbei verwendeten Metaphern kamen Metaphernanalysen zum Einsatz. Die Interviews dienten dazu, Drogenkarrieren zu rekonstruieren.Als Trends entlang der bisherigen Auswertung wurden ein früherer Start von Zigarettenkonsum, das Miterleben des Alkoholkonsums Erwachsener,  eine Unterschätzung der Folgen von Drogenkonsum und in spezifischen Feldern die Abhängigkeit von harten Drogen identifiziert. Des Weiteren fanden sich Gender-spezifische Nutzungsformen. Auch verbanden junge Roma mit bestimmten Drogen ein Gefühl von Zugehörigkeit und Ansprüche auf einen höheren sozialen Status, wenn Konsumptionsmuster denen von Jugendlichen aus nicht-marginalisierten Gruppen ähnelten. Es wird auch veranschaulicht, in welcher Weise qualitative Forschung zu ausgewählten Präventionsprogrammen beitragen kann.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs160155Alternate abstract:The article deals with drug use by young Roma as members of a marginalized population.

Additionally, various stakeholders were involved in a participatory manner in defining research questions, priorities and strategies. In order to understand young Roma's perceptions on drugs, 23 visual focus groups and 58 life-story interviews were conducted in five European countries. In the focus groups, young people built collages to represent drugs and then explained their meanings. Metaphor analysis was used to analyze the data. With the biographical interviews, histories of consumption from drug users were gathered.Among the trends identified are the early onset of tobacco use, exposure to consumption of alcohol by adults, underestimation of the consequences of many drugs, addiction to injecting drug use in specific areas. Gender roles are strongly associated with patterns of consumption. Roma young people also express belonging and reclaim positive social status by using certain types of drugs and by sharing consumption patterns with non-minority young people. The research process also illustrates how qualitative research can contribute to selective prevention programs.URN: http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:0114-fqs160155Alternate abstract:El artículo aborda el uso de drogas por parte de los jóvenes romaníes como miembros de una población marginada.

Con las entrevistas biográficas se recopilaron historias de consumo de los usuarios de drogas.Entre las tendencias identificadas se encuentran el inicio temprano del consumo de tabaco, la exposición al consumo de alcohol por parte de los adultos, la subestimación de las consecuencias de diversas drogas, y la adicción al consumo de drogas intravenosas en áreas específicas. Los roles de género están fuertemente asociados con patrones de consumo. Los jóvenes romaníes también expresan sentido de pertenencia y se refieren a un estatus social positivo mediante el uso de cierto tipo de drogas al compartir patrones de consumo con jóvenes que no pertenecen a esta minoría.

T1  - First-generation immigrants feel socially excluded and have greater pro-violence attitudes than the native population in England and Wales
AN  - 2117579547
AB  - Purpose – Studies examining immigrant generational status and violence have supported differences in the prevalence of violence between these groups. The purpose of this paper is to measure relevant risk factors for violence to focus on whether negative perceptions may contribute to understanding the between-generations differences in violence. Based on the literature, it is theorised that pro-violence attitudes would be related to and be higher in second-generation immigrants than first-generation immigrants, and that negative perceptions would mediate the relationship between pro-violence attitudes and violence. Design/methodology/approach – Data to answer the study’s key questions were taken from the 2010-2011 UK citizenship survey, where only the main sample was analysed. Findings – The findings reveal that first-generation immigrants have a higher prevalence of pro-violence attitudes than the native population. Originality/value – This suggests that there is an intergenerational transmission in violent attitudes, and this is a risk factor for actual violence in second-generation immigrants.

T1  - THE EFFECT OF KNOWLEDGE ON ATTITUDES TOWARD HOMOSEXUAL BEHAVIOR
AN  - 1867156476
AB  - During the showing of the NFL draft on national television (ESPN) in 2014, Michael Sam kissed his male partner in the mouth in celebration of getting drafted by the St. Louis Rams professional football team. Students in the cafeteria appeared to be shocked and surprised while others seemed to accepting of the fact that two men were shown kissing on national television. The publicly televised kiss by the two men and the behavior of the students facilitated me to pose three questions: First, are homosexuality and homosexual behavior more prevalent and accepted in today's society than in the past? Second, are American citizens ignorant of homosexual behavior? And third, if people are knowledgeable of homosexuality and homosexual behavior, would their attitudes toward homosexuality and homosexual behavior change? Therefore, this research attempts to answer the following hypothesis: What effect does knowledge have on attitudes toward homosexuality and homosexual behavior? Using primary data collected from participants and using a variation of the before and after research design, this research was conducted at through telephone surveys. The dependent variable is attitude towards or support for homosexuality and homosexual behavior while the independent variable is knowledge about homosexuality and homosexual behavior based on factual questions gathered from previous scholarly research and the documentary entitled "Gay Rights/Special Rights". In a nutshell, the results indicate that the stimulus, the movie "Gay Rights/Special Rights" did not have an impact on support for homosexual behavior mainly because most respondents consider themselves Christian, African-American, Older, and Democrat. Of those four variables religion trumped all others. The participants based their negative attitude toward homosexuality and homosexual behavior on their religious beliefs. I am not sure if I would say that the participants were homophobic. However, I would say that the participants were anti-homosexual before the stimulus (the documentary) was applied.

T1  - POPULAR COMICS AND AUTHORITARIAN INJUSTICE FRAMES IN MEXICO
AN  - 1792166191
AB  - Analysts of social movements have done a great deal to extend our understanding of how resistance groups frame injustices. They often assume that some form of collective (discursive) action is necessary to frame common understandings, but in many authoritarian regimes collective action is not tolerated. Instead, opposition is expressed in messages embedded in comics, films, and other images generated by popular culture. In this article we connect the literature on social movements and framing to the psychological and cultural understandings of humor, and specifically how text and images in humorous comics form a response to official frames of social peace, modernization, and development. Even when no one dares to write a letter of protest, or take to the streets, or set up a website, the political content of comics establishes understandings about group identity and justice. In more open and democratic regimes, dissident leaders are permitted to manipulate images and understandings. In closed authoritarian regimes, comics are "ready meals" for dissidents. We examine humorous comics in Mexico from 1970 to 1976 to show how text and images spoke of injustices such as torture, poverty, and marginalization.

T1  - Asylum, immigration and anti-racism - an interview with Amal Azzudin
AN  - 1885897709
AB  - The fight against asylum and immigration policies and their punitive impact on young people and their families was given high-profile media and political attention when the 'Glasgow Girls' at Drumchapel High School campaigned against the detention of one of their school friends in 2005. Amal Azzudin played a key role in fighting for her friend to be released from detention and, in the process, engaged with teachers, other pupils at Drumchapel High School, politicians and the media, raising awareness of the way in which asylum seekers without leave to remain were being treated. The campaign was instrumental in challenging mainstream attitudes and assumptions, and informing policy debates. Amal, in this piece, discusses the campaign and her continuing commitment to fighting against racism and inequality in all areas of society. She offers an insight into the successes that can be achieved when groups come together to fight against oppression in all its forms.

T1  - MATERIALISTIC VALUES, SHOPPING, AND LIFE SATISFACTION IN ROMANIA
AN  - 1767324844; 201607553
AB  - Numerous studies have shown that generally materialists are less happy than those lower in materialism. Several studies confirm that people who experience a lower level of life satisfaction are more interested in shopping; therefore materialism determines directly and indirectly (mediated by life satisfaction) the desire of going shopping. There are only few studies that deal with this topic within Romanian consumers. The conceptual model proposed here was tested on a convenience sample of 390 Romanians. Using structural equation modelling, our findings confirm the hypothetical model only partially. Materialism leads to life dissatisfaction and shopping, but life dissatisfaction does not increase shopping. To the contrary, there is a positive relationship between life satisfaction and the desire for shopping. One possible explanation is that Romanians perceive materialism as a positive attitude. Anyway, nuances should be considered regarding the role of money and possession in bringing life satisfaction. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Selectively Social Politics: The Differing Roles of Media Use on Political Discussion
AN  - 1752994954; 201600619
AB  - In the modern media environment, people are afforded a variety of options for political information. In addition, people now use multiple media sources (e.g., television, radio, blogs) to obtain information about all aspects of politics (Eveland, 2004; Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, 2009). The purpose of this study was to examine how use of particular media sources influenced the frequency of political discussion with people from the same political party (political in-group members) and people from a different political party (political out-group members). Guided by a uses and gratifications perspective, which emphasizes the role of the user in media effects, we examined how specific user background characteristics (e.g., age, sex, political opinion leadership, political social identity, political content affinity), motives for using traditional and social media for political information, and use of different media sources work together to influence discussion with political in-group and out-group members. Our results allowed us to identify several distinct differences between people who talk to political in-group and out-group members. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Feral families, troubled families: The spectre of the underclass in New Zealand
AN  - 1648847729
AB  - This article reports on an investigation of media representations of 'feral families' and the 'underclass' over a period of intense welfare reform in New Zealand, which includes significant income maintenance reform and targeted interventions to reduce family violence. The use of emotionally charged and stigmatising language to characterise people and groups may be interpreted as media framing and reveals some elements of an enduring moral panic. While media stories engender a wide range of audience responses, analysis of the content of both news stories and commentary suggests some support for sanctions aimed at control of the poor. An unsympathetic focus on the struggles of poor parents and their children invokes stigma and fear of unruly populations. The portrayal of poor families, particularly M?ori families, as a 'feral' underclass, is highly stigmatising and may reduce public empathy with advocacy about child welfare.

T1  - The Escalation of Ethnonationalist Radicalization: Simulating the Effectiveness of Nationalist Ideologies
AN  - 1692290635; 201520941
AB  - This article describes an agent-based simulation model of ethnonationalist radicalization between political actors and their constituencies based upon evidence from the former Yugoslavia. The central mechanism is the recursive feedback between political and cultural dynamics, focusing on processes prior to the outbreak of actual violence. The results offer theoretical insights by revealing mechanisms that lead to escalation. These can be found within politics as well as among the population: between conflicting ethnically homogeneous regions, opposing radicalization forces fuel an escalation spiral. These processes are driven by political influences. Challenging the theory that diversity breeds conflict, this suggests that multiethnic regions are more capable of withstanding political pressures. However, they are vulnerable to imported violence, driven by the local population. This finding is tested with a different model of the same events, in which different implemented mechanisms generate results, in line with the diversity-breeds-conflict theory. A comparative discussion demonstrates how simulation is sensitive to theoretical predispositions. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Promoting Civil Discourse Through Search Engine Diversity
AN  - 1531934075; 201422706
AB  - The ability of modern web services such as news aggregators and search engines to tailor their results to the tastes of individuals, together with people's preference for reading opinions which reinforce their own viewpoints, have raised concerns that people are nowadays exposed to a narrow range of view-points, a phenomenon referred to as the 'filter bubble'. In this paper we focus on increasing exposure to varied political opinions with a goal of improving civil discourse. We develop a method to algorithmically encourage people to read diverse political opinions and test it when people actively seek information. First, analyzing data from a popular search engine we show that people are indeed more likely to read opinions consistent with their own. Interestingly, they are more likely to read news from opposing sites when the language model of a particular news item is close to the language model of their own political leaning. Based on this finding, we describe a method for assisting people to read divergent opinions by choosing documents of opposing viewpoints that have a language model closer to their own language model. We test our method on a number of web searchers and show that pages of the opposing side which were more similar than the average persons' own language model tended to be clicked 38% more than those below. We also describe the long-term effects of our method, showing that people who were shown more diverse results continued reading more diverse results and overall became more interested in news.

T1  - Motives for Active Participation in Political Blogs: A Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Eight German Blogs
AN  - 1531931120; 201422694
AB  - Blogs play an important role in political communication and in forming the opinions of political actors and politically interested users. Their ability to facilitate active interaction, present opinions, mobilize voters, and thereby, influence public opinion and eventually election outcomes makes political blogs an interesting research subject. Thus, this article draws upon a qualitative content analysis to reveal the readers' motivations and main themes to post comments and get involved in the discussions on political blogs. We analyze 12 blog discussions (500 pages) in eight left-leaning German political blogs and use qualitative content analysis to develop a category scheme comprising of 3,868 codings. We find that social interaction with other blog users is the main motive for blogging on German political blogs together with the desire for the exchange of further information and analysis, and the expression of the own opinion concerning the subject. Moreover, we classify 191 users by their motivations for blogging using cluster analysis and identify the bloggers' different communication roles. By providing insight into the users' political discussions, motives for participation, and communication roles, we clarify the role that political blogs play in the process of forming political opinion and derive implications for politics.

T1  - Supervising Rioters: The Role of Probation
AN  - 1504423777; 201407683
AB  - This article aims to investigate the current response to the riots in the UK in August 2011 by comparing and contrasting the political and institutional factors with the reaction to the riots that occurred in Brixton and Toxteth 1981 and those in Bradford, Burnley and Oldham in 2001. The article focuses on the changes which have occurred within the probation service over that period and by interviewing twelve frontline practitioners, seeks to gain an insight into the ways these transformations reflect wider differences within the role of probation, the community, political and government attitudes and the ways this is communicated within the media.

T1  - Outrageous political opinion and political anxiety in the US
AN  - 1541997076; 201427283
AB  - In a time marked by declining audiences for nightly news broadcasts and dwindling newspaper readership, the audience size for outrage-based political opinion-media (e.g., The Rush Limbaugh Show, The O'Reilly Factor, The Ed Show) has grown dramatically. Existing research has shown that people gravitate toward media sources that support their pre-existing beliefs, but explanations for this tendency dwell upon psychological processes and perceptions of information quality. We find such explanations unsatisfying for this unique genre, and we apply a more sociological lens. Using in-depth interviews with fans and qualitative analyses of television and talk radio transcripts-this research shows how anxieties churned up by public political dialog and people's related tendency to avoid political talk with those outside their most trusted inner circles help to create powerful connections between charismatic political talk show hosts and their fans. Shifting the focus from the information desired by fans to experiences they value, and from psychological to social needs, we show that outrage-based political opinion programs create safe political spaces for fans. We end by suggesting how shifts in the broader political climate have left conservative audiences hungrier for such content. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

T1  - Television Drama and Partially Structured Measure of Racial Attitudes
AN  - 1512219257; 201409492
AB  - This study investigates the utility of a thought-listing procedure for measuring racial attitudes based on the logic of a partially structured measure. Two studies are conducted to explore this possibility. Two episodes of Law and Order are used as the stimuli to replicate the findings. Both convergent and discriminant validity are tested. Results indicate that the partially structured measure has no significant relation with either explicit or implicit measures of racial attitudes. Implications of the findings are discussed, such as the existence of aversive racism, and the validity of the partially structured measure to detect people's racial attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racial composition of social settings, interracial friendship, and whites' attitudes toward interracial marriage
AN  - 1347783254; 201321499
AB  - This study examines the effect that the racial composition of neighborhoods, workplaces, congregations, and friendships has on whites' attitudes toward interracial marriage with blacks, Latinos, and Asians. Utilizing survey data drawn from a national probability sample, ordered logit regression models are estimated in order to (1) determine the effect of the racial composition of neighborhoods, workplaces, and congregations on white intermarriage attitudes, net of sociodemographic and ideological controls and (2) test for a mediating effect of interracial friendship. Greater presence of blacks, Latinos, or Asians in neighborhoods and congregations of whites predicts favorable attitudes among whites toward interracial marriage with each respective racial group. A higher proportion of Latinos in the workplace also predicts support for racial exogamy with Latinos. Many of these effects, however, are reduced when interracial friendship is included in models, suggesting that the effect of interracial contact on intermarriage attitudes is mediated by whether or not whites develop interracial friendships within settings of cross-race interaction.

T1  - Violence Against Women in Video Games: A Prequel or Sequel to Rape Myth Acceptance
AN  - 1364700878; 201327530
AB  - Current research suggests a link between negative attitudes toward women and violence against women, and it also suggests that media may condition such negative attitudes. When considering the tremendous and continued growth of video game sales, and the resulting proliferation of sexual objectification and violence against women in some video games, it is lamentable that there is a dearth of research exploring the effect of such imagery on attitudes toward women. This study is the first study to use actual video game playing and control for causal order, when exploring the effect of sexual exploitation and violence against women in video games on attitudes toward women. By employing a Solomon Four-Group experimental research design, this exploratory study found that a video game depicting sexual objectification of women and violence against women resulted in statistically significant increased rape myths acceptance (rape-supportive attitudes) for male study participants but not for female participants.

T1  - Transactional Politics
AN  - 1994216958
AB  - In spring 2009, revelations over the expense claims of British MPs led to one of the most damaging scandals affecting the legitimacy of parliamentary democracy in recent history. This article explores how this incident reveals the capacity of Web 2.0 devices and transactional data to transform politics. It reflects, graphically, the political power of identifying and knowing people on the basis of their transactions, on what they do rather than what they say. It also shows in practice how Web 2.0 devices such as Crowdsourcing, Google Docs, mash-ups and visualization software can be used to mobilize data for collective and popular projects. Basic analytic tools freely available on the Web enable people to access, digitize and analyse data and do their own analyses and representations of phenomena. We examine media and popular mobilizations of transactional data using the specific example of the MPs' expenses scandal and relate this to larger currents in online government data and devices for public scrutiny which give rise to a new politics of measurement. We argue that this politics of measurement involves the introduction of new visual devices based on the manipulation of huge databases into simplified visual arrays; the reorientation of accounts of the social from elicited attitudes and views to transactions and practices; and, the inspection of individuals arrayed in relation to other individuals within whole (sub) populations. It is also a politics that mobilizes new informational gatekeepers and organizers in the making and analysis of transactional data and challenges dominant or expert forms of analysis and representation.

T1  - Red socks and purple rain: the political uses of colour in late apartheid South Africa
AN  - 887499210; 201118580
AB  - This article explores the extent to which colour functions as an independent mode in a particular context and explores the culturally produced regularities in the uses of colour in this context. Drawing on a Hallidayan metafunctional view of text, we look at how colour instantiated systems of knowledge and belief (ideational function) and social relations and identities (interpersonal function) in South Africa during the last decade of the apartheid government. In this type of repressive socio-political context, colour was a less policed mode, and thus had different affordances to images and the verbal modes. We argue that colour can function as an independent mode under certain conditions, such as stringent press restrictions, where the use of colour in a range of media (clothing, flags, posters) can play a crucial role in communicating.

T1  - The Effects of Death Reminders on Sex Differences in Prejudice Toward Gay Men and Lesbians
AN  - 881465439; 201116485
AB  - Terror management research shows that death reminders (mortality salience) increase prejudice toward worldview violators. Two studies investigated whether death reminders exacerbated differences in heterosexual men's and women's reports of sexual prejudice (negative attitudes based on sexual orientation). Results showed that following death reminders, sex differences in anti-gay discrimination and affective prejudice toward gay men (but not toward lesbians) were larger, and that these increased sex differences were mediated by gender role beliefs. The current studies suggest that researchers may attenuate the effects of death reminders by lessening the perceived worldview violation in addition to alleviating the existential terror of death.

T1  - Mediated Intergroup Conflict: The Discursive Construction of "Illegal Immigrants" in a Regional U.S. Newspaper
AN  - 862597940; 201110797
AB  - Using an intergroup communication framework, this article examines how a newspaper in southeastern Virginia discursively constructs the "illegal immigrant" as a metonym for Latino immigrants. This mixed methods study traces the development of this newspaper discourse about illegal immigrants from 1994 to 2006 using quantitative lexical analysis. It then shows how two local news events further instantiate an illegal immigrant metonymy influencing perceptions of Latinos, subsequent media discourse about immigration, and local immigration policies using critical discourse analysis. The quantitative findings suggest that news discourse focusing on (illegal) immigration tended to use lexical items low in optimism and commonality, consistent with out-group negativity. The qualitative findings show how two incidents involving "illegal immigrants" attached negative stereotypes to this category, which then potentially influenced perceptions of Latinos more broadly. This analysis shows some of the ways that media discourse influences perceived intergroup threats at the local and national levels.

T1  - An Experimental Test of the Effects of Fictional Framing on Attitudes
AN  - 862595973; 201110278
AB  - Objectives. Most studies of media effects in political communication focus on news media. A smaller body of work extends theories of news media effects to fictional entertainment media. Just as news media engage in priming and agenda setting, these studies suggest that fictional media do as well. In this study, we deal with fictional media's framing of issues. No research has sought to test the effects of framing in explicitly fictional media on political opinions. We develop the outlines of a theory we call 'fictional framing' and test it in an experiment. Methods. Participants in our treatment group watched the film Cider House Rules. The movie frames the issue of abortion in the case of incest in a pro-choice way, and frames morality in terms of following one's own conscience. Results. The film influenced opinions in ways consistent with the framing of these issues. Conclusions. Since abortion opinions and moral values tend to be entrenched, we consider this a strong first test of the effects of fictional framing. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Britney Spears Remained in Russia: Dynamics of Musical Preferences in the Integration of Immigrant Adolescents
AN  - 2076977042
AB  - This study examined the roles of popular music in the lives of immigrant adolescents from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS-former Soviet Union) in Israel. Based on 70 in-depth interviews with newly arrived adolescents aged 12-18, our research revealed that these adolescents' musical preferences matched different stages of adaptation to their new country, with different music styles fulfilling different integration needs. During their first two years in Israel, interviewees enthusiastically explored local musical fare. This stage was also characterised by positive attitudes towards their new home and their anticipated integration. In dramatic contrast, the next three to five years were characterised by disappointment with the local culture, accompanied by growing social alienation. Many adolescents found consolation in late-1980s Russian rock music, as texts critical of the Soviet regime helped them express anger and frustration felt as they came of age in new, difficult and often hostile surroundings. It seems, therefore, that, for immigrant adolescents, different types of popular music not only serve as a marker of their evolving cultural identity but also as indicators of social and psychological adaptation.

T1  - Mixed methods evaluation of a menu of research learning opportunities for mid-career social work academics with 'protected time'
AN  - 1364701474; 201327060
AB  - Knowledge about research methodologies and positive attitudes about research are each essential for academics who teach social worker students to advocate for and to deliver effective, empowering services to vulnerable people. This paper evaluates a menu of learning opportunities offered to fifty-two mid-career social work academics from 30 UK universities given 'protected time' to increase their research skills, funded by RDI4-ESRC. Qualitative and quantitative survey data are summarized. All participants attended five of eight conference days on research methodologies; 80% participated in small discussion groups; 49% attended a 3-day writing retreat; 49% signed up to a research mini-placement; 31% presented research at a conference; 21% submitted manuscripts to a journal. The demonstrated commitment of time, expertise, and advanced skills to this project from 32 senior social science/social work researchers came at a time when media was blasting the profession. They modelled enthusiasm and confidence and 'bridged' access for the 'next generation' of academics. Repeated encounters amongst the participants gradually built 'bonded' social capital 'normed' positively around the enterprise of research. Participants reported at follow-up increased knowledge and confidence as they teach... In the current economic context, there are benefits of 'protected time' combined with structured opportunities for mid-career social work academics. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - News use and political socialization among young Jordanians
AN  - 1018356712; 201213409
AB  - This study examined the relationship between young Jordanians' (N = 321) news use and their feelings toward the Jordanian and US governments. Consumption of traditional news delivery formats (such as print newspapers, radio broadcasts and interpersonal sources) was measured, as was reliance on new media formats such as blogs, text messaging and podcasting. Political socialization measures were indices of political trust and appraisals of the US government. Results suggest that young Jordanians in the sample rely mostly on TV news, newspapers and interpersonal contacts for current events information, and that TV news use and reliance on interpersonal sources were associated with negative views of the US government.

T1  - For God (or) Country: The Hydraulic Relation Between Government Instability and Belief in Religious Sources of Control
AN  - 822521874; 201074662
AB  - It has been recently proposed that people can flexibly rely on sources of control that are both internal and external to the self to satisfy the need to believe that their world is under control (i.e., that events do not unfold randomly or haphazardly). Consistent with this, past research demonstrates that, when personal control is threatened, people defend external systems of control, such as God and government. This theoretical perspective also suggests that belief in God and support for governmental systems, although seemingly disparate, will exhibit a hydraulic relationship with one another. Using both experimental and longitudinal designs in Eastern and Western cultures, the authors demonstrate that experimental manipulations or naturally occurring events (e.g., electoral instability) that lower faith in one of these external systems (e.g., the government) lead to subsequent increases in faith in the other (e.g., God). In addition, mediation and moderation analyses suggest that specific concerns with order and structure underlie these hydraulic effects. Implications for the psychological, sociocultural, and sociopolitical underpinnings of religious faith, as well as system justification theory, are discussed.

T1  - Sexual Experience and Couple Formation Attitudes Among Emerging Adults
AN  - 1429638613; 201338116
AB  - In this study, we explore the relationship between attitudes toward both marriage and cohabitation and sexual experience during emerging adulthood. Results from 990 emerging adults indicated only moderate evidence that marital attitudes are related to sexual experience but strong evidence of a relationship between attitudes toward cohabitation and sexual experience. In particular, sexually active emerging adults were more likely to have positive attitudes toward cohabitation. Furthermore, it was found that both religiosity and dating status moderate the relationship between couple formation attitudes and sexual experience. For highly religious emerging adults, sexual activity was associated with higher endorsement of cohabitation; however, this pattern was not present for emerging adults with low religiosity. Dating status was found to have some impact on the relationship between sexual behavior and attitudes toward marriage but did not greatly impact the overall pattern of relationships.
