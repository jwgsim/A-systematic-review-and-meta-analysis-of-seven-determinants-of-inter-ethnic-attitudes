T1  - The COVID‐19/racial injustice syndemic and mental health among Black Americans: The roles of general and race‐related COVID worry, cultural mistrust, and perceived discrimination
AN  - 2687741417
AB  - This study explored intersecting concerns about COVID‐19 and racial injustice against Black people in the United States using a syndemic perspective. Findings from a multistate COVID‐19 needs assessment project examined the association of general and race‐related concerns about COVID‐19 and concerns about police violence against Black people with mental health symptoms in a sample of 2480 Black Americans. The role of cultural mistrust in vaccination status was also examined. Concerns about COVID‐19 were positively associated with concerns about police violence and associated with worse mental health. Nonvaccinated individuals were higher in cultural mistrust but lower in perceived discrimination than vaccinated individuals. Perceived discrimination partially mediated the relationship between race‐related concerns about COVID‐19 and mental health symptoms. Findings can inform the development of culturally responsive strategies to address the syndemic effects of COVID‐19 and racial injustice.

T1  - Professional preference for mental illness: The role of contact, empathy, and stigma in Spanish Social Work undergraduates
AN  - 2673562969
AB  - The treatment of the mentally ill people is a challenge across the world, and different professionals, such as doctors, social workers, psychologists, or nurses, take care of this group. Nonetheless, mental health is not a vocational sector preferred by students and professionals of many of these careers. Research has proposed that professional preference for a patient group would be positively influenced by intergroup contact (quantity and quality) and empathy (perspective‐taking), and negatively associated with intergroup anxiety and social distance. However, the evidence testing this proposal was partial and mainly referring to other patient groups such as minorities or immigrants. The major aim of this cross‐sectional study was to clarify two research questions referring to mentally ill persons: Do contact and empathy protect undergraduates from intergroup anxiety and social distance and promote professional preference? Do intergroup anxiety and social distance predict professional preference and mediate the influence of contact and empathy in professional preference? A convenience sample of 409 Social Work undergraduates (81% females) from three Spanish universities completed a questionnaire between February and June 2020. Concerning direct relationships, the structural equation model showed that the quantity of contact only predicted intergroup anxiety negatively; quality of contact and empathy negatively predicted intergroup anxiety and social distance; intergroup anxiety positively predicted social distance; intergroup anxiety and social distance negatively predicted professional preference. Concerning mediated relationships, the influence of quality of contact and empathy on social distance was mediated by intergroup anxiety; social distance mediated the relationship of intergroup anxiety with professional preference; both anxiety and distance mediated the influence of quality of contact and empathy in professional preference. These results encourage interventions aimed at enhancing professional preference for mental illness by improving contact, knowledge, and empathy and reducing stigma in students and workers from diverse mental health careers.

T1  - Interview with an avatar: Comparing online and virtual reality perspective taking for gender bias in STEM hiring decisions
AN  - 2686268159
AB  - Virtual perspective taking can reduce unconscious bias and increase empathy and prosocial behavior toward individuals who are marginalized based on group stereotypes such as age, race, or socioeconomic status. However, the question remains whether this approach might reduce implicit gender bias, and the degree to which virtual immersion contributes to behavioral modulation following perspective taking tasks is unknown. Accordingly, we investigate the role of virtual perspective taking for binary gender using an online platform (Study 1) and immersive virtual reality (Study 2). Female and male undergraduates performed a simulated interview while virtually represented by an avatar that was either congruent or incongruent with their own gender. All participants rated a male and a female candidate on competence, hireability, likeability, empathy, and interpersonal closeness and then chose one of these two equivalently qualified candidates to hire for a laboratory assistant position in the male dominated industry of information technology. Online perspective taking did not reveal a significant influence of avatar gender on candidate ratings or candidate choice, whereas virtual reality perspective taking resulted in significant changes to participant behavior following exposure to a gender-incongruent avatar (e.g., male embodied as female), such that men showed preference for the female candidate and women showed preference for the male candidate. Although between-group differences in candidate ratings were subtle, rating trends were consistent with substantial differences in candidate choice, and this effect was greater for men. Compared to an online approach, virtual reality perspective taking appears to exert greater influence on acute behavioral modulation for gender bias due to its ability to fully immerse participants in the experience of (temporarily) becoming someone else, with empathy as a potential mechanism underlying this phenomenon.

T1  - Accessing racial privilege through property: Geographies of racial capitalism
AN  - 2683174167
AB  - This paper examines racial capitalism through the lens of housing and urban development. We compare two disparate places Kabul, Afghanistan and Boulder, Colorado in order to illustrate the commonalities of property rights regimes, and the (ill)logics of economic development that reinforce racial-economic privilege. By exploring housing specifically, this paper explicates the ways in which availability, affordability, and desirability are intertwined with racialized conceptualizations of space. Both Kabul and Boulder are dominated by legacies and contemporary practices of white privilege and economic inequality based on neoliberal racial capitalism. Housing in Kabul has been a key part of international and national economic development programs, while the influx of international funds and workers included a form of gentrification that significantly marginalized local-Afghans from several spaces in the capital city. In Boulder, property values have increased exponentially in recent decades due to the growth of information technology jobs and influx of wealth. The racial and economic marginalization of nonwhite and low-income persons in Boulder remains consistent within housing and work sectors. The racialization of Afghans by international development workers in Kabul, and the racialization of poverty and marginalization of nonwhite minorities in Boulder explicate the tensions and conflicts between property rights regimes and the "right" to be housed. This paper examines the ways in which discursive representations of wealth and poverty become geopolitical and geo-economic tools of racialized socioeconomic ostracism. Analyzing these disparate places through the lens of racial capitalism explicates the common forms of reductionism used to reinforce market privilege over the lives and livelihoods of bodies racialized as "other". While the specific histories of domination differ by location, the effects of racial capitalism are visible in each, particularly through relations of private property.

T1  - African American Activism: The Predictive Role of Race Related Stress, Racial Identity, and Social Justice Beliefs
AN  - 2678684166
AB  - Historically, African American activism has played a pivotal role in advancing social change in the United States. As such, there is an interest in examining possible factors that may engender activism among African Americans. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to extend research by Szymanski and Lewis (2015), which explored potential predictors of activism among African Americans. With a sample of 458 African American undergraduates, race-related stress, racial identity dimensions, and social justice variables were examined. A four-stage, multiple linear hierarchical regression model and two multiple mediation bootstrap analyses were employed. Race-related stress and racial identity attitudes significantly and uniquely predicted involvement in African American activism, complementing existing literature. Beyond that, social justice beliefs predicted African American activism over and above racial identity and race-related stress. More specifically, social justice subjective norms (i.e., social influence) was the most important predictor of activism for African American undergraduates. Implications for social justice development within institutions of higher education are discussed.

T1  - Workplace incivility and its socio-demographic determinants in India
AN  - 2660091331
AB  - Purpose>The purpose of this study is to present an empirical account of the prevalence and socio-demographic determinants of workplace incivility (experienced and instigated) in the Indian workplace.Design/methodology/approach>The study sample consisted of 1,133 employees working in service organizations mainly banks, hotels, academic institutions and information technology firms. The authors tested the proposed model on the same set of respondents in two different studies. The phenomenon of instigated incivility and its determinants were examined in Study 1, while Study 2 looked at experienced incivility and its antecedents. The data were analyzed using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate statistical operations in SPSS 24.Findings>The results of both studies revealed that employees’ age, gender, educational qualification, position, nature of the organization, type of the organization and duration of working hours significantly predict the onset of workplace incivility. Nevertheless, marital status and tenure failed to predict the manifestation of uncivil behaviors in the organization.Research limitations/implications>The scope of this study was restricted to the Indian service sector with a focus on only two types of workplace incivility (instigated and experienced).Practical implications>The managers are advised to be mindful of employees’ socio-demographic differences while devising interventions to tackle the issues of uncivil acts at work.Originality/value>This study is one of the pioneer attempts to explore the impact of socio-demographic factors on employees’ tendency to instigate and experience incivility at work in India. In doing so, the study enriches the scant literature on workplace incivility by establishing the role of individual differences in determining the occurrence of incivility in the workplace.

T1  - Lawyering While Black: Perceived Stress as a Mediator of Impostor Feelings, Race-Related Stress and Mental Health Among Black Attorneys
AN  - 2653220130
AB  - Attorneys suffer from high rates of stress and mental health problems, and Black attorneys, who make up only five percent of all attorneys in the United States, are especially vulnerable due to underrepresentation and experiences of bias. The present study examined perceived stress as a mediator of the impostor phenomenon, race-related stress, and mental health among a sample of 142 Black attorneys (114 women, 25 men). Gender, age, impostor phenomenon, race-related stress, and perceived stress accounted for 51% and 57% of the variance in depression and anxiety, respectively. Perceived stress fully mediated the links between the impostor phenomenon and depression, cultural racism and depression, and impostor feelings and anxiety and partially mediated the link between cultural racism and anxiety. Results suggest that perceived stress is an important mechanism for understanding why the impostor phenomenon and race-related stress negatively impact the mental health of Black attorneys.

T1  - The Gray Digital Divide in Social Networking Site Use in Europe: Results From a Quantitative Study
AN  - 2651992592
AB  - Social networking sites (SNSs) might be important tools to contrast social exclusion in old age. However, the so-called gray digital divide (GDD) may undermine the potentialities of SNSs. Despite its relevance, there is very little research, which documented the characteristics of the digital divide in SNS use among the old-age population in Europe. Drawing on the “material access in resources and appropriation” theory developed by van Dijk, this work contributes to consolidate the body of research, documenting the nature of the GDD in SNS use in Europe and evaluating the role that older people’s categorical, personal, and positional characteristics together with ICT characteristics play in gaining access to digital technologies. We analyze data from the 2013–2016 Eurostat Community Statistics on Information Societies (CSIS) survey and perform bivariate and multilevel regression analysis. Key findings are (i) the persistence of the intergeneration digital divide in old age together with the marked cross-countries differences in SNS use across European countries and over time and (ii) the stability over old-age generations, countries, and time of the positional categories associated with SNS use in old age, providing further empirical support to van Dijk’s theory.

T1  - Coverage and Framing of Immigration Policy in US Newspapers
AN  - 2640381821
AB  - Policy PointsAlthough immigration policy is recognized as a social determinant of health, less is known about how mechanisms, such as news coverage of policy, influence intermediary and proximal health processes like seeking health care.The extent of news coverage of federal, state, and local exclusionary or integration immigration policies can influence public agendas regarding immigrant inclusion and exclusion.Exclusionary federal immigrant policies have dominated the news across the United States over the past ten years, despite active immigrant integration policymaking at national, state, and local levels.ContextImmigration policymaking at federal, state, and local levels in the United States has proliferated in the past decade. While evidence demonstrates that immigration policy is a determinant of health, there has been limited examination of the mechanisms by which policy influences proximal health processes. News coverage has served as a central platform for debates over restrictive and inclusive immigration policies and may constitute an important health mechanism by shaping public agendas, influencing support for immigrant exclusion or inclusion, and framing policy issues, thereby influencing immigrants’ social climates. This study sought to examine the extent of news coverage of exclusionary and inclusive immigration policy at federal and state levels and variations in messages about immigrants during two periods of extensive policymaking.MethodsWe conducted a quantitative content analysis of newspapers’ coverage of immigration policy between 2010 and 2013 and between 2017 and 2019. We conducted a systematic NewsBank search of articles covering legislation, lawsuits, and other policies related to immigration (n = 931). Articles were coded for policy type and level, positive or negative framing of immigrants, and other characteristics. Our analysis then compared the patterns of the two periods.ResultsIn both periods, the majority of coverage focused on exclusionary policies at the federal level, despite a significant increase in integration policies between 2017 and 2019. We found significant shifts in both the negative and positive framing of immigrants, from the dominant negative messages of immigrants as an economic drain to immigrants as criminals and the dominant positive messages of immigrants’ economic contributions to immigrants as families.ConclusionsSince 2010, coverage of exclusionary federal policy has consistently dominated the news, as messages have increasingly described immigrants as either criminals or part of families. We discuss the health implications and future research directions of news coverages’ role in influencing the immigration policy and social contexts that have been linked to health outcomes.

T1  - More Than Politics: How Personality Trait and Media Technology Use Affect Vote Likelihood During the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election: PROD
AN  - 2631515237
AB  - Considerable work has been devoted to studying voter behavior in U.S. presidential elections by analyzing their political participation and attitude toward political advertising. Less is known about how other factors may alter voter behavior like personality traits and use of information and communication technology (ICT). This study analyzes vote likelihood among American young voters and their parents (N = 674) after they watched four presidential campaign commercials . It proposes a hierarchical mediation model highlighting the need for cognition (NFC) impact on vote likelihood through the mediation of power use of ICT applications, political participation and trust in negative advertising. This study has revealed both the direct effect of NFC on vote likelihood, and the indirect relationship between NFC and vote likelihood that is mediated by power use of ICT applications. The findings should enrich the literature of vote likelihood by highlighting the effects of need for cognition and ICT usage.

T1  - Framing Syrian refugees: US local news and the politics of immigration: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2623665546
AB  - The article investigates news coverage and media framing of the Syrian refugee debate as a public opinion issue in US local news in 2015. The sheer number of refugees created an unprecedented humanitarian crisis as millions of civilians settled in neighboring countries, and a significant number of them embarked on a perilous journey to seek refuge in European countries. The political response to the Syrian refugee crisis was divided, but public attitudes shifted after the terrorist attacks on Paris in November 2015 with calls for more restrictive immigration policies and smaller refugee quotas. In the US, GOP leaders demanded “extreme vetting” and “screening” of refugees and many opposed resettling the modest number of refugees the Obama administration promised to let in. The study analyzes local news coverage variation across the States that welcomed, not welcomed or did not commit to accepting Syrian refugees at the height of the Syrian refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016. The findings of the study demonstrate that the editorial framing of the Syrian refugee crisis downplayed the global responsibility and international commitment of the US, highlighted the administrative costs and framed them as security threats. The implications of these frames are discussed.

T1  - Protecting America’s borders: Christian nationalism, threat, and attitudes toward immigrants in the United States: GPIR
AN  - 2638250339
AB  - Attitudes toward immigrants and immigration policies are divisive issues in American politics. These attitudes are influenced by factors such as political orientation and religiousness, with religious and conservative individuals demonstrating higher prejudice toward immigrants and refugees, and endorsing stricter immigration policies. Christian nationalism, an ideology marked by the belief that America is a Christian nation, may help explain how religious nationalist identity influences negative attitudes toward immigrants. The current research addresses this through four studies among participants in the US. Across studies, our results showed that Christian nationalism was a significant and consistent predictor of anti-immigrant stereotypes, prejudice, dehumanization, and support for anti-immigrant policies. These effects were robust to inclusion of other sources of anti-immigrant attitudes, including religious fundamentalism, nationalism, and political ideology. Further, perceived threats from immigrants mediated the relationship between Christian nationalism and dehumanization of immigrants, and attitudes toward immigration policies. These findings have implications for our understanding of the relations between religious nationalism and attitudes toward immigrants and immigration policy in the US, as well as in other contexts.

T1  - Scalable Co-presence: WhatsApp and the Mediation of Personal Relationships during the COVID-19 Lockdown
AN  - 2651990310
AB  - This article sheds light on how adults in Barcelona (ES), Groningen (NL), and Milan (IT) utilized WhatsApp to compensate for the lack of face-to-face interactions and to fight social isolation during the first 2 months of the COVID-19 lockdown. We argue that practices of WhatsApp usage have multiplied and diversified experiences of co-presence at distance and made group socialities even more important than before. Building on the concepts of “scalable socialities” and “polymedia,” the article formulates the concept of “scalable co-presence” to account for ways in which WhatsApp has enabled multiple experiences of proximity to others across different scales of sociality, from one-to-one to large groups interactions. In this article, we also argue that the concept of “scalable co-presence” is relevant to bring the study of mediated co-presence out of media and migration studies into the broader field of media and cultural studies. With reduction in mobility, increased social distancing, and ubiquitous connectivity, the role of communication technologies in mediating proximity at distance has become crucial for many more people around the world outside the context of transnational migration. The concept is also relevant to acknowledge the increased importance of mediated group interactions and communications in (post)-pandemic digital societies.

T1  - Effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on public managers' attitudes toward digital transformation
AN  - 2617692645
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has induced a process of digital acceleration and has likely changed the attitudes of local public managers toward information and communication technology (ICT). While this attitude change has been reasonably argued, it has not been systematically measured. This study narrows this gap by measuring the attitudes of public managers before and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, this study finds that the pandemic has led public managers to be more confident in the capacity of ICT to help cities achieve their economic, social, and environmental goals and respond to challenges. Both explicit and implicit measures confirmed attitude changes. The explicit measures also indicated that the change in public managers' attitude toward ICT was similar to their change in attitude toward scientific progress and greater than their change in attitude toward other issues that have played a major role during the pandemic, namely, climate change, citizen participation, and privacy.

T1  - Bringing social marketing closer to the disability field
AN  - 2600347731
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to show the advantages that social marketing training programs for disability professionals can play in improving the approach to the problems faced by people with disabilities, offering a necessary mutual understanding between both sectors. So, describing what are the training needs in social marketing expressed by disability professionals and providing an initial shared theoretical framework of both fields that could contribute to implementing social marketing strategies in the field of disability as an inducer of quality of life.Design/methodology/approachThis is a mixed-method approach combining: a quantitative analysis with a web-based self-administered questionnaire completed in six European countries and a qualitative analysis: interviews to experts pre and post questionnaire.FindingsQuantitative data has identified that: front-line professionals working directly with people with disabilities have high social marketing training needs; these needs are mostly related to the assessment and modification of clients’ behavior and the development of interventions according to the concept of value co-creation. Qualitative data has shown that: both fields share some similar theoretical frameworks. Therefore, it is stated that social marketing has the potential to be better implemented in the disability field.Research limitations/implicationsConsidering public policy; stigma and discrimination; regulations; other models and improving the sampling method.Originality/valueSharing theoretical framework of both fields, social marketing strategies into the disability field as an inductor for quality of life. No research has analyzed the needs of disability professionals when they have to face a problem and find a solution that social marketing strategies could offer into the disability field.

T1  - Using a social marketing approach to develop a pro-diversity intervention
AN  - 2600347126
AB  - PurposeDespite more than half a century of academic research, relatively few methods have been shown to reliably improve intergroup relations in the real world. This paper aims to use a social marketing approach to design a pro-diversity intervention in a university setting.Design/methodology/approachWe conducted extensive qualitative, quantitative and observational background research to identify elements that would increase the effectiveness of the intervention. Focus groups and surveys allowed us to identify a target audience, target behaviors and the relevant barriers and benefits.FindingsThe background research suggested increasing inclusive behavior would have a greater impact than reducing discriminatory behavior. Based on this research, this paper determined an optimal target audience was students who had relatively positive attitudes toward diversity but engaged in few inclusive behaviors. This paper used relevant theories from the behavioral sciences to design an intervention that promoted a small set of inclusive behaviors and that addressed the relevant barriers and benefits. The intervention took the form of a single page of targeted messages that instructors can add to their course syllabi. The page communicates injunctive and descriptive norms, highlights the benefits of behaving inclusively and provides concrete behavioral advice.Originality/valueThe research applies the social marketing approach to a novel domain. This approach represents a new way to advance diversity, equity and inclusion through promoting inclusive and reducing discriminatory behavior.

T1  - Gender, Media, and Contraceptive Use in Nigeria: Men Need Help, Not Women
AN  - 2551250469
AB  - Nigeria's annual population growth and fertility rates are fueling the popular postulation that by 2050, the nation will rank after India and China in population size. Increasing population growth amid poor economic and health statistics in Nigeria point to family planning as one of the long-term effective solutions to this issue. After years of raising awareness and knowledge building, there still exists a huge gap between knowledge of contraceptives and the application of the knowledge in Nigerian society. This gap has initiated a myriad of behavior change communication campaigns on the use of contraceptives. This study goes beyond considering the influences of both spousal communication and mass media on family planning awareness and usage of contraceptives; it examines the response of each gender to family planning campaigns and contraceptive use in Osun and Ogun states, Nigeria. In spite of awareness raising, knowledge building, and persuasion for adoption, how does each gender respond to social marketing of contraceptives usage? A comparative descriptive survey was conducted among ninety men in Iwo, Osun State, and ninety-five women in General Hospital, Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State. The purposive sampling method was adopted in selecting men and women with previous exposure to social marketing campaigns on family planning. The findings revealed that television and radio, social media, and interactions with doctors/nurses are prominent means through which family planning communication takes place. Through mass and social media, barriers and myths relating to family planning are being eradicated, and access to family planning knowledge and resources is increasing. The media has been able to successfully persuade and change negative attitudes toward contraceptive usage. Findings also showed that while men respondents were not using contraceptives, almost all the women respondents were. Some of the factors that could contribute to the varying responses to behavior change communication on the use of contraceptives between genders have been identified to be individual differences, as well as socio-cultural and religious barriers. The study calls for a new wave of social marketing on contraceptives usage, specifically targeted at transforming the positive attitudes of a proportionate number of men, to actual usage of contraceptives.

T1  - Social Exclusion and Anti-Immigration Attitudes in Europe: The mediating role of Interpersonal Trust
AN  - 2537006504
AB  - Managing immigration is a challenge at the political, economic, and social levels. Clarifying the social psychological antecedents behind the onset of negative attitudes towards immigrants might help overcome this challenge. The present study investigates the relationships between people’s experience of social exclusion, feelings of generalized interpersonal trust, and anti-immigrant attitudes across 23 European countries. We used data from the European Social Survey 8 (2016), employing a representative sample of the European population. A 1–1–1 multilevel mediation model showed that: (a) the higher the experience of social exclusion, the lower the generalized trust towards others; (b) the experience of social exclusion related positively and directly with anti-immigration attitudes; and (c) generalized interpersonal trust mediated the relationship between experienced social exclusion and anti-immigrant attitudes so that the experience of being socially excluded reduced feelings of generalized interpersonal trust that, in turn, promoted hostile attitudes towards immigrants. Taken together, these results create a platform for future research on the emergence of negative attitudes towards immigrants and factors that might facilitate the development of a climate of integration and acceptance.

T1  - Online Social Endorsement and Covid-19 Vaccine Hesitancy in the United Kingdom
AN  - 2547874813
AB  - We explore the implications of online social endorsement for the Covid-19 vaccination program in the United Kingdom. Vaccine hesitancy is a long-standing problem, but it has assumed great urgency due to the pandemic. By early 2021, the United Kingdom had the world’s highest Covid-19 mortality per million of population. Our survey of a nationally representative sample of UK adults (N = 5,114) measured socio-demographics, social and political attitudes, media diet for getting news about Covid-19, and intention to use social media and personal messaging apps to encourage or discourage vaccination against Covid-19. Cluster analysis identified six distinct media diet groups: news avoiders, mainstream/official news samplers, super seekers, omnivores, the social media dependent, and the TV dependent. We assessed whether these media diets, together with key attitudes, including Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy, conspiracy mentality, and the news-finds-me attitude (meaning giving less priority to active monitoring of news and relying more on one’s online networks of friends for information), predict the intention to encourage or discourage vaccination. Overall, super-seeker and omnivorous media diets are more likely than other media diets to be associated with the online encouragement of vaccination. Combinations of (a) news avoidance and high levels of the news-finds-me attitude and (b) social media dependence and high levels of conspiracy mentality are most likely to be associated with online discouragement of vaccination. In the direct statistical model, a TV-dependent media diet is more likely to be associated with online discouragement of vaccination, but the moderation model shows that a TV-dependent diet most strongly attenuates the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and discouraging vaccination. Our findings support public health communication based on four main methods. First, direct contact, through the post, workplace, or community structures, and through phone counseling via local health services, could reach the news avoiders. Second, TV public information advertisements should point to authoritative information sources, such as National Health Service (NHS) and other public health websites, which should then feature clear and simple ways for people to share material among their online social networks. Third, informative social media campaigns will provide super seekers with good resources to share, while also encouraging the social media dependent to browse away from social media platforms and visit reliable and authoritative online sources. Fourth, social media companies should expand and intensify their removal of vaccine disinformation and anti-vax accounts, and such efforts should be monitored by well-resourced, independent organizations.

T1  - A matter of flexibility: Changing outgroup attitudes through messages with negations
AN  - 2518431192
AB  - Attitudes toward outgroups are an important determinant of peaceful coexistence in diverse societies, but it is difficult to improve them. The current research studies the impact of messages with negations on outgroup attitudes, more specifically on outgroup trust. All studies were preregistered. Using different target groups, Studies 1 and 2 provide evidence for the prediction that communicating negations (e.g., "they are not deceptive") enhances outgroup trust (more so than affirmations, such as "they are reliable," and no messages) among people who are initially low in outgroup trust. Three additional studies (Studies 3a, 3b, and 4), using both a causal chain approach and (moderated) mediation analysis, demonstrate that negations promote cognitive flexibility which in turn enhances outgroup trust among those initially low in outgroup trust. One final study suggests that these findings generalize to outgroup attitude change per se by showing that communicating negations also results in more moderate attitudes when the dominant initial attitude is positive (Study 5: high warmth) rather than negative (Studies 1–4: low trustworthiness). As such, communication that negates people's initial outgroup attitudes could be an effective (previously discounted) intervention to reduce prejudice in intergroup settings.

T1  - Rural Youth Inclusion, Empowerment, and Participation
AN  - 2506944345
AB  - This paper focuses on participation in decision-making processes and how rural youth could benefit from its use in development projects and initiatives. General literature and relevant international experiences related to participation mechanisms aimed at youth show that participation boosts interventions linked to improvements of young people’s livelihoods and developmental opportunities. However, participation mechanisms are less explored (and used) in rural settings: we know little of the effectivity of rural participation, even less so for youth, in developing countries. Based on the review of 54 documented cases about participation of rural youth in developing countries, we conclude that participation mechanisms towards rural youth can produce substantial results to enhance the development and social inclusion opportunities through three channels. First, collecting rural youth´s opinions around issues relevant to them through platforms that are sensible to the challenges they face to participate. Second, capitalising rural youth and their organisations, improving their financial assets but also working in character skills and intergenerational partnerships that let them break the status quo. Third, articulating youth with new institutions, organisations, and territories through new links supported by diversification of the urban-rural continuum and new information technologies.

T1  - The Nearness of Youth: Spatial and Temporal Effects of Protests on Political Attitudes in Chile
AN  - 2487421021
AB  - Social movement research indicates that mobilization can effect change in political attitudes, yet few works have systematically tested the effect of protests on public opinion. This article uses survey and protest event data to assess the spatial and temporal effect of mobilizations on political attitudes Chile. It combines the 2008, 2010, and 2012 LAPOP surveys and a dataset of college student protest events, mapping respondents and protests at the municipal level using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Using regression analyses, it finds that proximity to college student protests has a significant effect on various political attitudes. The effect, however, tends to be substantively larger on “weak” attitudes and smaller on “strong” ones. The results highlight the importance of mobilizations in shaping individual political attitudes and the role that social movements play in the policy-making process.

T1  - Developing smart community based on information and communication technology: an experience of Kemaman smart community, Malaysia
TT  - Developing smart community based on ICT
AN  - 2534005868
AB  - PurposeIn light of the rapid evolution of information and communication technology (ICT), every society is faced with many issues such as social exclusion, inequality and the digital divide. Hence, there is need to solve these complex challenges without comprising any development objective. A practical solution in this regard includes establishment of a sustainable model of community development. Therefore, this paper aims to identify the role of education in promoting the awareness on the use of ICT-based infrastructure among the general public to enhance their socioeconomic status. In addition, this study sets out to establish the nexus between socioeconomic status, ICT programme as well as the awareness of Kemaman Smart Community (KSC) development project.Design/methodology/approachThis paper adopted a quantitative approach based on data collected through a survey on information literacy in KSC. The logit behavioural model and structural equation model were adopted as a quantitative technique to verify the objective of the study.FindingsThe result of the logit behavioural model showed that education, income and age have a positive impact on the KSC programme awareness. The SEM models revealed that income level and education (especially at the tertiary level) significantly enhance the awareness of KSC project. On the contrary, poverty remains regressive towards the community awareness of KSC programmessPractical implicationsInformation literacy and knowledge-based programme promote a more inclusive development approach. Moreover, education, socioeconomic status, information literacy and knowledge-based programme are essential to develop a smart community towards achieving a high-income nation status. Future replication of smart community project in other parts of Malaysia may need to consider these factors for a comprehensive community development strategy.Originality/valueKSC is the first smart city initiative by the government of Malaysia. Besides, primary data were used in this study. The findings of the study will provide academics and policymakers a better understanding of the smart city initiative.

T1  - ‘A battlefield for public opinion struggle': how does news consumption from different sources on social media influence government satisfaction in China?
AN  - 2502060120
AB  - While the political influence of the Internet, especially social media, on people’s attitude toward their governments has been widely discussed in western democracies, the situation in authoritarian regimes such as China has not yet been adequately addressed. The current Chinese administration considers social media ‘the main battlefield for public opinion struggle’ between the official discourse and those challenging it. To provide clues about who is shaping the public opinion, this study examined how consuming news from competing information sources on social media influences Chinese citizens’ satisfaction with the central and local government. Based on a nationally representative survey of 2,882 Chinese adults, the study found that consuming news from governmental sources on the country’s major social media platforms – Weibo and WeChat – was positively associated with citizens’ satisfaction with the central government, while exposure to alternative news sources on WeChat had a negative impact on both central and local government satisfaction. Additionally, news consumption from mainstream media sources on social media did not significantly influence the public’s government satisfaction. This paper contributes to the current literature by revealing that social media do not provide a unified agenda and by emphasizing the impact of platform affordances on people’s political attitudes.

T1  - Digital inequalities in the Internet of Things: differences in attitudes, material access, skills, and usage
AN  - 2488860210
AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is more complex and abstract than previous information and communication technologies as there are many connections occurring. New challenges for users arise from increased amount of data, decisions made automatically, less visibility and more ambiguity, and magnified security and privacy risks. There is a fair chance that only a selective group will benefit, making it important to study IoT from a digital inequality perspective. The current study focused on health, home, and security related IoT by conducting a survey among a representative sample of the Dutch population. The study was guided by resources and appropriation theory. IoT attitudes and material access as well as educational and income differences play an important role. Those with higher education and those with higher incomes have more positive attitudes and are the first to actually buy IoT. This also means that they are the first to develop the required skills and to engage in a diverse IoT use. The results suggest that to make the IoT attractive for larger parts of the population, clear terms of use and user-friendly IoT should be an important objective. Stimulating positive attitudes towards IoT will increase the likelihood of IoT ownership, development of IoT skills, and, eventually, a wider diversity of IoT use. Policies should aim to stress the potential outcomes IoT has to offer and should promote transparency and disclosure of how personal data is used as well as better privacy, security practices and regulation.

T1  - A semantic network approach to measuring sentiment
AN  - 2486883778
AB  - Sentiment research is dominated by studies that assign texts to positive and negative categories. This classification is often based on a bag-of-words approach that counts the frequencies of sentiment terms from a predefined vocabulary, ignoring the contexts for these words. We test an aspect-based network analysis model that computes sentiment about an entity from the shortest paths between the sentiment words and the target word across a corpus. Two ground-truth datasets in which human annotators judged whether tweets were positive or negative enabled testing the internal and external validity of the automated network-based method, evaluating the extent to which this approach’s scoring corresponds to the annotations. We found that tweets annotated as negative had an automated negativity score that was nearly twice as strong than positivity, while positively annotated tweets were six times stronger in positivity than negativity. To assess the predictive validity of the approach, we analyzed sentiment associated with coronavirus coverage in television news from January 1 to March 25, 2020. Support was found for the four hypotheses tested, demonstrating the utility of the approach. H1: broadcast news expresses less sentiment about coronavirus, panic, and social distancing than non-broadcast news outlets. H2: there is a negative bias in the news across channels. H3: sentiment increases are associated with an increased volume of news stories. H4: sentiment is associated with uncertainty in news coverage of coronavirus over time. We also found that as the type of channel moved from broadcast network news to 24-h business, general, and foreign news sentiment increased for coronavirus, panic, and social distancing.

T1  - Twitter Fingers and Echo Chambers: Exploring Expressions and Experiences of Online Racism Using Twitter
AN  - 2574778005
AB  - Social media sites, such as Twitter, represent a growing setting in which racism and related stress may manifest. The aims of this exploratory qualitative study were to (1) understand the essence of Twitter users’ lived experience with and response to content about race and racism on the platform, and (2) explore their perceptions of how discussions about race and racism on Twitter may impact health and well-being. We conducted six focus groups and four interviews with adult Twitter users (n = 27) from Berkeley, California, and Greenville, South Carolina. We managed the data with NVivo and conducted an interpretative phenomenological analysis to identify themes. Participants described Twitter content as displaying both overt and subtle expressions of racism, particularly for Black and Latinx people, and serving as an echo chamber where similar viewpoints are amplified. Participants described how Twitter users may feel emboldened to type offensive tweets based on the perception of anonymity, and that these tweets were sometimes met with community disapproval used to provide a collective calibration to restore the social norms of the online space. Participants perceived harmful mental, emotional, and physical health impacts of exposure to racist content on Twitter. Our participants responded to harmful race-related content through blocking users and following others in order to curate their Twitter feeds, actively engaging in addressing content, and reducing Twitter use. Twitter users reported witnessing racism on the platform and have found ways to protect their mental health and cope with discussions of race and racism in this social media environment.

T1  - Virtual Reality and Political Outgroup Contact: Can Avatar Customization and Common Ingroup Identity Reduce Social Distance?
AN  - 2507921931
AB  - This study (N = 217) explores the potential for virtual reality to decrease social distance toward outgroup members among women. Raising the salience of individuals’ real physical identity through avatar customization and common ingroup identity manipulations was theorized to influence social distance. Participants who customized an avatar to resemble their real selves showed increased social distance. However, avatar customization also increased user identifiability, which was linked to reduced social distance. Priming a common ingroup identity increased identity salience but did not influence social distance. In examining heterogeneous effects by prior levels of issue involvement, participants with high and moderate involvement with immigration showed increased social distance after customizing an avatar to resemble their real selves, thus implying boomerang effects. The study discusses how avatar customization, identifiability, and common ingroup primes in virtual encounters may influence outgroup attitudes and intergroup relations.

T1  - Social Media Posts About Racism Leads to Evaluative Backlash for Black Job Applicants
AN  - 2474691735
AB  - Black Americans post about race and race-related issues on social media more than any other racial group. In this study, we investigated whether Black Americans who post about racism on social networking sites (i.e., Facebook) experience evaluative backlash during the employee selection process. Participants (N = 154) were given a Black job candidate’s cover letter, resume, and a scanned printout of their social media. Depending on what condition they were randomly assigned to, the applicant’s social media contained posts about racism or posts that were race neutral. Results indicated that Black individuals whose posts were about racism were evaluated less favorably than Black individuals whose posts were race neutral. Specifically, they were perceived as being less likable. In addition, Black individuals whose social media posts were related to racism were less likely to be offered an interview for a job. Implications, limitations, and future directions are discussed.

The increase of violence in their home country caused about 3 million 666 thousand 59 people to flee to Turkey and they've been experiencing economic, social and cultural problems as well as a problem of acceptance and adaptation. We aimed to evaluate the attitudes of emergency healthcare providers towards refugees and their perception of social distance. Methods This is a methodological study conducted between January-February 2020. The study group consisted of 372 (77.5%) out of 480 healthcare professionals. Attitude towards refugees was evaluated with the Health Providers' Attitude Towards Refugees Scale (HPATRS) developed by the researchers. Questionnaire form included HPATRS and Social Distance Scale(SDS). The Cronbach's alpha value of HPATRS was 0.694. Multiple linear regression was used for multivariate analysis. Results The ages of the study group ranged between 18-60 while the mean age was 32.15 ± 7.50 and 55.1% were female. Of the study group, 50.8% scored below the mean score from HPATRS. Multivariate analysis showed that, having language difficulties, having a master's degree and above and having high social distance was related to negative attitude towards refugees. (F: 7.567 p < 0.001 R²: 0.195). The social distance level was found to be the most important determinant in attitude (β: 0.343). Conclusions The attitude towards refugees in emergency care providers were thought to be not positive enough to eliminate the inequalities. It was concluded that; having a master's degree and above, having more social distance and having language difficulties were risk factors for a negative attitude towards refugees. Key messages    As the first responders, emergency workers’ attitudes towards refugees is an important issue to be addressed in eliminating health inequalities.   Mass media campaigns should be used to reduce social distance and trainings should be planned in order to develop positive attitudes towards refugees.

T1  - The challenge of heritability: genetic determinants of beliefs and their implications
AN  - 2451517013
AB  - Ethical and political attitudes are not randomly distributed in a population. Attitudes of family members, for example, tend to be more similar than those of a random sample of the same size. In the fields of social psychology and political science, the historically standard explanation for these attitude distribution patterns was that social and political attitudes are (at least partially) a function of environmental factors like parental socialization and prevailing social norms. This received view is, however, complicated by more recent work in behavioral genetics, which consistently and repeatedly demonstrates that certain ethical and political attitudes dealing with issues like censorship, abortion, capital punishment, and immigration policy have a significant heritability coefficient, to wit, a substantial percentage of attitude variance in a population can be attributed to genetic variance, independent of environmental factors. In this paper, I argue that the genetic influence on our ethical and political attitudes is mediated by what we can agree to be irrelevant and distorting factors that can lead moral reasoning astray. Further, I argue that we should significantly lower our credences in ethical and political attitudes that fall within the domains of belief that involve significant genetic influence.

T1  - BRAZILIAN RACE RELATIONS, FRENCH SOCIAL SCIENTISTS, AND AFRICAN DECOLONIZATION: A TRANSATLANTIC HISTORY OF THE IDEA OF MISCEGENATION
AN  - 2430935711
AB  - This article analyzes how debates concerning Brazilian race relations, miscegenation, and racial democracy unfolded in France in the 1950s. During those years, Gilberto Freyre and those critical of him emerged in French social scientific discourse, offering distinct visions concerning race, culture, and the possibility of harmonious coexistence in a world structured by racial, social, and colonial inequalities. Certain French social scientists such as Lucien Febvre and Fernand Braudel embraced Freyre's vision as a possible source for racial and cultural mixing, whereas others, especially Alfred Métraux and Florestan Fernandes, directly criticized his work. Roger Bastide mediated between the two, translating Freyre's Casa-Grande & Senzala and coauthoring a UNESCO-based study on blacks and whites in São Paulo that largely repudiated Freyre's claims. I argue that in a period in which decolonization was already underway, Freyre piqued the interest of French social scientists looking to overcome the growing antagonism between colonizer and colonized, even if other models of cultural integration and autonomy contested the validity of Brazil's so-called racial democracy.

T1  - Race in Cyberspace: College Students’ Moral Identity and Engagement with Race-Related Issues on Social Media
AN  - 2423654666
AB  - This quantitative study explored social media usage among college students attending urban public universities in the Southeastern U.S., focusing on their engagement with race-related issues online and examining whether this engagement was related to moral identity. Multiple regression analyses indicated that frequent social media use and race were significant predictors of online responses to race-related issues (when compared to age, gender, and religiosity) and that, among White students, there was a strong positive association between high symbolization of moral identity and engagement with race-related issues online. This study is meant to help educators recognize ways in which students’ moral identity and social media use may be facilitating or impeding race relations online and to present specific actions they can take to address racism on social media.

T1  - The China-Pakistan economic corridor: The Pakistani media attitudes perspective
AN  - 2462673891
AB  - The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative. How Pakistani media coverage shapes the CPEC is related to public attitudes towards the project and may even affect the success or failure of the initiative in Pakistan. This paper examines Pakistani media coverage on the CPEC by constructing and analyzing semantic networks of the news from the top three English media from 2015 to 2018. We detect the sentimental polarity of news coverage on the CPEC, focusing on the words used in the news and determining how the media frames the CPEC in Pakistan. Then, we construct semantic networks of the negative, neutral and positive documents. Network analysis is used to determine the characteristics of the different sentiment networks, which words hold significant positions, and how the negative central concepts are associated with describing the apprehension towards and obstacles related to the CPEC. The results show that most coverage exhibits a positive attitude towards the CPEC. Negative sentiment towards the CPEC is illustrated through more diverse messaging, demonstrating greater cohesiveness than the larger, less-connected positive network. The identified negative central topics are India, security, region, parties, issues, Afghanistan, Kashmir, debt, loans, situation, disputes, cost, opposition and peace, which are framed around apprehension and skepticism regarding the CPEC and the stability of the environment of its construction. In contrast, the most significant words in the positive network are progress, important, support, benefit, prosperity, enhance, improve, and boost, highlighting the potential economic returns and political guarantees. Semantic network analysis of the sentiments expressed in the Pakistani media regarding the CPEC can improve our understanding of Pakistani attitudes towards the CPEC. Our research combines quantitative and qualitative evidence to study media coverage in Pakistan, which can provide insights regarding the communications used to improve confidence in the CPEC and can also improve our understanding of the Belt and Road Initiative.

T1  - Determinants of political behavior and the role of technology in the classroom: An empirical investigation in Brazil
AN  - 2462673775
AB  - University professors face numerous challenges, especially when teaching issues related to political behavior. Recent studies in Brazil have shown that technology, clarity of information and impartial debates in the classroom have led to the development of more frequent political behaviors among Brazilian students. However, this research subject remains poorly addressed in Brazil. We investigated the development of political attitudes and political behavior of undergraduate students in Brasília, Brazil. We applied questionnaires to students (N = 349) in undergraduate courses (social, exact and health sciences) of a public university in Brasília (Federal District), capital of Brazil. Principal Components Analysis was used and three dimensions of political attitudes were created: (i) Degree of political knowledge Factor (PK), (ii) Positive Feelings about Politics Factor (PFP) and (ii) Negative Feelings about Politics Factor (NFP). The results suggest that students from social sciences undergraduate courses have a higher PK average in comparison to other student groups. Moreover, a linear regression model was developed for PFP factor. For PFP and NFP, the students from the social sciences areas were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Based on the outcomes of this study, we argue that it is essential for teachers to be aware of the importance of introducing themes related to political behavior in the classroom, considering the influence that political attitudes have on political behavior. It is the professor's role to stimulate impartial debate, free of personal preferences while presenting arguments from the students' arguments, in order to promote the scientific understanding of these subjects.

T1  - ‘That is why we raise children’: African American fathers' race-related concerns for their adolescents and parenting strategies
AN  - 2460974833
AB  - Introduction
The current study highlights the voices and perspectives of African American fathers, with specific emphasis on their race-related concerns for their adolescents as well as how these concerns guide their parenting strategies.
Method
Twenty-four African American fathers participated in 1.5–3 h long focus group interviews. All fathers (M = 42.24 years, SD = 6.93) resided in a mid-sized city in the Southeastern United States. All participants were either biological fathers (n = 20) or non-biological (n = 4) fathers. Fathers were residential (76%) and non-residential (24%), with at least one adolescent child (M = 14.32 years, SD = 5.80; Range: 10–16 years). Fifty-eight percent of fathers (n = 14) had both male and female children, 29% had only female children (n = 7) and 13% had only male children (n = 3). After codebook development and refinement, key themes were explored using a theoretical thematic analysis.
Results
In response to race-related and other social risks for African American adolescents, fathers articulated a number of parenting motivations and intentions: 1) fathers' own racial experiences; 2) negative media images of Black youth and families (e.g. media influences, negative stereotypes, and portrayals of Black fathers); 3) preserving families through community support; 4) developing awareness of discrimination and coping strategies; 5) cultivating positive personal and cultural identities; and 6) achievement as necessity. Also, gender emerged as a critical lens for African American fathers’ concerns and parenting strategies.
Conclusion
Overall, our investigation highlights African American fathers’ own meaning-making around concerns for their adolescents as well as how they shape parenting processes.

T1  - “Distant Participation” and Youth Political Attitudes: Evidence from a Natural Experiment
AN  - 2427515795
AB  - ObjectiveIn this article, we explore the seldom studied concept of “distant participation,” defined as the experience of social movements (such as receiving information from online media) from overseas. Online media may affect people's political attitudes, but how people use online media is also contingent upon their political attitudes.MethodWe take advantage of a natural experiment to deal with this endogenous selection problem. Our treatment group consists of college students who happened to join a short‐term overseas exchange program during the Umbrella Movement, which had an unexpectedly large turnout in Hong Kong. These students had a different mode of participation in the event from their peers physically in Hong Kong. The experience, including intensive exposure to online media, changed their media consumption habits, and hence their political attitudes.ResultsWe find that the treatment group is more likely to report using online media to obtain news. They also have a stronger sense of political efficacy and significantly weaker national identity. We, however, find no significant difference between the treatment and control groups regarding civic and political participation.ConclusionThis study provides a rare contribution to the study of the effect of online media by tackling the problem of selection. The concept of distant participation should also be given more attention given the ease of population flow and technological advancement nowadays.

T1  - Race and Media: A Critical Essay Acknowledging the Current State of Race-Related Media Effects Research and Directions for Future Exploration
AN  - 2400040451
AB  - The following article illuminates how race-related media effects research creates a space for race to be represented within quantitative literature. However, it presents barriers towards inclusion regarding the examination of diverse audiences and distinct media content, while also normalizing existing patterns of hierarchy by concentrating on the implications of White viewers. To address this, the following text presents a synthesis of previous race-related media effects research and discusses applicable theoretical frameworks. More importantly, this piece offers suggestions for future direction where diverse audiences and media content are centered, various inclusive social contexts are contemplated, and the expansiveness of mass media platforms, as well as the adoption of theories, inside and outside of the discipline, are brought into the dialogue. These recommendations are offered to champion creating a more equitable landscape regarding the future of race-related media effects research.

T1  - Exploring Ethnic Identity Through Social Networking Sites: A Q Methodology Study With Immigrant-Origin College Students
AN  - 2396274689
AB  - In this mixed methods study, Q methodology was used to identify patterns of ethnic identity exploration via social networking sites for college students from multiethnic, immigrant-origin backgrounds. Drawing from the community cultural wealth (CCW) social capital framework (Yosso, 2005), a Q-sort of 47 statements was constructed. Based on factor analysis, 3 resultant factor groups emerged: Active Explorers, Limited Explorers, and Filtered Explorers. Variability between groups in social capital, as reflected in social networking sites use, has implications for understanding ethnic identity exploration trajectories for immigrant-origin college students.

T1  - The Potentials of Digital Collaborative Platforms for the Innovation of Refugees’ Reception Strategies
AN  - 2394528882
AB  - The article presents a reflection on the possibilities that the information technologies and new apps developed in the context of the sharing economy may have in the processes of receiving refugees. In recent years, the narrative of migratory phenomena has emphasised the idea of an “out of control emergency”, negatively affecting the ability to imagine constructive answers to arising situations. After a review of definitions, numbers and reception practices in Italy, the article focuses on the inclusive models made possible by using digital collaborative platforms. The case of Refugees Welcome, an association that uses an online platform to connect people offering a room with refugees looking for a place in which to live is analysed in order to better understand its working model, using a mix of qualitative and quantitative data. The conclusion provides a reflection on the potential that this kind of approach may have in promoting social inclusion processes and supporting active citizenship among all individuals both directly and indirectly involved in the association’s activities.

T1  - Getting the specialization right. Industrialization in Southern China in a sustainable development perspective
AN  - 2350927994
AB  - Information and communication technologies (ICT) are acknowledged as a powerful tool used to foster development and to broaden people's agency. This being so, ICT are also the results of specific production processes. And, little attention has been given to the degree of sustainability that the places that are currently in charge of producing ICT attain. In this framework, we investigate under what conditions specializing in ICT products rewards a territory in terms of technological innovation and socially sustainable development. Our analysis focuses on the case of Dongguan city, China, which is a core area in the global production of ICT. Industrialization in this area has been mainly FDI-led and framed within a Province-level industrial specialization policy – the Specialized Towns program. We perform an empirical analysis based upon a unique township-level dataset covering several years (2000–2016). We then integrate the quantitative data with qualitative fieldwork information on Dongguan ICT-specialized townships. Our findings suggest that (1) specializing in ICT can pay in terms of innovative performances, provided it is supported by an institutional setting aimed at collectively promoting innovation, a sufficient degree of extra-cluster relations and a sufficiently high level of education of the population. (2) Social sustainability can be improved in ICT clusters by long experience in public involvement towards building collective action. Since many of these areas do not currently show to have reached such social and economic conditions, they risk being captured in a middle income-low development trap. Governments targeting ICT specialization should then focus also on devoting specific policy initiatives towards social inclusion.

T1  - Media of Contempt: Social Media Consumption Predicts Normative Acceptance of Anti-Muslim Hate Speech and Islamoprejudice
AN  - 2444990891
AB  - The new era of information technology brings new opportunities but also poses new threats. In our paper, we examine whether a shift from traditional print and broadcasting to new online media results in the increased normalization of hate speech towards minorities, and whether this change can subsequently increase prejudice towards minorities. Our research uses data from a representative two-wave longitudinal survey of Polish adults. In wave 1 (N = 1060), data on respondents' primary sources of information about the world (TV, newspapers, radio, online, social media, blogs) was collected. Wave 2 (N = 628), conducted six months later, included measures of perceived normativity of anti-Muslim hate speech and Islamophobia. We found that respondents who were frequent social media users expressed higher levels of Islamoprejudice and perceived higher normativity of antiMuslim hate speech than the respondents who got their news from traditional mass media. We also found that an increase in perceived normativity of anti-Muslim hate speech can act as one of the mechanisms through which use of social media is linked to higher Islamoprejudice.

T1  - What is with all the hate? A thematic analysis of New Zealanders' attitudes to the Human Rights Commission's 'Give nothing to racism' social marketing campaign
AN  - 2417373165
AB  - This article explores the attitudes of New Zealanders to the social marketing campaign 'Give nothing to racism'. Thematic analysis was applied to a series of comments posted on the New Zealand Human Rights Commission (HRC)'s Facebook page. The analysis revealed four key themes: 'It starts at the top'; 'White people are victims too'; 'What is racism anyway?'; and We are all equal'. These themes showed that the campaign did not create a single, unified desire among audiences to overcome racism. Posts from the public ranged from commending the HRC for stamping out racism to condemnation for shedding light on an issue that some felt was non-existent in New Zealand society or which unfairly targeted 'white New Zealanders'. The campaign appeared to produce ethnocentric and prejudiced responses, and the comments were evidence of in-group favouritism and othering of Maori. This article contends that social media platforms are spaces where "bullying, offensive content and hate speech" (Mondal, Silva & Benevenuto, 2017, p.85) can undermine social marketing and attempts to establish social cohesion and unity.

T1  - Can We Talk About Race? Exploring Online Comments about Race-Related Shootings
AN  - 2328366433
AB  - A quantitative content analysis was conducted of online comments (N = 1,840) posted on news stories about 4 shooting deaths involving Black Americans and police officers to assess how Americans talk about race in the digital space. Findings showed that uncivil attributes, such as profanity or name-calling, were more frequent than deliberative attributes, such as using evidence to support one's point. Findings suggested there are scant but meaningful deliberative discussions about race in the comments we studied, but incivility mires that conversation. Results are discussed in terms of critical race theory and deliberative democracy.

T1  - Numbers, Narratives, and Nation: Mainstream News Coverage of U.S. Latino Population Growth, 1990–2010
AN  - 2406941440
AB  - Ideologies that support racial domination and White supremacy remain foundational in U.S. society, even as the nation becomes increasingly diverse and progressively focused on quantitative measurement. This study explores how a prominent mainstream news outlet represents the growth of the nation’s second largest population, Latinos, within this changing demographic and numeric environment. Drawing from two frameworks, the Latino Threat Narrative and Color-Blind Racism, quantitative and qualitative analyses are conducted with 174 Los Angeles Times (LAT) articles about 2000 and 2010 census results. Reporters for the LAT, located in the single most important U.S. location for Latinos, frame Latinos and their population dynamics in line with the overtly racist narrative of Latino threat and the covertly racist ideology of color-blind racism. Moreover, the analyses reveal that quantitative logics circulating in the present evaluative climate further the view that Latinos pose cultural-demographic threats to the nation. Quantification also enhances color-blind frames and rhetorical strategies justifying present-day racial stratification and the subordinate locations of non-White groups. This suggests how White supremacy retains its power as the populations and metrics of evaluation change. Finally, given recent research linking demographic trends and media representations with attitudes, policy positions, and political partisanship, these representations have implications for the well-being of Latinos, other populations, and the nation.

T1  - Race relations, nationalism and the humanitarian Rohingya crisis in contemporary Myanmar
AN  - 2262002121
AB  - The recent ethnic tensions in Myanmar especially in the Rakhine state has once again placed the country onto the centre stage of global media attention. The aim of this paper is to look at race relations in contemporary Myanmar with a special focus on the Rohingya community. The paper argues that problematic race relations in the country today should be analysed within a certain historical context and should be seen as part of a historical continuum. This paper places a lot of importance on this historical continuum. In this connection, the British colonial policies of divide and conquer, politicians and their obsession with Buddhism and trying to make it the state religion shortly after independence in 1948, and the xenophobic policies followed by the military junta after 1962 deserve special mention. The paper further argues that the current state of affairs and escalation in violence has happened recently because of the convergence of the activities and ideologies of certain political groups like the military junta, the National League for Democracy, the Arakan League for Democracy, and the role played by certain Buddhist extremist groups like the MaBaTha in Burmese politics. To ease the existing tension in the Rakhine, the central government would need to take a more federally minded approach and introduce meaningful democracy and development in the frontier parts of the country where there is a strong ethnic minority presence.

T1  - Impacts of Internet on Openness to Change in China: Millennials Versus Pre‐Millennials
AN  - 2259659515
AB  - ObjectiveThis article explores whether there are different consequences from Internet use—in the form of changed political attitudes—for older Chinese as compared to their younger counterparts.MethodsUsing data from a nationwide representative survey of Chinese adults, analyses include both cross‐tabulation and multiple regression.ResultsIt is found that millennials are more open to political change than are older Chinese, that older Internet users—as compared to older nonusers—have attitudes more similar to those of millennials, and that differences in attitudes are greater between older users and nonusers than between millennial users and nonusers.ConclusionThe findings support the conclusion that Internet use has had greater consequences for changed political attitudes for older Chinese than for their younger counterparts.

T1  - Addressing Women and Minorities on Social Media by the 2016 U.S. Presidential Candidates
AN  - 2256068507
AB  - Donald Trump’s bombastic statements regarding women and minorities were a constant theme in the 2016 presidential election and attracted attention from both the mainstream media and his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Given the increasing use of social networking sites among political actors and the public, as well as the focus given to women and minorities in the 2016 election, we utilize a content analysis of presidential candidates’ social media activity in the months preceding the election in order to better understand how the candidates addressed women and minorities. We ultimately find that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton out-posted Trump in both positive and negative content in the categories of women’s issues; lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender issues; race; and immigration. However, this is not the case with issues involving crime and police, which was a lens through which Trump was more likely to approach race-related issues. In many instances, the candidates also appeared to strategically target content-specific posts to the social media platforms where they would be most likely to be seen by women or the minority group most closely related to the post’s content.

T1  - Awareness of Indirect Information Disclosure on Social Network Sites
AN  - 2313791314
AB  - This research investigates user awareness and attitudes toward potential inferences of information posted on social network sites (SNSs). The study reports how user attitudes change after exposure to inferences made based upon information they have disclosed on an SNS, namely, on Facebook. To demonstrate this, two sub-studies involving three focus group sessions were conducted with Facebook users. In the first sub-study, the users received a general introduction to information that can be inferred from posts by using a prototypical privacy-enhancement tool called DataBait. Then, the second sub-study allowed the users to witness the potential inferences of their own Facebook photos and posts by using the DataBait tool. Next, qualitative content analysis was conducted to analyze the results, and these showed that the participants’ attitudes toward privacy on SNSs changed from affective to cognitive when they became aware of potential inferences from actual information posted on their own Facebook accounts. The results imply that end users require more cognitive awareness regarding their genres of disclosure and the effect of their disclosures on their privacy. Moreover, as privacy awareness is contextual, there is a need for more research and development of online tools that will allow users to manage and educate themselves.

T1  - Examining the effects of news coverage linking undocumented immigrants with criminality: Policy and punitive implications
AN  - 2185851746
AB  - Although research suggests that there is no meaningful real-world connection between crime rates and undocumented immigrants, media coverage of this group almost exclusively portrays them as criminals. The present two-study investigation experimentally tests the effects of exposure to crime news depicting undocumented immigrant suspects on White viewers' social judgments. To this end, assumptions from social identity theory were applied to research and theorizing on mediated intergroup threat and compound penalties for immigrant criminality. Results from Study 1 and Study 2 indicate that when White viewers are exposed to threatening crime news featuring undocumented immigrants, out-group bias emerges in the form of harsher sentencing. In Study 1, when exposed to highly threatening coverage, attitudes toward immigration and in-group identification partially mediated and moderated this relationship, respectively.

AN  - 2473006258
AB  - This research project aims to assess how information and communication technologies (ICTs) are a tool for the social integration of disadvantaged groups. To that end, we studied a group of young people in social exclusion from the Initial Professional Qualification Programs of the Federico Ozanam Foundation in Zaragoza (Spain); we focused on the relationship between their level of digital literacy and their feeling of integration in the main social group. We evaluated their social capacities, their life skills as defined by the World Health Organization, their relational and informative habits and their feeling of empowerment in digital contexts. The goal was to find out if the relationship between these factors and their feeling of integration was directly proportional. The results were positive for most of the indicatives studied.Alternate abstract: Esta investigación analiza cómo las tecnologías de la información y la comunicación (TIC) son una herramienta para la integración social de grupos desfavorecidos. Para ello, se ha estudiado la relación existente entre el grado de competencia digital de un grupo de jóvenes en exclusión social de los Programas de Cualificación Profesional Inicial de la Fundación Federico Ozanam de Zaragoza (España) y su sentimiento de pertenencia al grupo social mayoritario. Se ha evaluado la posesión de capacidades sociales, las denominadas habilidades para la vida establecidas por la Organización Mundial de la Salud, los hábitos relacionales e informativos y el sentimiento de empoderamiento de la muestra en contextos digitales. El objetivo era averiguar si existía una relación directamente proporcional entre estos factores y el sentimiento de integración.

T1  - Family Communication Problems, Psychosocial Adjustment and Cyberbullying
AN  - 2329436297
AB  - [...]since cyberbullying occurs through technological means, the authors consider it worthwhile to explore other variables relating to PUSNS [41,42,43].

PUSNS is defined as an individual being overly concerned about social networking sites (SNSs), to be driven by a strong motivation to log on or use SNSs, and to devote so much time and effort to SNSs that it impairs other social activities, studies or work, interpersonal relationships, and physical and mental health and wellbeing [44,45,46].

In terms of gender, previous studies have also indicated that gender is a relevant variable when problematic online behaviors and cyberbullying are considered.

[...]girls more often use social networking sites that allow them to communicate with their peers [51,52] whereas boys spend more time on other activities such as video games or visiting web pages [53].

Regarding attitude towards institutional authority, previous authors have observed that adolescent boys have a positive attitude towards the transgression of social norms, unlike girls, who show higher levels of positive attitude towards institutional authority [35].

[...]examining positive and non-positive tweets may provide a fuller picture of the social context of a place.

To provide a measure of social climate in relation to race and ethnicity and address prior limitations of self-reported, individual-level measures, we employed mixed methods to (1) examine variation in sentiment regarding tweets using one or more race-related terms, and (2) identify emerging themes of the tweets.

Social Media Data Collection and Processing From March 2015–April 2016, we utilized Twitter’s Streaming Application Programming Interface (API) to continuously collect a random sample of publicly available tweets.

To conduct sentiment analysis on tweets with references to racial and ethnic minorities, we used the Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGD), an optimization method that minimizes a given loss function [30], in Python software version 2.7 (Python Software Foundation, Wilmington, DE, USA).

T1  - Facebook news and (de)polarization: reinforcing spirals in the 2016 US election
AN  - 2019372483
AB  - The rise of social media, and specifically Facebook, as a dominant force in the flow of news in the United States has led to concern that people incur greater isolation from diverse perspectives through filter bubbles (from algorithmic filtering) and echo chambers (from an information environment populated by social recommendations coming from overwhelmingly like-minded others). This evolution in news diffusion comes at a time when Americans report increased affective partisan polarization. In particular, evidence shows increasingly negative attitudes about out-party members. Based on selective exposure and reinforcing spirals model perspectives, we examined the reciprocal relationship between Facebook news use and polarization using national 3-wave panel data collected during the 2016 US Presidential Election. Over the course of the campaign, we found media use and attitudes remained relatively stable. Our results also showed that Facebook news use was related to a modest over-time spiral of depolarization. Furthermore, we found that people who use Facebook for news were more likely to view both pro- and counter-attitudinal news in each wave. Our results indicated that counter-attitudinal news exposure increased over time, which resulted in depolarization. We found no evidence of a parallel model, where pro-attitudinal exposure stemming from Facebook news use resulted in greater affective polarization.

T1  - Web Accessibility for People with Disabilities in the European Union: Paving the Road to Social Inclusion
AN  - 2124999155
AB  - Despite the drawbacks and the challenges highlighted by several scholars, Information and Communication Technology (ICT), in particular the World Wide Web, has the potential to foster social inclusion of people with disabilities. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which entered into force in 2008, has illuminated the role technology can play as a tool to promote the human rights of people with disabilities, and their participation and inclusion in society. The UNCRPD has also conceptualized ICT accessibility as a precondition for the enjoyment of rights, prompting a series of reforms in domestic legal frameworks globally and in the European Union (EU). Against this background, this article aims to address the role played by the EU in fostering “digital inclusion”, and critically evaluates relevant EU policies and legal rules, locating them within the broader realm of the implementation of the UNCRPD. It pays particular attention to Directive 2016/2102 on the accessibility of the websites and mobile applications of public sector bodies, as well as on the proposal for a European Accessibility Act (EAA). It attempts to show that, while the EU has thus far played an extremely important role in fostering web accessibility, many remaining obstacles must be eradicated to fully ensure access to the web to people with disabilities. This article adopts a doctrinal legal research methodology and is primarily concerned with the analysis of relevant legal rules and related scholarship. In addition, it is informed by a socially-oriented understanding of disability and builds upon the multifaceted and multidisciplinary literature on disability and technology.

T1  - “Incorrigible slag,” the case of Jennifer Murphy's HIV non-disclosure: Gender norm policing and the production of gender-class-race categories in Canadian news coverage
AN  - 2086364695
AB  - In Canada, HIV non-disclosure is a criminal offence captured under the rubric of aggravated sexual assault. How the crime is reported, however, supports dominant gender schema that are constituted in relation to class and race. This article uses the critical discourse paradigm to analyze the narrative discourses in news reports about Jennifer Murphy, charged with HIV non-disclosure, in relation to both gender policing and the broader case of her over-representation alongside the over-representation of racialized men. Doing a close reading of the narratives used by reporters, within their social, political, and ideological contexts reveals that, in the case of Murphy, as in the case of racialized men, unsafe sexual bodies are a trope for other power relations.

T1  - Multiple sexual violence prevention tools: doses and boosters
TT  - Multiple sexual violence prevention tools
AN  - 2533894276
AB  - PurposeSexual violence prevention programs on college campuses have proliferated in recent years. While research has also increased, a number of questions remain unanswered that could assist campus administrators in making evidence-based decisions about implementation of prevention efforts. To that end, the field of prevention science has highlighted the need to examine the utility of booster sessions for enhancing prevention education. The purpose of this paper is to examine how two methods of prevention delivery – small group educational workshops and a community-wide social marketing campaign (SMC) – worked separately and together to promote attitude change related to sexual violence among college students.Design/methodology/approachThe two-part study was conducted at two universities. Participants were from successive cohorts of first year students and randomly assigned to participate in a bystander based in-person sexual violence prevention program or a control group. Participants were later exposed to a bystander based sexual violence prevention SMC either before or after a follow-up survey. Analyses investigated if attitudes varied by exposure group (program only, SMC only, both program and SMC, no prevention exposure).FindingsResults revealed benefits of the SMC as a booster for attitude changes related to being an active bystander to prevent sexual violence. Further, students who first participated in the program showed enhanced attitude effects related to the SMC.Originality/valueThis is the first study to look at the combination of effects of different sexual violence prevention tools on student attitudes. It also showcases a method for how to investigate if prevention tools work separately and together.

T1  - Critical GIS as a tool for social transformation
AN  - 2011242165
AB  - When Critical GIS emerged in the 1990s and gained momentum in the 2000s, its potential for enabling progressive social change generated considerable excitement. By combining the powers of mapping, information technologies, and critical social theory, it promised new possibilities for acting upon the growing social contradictions of the neoliberal era. Critical GIS seemed to open a pragmatic plane of action by fusing progressive geographic imaginations with concrete and tangible maps. As I reflect on the state of critical GIS in the middle of the second decade of the 21st century, new configurations of class power, patriarchy, and racism are rapidly reshaping our social and geopolitical worlds and are precipitating environmental destruction. Yet, I attempt to develop the idea that GIS is a tool for social transformation because it can produce new cartographies and spaces of possibility and build and expand geographies of hope and care that change social imaginaries in favour of non‐hierarchical class, gender, and race relations. In short, critical GIS scholarship both engages ongoing progressive politics and can create new possibilities for change. In particular, I examine two interventions of critical GIS: creating cartographies of solidarity and teaching.Alternate abstract:La science de l'information géographique critique comme outil de transformation socialeLorsque la science de l'information géographique critique est apparue durant les années 1990 et a gagné en popularité au cours des années 2000, son potentiel pour un changement social progressif a suscité un enthousiasme considérable. En combinant les potentiels de la cartographie, des technologies de l'information et de la théorie sociale critique, elle a ouvert de nouvelles possibilités de tirer parti des contradictions sociales croissantes de l’ère néolibérale. Elle a semblé ouvrir un plan d'action pragmatique en fusionnant des vues géographiques progressives avec des cartes concrètes et tangibles. Alors que je réfléchis à l’état de la science de l'information géographique critique au milieu de la deuxième décennie du 21e siècle, de nouvelles configurations du pouvoir des classes, du patriarcat et du racisme redéfinissent rapidement notre monde géopolitique et social et précipitent le déclin environnemental. Pourtant, je tente de développer l'idée que les SIG sont un outil de transformation sociale parce qu'il peut produire de nouvelles cartographies et de nouveaux espaces de possibilités et bâtir et étendre des géographies de l'espoir et de la bienveillance qui changent l'imaginaire social au profit de relations de classes, de genres et de races non hiérarchiques. Bref, le cursus d’études en science de l'information géographique critique implique des politiques progressistes et peut également créer de nouvelles possibilités pour le changement. J'ai examiné plus particulièrement deux interventions : la création de cartographies de solidarité et pédagogiques.

T1  - E-government: Accessing public services online: Implications for citizenship
AN  - 2002587329
AB  - In this Viewpoint we wish to stimulate debate concerning the impact on citizens of the move to deliver more and more public services online (e-government) in urban and rural areas. It is now widely accepted that we are moving more and more online as society. However, there has been a lack of discussion about the implications of the government’s strategy to move services online especially for those most disadvantaged. The increasing focus and use of Information and Communication Technologies is changing the ways we can access public services, goods and services and health information. There is an increasing separation between those who have the skills, knowledge and economic resources to do so with those who do not – how we ensure full citizenship for all remains unanswered if not too often unconsidered.

T1  - REPEATING HISTORY: HAS THE MEDIA CHANGED SINCE THE KERNER COMMISSION?
AN  - 2233853236
AB  - The riots in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland, are reminiscent of unrest that occurred during the Sixties in major cities like Detroit, Watts, and Newark. In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson assembled The National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, better known as the Kerner Commission, with an assignment to investigate the causes of riots and civil unrest in major metropolitan areas across the United States during the mid-Sixties. Among the many questions asked by the Commission, President Johnson wanted to know "What effects do the mass media have on the riots?" Within the conclusions contained in the final report, the Commission noted that while the media made a good-faith effort to factually chronicle the unrest plaguing the nation, journalists "failed to adequately report the causes and consequence of civil disorders and the underlying problems with race relations." The Commission made several recommendations, including encouraging media outlets to focus more attention on significant issues facing African-Americans and improve diversity in the newsroom. But five decades after the Kerner Commission's recommendations, has the media made any progress toward reporting issues important to the minority communities or improve newsroom diversity? Did the media adequately explore the causes and problems that contributed to the unrest in communities like Ferguson, Baltimore, and other cities across the nation? And fifty years later, is the question, "What effects did the mass media have on the riots" in cities like Baltimore and Ferguson still applicable? Repeating History: Has the Media Changed Since the Kerner Commission provides historical context between the media's role in covering race relations, exploring problems facing minorities, and reporting civil unrest during the Sixties and present day America. Using the recommendations suggested by the Kerner Commission, this paper evaluates the state of newsroom diversity fifty years after the Commission's report was issued and discusses whether the media has made any progress toward examining the issues and concerns that contribute to civil unrest and race relations in the United States.

T1  - Recovering from social exclusion: The interplay of subtle Facebook reminders and collectivistic orientation
AN  - 1980099614
AB  - The sense of being connected with others through Social Networking Sites (SNS) can counteract feelings of loneliness. We examined whether subtle reminders of Facebook, the largest SNS, mitigate people's responses to ostracism (i.e., being ignored and excluded), taking into account individual differences in collectivistic orientation. We examined two typical responses to ostracism: interest in social contact (Study 1) and the need to belong (Study 2). After being included or ostracized in Cyberball, a Facebook (vs. Word) icon was displayed on the margin of a computer screen while participants focused on a primary task. We found three-way interactions between icon presentation, ostracism, and participants' horizontal collectivism. In the Facebook-icon (vs. Word-icon) condition, ostracized (vs. included) participants with higher (vs. lower) collectivistic orientation exhibited less compensatory interest in social contact (Study 1) and a greater recovery of their need to belong (Study 2). A meta-analytical synthesis of the effect sizes from the two studies suggests a significant, medium-sized effect of the moderation by collectivistic orientation. The findings suggest that thoughts about being connected through SNS can help people cope with threats to belonging, especially those who cherish relationships with equal others.

T1  - Colorblind Individualism, Color Consciousness, and the Indian Child Welfare Act: Representations of Adoptee Best Interest in Newspaper Coverage of the Baby Veronica Case
AN  - 2558485227
AB  - Transracial adoption debates revolve around adoptee best interest with support focusing on individual rights and opposition emphasizing identity. How the media portrayed the Baby Veronica case highlights tensions between colorblind individualism and collective color consciousness central to the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). Content analysis of 262 mainstream and Native American newspaper articles illustrates the complex use of both frameworks with Native American sources more often noting the importance of tribal ties and drawing from a more diverse range of authorities. Findings have implications for public attitudes regarding tribal rights, adoption and foster care policies and practices, and the future of ICWA.

T1  - Social network sites influence recovery from social exclusion: Individual differences in social anxiety
AN  - 1939943921
AB  - Social network sites (SNSs) have been found to be closely associated with responses to social exclusion and to impact people with high or low levels of social anxiety in different ways. Our study tested whether social anxiety, an individual difference variable, affected the association between SNSs and responses to social exclusion. A Cyberball game was conducted to create social exclusion, followed by a waiting period during which participants were observed to see whether they would choose to use SNSs. Afterwards, recovery from participants' negative responses to exclusion was measured. Results showed that using SNSs benefited the highly socially anxious (HSA) group in terms of recovering from disconnection and feeling a sense of meaningful existence more than the low socially anxious (LSA) group. However, recovery from disconnection was lower for LSA individuals who used SNSs than those who did not use SNSs. Our research suggests that SNSs benefited HSA individuals after social exclusion, but hindered the recovery of LSA individuals.

T1  - Kicking out the trolls – Antecedents of social exclusion intentions in Facebook groups
AN  - 1939928236
AB  - When contributing to groups on social networking sites (SNS), not all group members necessarily adhere to the group's norms (i.e., its explicit or implicit rules); in other words, they show norm-deviant behavior. Despite the popularity of groups on SNS and the frequency of norm-deviant behavior within them, research has to date rarely investigated how members of online groups react to those behaviors. This article introduces a model based on the social identity approach regarding the responses to norm-deviations in Facebook groups and reports an experiment testing this model. In this experiment, deviant members were perceived as questioning what the group stands for (i.e., as subverting the group's identity). Perceptions of identity subversion, in turn, motivated group members to derogate and exclude the deviate. Furthermore, participants were found to ignore the deviate's contributions (i.e., not to recall them after reading the group's timeline). Taken together, the results suggest that group members perceive a deviate's behavior as questioning their group's image. This, however, does not seem to lead to a group's decay, but rather promotes a "natural purification" within the group through elimination of negative influences.

T1  - (In)civility and online deliberation: readers' reactions to race-related news stories
AN  - 1938645692
AB  - Reacting to an increase in gratuitous racist and sexist comments made by readers in response to online articles, media outlets in South Africa have begun closing down their comments sections, an action that has been repeated many times over across the globe. After a particularly abusive tirade against a young women who wrote an article about being black in Cape Town, Independent Media established an advisory panel in 2014 to investigate the nature of user-generated content (UGC) on their news site, Independent Online (IOL). One of the panel's recommendations was that what is meant by "uncivil" discourse on online news sites be delineated more accurately and narrowly. Employing computer-mediated discourse analysis, we explore the nature of civility and incivility generated by readers of online news. We look at readers' posts in response to race-based topics and uncover the complexities inherent in describing both (in)civility and deliberative discourse precisely. Our sample is drawn from the South African newspaper Mail & Guardian Online, one of the few national media establishments that permitted user comments during our data collection phase.

T1  - INDIA'S POLICIES ON LEVERAGING FINANCIAL INCLUSION IN THE COUNTRY
AN  - 1917823322
AB  - Exclusion of basic financial services acts as an obstacle in achieving economic development because financially excluded people are forced to take credit at exorbitant rates from informal sources which results in debt, unemployment and rise in crime rates (Sharma & Kaur 2012; Mathew & Kurian 2015). Moreover, lack of access to the financial services or the inability to use them leads to social exclusion (European social watch report 2010). Hence financial inclusion becomes a priority of every government. In India several policy initiatives have been taken by the Government of India (GOI) and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to make banking services accessible to the masses; right from nationalization of banks to priority sector lending to launching of lead bank scheme to establishing Regional Rural Banks to initiating Self - Help group bank Linkage Programme. In spite of all the sincere efforts by Government of India (GOI) and by Reserve Bank of India (RBI), they are yet to overcome several hurdles as 10.91% of the entire population in the country state distance as a barrier, 10.92% of them state cost as a barrier, 9.71% report documentation as a barrier and 3.47% report trust as a barrier for opening a bank account (World Bank 2016). In this paper through expository research we have made an attempt to study the various initiatives taken by the authoritative bodies in India to achieve financial inclusion and its impact on the households. A thorough study has been done on the various policies undertaken and the participation of the various stakeholders of the Indian economy to help in the successful execution of these policies. Data has been gathered through official reports published by these authoritative bodies and an analysis of the parameters that indicate the spread of financial inclusion has been undertaken.

T1  - Information grounds as a vehicle for social inclusion of domestic migrant workers in Israel
TT  - Information grounds
AN  - 2533738275
AB  - PurposeEconomic adversity, geopolitical, and climate crises leading to the lack of decent and sustainable work are resulting in growing and diverse migratory movements. The precarious situation of many migrant workers in their countries of employment results in a state of social exclusion due to a lack of access to relevant information sources. The purpose of this paper is to further the understanding of the information behavior of migrants by examining the role that La Escuelita, a Hebrew night school for domestic migrant workers in Israel, plays as an information ground helping migrants struggling with social exclusion.Design/methodology/approachA qualitative methodology was used and data were collected using participation observation over a three-months period. Eight students at the school were interviewed using in-depth interviews.FindingsLa Escuelita served as a vehicle for social inclusion by providing valuable everyday information to the students in a caring environment. Information was shared in multiple directions between both the staff and the students and between the students. Language barriers were revealed as one of the main factors for social exclusion. Findings revealed that although the migrant workers who study at La Escuelita are information poor regarding their struggle for social inclusion into Israeli society, they wish to learn Hebrew as a way to overcome this exclusion.Originality/valueUnderstanding the information behavior of marginalized populations is the first step into designing and implementing information services to help them toward social inclusion. This research presents an innovative contribution by examining the significance and roles of social connections in the setting of a unique information environment.

T1  - The 'Linchpin for Success'? The problematic establishment of the 1965 Race Relations Act and its Conciliation Board
AN  - 1947105829
AB  - The 1965 Race Relations Act was the first legislation directed towards outlawing racial discrimination and racial incitement in Britain; but it has been almost universally criticised as weak, narrow and ineffectual. This article focuses on an area not adequately discussed in the existing literature-the debate about, and impact of, replacing initial criminal sanctions with American-styled conciliation and civil remedies, and subsequent creation of conciliation machinery. It argues that the protracted process of forming this Board had a greater impact upon the Act's success than has been previously acknowledged, as it demonstrated the bipartite lack of desire to address the politically unpopular issue of race and immigration, thus creating further disillusionment towards the British state. Rather than being the 'last step' in such legislation, as desired by many at the time, its weaknesses and limitations stimulated criticism and increased political action, leading to subsequent broader legislation in future years.

T1  - ‘Jupiter is back’: gender in the 2017 French presidential campaign
AN  - 1946308622
AB  - Since 1958 and the beginning of the Fifth Republic, the French presidency has been constructed and consolidated as a masculine institution. Furthermore, all presidential elections can be considered as a key moment for politicising issues relating to sex and gender. The 2017 presidential campaign is more specific. Since 2000, the mechanisms designed to ensure gender equality have been strengthened, such that they are now an unavoidable norm in political competition. In a context of dramatic political change, the hierarchy of political issues is affected. This article looks back over François Hollande’s 5-year term from this perspective, before drawing on an analysis of campaign materials and press coverage. The small proportion of women candidates and the marginalisation of gender issues in the programmes testify to the fragile nature of ‘egalitarian good will.’ Gender and sexuality did, however, offer a means for other power relations to be expressed, in relation to different conceptions of nationalism and both class and race relations.

T1  - The Mafia, La Raza, and the Spanish- Language Press Coverage of the 1891 Lynchings in New Orleans
AN  - 2335159332
AB  - [...]Fava withdrew his post from Washington, D.C., and issued a subtle threat of war.

Set within this broader hemispheric context, these ten newspapers- in Latin America La Voz de Mexico (Mexico City, Mexico), El Impartial (La Paz, Bolivia), El Siglo Diez y Nueve (Mexico City, Mexico), La Nación (Buenos Aires, Argentina), El Pais (Havana, Cuba), La Estrella de Panama (a weekly in Panama City, Panama, which was at the time part of CoIombia), the Daily Star and Herald (pubIished in English and Spanish in Panama City), and El Correo Nacional (Bogota, Colombia); and in the United States Las Novedades (New York City, New York) and El Tiempo (Las Cruces, New Mexico)-formed their own perspectives on the 1891 lynchings based on the positions from which they reported.11 Considering the malleability of race and the inconsistencies of dipIomacy that beset this period in the Americas, this articIe Iocates the Spanish-Ianguage newspapers' coverage within a compIicated system of raciaIized constructions and within a broader critique of U.S. imperialism.

The social and economic mobility of the Italian working class positioned them in a gray area that defied a black and white binary and shifted in response to nativist sentiments.14 Moreover, Clive Webb has argued that scholars of the 1891 lynchings in New Orleans often fall short in their analyses of this event, contending that because these "authors are not interested in southern race relations per se, they do not attempt to place the lynching of Sicilians within the broader pattern of mob violence.

In their book Carrigan and Webb complicate their confidence in the effectiveness of diplomatic pressure on the U.S. State Department, pointing out that because lynching was not a federal crime, it was difficult for U.S. diplomats to compel the prosecution of mob members at the

T1  - Races without Racism?: everyday race relations in Singapore
AN  - 1920010355
AB  - In Singapore, race has a prominent place in the city state's national policies. Its political ideology of multiracialism proclaims racial equality and protection for minority groups from racial discrimination. However, despite official rhetoric and policies aimed at managing and integrating the different ethnic groups, some scholars have argued that institutional racism does exist in Singapore. While it is public knowledge, with few exceptions, racist provocations and experiences of racism are not publicly discussed. In recent years, the advent of social media has made it possible for Singaporeans oftentimes unwittingly to express racially derogatory remarks. This has highlighted that racism is much more deep rooted. Yet, it still remains the white elephant in the room. This paper examines the sociopolitical context that has contributed to everyday racial discrimination and calls for a public acknowledgement of racism so as to combat racist practices.

T1  - Belief in Race as Biological: Early Life Influences, Intergroup Outcomes, and the Process of "Unlearning"
AN  - 1816297590
AB  - This paper reports on three studies examining people's belief about race as biological. Study 1 (N = 155) found that the relationship between early exposure to diversity as a child and belief in race as biological was moderated by socioeconomic status. Study 2 (N = 210) found that belief in race as biological was related to greater social distance toward out-group members, and this relationship was mediated by out-group discomfort. Study 3 found that participants (N = 31) had significant decreases in belief in race as biological immediately following a daylong race relations workshop and in a 6-week follow-up, and this "unlearning" trajectory was particularly prominent among students who experienced greater social distance from out-groups. Results are interpreted and discussed in relation to reconceptualizing beliefs about race as rationalizing rather than proactive ideologies and for promoting positive race relations through education aimed at deessentializing race.

T1  - Social Network Sites and Political Engagement: Exploring the Impact of Facebook Connections and Uses on Political Protest and Participation
AN  - 1806575515
AB  - Past studies have shown positive relationships between use of social network sites (SNSs) and political engagement, but an understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship is limited because the studies often did not take into account the diverse affordances of SNSs that can influence participation in different ways. Adopting the O-S-R-O-R (Orientation-Stimulus-Reasoning-Orientation-Response) model of political communication effects, this study examined the roles of Facebook network size, connections with public political actors, use for news, and political expression on political attitudes, protest, and participation. Structural equation analyses were conducted based on data from a national sample in Hong Kong, a city-state with one of the world's highest Facebook penetration rates. Results showed that Facebook network size and connections with public political actors exhibit both direct and indirect effects on participation through Facebook news, expression, and efficacy. Facebook news exhibited indirect effects primarily though political expression. A discriminant function analysis also showed that age, education, and online news exposure were the most influential variables for distinguishing Facebook users and nonusers. Implications of the findings are discussed.

T1  - Does media coverage influence public attitudes towards welfare recipients? The impact of the 2011 English riots
AN  - 1795388644
AB  - Following the shooting of Mark Duggan by police on 4 August 2011, there were riots in many large cities in the UK. As the rioting was widely perceived to be perpetrated by the urban poor, links were quickly made with Britain's welfare policies. In this paper, we examine whether the riots, and the subsequent media coverage, influenced attitudes toward welfare recipients. Using the British Social Attitudes survey, we use multivariate difference-in-differences regression models to compare attitudes toward welfare recipients among those interviewed before (pre-intervention: i.e. prior to 6 August) and after (post-intervention: 10 August-10 September) the riots occurred (N=3,311). We use variation in exposure to the media coverage to test theories of media persuasion in the context of attitudes toward welfare recipients. Before the riots, there were no significant differences between newspaper readers and non-readers in their attitudes towards welfare recipients. However, after the riots, attitudes diverged. Newspaper readers became more likely than non-readers to believe that those on welfare did not really deserve help, that the unemployed could find a job if they wanted to and that those on the dole were being dishonest in claiming benefits. Although the divergence was clearest between right-leaning newspaper and non-newspaper readers, we do not a find statistically significant difference between right- and left-leaning newspapers. These results suggest that media coverage of the riots influenced attitudes towards welfare recipients; specifically, newspaper coverage of the riots increased the likelihood that readers of the print media expressed negative attitudes towards welfare recipients when compared with the rest of the population.

T1  - The Scary World of Online News? Internet News Exposure and Public Attitudes Toward Crime and Justice
AN  - 1787236885
AB  - Objectives
 A substantial body of literature indicates that certain forms of media consumption may increase anxiety about crime and support for social controls. However, few studies have examined whether Internet news consumption is positively associated with such attitudes. The void is significant given the public's increasing use of online news sources. This study addresses this research gap.
Methods
We draw on data from four national surveys conducted between 2007 and 2013, which collectively include interviews with more than 13,000 Americans. Using OLS and logistic regression, we assess the relationships between exposure to traditional and online media and perceptions of victimization risk, support for punitive crime policies, and views about police powers.
Results
Consistent with prior work, we find positive relationships between exposure to traditional forms of media--television news and crime programming--and anxiety about victimization and support for harsh crime policies. In contrast, Internet news exposure is generally not associated with anxieties about crime or support for getting tough on criminals. However, there is evidence of an interactive relationship between political ideology and Internet news exposure.
Conclusions
The results provide little support for cultivation theory in the context of Internet news consumption. We discuss the import of our findings, and suggest new lines of research to explore the correlates and the effects of exposure to online news sources.

T1  - Muslim neighbors or an Islamic threat? A constructionist framing analysis of newspaper coverage of mosque controversies
AN  - 1791353920
AB  - In recent years, growing communities of Muslim-Americans have faced tension in a series of debates over the construction of Islamic prayer spaces in American cities. Islamic community members have found themselves fighting for representation within the political process and for their philosophical right to exist within American society. This study presents a framing analysis of the debate in five US newspapers between 2010 and 2013 as a way of examining the position of Muslims within contemporary American society. The study examines five frames: Local Regulation, Legal Authority, Political Debate, Muslim Neighbors, and Islamic Threat. The first three were episodic frames, while the other two were thematic. Some of the discourse showed evidence of Islamophobia, or indiscriminate negative attitudes or emotions directed at Islam or Muslims. Other stories showed evidence of Islamophilia, which is the stereotypical presentation of 'good Muslims' who are model citizens in contrast to the 'bad Muslims' who serve as rhetorical enemies.

T1  - Empowering the elderly population through ICT-based activities
AN  - 2093343232
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to focus on elderly people who have adopted Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and participated in ICT-based activities, and explore variables associated with their individual and collective empowerment by using data collected by a questionnaire survey. Design/methodology/approach – A set of 14 questions was developed to measure older adults’ perceived psychological empowerment. A factor analysis was conducted to condense 14 individual variables into several large categories. Finally, a set of multiple regression analyses was employed to identify variables associated with the elderly’s individual and collective empowerment. Findings – Three factors, including a sense of meaning; competence/self-determination; and collective empowerment were extracted from the 14 questions. Multiple regression models revealed that elderly empowerment is not a matter of social skills, ICT skills, or complementary skills, but is more likely to result from their being interested in ICT and ICT-based activities. Learning activities in ICT-based activities and participation frequency were found to be predictors of both meaning and competence/self-determination dimensions. Research limitations/implications – The major finding of this study concerns the development of a measure that assesses three factors of empowerment in older adults, i.e., sense of meaning, competence/self-determination, and collective empowerment. This study represents an initial step in establishing the measure, and therefore, further work is needed to establish its psychometric properties, particularly external validity. Originality/value – This study is one of the first studies to focus on older people’s empowerment construct and its relation to ICT-based activities.

T1  - Localized Use of Information and Communication Technologies in Seoul's Urban Neighborhoods: PROD
AN  - 1749604144
AB  - Theoretically guided by communication infrastructure theory and theory of planned behavior, this study has two aims: to assess the experiences and intentions of Seoul residents with regard to their localized use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and to identify the factors influencing those experiences and intentions. Online survey data (n = 901) were collected from adult residents of Seoul in the summer of 2013. The results indicate that various ICT channels (especially websites, online news sites, blogs, online cafes, and smartphone apps) could potentially be customized to serve urban neighborhoods. Positive attitudes and subjective norms related to localized ICT use behavior were significant factors for use of almost all ICT channels considered in the current study. Individuals' integrated connectedness to community storytelling network was a consistently significant and positive factor in relation to both experience and intention of localized uses of ICTs. Among four community engagement variables included in the current study, community activity participation was associated with the experience (but not with the intention) of localized ICT uses.

T1  - The digital divide and social inclusion among refugee migrants
AN  - 2093346107
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors which influence refugee migrants’ adoption of digital technology and its relevance to their social inclusion in Australia. Design/methodology/approach – This research developed a conceptual framework keeping the “use” of digital technology as the centre-piece of the digital divide. The empirical data were derived from a series of focus group discussions with refugee migrants in an Australian regional city, Toowoomba in Queensland. Findings – There is a digital divide among refugee migrant groups and it is based on inequalities in physical access to and use of digital technology, the skills necessary to use the different technologies effectively and the ability to pay for the services. The opportunities to use digital technology could support the social inclusion of refugee migrant groups in the broader Australian community. Research limitations/implications – Further research is required to examine whether this digital divide is unique in the regional context or common to Australian society and to confirm factors that might contribute significantly to refugee migrants’ social inclusion. Originality/value – This paper determined the role digital technology can play in building social capital and hence social inclusion among refugee migrant groups. Many of the factors identified as influencing refugee migrants’ use of digital technology can inform the Australian government and the information and communication technology industry in devising supportive policies and plans to reduce the risk of social exclusion, alienation and marginalisation among refugee migrant groups.

T1  - The four Es of social marketing: ethicality, expensiveness, exaggeration and effectiveness
AN  - 2202791731
AB  - Purpose – This study aims to contribute to the existing social marketing literature by considering young adults’ views and perceptions about social marketing and social marketing campaigns in the context of alcohol consumption. Design/methodology/approach – Eighteen interviews were conducted with young adults aged 25-30 years in Australia and the USA. Biographical interviews were used to collect information on individuals’ drinking histories and how their attitudes towards social marketing campaigns have formed during their lives. Findings – Four main themes emerge in the study, namely, ethicality (freedom of choice), expensiveness, exaggeration and effectiveness. These four issues represent the main barriers and challenges for social marketers. Future research needs to explore the relationship between the attitudes of the target audience towards social marketing, and the actual effectiveness of social marketing campaigns. Research limitations/implications – This is an exploratory study that is limited by its context, sample size and participants’ demographical characteristics. Originality/value – This study provides empirical evidence behind challenges and barriers facing social marketing identified by Andreasen (2002).

T1  - The rejection of science frames in the news coverage of the golden rice experiment in Hunan, China
AN  - 1660023517; 201508075
AB  - In this article, we examine the ways in which media frames and rhetorical devices in the Chinese media shaped the representation of the genetically modified (GM) golden rice. We draw on a study of Chinese media representations of an experiment designed to test the efficacy of golden rice as a source of Vitamin A using school children in China's Hunan province as subjects. The study analysed Chinese web news stories about the Hunan experiment posted between 30 August 2012 (when Greenpeace first reported on the issue) and 30 October 2012. This experiment resulted in allegations of breaches in scientific protocols and created a hostile public reaction. The incident fuelled the long-standing debate about the risks and benefits of GM crops in China. In this article, we analyse 25 online news reports, examining the attitudinal orientation of the articles, the readers' comments on the articles and GM crops, the writing style and rhetorical devices employed, the emotions provoked and the frames manifest and embedded in these articles and comments. We found that although only one-third of the articles manifested an obviously negative attitude towards golden rice and GM foods, their use of strident metaphors and analogies were designed to arouse readers' fear and concerns about GM crops. In the anti-golden rice articles, we identified conspiracy frames, including the view that the West was using genetic engineering to establish global control over agriculture and that GM products were instruments for genocide. The pro-golden rice articles emphasised the scientific humanitarian progress, but it appears to be less attractive to the readers. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Bringing Race Relations Into the Restorative Justice Debate: An Alternative and Personalized Vision of 'the Other'
AN  - 1550999614; 201428973
AB  - Restorative justice was reborn in the 1970s with a promise to provide a better sense and experience of justice, especially for those who are let down the most by the criminal justice system. And yet, despite well-evidenced disproportionality and race inequality issues within criminal justice institutions, restorative justice research and practice within the context of race are almost nonexistent. This article aims to unravel this paradox while looking at the scant extant literature to explore the alternative and more personalized restorative justice vision of 'the other' and cultural differences. An expansive conceptual model that is aligned with the integrative nature of restorative justice is then posited for further pilots and research. The article warns that if restorative justice continues to ignore the challenges raised within a race equality context, the power structures inherent within our current structural framework of criminal justice will lead to its demise.

T1  - Prominent Messages in Television Drama Switched at Birth Promote Attitude Change Toward Deafness
AN  - 1718067317; 201531366
AB  - The study at hand employed a pre- versus posttest experimental design to test the effects of television drama Switched at Birth on viewers' attitudes toward deafness. This program tells the story of two teenage girls (one of whom is deaf) and their struggles to relate to their peers and families after discovering they were switched as newborns. Two hundred eleven female adults completed pre- and postexposure measures utilizing Cooper, Rose, and Mason's (200412. Cooper, A., Rose, J., & Mason, O. (2004). Measuring the attitudes of human service professionals toward deafness. American Annals of the Deaf, 148, 385-389.) Attitudes to Deafness measure, the items of which were categorized according to thematic dimensions. After exposure to one of three episodes, viewers' attitudes toward deafness significantly improved overall, although significant differences in attitude changes varied by episodes and dimensions. The three thematic dimensions that were most strongly represented in the program (social interaction, deafness as a handicap, and language issues) appeared to show the strongest attitude change. Positive attitude changes were observed on social interaction and deafness as handicap dimensions, which was consistent with program content depicting positive deaf-hearing friendships and capable deaf characters. However, attitudes on the language issues dimension showed a negative shift, possibly due to the way that deaf characters communicated with hearing characters onscreen.

AN  - 1512218759; 201408398
AB  - The increasing popularity of social network sites (SNSs) in election campaigns provides a unique climate for scholarly inquiry. The study reported here builds upon Zhang, Johnson, Seltzer, and Bichard and investigates the impact of different types of SNS use on voters' attitudes and behavior during the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign. Sites such as Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, and YouTube are included to offer a robust assessment of distinct relationships. A national online panel of Internet users was utilized to examine reliance on SNSs and the multiple consequences on political attitudes and behavior such as political participation, political interest, selective exposure, selective avoidance, and strength of party affiliation. The findings are evaluated for theoretical and practical implications on democratic governance. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - THE ART OF KILLING A DREAM
AN  - 1690105909
AB  - This article examines how race relations have changed since Pres Barack Obama was elected to the office of President of the US. The authors examined media coverage of issues encountered by this president, to see if any of those issues had a racial bias. Results showed that change has come to America in the area of race relations because a black man has ascended to the Presidency, the highest office in the land. On the other hand, commentators are still debating his blackness or lack thereof, which indicates race remains a salient issue in society.

T1  - Police race relations in the Big Society: Continuity and change
AN  - 1364703381; 201326093
AB  - In British politics, it is clear that the idea of the 'Big Society' encompasses many aspects of state activity and civil society, including the work of constabularies. Implications of ideas related to the Big Society implemented in police policy and practice, particularly in the area of police race relations, are considered in this article. No matter what changes that may take place, they will be mediated by the police occupational culture, which itself might be changed by Big Society ideas and concurrent, significant cuts to police budgets. The article begins with a consideration of whether we adequately understand how police organizations change. Janet Chan's use of Bourdieu's ideas on the relationship between 'field' and 'habitus' is criticized. In light of this discussion, the article considers aspects of police race relations. In particular, the implications of 'seeing like a citizen' and 'participative policing', Big Society ideas identified by Martin Innes, are discussed.

T1  - ICTs changing youths' political attitudes and behaviors in Bangladesh
AN  - 1364702240; 201324741
AB  - This article explains political activism among educated youths in Bangladesh and how information and communication technologies (ICTs) change their political attitudes and behaviors. The findings identify motivations and psychological factors that affect patterns of new media use in political participation. Data from 23 interviewees, alongside those of 69 focus group participants, reveal that Bangladeshi youths increasingly favor forward-looking agendas by rejecting traditional ideology-based party politics. They have a passion for shaping their opinions through social networking instead of processions, party meetings, and political violence. This study finds that youth engagement through virtual communication has no direct impact on political decision-making but may play a pivotal role in some policy-making processes in Bangladesh.

T1  - Media Framing and Public Attitudes Toward Biofuels
AN  - 1347784272; 201319766
AB  - This study investigates the relationship between media framing and public opinion on the issue of biofuels-transportation fuels made from plants, animal products, or organic waste. First, the paper investigates how media framing of biofuels has changed since the issue regained national prominence in the early 2000s. Through a detailed content analysis of newspaper coverage, the paper documents an increase in negative frames between 1999 and 2008, especially frames focusing on the negative economic effects of biofuels on consumers. Second, using data from a 2010 Internet survey of a random sample of the U.S. public, the paper analyzes the relative influence of these new media frames on public attitudes toward biofuels compared with other common predictors of public opinion, such as party ID, regional economic interests, and personal identity as an environmentalist. In general, the results confirm that public attitudes toward biofuels appear to be shaped by these new media frames, especially among those who indicate a high degree of attention to the media, suggesting the relative importance of framing effects on policy attitudes for environmental and energy policies in general.

T1  - Public attitudes towards privacy and surveillance in Croatia
AN  - 1346700811
AB  - This paper investigates public attitudes towards privacy, data protection, surveillance and security in Croatia. The public opinion survey assesses the value privacy may have for the individuals and if privacy is recognized as a social and political value. Four principal groups of privacy violations are covered in the survey: information collection, information processing, information dissemination and invasion. Citizens' awareness of the data protection issues and related confidence in government and business practices are examined as well. Furthermore, this paper investigates if public attitudes towards surveillance in Croatia are in favor of the "nothing to hide" argument. Based on empirical data, the findings indicate that there are three groups of Croatian citizens with different opinions: "pro-surveillance" oriented citizens; citizens concerned about being surveilled; and citizens concerned about data and privacy protection. Identified groups of citizens differ in demographics. Policy implications of the research results are discussed in the paper. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Abnormal Neural Responses to Social Exclusion in Schizophrenia
AN  - 1326266838
AB  - Social exclusion is an influential concept in politics, mental health and social psychology. Studies on healthy subjects have implicated the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a region involved in emotional and social information processing, in neural responses to social exclusion. Impairments in social interactions are common in schizophrenia and are associated with reduced quality of life. Core symptoms such as delusions usually have a social content. However little is known about the neural underpinnings of social abnormalities. The aim of this study was to investigate the neural substrates of social exclusion in schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls underwent fMRI while participating in a popular social exclusion paradigm. This task involves passing a ‘ball’ between the participant and two cartoon representations of other subjects. The extent of social exclusion (ball not being passed to the participant) was parametrically varied throughout the task. Replicating previous findings, increasing social exclusion activated the mPFC in controls. In contrast, patients with schizophrenia failed to modulate mPFC responses with increasing exclusion. Furthermore, the blunted response to exclusion correlated with increased severity of positive symptoms. These data support the hypothesis that the neural response to social exclusion differs in schizophrenia, highlighting the mPFC as a potential substrate of impaired social interactions.

AB  - This study examines the news coverage of the Commonwealth Games in India in major newspapers in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. Textual analysis of news articles reveals a heavy focus on issues of mismanagement and deficiencies in game preparations, and the use of negative stereotypes of India. The article draws attention to the bias in coverage of events in developing countries and calls attention to the hegemonic function of the Western press in perpetuating old social attitudes and prejudices that undermine the success and achievements of events in developing countries like India.

T1  - Translating Sexual Assault Prevention from a College Campus to a United States Military Installation: Piloting the Know-Your-Power Bystander Social Marketing Campaign
AN  - 1023030938; 201227048
AB  - One population that shares both similar and different characteristics with traditional college-age students is the U.S. Military. Similarities include a high concentration of 18- to 26-year-olds dealing with new found independence, peer pressure, and the presence of social norms that support violence and hypermasculinity. Sexual violence is a major public health problem in the United States, and because of the similarities in the age group of college and military populations, the problems regarding sexual violence in both constituencies have been well-documented. In the current pilot study we seek to add to both current knowledge about and promising practices of translating prevention strategies from one target audience to another. We describe how we translated, administered, and evaluated a bystander intervention social marketing campaign focused on sexual assault prevention that had been found to significantly affect attitude change on a college campus for a U.S. Army installation in Europe. In addition to demonstrating the process of translating prevention strategies across target audiences, findings from this pilot study contribute to the evaluation data on the effectiveness of sexual violence prevention strategies implemented with members of the U.S. Military. From our analysis, we see that research participants indicate that the degree to which the images resonate with them and the familiarity of the context (i.e., social self-identification) significantly affect the participants' personal responsibility for reducing sexual assault, confidence in acting as a bystander, and reported engagement as a bystander.

T1  - Persistence of attitude change and attitude-behavior correspondence based on extensive processing of source information
AN  - 1037877252; 201230931
AB  - A three-phase longitudinal study (spread over a month's time) was carried out to investigate attitude's persistence and linkage to behavior as it may be affected by the processing of information about the communication source. The following three independent variables were manipulated: (i) contents of the source of information (implying the communicator to be expert or inexpert on the topic of the communication); (ii) length of the source information (brief versus lengthy); and (iii) message recipients' involvement in the issue at hand (high versus low). Replicating prior research when the source information was brief it exerted greater persuasive impact under low versus high involvement, and when it was lengthy, it exerted greater persuasive impact under high versus low involvement. Of greater importance, the newly acquired attitudes were more persistent and were linked more strongly to actual behavior when the source information was lengthy (versus brief) provided the recipients had high (versus low) involvement in the issue. These findings were interpreted to mean that just like with the message/issue information in prior research, when processed extensively, source information, too, may contribute to the formation of persistent and behavior-driving attitudes.

T1  - Rebuilding or Intruding? Media Coverage and Public Opinion on Latino Immigration in Post-Katrina Louisiana
AN  - 1283639664; 201304253
AB  - Objectives: Few studies fully integrate the interactive effects of political, geographic, and media contexts into studies of public opinion on immigration. We rectify this by utilizing the post-Katrina Latino immigrant migration to Louisiana as an opportunity for study of these relationships. Methods: We utilize survey data and content analysis of news coverage to examine the influence of news exposure on attitudes toward immigrants and immigration. Results: Exposure to immigration news influences the relative importance of immigration to other issues, self-reported personal contact with Spanish-speaking populations, and perceptions of the legal status of immigrant populations. Conclusions: Local news coverage of immigration increases awareness and concern about immigration and heightened news exposure increases perceptions about personal interactions with Spanish-speaking populations. Additionally, local news coverage of immigration influences the importance of key characteristics of immigrant populations, particularly whether immigrants are here illegally. Tone of coverage, as opposed to amount, exerts the more consistent effect on immigration-related attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Covering the crisis: Media coverage of the economic crisis and citizens' economic expectations
AN  - 919905066; 201202004
AB  - The 2008-2009 worldwide economic crisis serves as a backdrop to this study of the dynamics of citizens' economic expectations. Economic expectations are identified as crucial for a range of political attitudes. This study is the first to consider how information affects evaluations in times of a severe crisis, as prior research of information effects on economic evaluations took place in more stable economic times. It links citizens' news exposure and the content of economic news coverage with changes in prospective economic assessments. Drawing on a three-wave panel study and on a media content analysis between the panel waves, we thus provide a dynamic assessment of media influences on changes in economic evaluations. The results demonstrate that media exposure strongly affected expectations regarding the future development of the national economic situation, while being largely unrelated to personal economic expectations. We furthermore show that media dependency increases the magnitude of the media effect. We discuss the disconnect between personal and national economic evaluations with regard to mass-mediated economic information. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Perceived Threats and Latino Immigrant Attitudes: How White and African American College Students Respond to News Coverage of Latino Immigrants
AN  - 870433272; 201114491
AB  - A survey of 326 White and African American college respondents examined the relationship among perceptions of news coverage of Latino immigrants, perceived threats, and attitudes toward Latino immigrants. Perceived negative news images of Latino immigrants were associated with greater perceived threats, which were related to White and African American respondents' negative immigrant attitudes. Negative news perception also predicted unfavorable Latino immigrant attitudes. The study also suggested that perceived accuracy of negative immigrant news affected perceived threats. There was no racial difference in these response patterns. Findings are discussed in light of intergroup threat and social identity theory. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - How Choice Affects and Reflects Preferences: Revisiting the Free-Choice Paradigm
AN  - 817163487
AB  - After making a choice between 2 objects, people reevaluate their chosen item more positively and their rejected item more negatively (i.e., they spread the alternatives). Since Brehm's (1956) initial free-choice experiment, psychologists have interpreted the spreading of alternatives as evidence for choice-induced attitude change. It is widely assumed to occur because choosing creates cognitive dissonance, which is then reduced through rationalization. In this article, we express concern with this interpretation, noting that the free-choice paradigm (FCP) will produce spreading, even if people's attitudes remain unchanged. Specifically, if people's ratings/rankings are an imperfect measure of their preferences and their choices are at least partially guided by their preferences, then the FCP will measure spreading, even if people's preferences remain perfectly stable. We show this, first by proving a mathematical theorem that identifies a set of conditions under which the FCP will measure spreading, even absent attitude change. We then experimentally demonstrate that these conditions appear to hold and that the FCP measures a spread of alternatives, even when this spreading cannot have been caused by choice. We discuss how the problem we identify applies to the basic FCP paradigm as well as to all variants that examine moderators and mediators of spreading. The results suggest a reassessment of the free-choice paradigm and, perhaps, the conclusions that have been drawn from it. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Different Meanings of the Social Dominance Orientation Concept: Predicting Political Attitudes Over Time
AN  - 754040781; 201049623
AB  - We examined predictors of political attitude change by assessing the independent and interactive effect of social dominance orientation (SDO) as a context-dependent versus an individual difference construct. In a longitudinal study, British students' political orientation was assessed before entering university (T1) and after being at university for 2 months (T2) and 6 months (T3; N=109). Results showed that initial SDO (T1) did not predict political attitudes change nor did it predict self-selected entry into course with hierarchy enhancing or hierarchy-attenuating ideologies. More support was obtained for a contextually determined model whereby SDO (T2) mediated the relationship between social class (T1) and political attitude change (T3). We also found support for mediated moderation in accounting for effects of initial SDO on political attitude change. Findings suggest that SDO as a concept that is sensitive to group dynamics is best suited to explain shifts in political attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Revolution Will be Networked: The Influence of Social Networking Sites on Political Attitudes and Behavior
AN  - 60349482; 201012772
AB  - Social networking is a phenomenon of interest to many scholars. While most of the recent research on social networking sites has focused on user characteristics, very few studies have examined their roles in engaging people in the democratic process. This paper relies on a telephone survey of Southwest residents to examine the extent to which reliance on social networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace and YouTube has engaged citizens in civic and political activities. More specifically, this study looks at the extent to which social networking sites influence political attitudes and democratic participation after controlling for demographic variables and the role of interpersonal political discussion in stimulating citizen participation. The findings indicate that reliance on social networking sites is significantly related to increased civic participation, but not political participation. Interpersonal discussion fosters both civic participation and political activity. Implications of the results for democratic governance will be discussed.
