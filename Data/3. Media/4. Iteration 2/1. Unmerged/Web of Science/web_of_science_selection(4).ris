AB  - Objective: This study provides insight into how electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) may affect the social normative environment for tobacco use among college students. Participants: Participants were 244 freshman and sophomore students. Methods: Students completed an online self-report survey in April 2011. Results: There is a higher acceptance rate of e-cigarette smoking in public than traditional tobacco. For intention to use an e-cigarette, the strongest predictor is current tobacco use, followed by a positive orientation toward public use of e-cigarettes. Positive orientation toward public use of e-cigarettes is significantly predicted by the use of alternate tobacco, intention to use or try e-cigarettes, positive orientation toward public use of tobacco, positive attitude toward e-cigarettes, positive perception of social norms for use of e-cigarettes, and favorable orientation toward e-cigarettes as an innovation. Conclusions: These models suggest attitudinal, social normative, innovation, and behavioral factors may combine to bring the e-cigarette into wider use among college students.

TI  - English-based coroneologisms A short survey of our Covid-19-related vocabulary
T2  - ENGLISH TODAY

KW  - ANGLICISMS
AB  - In a 2016 article published in this journal (Roig-Marin, 2016), I argued that the coinage of cyber-blends reflects our blended digital/physical relationships in today's world. The current pandemic has put a halt to our everyday lives and all forms of physical contact, and so technologies and digital experiences now play a more conspicuous role than ever. We have gone online and got used to vocabulary whose usage prior to COVID-19 was very limited (e.g. quarantine and pandemic) or known to very few (coronavirus, super-spreader, or the abbreviations PPE 'personal protective equipment' or WFH 'working from home'), while coming to terms with the implications of others such as self-isolation, lockdown, or social distancing (which should be better called physical distancing as social closeness, albeit non-physically, is very much needed to get through these difficult times). Short pieces on coroneologisms have attested to the rise of many new lexical formations, mostly blends. According to Thorne (2020; also cited in CBC, 2020), more than 1,000 new words - both non-specialised and technical terminology - have been created during the current pandemic. Journalists and Twitter users are particularly prone to coin words displaying a high level of linguistic ingenuity; yet, the circulation of that lexis may be very limited. The present note overviews some of the most widely spread vocabulary related to our new COVID-19 reality, coming from the laity rather than from medical or scientific professionals. Alongside terms like social distancing and lockdown, less technical and more playful vocabulary has transcended linguistic boundaries. Particular attention will be paid to examples from European languages whose word-stocks share a common Latinate substratum, likewise central to scientific communication.

AB  - This article explores Chinese English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers' attitudes toward technology use and the factors that influence their technology acceptance. A qualitative study was conducted with data obtained from semistructured, in-depth interviews of 14 university teachers from six provinces. The interview data revealed that Chinese EFL teachers generally maintained a positive attitude toward technology use in teaching. Facilitating conditions driven by modernization, perceived usefulness, subjective norm, and technology mania are major factors influencing their technology acceptance. It is worth noticing that the degree of reliance on technology varied in terms of age and experience. Overall, the findings were consistent with previous studies, while leading to a broader and deeper understanding of technology acceptance theories by analyzing contextual and cultural phenomenon in China. Implications for future research and suggestions to improve Continuing Professional Development were provided in order to promote technology integration among Chinese teachers.

AB  - Firefighters are exposed to carcinogens such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) during fires and from their personal protective equipment (PPE). Recent research has shown that decontamination processes can reduce contamination on both gear and skin. While firefighter cultures that honor dirty gear are changing, little is known about current attitudes and behaviors toward decontamination in the fire service. Four hundred eighty-five firefighters from four departments completed surveys about their attitudes, beliefs, perceived norms, barriers, and behaviors toward post-fire decontamination processes. Overall, firefighters reported positive attitudes, beliefs, and perceived norms about decontamination, but showering after a fire was the only decontamination process that occurred regularly, with field decontamination, use of cleansing wipes, routine gear cleaning, and other behaviors all occurring less frequently. Firefighters reported time and concerns over wet gear as barriers to decontamination.

AB  - Following intergroup conflict, reconciliation efforts most often focus on relationships among people. Though human-centric approaches are valuable, we propose people's engagement in reconciliation is also related to their attitudes toward the broader natural world. With a sample of 233 undergraduate non-Indigenous Canadian students who completed an online survey, we investigated the relationships among connectedness to nature, animal-human continuity, moral expansiveness, and support for reconciliation. All variables correlated positively, though the correlation between animal-human continuity and support for reconciliation was not significant. As well, age positively and significantly correlated with connectedness to nature, whereas gender (coded 0 = male, 1 = female) positively and significantly correlated with animal-human continuity, moral expansiveness, and support for reconciliation. To better understand how connectedness to nature and animal-human continuity related to moral expansiveness and support for reconciliation, we conducted mediation analyses. Participants who felt more connected to nature had more positive attitudes toward reconciliation, because they were more morally expansive. A similar pattern emerged for animal-human continuity, though only for women. These findings imply that strengthening peoples' connection to nature or beliefs about how humans and other animals are similar, and consequently extending peoples' circles of moral concern, may increase support for reconciliation.

AB  - Mental health practitioners in many developing countries are faced with high job demands and a lack of institutional support. Given their high levels of work-related stress, it is important to identify mechanisms that help them to maintain psychological well-being and job satisfaction. Recent research has focused on the role that positive orientation (POS) may play in mediating the negative impact of stress on individual well-being. The present study investigated whether POS predicts mental health practitioners' perceived levels of stress, mental health and job satisfaction. If POS measures a person's tendency to take a positive attitude to life and their ability to cope with difficulties, a high POS could be linked to reduced levels of stress and increased levels of job satisfaction and well-being. This study examined associations between self-reported POS and psychological outcomes in a sample of 100 Malaysian mental health practitioners. The results showed that POS significantly predicted job satisfaction positively and mental health issues and perceived stress negatively, even when socio-demographic variables were controlled. Overall, we found a strong effect of POS on individual functioning across the sample of mental health practitioners. Our results have implications for improving practitioner wellbeing and job satisfaction.

AB  - Restorative justice provides an alternative to retributive justice by seeking to restore criminal offenders to be responsible members of the community. Often offenders will apologize (A) and offer to make restitution (R) for the damage done. Such offers might affect all parties present by promoting forgiveness (though that is not a stated goal of restorative justice), resolution of damages, and positive attitudes toward justice. We investigated Family Group Conferencing (FGC), which involves offender, victim, and supporters of each, in a mediated 30-minute dialogue. Namely, we organized role-play simulation meetings between "victims," "offenders," and the "mother" of each. There were 64 participants (16 groups of 4 participants). Each group role-played a mediated FGC that was video recorded. The offender had either to apologize and offer restitution (AR) or avoid both (No AR). Questionnaires assessed forgiveness (and other outcomes) from each of the four participants' perspectives. Coders coded behavior during the role-play. AR promoted forgiveness by all parties, but to different degrees. Coded "softness" of offender's behavior (i.e., nonverbal signs of remorse, contrition, and regret) affected victim's behaviors and ratings by women role-playing both mothers. The role-play simulation allowed some understanding of the inner working of FGCs relative to retrospective questionnaires.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to assess the impact of social media advertisements in combating the coronavirus pandemic in India. We assume that dissemination of awareness among susceptible individuals modifies public attitudes and behaviours towards this contagious disease which results in reducing the chance of contact with the coronavirus and hence decreasing the disease transmission. Moreover, the individual's behavioral response in the presence of global information campaigns accelerate the rate of hospitalization of symptomatic individuals and also encourage the asymptomatic individuals for conducting health protocols, such as self-isolation, social distancing, etc. We calibrate the proposed model with the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases for the Republic of India. We estimate eight epidemiologically important parameters, and also the size of basic reproduction number for India. We find that the basic reproduction number for India is greater than unity, which represents the substantial outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. Sophisticated techniques of sensitivity analysis are employed to determine the impacts of model parameters on basic reproduction number and symptomatic infected population. Our results reveal that to reduce disease burden in India, non-pharmaceutical interventions strategies should be implemented effectively to decrease basic reproduction number below unity. Continuous propagation of awareness through the internet and social media platforms should be regularly circulated by the health authorities/government officials for hospitalization of symptomatic individuals and quarantine of asymptomatic individuals to control the prevalence of disease in India.

AB  - (1) Background: The aim of the present study was to develop and validate the psychometric characteristics of a scale measuring nurses' experiences working with COVID-19 patients. (2) Methods: The participants were 180 Croatian nurses who worked in departments with COVID-19 patients, with a mean age of 36.8 years (ranging from 20 to 48). Research was conducted from March to June 2020. For the purpose of constructing the scale, 10 statements were developed. Factor analysis was used to determine the factor structure and construct validity of the scale. (3) Results: The scale consisted of nine statements divided into a three-factor structure: factor I-stigmatization and mistrusting (four items), factor II-social distancing (four items), and factor III-fear of infection (two items). Cronbach alpha was calculated to confirm the reliability of the scale: factor I-alpha = 0.80, factor II-alpha = 0.76, and factor III-alpha = 0.70. (4) Conclusion: The nurses' pandemic-related experiences scale showed good psychometric properties and can be applied in future research as a standardized tool for measuring health care workers' experience during COVID-19 or other infectious crises.

AB  - The impact of public relations on emerging fields such as travel journalism has not gained much attention, despite the broadergrowth of lifestyle journalism, and its particular dependence on PR. This study reports the findings of a representative survey of Australian travel journalists, focusing on their views of PR. Results show that travel journalists are wary of PR, although they believe they can be relatively immune from its influence and see some PR activities as quite useful. Cluster analysis identifies three distinct groups based on their views of PR, which range from a positive attitude to strong criticism. Their backgrounds and differences are explored, pointing to gender, job status, and background in mainstream journalism as main determinants for differences. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

   Methods: A questionnaire was prepared, comprising statements regarding the future role of AI in oral radiology and dentistry. A lecture of approx. 1 h was prepared, comprising the basic principles of AI and a non-exhaustive overview of AI research in medicine and dentistry. Participants filled in the questionnaire prior to the lecture. After the lecture, the questionnaire was repeated.
   Results: Throughout 7 sessions at 6 locations, 293 questionnaires were collected. The majority of participants were undergraduate dental students (57%). Prior to the lecture, there was a strong agreement regarding the various future roles and expected impact of AI in oral radiology. Approximately, one-third of participants was concerned about AI. After the lecture, agreement regarding the different roles of AI in oral radiology increased, overall excitement regarding AI increased, and concerns regarding the potential replacement of oral radiologists decreased.
   Conclusions: A generally positive attitude towards AI was found; an introductory lecture was beneficial towards this attitude and alleviated concerns regarding the effect of AI on the oral radiology profession. Given the unprecedented, ongoing revolution of AI-augmented radiology, it is pivotal to incorporate AI topics in dental training curricula.

AB  - CMC research presents emoticons as visual representations of writers' emotions. We argue that the emoticons in authentic workplace e-mails do not primarily indicate writers' emotions. Rather, they provide information about how an utterance is supposed to be interpreted. We show that emoticons function as contextualization cues, which serve to organize interpersonal relations in written interaction. They serve 3 communicative functions. First, when following signatures, emoticons function as markers of a positive attitude. Second, when following utterances that are intended to be interpreted as humorous, they are joke/irony markers. Third, they are hedges: when following expressive speech acts (such as thanks, greetings, etc.) they function as strengtheners and when following directives (such as requests, corrections, etc.) they function as softeners.

KW  - COVID-19 vaccine uptake
KW  - South Gondar
KW  - North Central Ethiopia
AB  - Introduction: with this fast-increasing pandemic in terms of morbidity and mortality, all mankind is at risk of infection unless they get vaccinated and all African countries shall incorporate COVID-19 vaccination in their health care programs as long as the world work cooperatively. The pandemic, as the World Health Organization (WHO) stated, could be mitigated when 70% of the population which is nearly 5.6 billion should be immunized and to achieve this objective, the willingness of the community to be vaccinated before vaccination is essential. Methods: institutional based cross-sectional study design was conducted from March 1st, 2021, up to 30th May, 2021, in South Gondar Province, North Central Ethiopia. A structured interviewer-administered pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data. The collected data were entered into EPI data version 4.2 and then exported into SPSS window version 22. Bivariate and multivariate analysis was undertaken and information was presented by using simple frequency tables and pie charts. Results: the majority of the respondents who accepted the COVID-19 vaccine accounted for nearly 260 (65%, 95% CI: 60-69). Positive attitude (AOR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.30-11.20), good knowledge (AOR 13, 95% CI: 6-27), bachelor of sciences (B.Sc) and above educational level (AOR 2.70, 95% CI: 1.30-6), TV or radio as source of information (AOR 0.10, 95% CI: 0.04-0.30), social media as source of information (AOR 0.04, 95% Cl: 0.01-0.2), political leaders (AOR 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01- 0.90) were predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Conclusion: healthcare professionals (HCPs) with the decision (yes, sure) for COVID-19 vaccine uptake during data collection were found to be low as compared to other studies. Positive attitude, good knowledge, B.Sc, and above educational level were predictors enhancing COVID-19 vaccination uptake and TV or radio as a source of information, social media as a source of information and political leaders were factors decreasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Hence, it might be important to prioritize knowledge and attitude creation programs for HCPs and an alternative way of source of information and agents for the COVID-19 vaccine other than social media and religious leaders.

AB  - Content analyses of U.S. English-language news coverage of immigration indicate that these stories are laden with negative, threatening messages and have an almost exclusive focus on Latino immigrants. However, little is known regarding how non-immigrant Latinos process and interpret these messages. The current survey of adult non-immigrant Latinos living in the United States addresses this question by applying insights from the rejection-identification model and research on vicarious shame. Based on this research, experiencing group shame in response to immigration news should drive Latinos to distance themselves from this identity, leading to greater affiliation with American identity (to maintain a positive self-concept) and stronger support for restrictive immigration policies (to mitigate the potential threats). Alternatively, experiencing anger in response to this coverage should result in less distancing from the shared Latino identity (i.e., greater affiliation), prompting decreased association with American identity and less support for restrictive immigration policies. Results from the mediation model tested here found support for predictions stemming from both vicarious shame and rejection-identification assumptions, indicating that they represent distinct pathways to views on immigration attitudes and identity management. Furthermore, in line with social identity theory, Mexican Americans (vs. non-Mexican Latinos) were more likely to distance from the immigration message and perceive immigration coverage to depict negative beliefs others hold about their ethnic group (owing to the disproportionate emphasis on Mexicans in this coverage). Results are discussed in terms of the implications for group standing as well as the importance of legitimacy of media messages in this context.

AB  - Background and purpose: The RAVES (Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group 08.03) randomised controlled trial (RCT), compares adjuvant radiotherapy with early salvage radiotherapy in men with high risk histopathological features at prostatectomy. The RAVES Decision Aid study evaluates the utility of a decision aid for men considering participation in the RAVES RCT. We report the RAVES Decision Aid study participants' attitudes and knowledge regarding RCTs, decision-making preferences and decisional-conflict.
   Materials and methods: Baseline questionnaires assessed knowledge and attitudes towards RCTs and RAVES RCT. Sociodemographic and clinical predictors of knowledge were examined. Involvement in decision-making and difficulties with the decision-making process were assessed using validated tools.
   Results: 127 men (median age = 63 years) were recruited through urologists (n = 91) and radiation oncologists (n = 36). Men preferred collaborative (35%) or semi-active (35%) decision-making roles. Most (>75%) felt the RAVES RCT was worthwhile and important with participation being wise. However, nearly half had high decisional-conflict regarding participation. Scores of objective knowledge regarding RCTs and RAVES RCT were low.
   Conclusions: Most men with high-risk histopathological features at prostatectomy desire active involvement in decision-making regarding further management. Despite positive attitudes towards RCTs and the RAVES RCT, there were gaps in knowledge and high decisional-conflict surrounding participation.

AB  - Recognizing an urgent need to understand the dynamics of the pandemic's severity, this longitudinal study is conducted to explore the evolution of complex relationships between the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown measures, and social distancing patterns in a diverse set of 86 countries. Collecting data from multiple sources, a structural equation modeling (SEM) technique is applied to understand the interdependencies between independent variables, mediators, and dependent variables. Results show that lockdown and confinement measures are very effective to reduce human mobility at retail and recreation facilities, transit stations, and workplaces and encourage people to stay home and thereby control COVID-19 transmission at critical times. The study also found that national contexts rooted in socioeconomic and institutional factors influence social distancing patterns and severity of the pandemic, particularly with regard to the vulnerability of people, treatment costs, level of globalization, employment distribution, and degree of independence in society. Additionally, this study portrayed a mutual relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and human mobility. A higher number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths reduces human mobility and the countries with reduced personal mobility have experienced a deepening of the severity of the pandemic. However, the effect of mobility on pandemic severity is stronger than the effect of pandemic situations on mobility. Overall, the study displays considerable temporal changes in the relationships between independent variables, mediators, and dependent variables considering pandemic situations and lockdown regimes, which provides a critical knowledge base for future handling of pandemics. It has also accommodated some policy guidelines for the authority to control the transmission of COVID-19.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if social undermining as perceived by frontline employees significantly affects their emotional exhaustion and procrastination behavior and to clarify the moderating role of positive psychological capital. A total of 310 deluxe hotel employees in South Korea participated in this study by completing a self-administered questionnaire. The study results showed that social undermining perceived by deluxe hotel employees positively influenced their emotional exhaustion. In addition, when emotional exhaustion became severe, employees' procrastination behavior, which harmed their organizations, increased. Additionally, the findings suggest a mediating effect, thereby indicating that employees' procrastination behaviors may increase when they experience emotional exhaustion resulting from social undermining. When employees perform their jobs with a positive attitude in a work situation, the negative influence of social undermining and emotional exhaustion may be partially offset. Limitations and future research directions are also discussed.

AB  - This research examined the impact of sexual orientation on heterosexuals' judgment of parental competence. Using a vignette approach, Study 1 presented participants with a lesbian, gay, or heterosexual couple who desired to have a child, either as adoptive parents or, in an additional heterosexual target condition, as biological parents. Study 2 presented a lesbian, gay, or heterosexual parent couple; heterosexual targets were either adoptive parents, reflecting the LG target conditions, or biological parents. Contradicting Hypothesis 1, neither target sexual orientation nor way to parenthood (with the latter varied in the heterosexual target condition only) had an impact on parental competence attributions. Confirming Hypothesis 2, participants with personal contact with lesbian and gay (LG) people provided higher ratings of LG target parental competence, mediated by positive attitudes toward homosexuality. Importantly, this mediation did not occur in the heterosexual target condition, corroborating the specificity of the intergroup contact effect.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of phonetic fit between spokesperson name and product attributes on perceived source credibility, namely, spokesperson expertise, attractiveness and trustworthiness. We manipulate phonetic fit through a 2 (spokesperson name: front vs. back) x 2 (product attribute: crisp vs. smooth) factorial design whilst controlling for spokesperson and product attractiveness. Results show that a phonetic fit between the name of the spokesperson and product attributes encourages positive perceptions of spokesperson credibility, irrespective of whether a spokesperson is visually presented in an advertisement. Finally, results demonstrate that phonetic fit (front (back) vowel spokesperson name with crisp (smooth) product attributes) can promote positive attitudes towards an advertisement and product, as well as purchase intention, with these relationships mediated by perceptions of spokesperson credibility. Findings from this research are able to aid advertisers and brand managers in the creation of effective and persuasive spokes/brand-characters.

AB  - The results of a structural equation model showed that a tendency to procrastinate, assessed early in college students' first term, was positively related to social values, assessed as concerns over social exclusion, but was negatively related to academic task values and grade goal-setting. The results suggest that procrastination may be a partial mediator of the influence of academic and social values on perceived school belongingness. In addition, the tendency to procrastinate had a direct negative relationship with self-regulatory self-efficacy and perceived school belongingness and was positively related to perceived stress near the end of the term. There was also a statistically significant negative total effect of procrastination on performance-approach and mastery-approach goal orientation and end-of-term grade point average (GPA). Statistically significant positive total effects of performance-approach and mastery-approach achievement goal orientations on GPA were found. However, while a statistically significant direct positive effect of performance-approach orientation on GPA was found, a direct relationship between mastery-approach orientation and GPA was not statistically significant.

AB  - Objective:
   This study sought to investigate the impact of a service user-led anti-stigma and discrimination education programme, encompassing numerous interventions focused on facilitating multiple forms of social contact, the promotion of recovery, and respect for human rights, on medical student attitudes.
   Method:
   A comparison cohort study was used to compare the attitudes of two cohorts of medical students who received this programme as part of their fifth (the fifth-year cohort) or sixth (the sixth-year cohort) year psychological medical education attachment (programme cohorts) with two cohorts of equivalent students who received a standard psychological medical attachment (control cohorts). Attitudes to recovery (using the Recovery Attitudes Questionnaire) and stigma (using the Opening Minds Scale for Healthcare Providers) were measured at the beginning and end of the attachments for each year and compared both within and between the cohorts using Wilcoxon signed-rank or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.
   Results:
   With sample sizes ranging from 46 to 70 across all cohorts, after their psychological medicine attachment both the programme and control cohorts showed more positive attitudes towards recovery and less stigmatising attitudes towards people with lived experience of mental distress. Significant differences between the programme cohorts and the control cohorts were found for recovery attitudes (median difference of 2, p < 0.05 in both fifth and sixth year), with particularly large differences being found for the 'recovery is possible and needs faith' subdomain of the Recovery Attitudes Questionnaire. There were no significant between cohort differences in terms of stigmatising attitudes as measured by the Opening Minds Scale for Healthcare Providers.
   Conclusion:
   The introduction of a comprehensive service user-led anti-stigma and education programme resulted in significant improvements in recovery attitudes compared to a control cohort. However, it was not found to be similarly superior in facilitating less stigmatising attitudes. Various possible reasons for this are discussed.

AB  - Duringacrisis context such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the population's dependence on the media system to seek information and guidance increases, which can generate and/or increase political attitudes, such as support for the governmental administration of the crisis. In particular, the article seeks to determine if media dependence influenced the citizen evaluation of the management of the president and the subsecretary of Health during the pandemic in Mexico and if the level of political partisanship moderated this effect. A survey with a representative sample at national level (N = 1211) was carried out. Findings allow observing a moderating effect of partisanship on the relationship between dependency and the evaluation of pandemic administration, especially in the case of the subsecretary of Health. This suggests that the differentiated media coverage of both political actors contributed to modifying the citizen evaluation, especially among nonpartisans.

AB  - Across three studies, we investigated whether threats to belongingness influence the tendency to use social relationships as a source of meaning in life (MIL), and in turn, perceived levels of MIL. This study builds on previous similar work in this area (e.g.; Hicks and King in J Posit Psychol 4:471-482, 2009), by explicitly measuring the tendency to base MIL on social relationships. In Study 1, we found that belongingness was positively associated with both the tendency to base MIL on social relationships and overall levels of MIL. Meanwhile, an exploratory mediation analysis was consistent with the idea that basing MIL on social relationships partially mediated the association between belongingness and MIL. In Study 2, we found that an experimental manipulation of social exclusion reduced both the importance attached to social relationships as a source of MIL and MIL levels (and a similar mediation pattern as Study 1). Moreover, participants experiencing threats to belonging tended to reaffirm MIL through autonomy in a compensation type process. In Study 3, we found that the effect of social exclusion on MIL levels and basing MIL on social relationships was attenuated when the value of social relationships was negated. Implications for future research on social relationships and compensation processes in MIL judgments are discussed.

AB  - Background: Numerous studies have produced social distance rankings to identify differences in the intensity of stigma associated with various general medical and mental health conditions. All of these studies, however, treat "mental illness" as a single homogeneous condition, when in reality different diagnoses of mental illness may elicit different levels of stigma.
   Aims of the Study: Within our samples, we aim to: (i) determine if there are significant differences in the intensity of stigma associated with different mental/behavior disorders; (ii) compare the intensity of stigma associated with mental/behavior disorders vs. physical/ sensory disorders; and (iii) analyze the effect of familiarity with a person who has a mental/behavior disorder on the stigma associated with that disorder.
   Methods: College students in the U.S. (n=213) and Republic of Korea (n=354) completed a survey of community attitudes toward persons with disabilities. Students were asked to rank 22 health conditions. including 10 mental/behavior disorders, according to the level of acceptance most usually accorded to persons with that condition in their society. Students also indicated, for each condition, whether they had close contact with a person who had that condition.
   Results: Students in both countries indicated a lower mean level of acceptance for the group of mental/behavior disorders than for the group of physical or sensory disorders. Nevertheless, there were significant differences in the acceptability of different types of mental/behavior disorders, with schizophrenia and substance use disorders eliciting the most negative attitudes in both samples. Familiarity is correlated with greater acceptance for most, but not all. mental/behavior disorders.
   Discussion: Mental illness-related stigma imposes costs on society in the form of productivity losses and increased rates of dependency. Reducing these costs requires an understanding of the negative stereotypes that are the source of stigma, and an appreciation of differences in the nature and intensity of stigma associated with different mental disorders. Limitations of the study include: lack of generalizability of the results; terminology which may have generated negative associations for some survey items; possibility of missing variables or data measured with error.
   Implications for Health Policies: The findings with respect to familiarity underscore the importance of inclusive policies to combat mental illness-related stigma. Anti-stigma policies must, however, account for differences in attitudes toward different diagnoses of mental illness. Strategies that may be effective in reducing stigma for some disorders may be counterproductive for others.
   Implications for Further Research: Many social distance studies rely on non-random samples, limiting generalizability of the results. Future research may be able to exploit web-based survey methods to obtain larger, more representative samples. Studies should include multiple diagnoses of mental/behavior disorders, instead of a single category of mental illness, and explore the ways in which familiarity affects intensity of stigma for different mental disorders.

AB  - In July 2021, breakthrough cases were reported in the outbreak of COVID-19 in Nanjing, sparking concern and discussion about the vaccine's effectiveness and becoming a trending topic on Sina Weibo. In order to explore public attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine and their emotional orientations, we collected 1542 posts under the trending topic through data mining. We set up four categories of attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines, and used a big data analysis tool to code and manually checked the coding results to complete the content analysis. The results showed that 45.14% of the Weibo posts (n = 1542) supported the COVID-19 vaccine, 12.97% were neutral, and 7.26% were doubtful, which indicated that the public did not question the vaccine's effectiveness due to the breakthrough cases in Nanjing. There were 66.47% posts that reflected significant negative emotions. Among these, 50.44% of posts with negative emotions were directed towards the media, 25.07% towards the posting users, and 11.51% towards the public, which indicated that the negative emotions were not directed towards the COVID-19 vaccine. External sources outside the vaccine might cause vaccine hesitancy. Public opinions expressed in online media reflect the public's cognition and attitude towards vaccines and their core needs in terms of information. Therefore, online public opinion monitoring could be an essential way to understand the opinions and attitudes towards public health issues.

AB  - Two studies are conducted to test how consumers respond differently in feeling nostalgic depending on age and gender. Study 1 uses narrative writing tasks to empirically test the effect of nostalgic versus nonnostalgic feelings on youthfulness by age and gender. To increase the external validity of our findings in Study 1, Study 2 replicates it using print ads. The results across the two studies consistently reveal a significant effect of nostalgia on feelings of youthfulness that differs by age and gender. Specifically, older women tend to feel less youthful than older men when nostalgic feelings are induced in both studies, whereas younger adults experience no gender difference. Results also show that these differences are explained by self-discontinuity between current and ideal body image. Furthermore, we identify that nostalgic feelings in advertising are effective because they generate positive feelings of youthfulness that in turn result in positive attitudes toward the ad.

AB  - e-Research is changing practices and dynamics in social research by the incorporation of advanced e-tools to process data and increase scientific collaboration. Previous research shows a positive attitude of investigators through e-Re search and shows a fast incorporation of e-Tools, in despite of many cultural resistances to the change. This paper examines the current state (attitudes, tools and practices) of e-Research in the field of Media and Communication Studies in Latin America, Spain and Portugal. A total of 316 researchers of the region answered an online survey during the last 2 months of 2011. Findings confirm an optimistic attitude through e-Research and an often use of e-Tools to do research. Even though, most of them informed to use basic e-Tools (e. g. e-mail, commercial videoconference, office software and social networks) instead of advanced technologies to process huge amount of data (e. g. Grid, simulation software and Internet2) or the incorporation to Virtual Research Communities. Some of the researchers said that they had an "intensive" (31%) and "often" (53%) use of e-Tools, but only 22% stated that their computer capacity was not enough to manage and process data. The paper evidences the gap between e-Research in Communications and e-Research in other disciplines; and makes recommendations for its implementation.

AB  - Background: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory illness that was recently recognized in humans. Recently, the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia reported a substantial increase in MERS cases, primarily from the Riyadh region. The objective of the present study was to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practices towards MERS among physicians, nurses, pharmacist and technicians individually.
   Methods: A cross sectional study conducted at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia among individual healthcare workers. The survey questionnaire was self-administrated and consisted of five sections: Demographic; Source of MERS information; Knowledge; Attitude; and Practice of healthcare workers towards MERS.
   Results: A total of 391 participants of which physicians (162; 41.4%), pharmacists (18; 4.6%), nurses (130; 33.3%) and technicians (81; 20.7%) were included with a response rate of 95.71%. The majority of the participants were female (53.70%) and mostly in the nurse's category (40.5%). The participants reported the highest main source of information was seminars and workshops (n = 191; 48%) followed by social media (n = 179; 45%). The overall score indicates good knowledge among physicians (95.7%), pharmacists (88.9%), nurses (86.2%) and technicians (91.4%) and showed statistically significant (p = 0.039). The study showed a positive attitude among physicians (96.3%), pharmacist (94.4%), nurses (94.6%) and technicians (90.1%) with no statistically significant (p = 0.273). However, the majority of the participants showed average practices towards MERS. However, the least practice among participants was the use of facemask in the crowds (24.2%). The demographic characteristic's age, gender and professions showed significantly associated with mean knowledge score. Similarly, statistical significance observed in gender and experience demographic variables with a mean attitude score.
   Conclusions: The study concludes that different health workers showed good knowledge and positive attitudes, but low to average practices towards MERS with low adherence to facemask practice. When comparing workers, physicians have a high degree of knowledge and attitude when compared to nurses, pharmacist and technicians. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Parent-child story time is an important ritual of contemporary parenting. Recently, robots with artificial intelligence (AI) have become common. Parental acceptance of children's storytelling robots, however, has received scant attention. To address this, we conducted a qualitative study with 18 parents using the research technique design fiction. Overall, parents held mixed, though generally positive, attitudes toward children's storytelling robots. In their estimation, these robots would outperform screen-based technologies for children's story time. However, the robots' potential to adapt and to express emotion caused some parents to feel ambivalent about the robots, which might hinder their adoption. We found three predictors of parental acceptance of these robots: context of use, perceived agency, and perceived intelligence. Parents' speculation revealed an uncanny valley of AI: a nonlinear relation between the human likeness of the artificial agent's mind and affinity for the agent. Finally, we consider the implications of children's storytelling robots, including how they could enhance equity in children's access to education, and propose directions for research on their design to benefit family well-being.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore factors affecting users' acceptance of automated vehicles (AVs, Level 3). A theoretical acceptance model was proposed by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with new constructs: initial trust and two types of perceived risk (i.e., perceived safety risk [PSR] and perceived privacy risk [PPR)). It was hypothesized that initial trust was built upon perception factors (i.e., perceived usefulness [PU], perceived ease of use [PEOU], PSR, and PPR) and was a key determinant of AV acceptance. The validity of the model was confirmed with a structure equation modeling analysis based on data collected from 216 survey samples. Results revealed that initial trust was the most critical factor in promoting a positive attitude towards AVs, which, together with PU, determined users' intention to use AVs. Initial trust could be enhanced by improving PU and reducing PSR associated with AVs. Theoretically, these findings suggest that initial trust offers another and probably more important pathway for other factors to impact consumers' adoption of systems with uncertainty. Practically, the findings provide guidance for designing interventions aimed at improving public's acceptance towards AVs.

AB  - This research aims to examine transprejudice in the Turkish cultural context and identify its socio-political and morality-based correlates. To that end, we report two studies. In Study 1, we manipulate the gender identity of a hypothetical victim in a violent criminal scenario. We find that people (N = 116) put greater social distance towards a transwoman compared to a ciswoman victim, yet do not distinguish between the two in terms of responsibility attributions. In Study 2 (N = 175), we explore the socio-political and moral underpinnings of transprejudice by focusing on the role of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) in different forms of transprejudice through the mediating functionof moral foundations. RWA predicts greater social distance and less positive affect towards transwomen through the purity foundation; while SDO predicts lower positive affect through the care foundation. The findings show that transprejudice does exist to some extent and that RWA seems to be a potent socio-political predictor of transprejudice in Turkey. The moral foundations, on the other hand, do not seem to play the mediator role that has been shown for other prejudice domains and different cultural contexts.

AB  - Background: Social network sites (SNSs) are widely exploited in health education and communication by the general public, including patients with various conditions. Nevertheless, there is an absence of evidence evaluating SNSs in connecting health professionals for professional purposes.
   Objective: This pilot randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the feasibility of an intervention aiming to investigate the effects of a continuous professional education program utilizing Facebook to obtain knowledge on dementia and care for patients with dementia.
   Methods: Eighty health professionals from Hong Kong were recruited for participation in the study and randomized at a 1:1 ratio by a block randomization method to the intervention group (n=40) and control group (n=40). The intervention was an 8-week educational program developed to deliver updated knowledge on dementia care from a multidisciplinary perspective, either by Facebook (intervention group) or by email (control group) from October 2018 to January 2019. The primary outcomes were the effects of the intervention, measured by differences in the means of changes in pre- and postintervention scores of knowledge assessments from the 25-item Dementia Knowledge Assessment Scale (DKAS) and formative evaluation of 20 multiple choice questions. Other outcome measurements included participant compliance, participant engagement in Facebook, satisfaction, and self-perceived uses of Facebook for continuing professional education programs.
   Results: Significantly more intervention group participants (n=35) completed the study than the control group (n=25) (P<.001). The overall retention rate was 75% (60/80). The mean of changes in scores in the intervention group were significant in all assessments (P<.001). A significant difference in the mean of changes in scores between the two groups was identified in the DKAS subscale Communication and Behavior (95% CI 0.4-3.3, P=.02). There was no significant difference in the total DKAS scores, scores of other DKAS subscales, and multiple choice questions. Participant compliance was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (P<.001). The mean numbers of participants accessing the learning materials were 31.5 (SD 3.9) and 17.6 (SD 5.2) in the intervention and control group, respectively. Polls attracted the highest level of participant engagement, followed by videos. Intervention group participants scored significantly higher in favoring the use of Facebook for the continuing education program (P=.03). Overall, participants were satisfied with the interventions (mean score 4 of a total of 5, SD 0.6).
   Conclusions: The significantly higher retention rate, together with the high levels of participant compliance and engagement, demonstrate that Facebook is a promising tool for professional education. Education delivered through Facebook was significantly more effective at improving participants' knowledge of how people with dementia communicate and behave. Participants demonstrated positive attitudes toward utilizing Facebook for professional learning. These findings provide evidence for the feasibility of using Facebook as an intervention delivery tool in a manner that can be rolled out into practical settings.

AB  - Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a global pandemic. Healthcare workers' (HCWs) role in patient management is predisposing and can serve as means of hospitals and community transmission. This study evaluated HCWs' knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 in Nigeria.
   Methods: we carried out a cross-sectional survey among HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria from March to June 2020. The study assessed 346 HCWs for Knowledge, attitude, and practice by using an online (Google form) self-administered questionnaire, based on a convinience sampling technique Data were retrieved and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Chi-Square and one-way ANOVA were used to measure association and difference among demographic variables. The relationship between knowledge, attitude, and practice was measured using Spearman's rho correlation test.
   Results: the mean knowledge score of the HCWs was 7.1 on a scale of 0-8. The correct overall rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 88.75%. Knowledge was gained mainly from television (35.0%) and social media (35.0%). The mean attitude score on a scale of 0-6 was 5.31 +/- 0.39. Most (92.5%) participants were confident that Nigerian medical scientists would win the war against COVID-19. The majority (92.2%) of the respondents thought that SARS-CoV-2 was not a biological weapon. About 1 out of 5 respondents held that faith healing or prayer is the only cure for COVID-19. A vast majority of the HCWs were taking precautionary measures such as avoiding crowded places (94.2%), washing of hands (96.0%), and the use of personal protective equipment (91.6%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, only 3 out of 5 HCWs used a face mask when leaving home. There was a significant (p = 0.046) positive correlation (0.584) between knowledge and attitude.
   Conclusion: our results showed that HCWs in Nigeria had excellent knowledge and possessed a positive attitude and good practice towards COVID-19. However; there were areas where poor knowledge, negative attitudes and unacceptable practices were observed. We recommend continuous public health education of HCWs on SARS-COV-2 infection control and prevention.

AB  - September 11th was a turning point in the understanding of terrorism and radicalization. The Internet has provided an instrumental change regarding how terrorists communicate and spread their propaganda, proving a cause of concern for counterterrorism units. The increased use of social networking platforms has provided a significant change in the process of self-radicalization, with younger generations at greater risk. The aim of the project was to study the relationship between social media and self-radicalization among college and university students. A sample of 499 participants was recruited throughout Amazon Mechanical Turk and social media platforms. Measures on emotional intelligence, psychological involvement on social media, attitudes toward terrorism, and political violence, and loneliness were gathered. Results showed that individuals holding a university degree-especially young men-were more at risk of endorzing positive attitudes toward political violence and terrorism, and, therefore, more at risk of being radicalized.

AB  - Recently, there has been an increase in prejudice toward some groups such as immigrants. In response, governments and citizens have called for compassion. In four studies, we tested the hypothesis that people who are high in compassionate love would express less prejudice than those who are low. We found that people high in compassionate love had more positive attitudes toward out-groups, including immigrants. The relation between compassionate love and prejudice toward immigrants was mediated by inclusion of out-group members in the self. An experiment provided evidence of a causal link between compassionate love and prejudice toward immigrants. Finally, people high in compassionate love were less likely to discriminate against immigrants in a budget cutting exercise and more likely to volunteer to help them. Empathy did not account for our results. We conclude that compassionate love holds promise as a positive pathway to prejudice reduction.

AB  - In this article, we use newly available data from the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life (RDSL) study to compare a wide range of attitudes related to pregnancy for 961 black and white young women. We also investigate the extent to which race differences are mediated by, or net of, family background, childhood socioeconomic status (SES), adolescent experiences related to pregnancy, and current SES. Compared with white women, black women generally have less positive attitudes toward young nonmarital sex, contraception, and childbearing, and have less desire for sex in the upcoming year. This is largely because black women are more religious than white women and partly because they are more socioeconomically disadvantaged in young adulthood. However, in spite of these less positive attitudes, black women are more likely to expect sex without contraception in the next year and to expect more positive consequences if they were to become pregnant, relative to white women. This is largely because, relative to white women, black women had higher rates of sex without contraception in adolescence and partly because they are more likely to have grown up with a single parent. It is unclear whether attitudes toward contraception and pregnancy preceded or are a consequence of adolescent sex without contraception. Some race differences remain unexplained; net of all potential mediators in our models, black women have less desire for sex in the upcoming year, but they are less willing to refuse to have sex with a partner if they think it would make him angry and they expect more positive personal consequences of a pregnancy, relative to white women. In spite of these differences, black women's desires to achieve and to prevent pregnancy are very similar to white women's desires.

AB  - How can we explain the persuasiveness of populist messages, and who are most susceptible to their effects? These questions remain largely unanswered in extant research. This study argues that populist messages are characterized by assigning blame to elites in an emotionalized way. As previous research pointed at the guiding influence of blame attributions and emotions on political attitudes, these message characteristics may explain populism's persuasiveness. An experiment using a national sample (N = 721) was conducted to provide insights into the effects of and mechanisms underlying populist blame attribution with regard to the European and national levels of governance. The results show that emotionalized blame attributions influence both blame perceptions and populist attitudes. Identity attachment moderates these effects: Emotionalized blame attributions have the strongest effects for citizens with weaker identity attachments. These insights allow us to understand how populist messages affect which citizens.

AB  - Background: We investigated and compared practices and attitudes about childhood vaccination between young parents and their parents and identified influences and sources of information in the County of Zadar, Croatia. Methods: This research was conducted in six general practice and paediatric medical clinics. It included 300 volunteers, including 150 younger parents and 150 older grandparents. Information was collected with a survey questionnaire. The survey data were statistically processed. Results: The 300 participants were divided into 2 groups. Most of the respondents were married, employed, had a high school education, and had a good economic status, often with two children and living in the city. Generally, the attitude towards vaccination was positive. Healthcare workers made the most important influence on the decision for vaccination. The younger age group was significantly affected by social networks and the internet and wanted more information. They were afraid of the adjuvants in vaccines. The older respondents held that vaccination must be legally regulated and did not believe the anti-vaccine media headlines. Conclusions: Our respondents had positive attitudes towards childhood vaccination, noticed the benefits of vaccinating children, and held that untreated children represent a risk for the community. They were well informed and satisfied with the collaboration with medical professionals, although the media and social networks had some impact on attitudes.

AB  - In this paper we discuss how cyberspace has been interwoven in the geographies of social stratification and segregation nowadays. It conceptualizes `virtual segregation' as an extension of the `digital divide' and sociospatial segregation in urban spaces. A case study was conducted in Hong Kong in 2010, when 770 Internet users were surveyed. A comparison of their patterns of Internet use shows that these individuals, all of whom possess devices and Internet access, have varied levels of connectivity in cyberspace. A typology of Internet users was then derived from the perspective of virtual segregation. The findings suggest that people may be stratified and segregated in cyberspace in similar ways to the physical world, and that segregation studies should pay more attention to virtual segregation.

AB  - The overload of news in today's digital information environment can lead to biased media exposure on the individual level-for example, based on the confirmation of preexisting attitudes, attractiveness of negative news, and familiarity with sources. To better understand such news patterns and to whom these selection biases apply, this study identifies different classes of (biased) news audiences and explores several antecedents. A survey in the U.S. and UK presented respondents with multiple vignettes in the form of political news headlines that were altered to reflect (1) confirmation bias, (2) negativity bias, and (3) source bias. Respondents' likelihood of selecting these biased news items was used to classify individuals into audience profiles. The results of a latent profile analysis provide three distinct and theoretically meaningful classes of news audiences that vary in terms of selection biases: avoiders, confirmers, and informers. As an important contribution, we show how these profiles are driven by the political attitudes and news preferences of audiences.

AB  - COVID-19 is a threat to everyone's health but can be especially devastating to older individuals. To prevent spread of the virus, social distancing has become the norm worldwide. However, with social distancing comes significantly less face-to-face interaction, which may be particularly harmful to older adults given their existing levels of loneliness. While social technologies can be used to provide critical social interaction during this time of necessary physical distancing, older adults tend to either lack access to these technologies or the skills and experience necessary to use them effectively. Once online, older adults face the additional challenge of being outsized targets of misinformation and scams, both of which abound in the context of COVID-19. In this essay, we discuss the challenges faced by older adults in their use of digital media for social connection in the present pandemic, as well as highlight some of the population's untapped strengths which can be leveraged to help them live prosperous online lives. Finally, we provide recommendations for actions which key stakeholders can take to support older adults in this pursuit.

AB  - In this article, we examine the ways in which media frames and rhetorical devices in the Chinese media shaped the representation of the genetically modified (GM) golden rice. We draw on a study of Chinese media representations of an experiment designed to test the efficacy of golden rice as a source of Vitamin A using school children in China's Hunan province as subjects. The study analysed Chinese web news stories about the Hunan experiment posted between 30 August 2012 (when Greenpeace first reported on the issue) and 30 October 2012. This experiment resulted in allegations of breaches in scientific protocols and created a hostile public reaction. The incident fuelled the long-standing debate about the risks and benefits of GM crops in China. In this article, we analyse 25 online news reports, examining the attitudinal orientation of the articles, the readers' comments on the articles and GM crops, the writing style and rhetorical devices employed, the emotions provoked and the frames manifest and embedded in these articles and comments. We found that although only one-third of the articles manifested an obviously negative attitude towards golden rice and GM foods, their use of strident metaphors and analogies were designed to arouse readers' fear and concerns about GM crops. In the anti-golden rice articles, we identified conspiracy frames, including the view that the West was using genetic engineering to establish global control over agriculture and that GM products were instruments for genocide. The pro-golden rice articles emphasised the scientific humanitarian progress, but it appears to be less attractive to the readers.

AB  - Recent research has demonstrated that genetic differences explain a sizeable fraction of the variance in political orientations, but little is known about the pathways through which genes might affect political preferences. In this article, we use a uniquely assembled dataset of almost 1,000 Swedish male twin pairs containing detailed information on cognitive ability and political attitudes in order to further examine the genetic and environmental causes of political orientations. Our study makes three distinct contributions to our understanding of the etiology of political orientations: (1) we report heritability estimates across different dimensions of political ideology; (2) we show that cognitive ability and political orientations are related; and (3) we provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that cognitive ability mediates part of the genetic influence on political orientations. These findings provide important clues about the nature of the complex pathways from molecular genetic variation to political orientations.

AB  - Despite increasing awareness of stigma from mental health service providers as a barrier to recovery, little research has directly examined how it might influence the service users' self-perceptions and treatment experience. The present study examined the association of service users' perceived provider stigma with their experience of internalized stigma and disempowerment, two psychosocial constructs known to hinder recovery. Mental health service users (N = 350) completed questionnaires assessing perceived stigma from mental health service providers, including perceptions of negative affective reactions towards individual users and desired social distance towards people with mental illnesses across various life domains, internalized stigma, and disempowerment (i.e., diminished self-efficacy and mastery) in mental health treatment settings. Structural equation modeling showed that both perceived negative affective reactions and perceived social distance were positively associated with disempowerment. Furthermore, these associations were significantly mediated by internalized stigma. These findings illuminate how perceived stigma from providers can "get under the skin" of mental health service users and contribute to their overall sense of disempowerment in mental health settings. They also highlight the need for future stigma reduction interventions to specifically target the attitudes and beliefs held by mental health professionals.

AB  - The phenomenon of scandal(ization) has become omnipresent in contemporary political media discourses - at the latest since the 2016 US presidential election. Our article addresses causes and effects of this recent prevalence of scandal narratives. By connecting concepts from social systems theory and media theory, we consider crucial practices and processes of scandal construction in the 2016 US presidential election, focusing on the much-noticed emailgate and trumptape scandals. Both examples serve to illustrate how the emergence of partial public spheres in social media may lead to a fight for sovereignty over scandal discourse, political attitudes, and the negotiation of social norms, morals, and values.

AB  - This study, based on a representative online survey of 1080 US journalists conducted in 2013, analyses the demographic and organizational predictors of how journalists use social media and how they evaluate the impact of these media on their professional norms and values. The findings indicate that 9 of 10 US journalists regularly use social media in their work-but mainly to check on what other news organizations are doing and to look for breaking news events. The most frequent users of social media are younger journalists with higher incomes who work for television, radio, or online news organizations. The findings also indicate that journalists who hold more positive attitudes toward the use of social media in journalism, and those who think that social media are more important in their jobs, tend to be more supportive of the populist-mobilizer and the disseminator roles of journalism.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 participants from eleven universities located in ten states around the U.S. Over half of the participants continue to have positive attitudes to working in the industry, as long as the businesses follow proper health guidelines. Professors and social media become the major platforms to collect career information and connect with potential employers. For career decisions, job security, stable working hours and a source of income become the important factors they consider. The insights revealed by the current analysis will assist hospitality management programs' decision makers and career advisers to better prepare their graduates to succeed in their career during turbulent times.

AB  - Citizen science programs provide an opportunity for the public to reconnect with nature; however, pro-environmental values may not necessarily result in a high level of participation. This study assessed the values and attitudes toward ecology and conservation of 482 people, including 231 citizen scientists participating in two programs requiring either a 'complex' or 'simple' level of participation. Positive attitudes toward urban wildlife were positively associated with increased participation in citizen scientist programs; however, a pro-ecological attitude was not always associated with an increasing level of participation. Young adults were more likely to participate in the simple data submitting a program or via social media, while middle-aged and older adults from vegetated suburbs were more likely to participate in the complex data collecting multi-species focused program. These results have implications for strategic design and targeting of citizen science programs to maximize participation rates.

AB  - American politics scholars disagree on the extent to which voters use policy information to evaluate politicians versus relying on partisan cues to evaluate policies. We demonstrate the coexistence of both of these perspectives, by studying the degree to which objective facts (measured with local COVID-19 cases) and partisan cues (measured with President Trump's tweets about the virus) influence differences in the social distancing behaviors in Democrat and Republican counties in 2020. We find that both factors play an important role in social distancing but that the relative importance between cues and facts favors the latter. Furthermore, the importance of these signals declines over time, suggesting a crucial but underappreciated dynamic of how partisan positions evolve in a Bayesian framework.

AB  - In this Viewpoint we wish to stimulate debate concerning the impact on citizens of the move to deliver more and more public services online (e-government) in urban and rural areas. It is now widely accepted that we are moving more and more online as society. However, there has been a lack of discussion about the implications of the government's strategy to move services online especially for those most disadvantaged. The increasing focus and use of Information and Communication Technologies is changing the ways we can access public services, goods and services and health information. There is an increasing separation between those who have the skills, knowledge and economic resources to do so with those who do not - how we ensure full citizenship for all remains unanswered if not too often unconsidered.

   The study is based on an experiment in which some participants watched a political TV series with a negative tone (House of Cards), others watched a series with a positive tone (The West Wing), while a control group watched The Big Bang Theory, a non - political show. Results show that those who perceive House of Cards to be realistic became more cynical. There is also evidence of a decline in cynicism among participants who perceive The West Wing to be realistic.

AB  - This paper investigates the role of crucial technological and social factors in enhancing or undermining vaccine coverage rates at the country level worldwide. Employing five country-level databases, it explores how different combinations of technology diffusion (that is, social media penetration) and social conditions (functional literacy and attitude toward science) affect the level of vaccine coverage. The analyses are based on two built ad-hoc longitudinal datasets of 36 and 40 countries worldwide, employing a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fs-QCA) approach. The findings highlight that, at the country level, the absence of high social media penetration, combined with an above-average level of functional literacy and positive attitude toward science, enable vaccine coverage to reach the level recommended by health institutions and authorities.

AB  - As environmental threats intensify rapidly across the globe, understanding how to promote public engagement in pro-environmental actions to address these threats is imperative. Contributing to the effort, we examined two influencers of pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors, psychological proximity and social ties influence, in the context of a recycling campaign through Facebook. We administered an online survey to a random sample of 434 U.S. Millennials. Results showed that psychological proximity (i.e. cognitive and emotional proximities) predicted positive attitudes toward recycling, intentions to like, share, and comment on posts of recycling-related social media campaigns, and to engage in recycling behaviors. The perceived influence of social ties (i.e. strong ties and weak ties) moderated the relationship between psychological proximity and attitudes toward recycling as well as offline recycling intentions. The results revealed that Millennials who perceive a stronger influence of their social ties, both strong and weak ties, rely less on their psychological proximity to determine their attitudes and offline behavioral intentions, indicating the critical influence of social ties. Theoretical and practical implications are suggested.

AB  - The understanding of the role of Cohesion Policy on the processes of European identity building is becoming more and more important in a period or resurgence of nationalisms and Euroscepticism. However, empirical evidence on this is still extremely scarce, due to both conceptual issues and data limitations. The present study tackles these limits and presents an empirical analysis of the way in which satisfaction with Cohesion Policy affected identification with Europe in EU regions between 2014 and 2017. Results show that this relationship is highly dependent on the intensity of funding spent, capturing the intensity of the European policy, and on the recent economic trend occurred at the regional level. This effect is boosted by a positive attitude towards EU institutions.

AB  - Although e-learning has been studied in different contexts, the intention to use e-learning during the Corona virus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has yet to be explored. This study extends the technology acceptance model (TAM) by treating e-learning interactivity as the antecedent construct of TAM. The constructs of uncertainty avoidance and perceived risks of COVID-19 were also added to understand the attitude and behavioral intentions of students to use e-learning. Two hundred and eighty-eight students from India participated in this study and partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The results revealed that e-learning offers a high level of interactivity, which influences perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness and enhances a positive attitude of the students. Perceived ease of use was directly found to influence the perceived usefulness of e-learning. Uncertainty avoidance had a positive effect on attitude and intention to use e-learning. Perceived risks of COVID-19 showed a positive and significant effect on attitude, whereas the former did not affect intention to use e-learning. Finally, attitude also influenced intention to use e-learning. Our findings provide academia with theoretical implications and practitioners with practical implications.

AB  - E-cigarette users' beliefs about COVID-19 may shape their responses to the pandemic and their e-cigarette consumption. A U.S. national cross-sectional survey of 562 e-cigarette users was conducted in April 2020. Participants self-reported nicotine consumption, COVID-19 beliefs, beliefs about e-cigarettes, social distancing, COVID-19 disruptions, cessation considerations, and individual characteristics. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression provided unstandardized, and standardized coefficients. Frequency of e-cigarette use is inversely associated with beliefs COVID-19 is relevant (beta = -0.215). Beliefs e-cigarettes are addictive, harmful, or pose a risk to future health were positively associated with beliefs COVID-19 is relevant (beta = 0.171; beta = 0.164; beta = 0.203), beliefs the media are truthful on COVID-19 (beta = 0.133; beta = 0.136; beta = 0.137), and beliefs e-cigarette users are at greater risk (beta = 0.279; beta = 0.411; beta = 0.447). All three COVID-19 beliefs (COVID relevant; media truthful; and greater risk) were positively associated with social distancing (beta = 0.307; beta = 0.259; beta = 0.115), work disruptions (beta = 0.134; beta = 0.135; beta = 0.130), family disruptions (beta = 0.232; beta = 0.131; beta = 0.164), friendship disruptions (beta = 0.214; beta = 0.139; beta = 0.133), and considerations of quitting (beta = 0.250; beta = 0.222; beta = 0.620). Strong associations between e-cigarette beliefs and COVID-19 beliefs exist. COVID-19 beliefs are associated with behavioral responses, such as social distancing and considerations of e-cigarette cessation. Interventions may be able to leverage COVID-19 beliefs to reduce e-cigarette consumption or promote cessation during the pandemic.

AB  - The present study investigates the mediating roles of psychological inflexibility and differential coping strategies on perceived stress and post-traumatic symptoms and growth in the context of COVID-19. Study one recruited 662 participants (54.8% women; M-age =40.64 years, SD =13.04) who completed a cross-sectional questionnaire. It was proposed that orientation to the problem, avoidance strategies, psychological inflexibility, and positive attitude were mediators for the positive association between perceived stress and PTSD symptoms. The fit indices for the path model were excellent: CFI =0.977, TLI =0.950, RMSEA = 0.057 [90%CI =0.043-0.081], and SRMS =0.042. Gender and stressful events encountered had indirect effects on the endogenous variables. In study two, 128 participants (57.8% women; M-age =42.30, SD =12.08) were assessed for post-traumatic growth one year later. Psychological inflexibility and orientation acted as mediators between perceived stress and PTSD symptoms. Furthermore, a novel path model was constructed in which psychological inflexibility and orientation to the problem as mediators for perceived stress and PTSD symptoms. The indices for the path model were excellent: CFI = 0.99, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.055 [90%CI = 0.001-0.144], and SRMS = 0.49. Furthermore, PTSD symptoms, psychological inflexibility, and orientation to the problem predicted post-traumatic growth. Specifically, both orientation to the problem (beta = .06 [90%CI: .01;.13]) and psychological inflexibility (beta = .14 [90%CI: .08;.26]) had an indirect effect on post-traumatic growth. Overall, these results significantly contribute to the literature as orientation to the problem positively predicted PTSD symptoms and post-traumatic growth one year later while psychological inflexibility predicted PTSD symptoms and less post-traumatic growth one year later. These results underline the importance of assessing both symptomology and psychological growth to determine adaptive coping strategies in specific contexts.

AB  - Schizophrenia affects more than eight million people in China. Stigmatization of schizophrenia may prevent family members and close others from providing social support to those with schizophrenia. This article aims to investigate the potential use of a biogenetic approach to reduce the stigma of schizophrenia using a cross-sectional (study 1, n = 141) and an experimental design (study 2, n = 100) in China. In the first study, mediation analysis reveals that perceived affiliate stigma, the negative prejudice, and discrimination towards family members of individuals with socially stigmatized identities due to their affiliation with the person mediates the path between biogenetic beliefs and desire for social distance. This pattern is replicated in study 2 in which two 10-min lectures were created and used to influence participants' beliefs in biogenetic causes of schizophrenia. Findings suggest that the biogenetic approach may increase Chinese participants' desired social distance towards their family members with schizophrenia through increasing their concerns about the negative consequences of being affiliated with the family member. Therefore, future research should investigate aspects of biogenetic anti-stigma campaigns that do not increase participants' perception of affiliate stigma in China.

AB  - The aim of this longitudinal study was to determine the effect of an original prevention program (RAPP) on the behavioral and cognitive characteristics of adolescents with high risk for substance consumption. Seventy-six Mexican adolescents 12-15 years old (38 with high risk (HR) and 38 with low risk (LR)) were selected. RAPP was applied for 3 months. Resilience, social skills, attitudes towards substance use, ability to delay a reward, and inhibitory control were assessed in these adolescents, before and after the RAPP intervention. Both groups improved their scores; however, HR achieved greater changes than LR. Findings suggest that HR have behavioral characteristics that can be considered as risk factors for substance consumption (low levels of resilience, low social skills, little family support, positive attitudes towards substance use). RAPP proved to be an effective program for preventing these risk factors for substance use in adolescents.

AB  - Science may be failing to convince a significant number of people about COVID-19 scientific facts and needed public health measures. Individual and social factors are behind believing conspiracy theories. Adults (N = 1001) were asked to rate their beliefs in various conspiracy theories circulating in social media, rate their psychological distress relating to COVID-19, rate their trust in science to solve COVID-19 problems, and rate their willingness to adhere to measures regarding social distancing and quarantine. The findings showed conspiracy theories are widely believed and related to lower age, lower education, living in less densely populated areas, and lower income. Stronger conspiracy theory beliefs predicted science mistrust and unwillingness to adhere to public health measures. Psychological state was a strong predictor of conspiracy beliefs. Recommendations, stemming from the findings, for reducing such beliefs and better serving public health are discussed.

AB  - Background High-quality patient care is a complex phenomenon that requires collaboration among healthcare professionals. Research has shown that Interprofessional Education (IPE) carries promise to improve collaborative work and patient care. So far, collaboration among various health professionals remains a challenge. Very few focus group discussions to determine the medical students' readiness and positive attitudes towards IPE have been reported from the Arabian context. Methods A two-staged sequential mixed methods study was conducted among medical, dental, pharmacy, and health sciences students of the University of Sharjah United Arab Emirates. The perspectives of students toward IPE and collaborative practice were first gathered by administering a validated instrument, Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS). This was followed by focused group discussions. A quantitative as well as a qualitative data analysis was performed. Results This study cohort included 282 students. All respondents showed readiness to adopt IPE as all statements of the RIPLS inventory scored high median scores. All participants showed positive attitudes and readiness towards IPE. Three main domains of themes were generated from focus group discussions; prior knowledge, need for IPE framework and its implementation. Information workload, lack of clarity and less focused teaching pedagogies of IPE were considered as perceived barriers. Conclusion This study demonstrated a substantial agreement of medical and health sciences students towards readiness and perceived effectiveness of IPE. Educators are urged to embed new IPE programs into existing curricular frameworks, which can potentially enhance collaborative learning and improve quality of patient care.

AB  - Cancer survivors manage their new status using a multitude of coping mechanisms. Coping strategies vary by individual, but are also socioculturally mediated. Scarce evidence on coping strategies adopted by Hispanic male cancer survivors (HMCS) is available to date. The purpose of this study was to explore the reaction to diagnosis and subsequent coping strategies employed by HMCS. Data were gathered through focus groups (n = 18), cognitive interviews (n = 12), and phone interviews (n = 84). Coping strategies included positive attitudes, humor, optimism and social support, use of home remedies, lifestyle changes, and faith. Findings are consistent with research on non-cancer-related coping showing that HMCS use active coping strategies, such as religion and support from family and friends. The analysis of existing strategies and needs points to the need to develop evidence-based psychosocial services that build on strengths and coping behaviors already employed by HMCS.

AB  - What is the role of culture in establishing young people's pathways into gang membership? Italian criminal organizations (COs) exhibit adherence to codes of honor and masculinity, important values in the context where they originated. Here it is proposed that the embedding of these values at an individual level may lessen young people's group-based opposition to such organizations, and indirectly, create a space in which such organizations can persist and recruit. In a study of young Southern Italians (N = 176; M-age = 16.17), we found that those who endorsed ideological beliefs related to the honorableness of male violence reported lower intentions to engage in antimafia activities. Consistent with the hypothesized mechanisms, this relationship was mediated by more positive attitudes toward COs, and lower reported vicarious shame in relation to the activities of COs. Directions for future research and implications for research on gangs are discussed.

AB  - Purpose Healthcare providers have limited time to spend with scoliosis patients who are considering surgery and their families. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an e-health strategy to increase knowledge and coping in patients with scoliosis who are surgical candidates and their families.
   Methods We enrolled patients with scoliosis who were candidates for surgery and their families. Patients and their families completed the scoliosis knowledge questionnaire, meaning of illness questionnaire, social support and coping questionnaires before and after access to a comprehensive evidence-based scoliosis website (http://www.aboutkidshealth.ca/scoliosis).
   Results Seventy-four patients and 71 parents completed the evaluation. While both patients and parents improved their knowledge of scoliosis (p = 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively), the scores of patients were consistently lower than those of the parents both before and after website use (p = 0.0001). Only parents demonstrated a change in the meaning of illness questionnaire, with a small increase in the negative attitude towards illness and a small decrease in the positive attitude towards illness (p = 0002 and p = 0.01, respectively). Of the 12 coping methods examined on the Adolescent Coping Orientation for Problem Experiences (A-COPE) instrument, patients were slightly more likely than parents to use relaxing and solving family problems as tools to cope following website access (p = 0.02 and p = 0.09, respectively). Parents demonstrated no significant changes in the four methods of coping on the Coping Health Inventory for Parents (CHIP) after website exposure. While the majority of patients and parents reported receiving sufficient support, over half of the patients indicated a need for more support in social participation.
   Conclusion An evidence-based website increased the knowledge of patients and parents but simply providing access to the website had minimal impact on their coping and perceptions of social support. The website, however, provides users with the opportunity to absorb vital information about scoliosis across several media.

AB  - Background. Recent A(H1N1) studies suggest that intrapersonal and interpersonal factors may exert influence on people's preventive behaviors for avoiding the flu during pandemics. Aims. Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and vaccinations play key roles in containing disease transmission during a pandemic. We examined how intrapersonal and interpersonal factors influenced adoption of NPIs and vaccine uptake during the A(H1N1) pandemic of 2009. Method. The data come from a nationally representative sample survey of 1,569 American adults. Hierarchical multivariable logistic regression was conducted to investigate the association between socioeconomic position, concern and knowledge about the threat, social networks for health advice or health care seeking, health consultations with doctors, and NPIs (including individual's social distancing behaviors and hygiene practices) and vaccine acceptance. Results. People with higher scores on health-related social networks, more knowledge or concern about A(H1N1), and those who have consulted their doctor were more likely than others to adopt NPIs. There was a significant association between being concerned about A(H1N1), having consulted a doctor, and seeking a vaccine. Conclusions. These findings suggest that interpersonal communication factors, such as health-related social networks and consultations with doctors, and intrapersonal factors, such as concern and knowledge, play a critical role in NPIs and vaccine uptake during pandemics and offer avenues for intervention.

AB  - The notion that the media's principal role regarding public opinion is reinforcement of pre-existing attitudes - and that this idea is relative inconsequential politically - is pervasive, across many political and social science sub-disciplines, and in non-academic commentary. This article comprehensively challenges the evidential and theoretical underpinnings of this thesis, drawing on a wealth of contemporary survey data and media coverage research, across a range of issues, including climate change, Brexit, immigration, the economy and benefit fraud. It also argues that reinforcement' is an important and consequential power, and that the processes involved have significant implications for public misperception of salient political issues. It makes the case that the media create attitudinal uncertainty, and can have pervasive but subtle influences on political attitudes, particularly when there are persistent patterns of coverage across a range of media. But also that in contexts like particularly close political contests, such influences can be decidedly consequential.

AB  - To be competitive with rivals, charitable organizations must rely on carefully formulated promotion programs. The literature, however, provides mixed advice on the effectiveness of charitable appeals. As a result, there is a need for research to identify their prevalence and effectiveness. The present research conducts a content analysis of charitable promotions and finds that more than 55% appeal to selfless consumer motives (i.e., altruism). A subsequent experiment reveals that appealing to more selfless (i.e., altruism) versus less selfless (i.e., reputation) consumer motives results in consumers having a more favorable attitude toward the charitable organization. Furthermore, consumer involvement is found to moderate this effect; more (vs. less) selfless appeals promote a more positive attitude among consumers with low, but not for those with high, involvement with a charitable cause (e.g., animal welfare). Managers should consider appealing to altruism in their charitable promotions, especially when targeting low-involvement consumers.

AB  - This study examined how psychological distance, both social and temporal, can be leveraged in prosocial health behavior messages to mitigate perceived psychological reactance. Following the construal level and psychological reactance theories, we conducted a 2 x 2 between-subjects factorial design (N = 245), which manipulated naturalistic messages regarding a prosocial communications campaign. Structural equation modeling showed that far temporal distance combined with far social distance could significantly reduce threat to freedom and therefore positively affect attitudes and behavioral intentions toward prosocial health topics. The effect of social distance was found not significant, differing from past findings. Further, intertwined and parallel psychological reactance models were tested and discussed. We suggest the need for more psychological reactance research, particularly examining prosocial health behavior. Strategies for practical persuasion strategies in prosocial messages are proposed.

AB  - Social distancing rules during the COVID-19 pandemic changed social interaction for many and increased the risk of loneliness in the general population. Social media use has been ambiguously related to loneliness, and associations may differ by age. The study aimed to examine loneliness and its association with social media use within different age groups during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Norway, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia during April/May 2020, and 3,810 participants aged 18 years or above were recruited. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between social media use and social and emotional loneliness within separate age groups. Emotional loneliness was higher among young adults and among those who used social media several times daily. Adjusting by sociodemographic variables, using more types of social media was associated with lower social loneliness among the oldest participants, and with higher emotional loneliness among the youngest participants. Among middle-aged participants, using social media more frequently was associated with lower social loneliness. We found that the associations between social media use and loneliness varied by age. Older people's engagement on social media may be a resource to reduce loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic. We observed higher levels of loneliness among high-frequent social media users of younger age.

AB  - As individuals accumulate media-based experiences with famous exemplars of racial/ethnic outgroups, subsequent reminders of those exemplars may elicit positive attitudes about the group as a whole. This "generalized appraisal process" was tested in two online experiments (one a replication) with US White 13- to 17-year-olds (N = 167; N = 200), who were randomized to see information about US Latino celebrities, Asian/Asian-American celebrities, or to a no-exposure control condition. Each celebrity condition (relative to control) increased warmth toward the focal group. There were further indirect-only effects of condition on other school-related judgments about each group, via the effect on warmth. In addition, consistent with secondary transfer hypotheses, each celebrity condition (relative to control) positively affected judgments about other racial/ethnic groups, via warmth toward the focal group. There was less support for racial stratification hypotheses.

AB  - Citizens' attitudes toward science are related to their use of science-related information from various sources. Evidence is scarce regarding citizens' individual media repertoires for staying informed about science as segmentation studies so far have primarily focused on scientific attitudes. In this paper, we explore audience segments regarding their science-related information behavior and whether such segments are comparable or vary between two countries with similar information environments. Based on two surveys in Switzerland and Germany, we identify national audience segments that differ in their science-related information repertoires, and analyze their sociodemographic characteristics and science-related attitudes. In both countries, we find very comparable information user segments ranging from those who inform themselves frequently about science ("Active Seekers"/"Science Consumers") to those who hardly get in contact with any information about science and research ("Non-Users"). Those segments which get in contact with information about science frequently show generally more positive attitudes.

AB  - Introduction: Electronic modes of continuing medical education (eCME) can provide an appropriate and scalable way of updating the knowledge and skills of general practitioners (GPs). To optimize the adoption of eCME and develop efficient and cost-effective eCME programs, factors explaining GPs' intention to use eCME must first be elucidated.
   Methods: Using the Theory of Planned Behavior as a framework, we developed a questionnaire and administered it to GPs in seven CME seminars in Isfahan, Iran, in 2014. Three domains of GPs' intention to use eCME were measured: attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms. We used linear and logistic regression to identify the main predictors of intention and behavior.
   Results: GPs who had high score in perceived behavioral control and a more positive attitude toward e-learning had a higher intention to adopt it for CME. In contrast, subjective norms (eg, social pressures to use eCME) were not a predictor. Attitude toward usefulness of eCME was the main predictor of being an actual eCME user.
   Discussion: Perceived behavioral control and attitude constitute the main predictors of the intention to use eCME. Establishing discussions forums and strengthening organizational support for eCME through an increased awareness among clinical superiors and CME managers would be expected to increase GPs' intention to use eCME.

AB  - The paper explores the process of the Czech journalists setting the EU agenda in the media during the 'hot phase' of the Czech national parliament election campaigns in 2002, 2006, and 2010. Unlike most studies that concentrated on the media agenda in the European Parliament election campaigns, we focused on periods that were neither strictly key events nor routine, but that were more intensively covered by the media and simultaneously generated more influential political representation defining national political attitudes towards the EU. Articles that referred to the EU during the 'hot phase' were content analyzed. The results suggest that in the Czech press, the EU agenda is less and less visible, and, moreover, that it is increasingly negatively framed and reduced to an economic agenda.

AB  - People sometimes perceive a mind in inorganic entities like robots. Psychological research has shown that mind perception correlates with moral judgments and that immoral behaviors ( i.e., intentional harm) facilitate mind perception toward otherwise mindless victims. We conducted a vignette experiment ( N = 129; M-age = 21.8 +/- 6.0 years) concerning human-robot interactions and extended previous research's results in two ways. First, mind perception toward the robot was facilitated when it received a benevolent behavior, although only when participants took the perspective of an actor. Second, imagining a benevolent interaction led to more positive attitudes toward the robot, and this effect was mediated by mind perception. These results help predict what people's reactions in future human-robot interactions would be like, and have implications for how to design future social rules about the treatment of robots.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to investigate the extent to which consumers recognize participation in consumption tax evasion (CTE) as an ethical issue and the impact of moral recognition on consumer intention to participate. It also explores the role of religiosity and attitude toward government in the ethical decision-making process of consumers.
   Design/methodology/approach The model was tested using the structural equation modeling approach over 128 responses collected through the mail survey.
   Findings The results of the study suggest that attitude towards government and religiosity influences the consumers' intention to participate in CTE. The negative attitude toward government enhances the intention to participate in CTE. Religiosity negatively influences the intention to participate in CTE and makes people recognize participation in CTE as a moral issue.
   Research limitations/implications There is a need to explore the impact of other factors such as social norms and personality traits on the consumer decision-making to participate in CTE.
   Practical implications This study indicates that the even when people recognize participation in CTE as morally wrong, they do not have intentions to avoid such behavior because of their attitude toward government. Governments need to improve their image among consumers to reduce CTE. Also, there is a need to launch social marketing campaigns to move consumers from just recognizing moral issues in CTE to forming intentions to resolve those issues.
   Originality/value Earlier studies have explored the moral issue related to tax evasion in a context where an individual has directly participated in such an act, whereas this study explores the ethical aspect in the situation where consumers play an indirect role in tax evasion, i.e. CTE. In the context of participation in CTE, this study points out that the consumers recognize their indirect participation in CTE as a moral issue, but they lack the intention to curb such behavior. Further, no earlier study has explored the impact of religiosity and attitude toward government in such indirect participation in tax evasion.

AB  - Although previous research has highlighted that virtual reality (VR) technologies can enhance customer experience, the efficacy of VR technologies in real estate remains unclear. Therefore, this study examines the effects of offering consumers a non-immersive VR experience via a widely available technology, that allows them to view real estate products. Participants accessed the website of a real estate agency that presented apartments through either static photos or interactive 360 degrees visits. The latter condition was associated with better "visiting" experiences and more positive attitudes toward both the products and the agency. This study highlights the advantages of such technologies in enhancing customer experience and attitudes, particularly in the highly competitive real estate industry.

AB  - Older adults often struggle to adjust to the rapid changes in the digitizing media landscape. In this article, we study, first, how 10 older adults adapt new online media into their daily lives and, by doing so, adjust to the changing "rules of engagement" that guide online-media use in their social surroundings. Second, we analyze how this adaptation process generates change in older adults' social connectedness. Results suggest that older adults' non-use of popular online media results in social exclusion. Enhancing their social connectedness, requires older adults to (partially) conform to new communication norms and values. Based on our findings, we propose three adaptation strategies that enhance both offline and online social connectedness.

AB  - Factors affecting e-democracy adoption were identified using Civic Voluntarism Model (CVM) and Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) which incorporated political culture and perceived e-democracy outcome. Survey instrument was designed based on these theories and was administered to a convenient and randomly selected sample in Nigeria. The variance-based Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) approach was used to evaluate the measurement and structural models. Partial Least Square Algorithm (PIS-Algorithm) and bootstrapping were executed to estimate the significance and test the validity of the SEM components. Findings reveal the imperative of democratic political culture orientation of ordinary citizens in developing positive attitude towards the acceptance and use of e-democracy system while political awareness, political efficacy, and recruitment networks are found to be significant predictors of intention to use e-democracy. These predictors can be stimulated through dedicated massive political orientation programs and enlightenment campaigns by the government in partnership with civil society organizations, religious associations, academic institutions, interest groups, the media and traditional institutions on the benefits of e-democracy to a country's political system.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the knowledge and attitudes of physicians of different specialties, including psychiatrists, regarding forensic psychiatry to determine whether further modification or training is needed in the psychiatry residency program.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out using a 3-page, 3-section questionnaire containing 21 questions disseminated randomly online via Google forms using social media platforms. The 482 participants were residents, specialists, and consultants of various specialties. The study was conducted between September 2020 and August 2021 in various tertiary hospitals across Saudi Arabia.
   Results: A total of 482 physicians were recruited. The most common age group was 25-35 years, comprising mostly Saudis (62.4%). Based on the results, "poor" and "good" knowledge of forensic psychiatry was identified in 89% and 11% of the physicians, while "negative" and "positive" attitudes were identified in 16.4% and 83.6% of the physicians.
   Conclusion: Although the perspective of physicians regarding forensic psychiatry was found to be positive, their knowledge of the topic seems to be lacking.

AB  - Brand image has been a crucial clue to making subjective judgment for consumers to determine the brand, which is critical to making a purchase decision. The influence mechanism from apparel brand images on consumers' purchase intention was explored for theoretical and positive analysis based on the self-congruity theory. This research first constructed a hypothetical model of apparel brand images influencing consumers' purchase intention with self-congruity and perceived quality as mediators, in which a questionnaire was designed and conducted to test the theoretical model. The research shows that apparel brand image and perceived quality can significantly influence consumers' purchase intention. The consumer purchase intention is directly related to clothing brand image provided self-consistency and perceived quality play an intermediary with the regulatory effect of self-motivation and brand familiarity. A positive attitude toward apparel brand image will stimulate consumers to build cognitive clues and associations between the consumers and the brand and strengthen cognitive consistency with the apparel brand's spirit. The research results are beneficial to textile fashion and clothing enterprises to improve brand building and marketing.

AB  - Objectives To test the hypotheses of positive changes of fathers' knowledge, attitude and involvement in supporting exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) after receiving breastfeeding education materials and counseling services.
   Methods A quasi-experimental, pre-test-post-test, non-equivalent control group design was used. At baseline, 251 and 241 pregnant women and their husbands were enrolled into the intervention and control groups, respectively. The 1-year intervention targeting fathers included mass media, game show-style community events, group and individual counseling at health facilities and home visits.
   Results Compared to fathers in the control group, fathers in the intervention group had higher BF knowledge scores and higher attitude scores reflecting more positive attitudes toward early initiation of BF and 6 months EBF. Fathers in the intervention group were also more likely to report active involvement in supporting mothers to practice EBF during antenatal and postpartum periods.
   Conclusions The community-based education model should be maintained and considered for conducting further test in wider application to mobilize fathers in supporting EBF.

AB  - Using social media through mobile has become a major source of disseminating information; however, the motivations that impact social media users' intention and actual information-sharing behavior need further examination. To this backdrop, drawing on the uses and gratifications theory, theory of prosocial behavior, and theory of planned behavior, we aim to examine various motivations toward information-sharing behaviors in a specific context [coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)]. We collected data from 388 knowledgeable workers through Google Forms and applied structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses. We noted that individuals behave seriously toward crisis-related information, as they share COVID-19 information on WhatsApp not only to be entertained and seek status or information but also to help others. Further, we noted norms of reciprocation, habitual diversion, and socialization as motivators that augment WhatsApp users' positive attitude toward COVID-19 information-sharing behavior.

AB  - Background: it has been suggested that there may be two groups of women with postnatal depression (PND) - one who have a history of depression and whose depression is etiologically similar to depression experienced at other times of life, and another who develop depression de novo in the postnatal period and whose depression is uniquely 'postnatal'. The primary aim of this study was to clarify the role of negative attitudes (general and maternal-specific) for these proposed subtypes, whilst also considering the role of a range of other potentially relevant etiological factors.
   Methods: 157 postnatal women were classified into four groups: (i) 'recurrent depression', (ii) 'de novo PND', (iii) 'prior (but not current) depression', (iv) 'healthy control'. Groups were compared on known vulnerability and situational risk factors for depression including negative attitudes (general and rnaternal-specific), personality style Vulnerability, relationship insecurity, low social support, stressful life events and difficult infant behaviour. Hierarchical regressions were conducted to examine the role of general and maternal-specific negative attitudes in mediating the relationship between previous depression and PND.
   Results: Women with recurrent depression had more personality vulnerability and maternal-specific negative attitudes than women with de novo PND, but there were no differences in general negative attitudes or relationship insecurity. Non-depressed women with a history of prior depression were characterized by elevated general depression vulnerability but lower maternal-specific negative attitudes. General negative attitudes mediated the relationship between previous depression and PND.
   Limitations: All participants had unsettled infants and the generalizability of results to general postpartum samples is not known.
   Conclusions: Although these results do not provide support for the proposed subtypes of PND, they highlight encouraging new avenues for cognitively based preventative interventions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The predictors of social closeness toward refugees are rarely examined. In this study (N = 337), higher cultural intelligence (CQ) and higher empathy were defined as predictors of higher social closeness (lower social distance [the Social Distance Scale] and warmer feelings [the Feeling Thermometer]) toward refugees from Syria. This is the target group of prejudice and intensive coverage in the European mass media. The obtained results indicated that other-oriented empathy (empathic concern and perspective taking) and the motivational CQ predicted higher social closeness and warmer feelings toward refugees from Syria. Empathic personal distress predicted lower social closeness and colder feelings toward this group. Motivational CQ consistently served as the mediator of the relationship between empathy dimensions and social closeness toward Syrian refugees. Our findings reveal the previously unexplored correlations between empathy dimensions and cultural intelligence factors, including the mediational effects in predicting social closeness toward Syrian refugees.

AB  - Marketing communication strategy via mobile phone constitutes a promising approach to companies because it enables to reach appropriate audiences at the right time and place. The main aim of this research is to determine key factors that create new opportunities for commercial communications by considering consumer attitudes toward mobile advertising. The proposed causal model of attitudes and intentions toward mobile advertising highlights potential differences between users of smartphones with Internet capabilities and non-users. The theoretical model integrates the influences of control, reference groups, perceived added value, and ease of use on attitudes toward mobile advertising, as well as the relationship of these effects with intentions toward advertising, mediated by mobile Internet usage. The sample is 612 respondents who receive advertising by their mobile phones. Our results reveal, similar to other research, that attitudes exert positive influences on intentions to receive advertising, especially among those who already have access to the Internet on their mobile phones. However, regarding these variables, the experience does not contribute to positive attitudes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In cancer, phase 1 clinical trials on new drugs mostly involve patients with advanced disease that is unresponsive to standard therapy. The purpose of this study was to explore the difficult ethical problems related to patient information and motives for participation in such trials.
   A descriptive and explorative qualitative design was used. Fourteen cancer patients from three different phase 1 trials in end-stage cancer were interviewed. The interviews were analysed using qualitative content analysis.
   The patients expressed unrealistic expectations of therapeutic benefit and inadequate understanding of the trials' purpose, so-called therapeutic misconception. However, they reported a positive attitude towards participation. Thus, the patients valued the close and unique medical and psychological attention they received by participating. Participation also made them feel unique and notable.
   Patients with end-stage cancer participating in phase 1 clinical trials are unaware of the very small potential for treatment benefit and the risk of harm. Trial participation may offer hope and social-emotional support and a strategy for coping with the emotional stress associated with advanced cancer and may, consequently, improve emotional well-being.

TI  - The knowledge and practice towards COVID-19 pandemic prevention among residents of Ethiopia. An online cross-sectional study
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Background
   The disease from the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has been considered as an international concern and a pandemic starting from the declaration of the World Health Organization (WHO) as an outbreak disease.
   Objective
   The objective of this study is to assess the prevention of knowledge and practices towards the COVID-19 pandemic among the residents of Ethiopia.
   Methods
   An online cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample of Ethiopian residents via social platforms of the author's network with popular social media such as Facebook, Telegram, and email. The snowball sampling was employed to recruit participants. In doing so, we collected the responses of 341 participants successfully from April 15 to 22, 2020. The collected data were analyzed by STATA version 14 software and descriptive statistics were employed to summarize the knowledge and practices of the community towards the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Results
   The majority of respondents 80.5% were male. About 91.2% of the participants heard about the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, out of 341 participants 90.0%, 93.8% of them knew that the COVID-19 pandemic was prevented by maintaining social distance and frequent handwashing, respectively. This shows that the prevention knowledge of the participants towards the COVID-19 by maintaining social distance and frequent handwashing was high. However, out of 341 participants only 61%,84% of them practiced social distance and frequent handwashing toward COVID-19, respectively.
   Conclusions
   The majority of the participants knew the ways to protect themselves from the novel corona-virus (COVID-19), but there was a great problem of changing this prevention knowledge to practices. This shows that there is an action gap between having prevention knowledge of the COVID-19 and implementing it into practices to tackle the spread of the COVID-19 among communities. Therefore, the concerned body should be focused on providing awareness and education for the community regarding the implementation of prevention knowledge to practices.

AB  - We examined whether constructs outlined in self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 2002), namely, autonomy-supportive and controlling motivational climates and autonomous and controlled motivation, were related to attitudes toward performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs) in sport and drug-taking susceptibility. We also investigated moral disengagement as a potential mediator. We surveyed a sample of 224 competitive athletes (59% female; M age = 20.3 years; M = 10.2 years of experience participating in their sport), including 81 elite athletes. Using structural equation modeling analyses, our hypothesis proposing positive relationships with controlling climates, controlled motivation, and PEDs attitudes and susceptibility was largely supported, whereas our hypothesis proposing negative relationships among autonomous climate, autonomous motivation, and PEDs attitudes and susceptibility was not supported. Moral disengagement was a strong predictor of positive attitudes toward PEDs, which, in turn, was a strong predictor of PEDs susceptibility. These findings are discussed from both motivational and moral disengagement viewpoints.

AB  - The current study examined the mediating role of proactive coping in the relationship between positive psychological states like optimism and self-esteem and trait anxiety. 204 undergraduate students completed measures of optimism, self-esteem, and trait anxiety, together with the proactive coping subscale of the Proactive Coping Inventory (PCI). Mediated effects were explored using a series of regression analyses anti were confirmed through bootstrapping procedures. Results revealed that proactive coping was a partial mediator in the relationship between both optimism and self-esteem and trait anxiety. Findings indicated that proactive coping enhances a perspective on life that involves a positive attitude toward future events in the form of optimistic expectancies and enhanced feelings of self-worth. Implications of the findings for clinical practice and mental health promotion are discussed.

AB  - Since the Black Lives Matter movement's rise to prominence, there has been significant opposition from both media and political figures who believe that the movement is promoting a "war on cops." Because there is no evidence to support this claim, the current study examines the basis for negative attitudes towards Black Lives Matter using a sample of over 500 undergraduate students from a large Midwestern university. The findings indicate that the strongest predictors of negative attitudes towards Black Lives Matter are being white and holding symbolically racist attitudes. Perceiving the police to be equivalent to soldiers in a war on crime, perceiving police misconduct to be less common, and holding a conservative crime ideology are also significant in the model.

AB  - In May 2011, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund and a prominent member of the French Socialist Party, was charged with attempted rape. Extensive media coverage led people across the globe to speculate about intentions and responsibilities. While the case was pending, we conducted two parallel Internet surveys, with French and German participants (N = 1,314). We examined how strongly exoneration of the alleged perpetrator depended on acceptance of modern myths about sexual aggression (AMMSA) and identity attributes that are temporarily salient as a function of local context (gender, political left-right orientation, nationality). AMMSA was a global predictor of exonerating the alleged perpetrator across national sub-samples, whereas the predictive power of gender and left-right orientation varied locally: For French respondents, left-wing political attitudes predicted exoneration of the alleged perpetrator, whereas only for German respondents, being male predicted exoneration. We conclude that the interplay of global (sexual aggression myths) and local (social identification) factors affects the lay assessment of ambiguous cases of sexual violence.

AB  - Recent studies have highlighted the importance of social media brand communities to brand loyalty. This paper aims to stress the role of the brand in that relationship, suggesting a conceptual model in mass-market products in which consumers' engagement in social media brand communities, brand identity, and consumer-brand identification are related to brand outcomes, such as trust and loyalty. A qualitative analysis was conducted, through in-depth interviews with experts and focus group discussions with consumers, so as to evaluate their experience with brands on social media. The findings indicated that in mass-markets, consumers engaged in social media brand communities may develop positive attitudes towards the brand, such as trust and loyalty, and that consumer-brand identification may have a fundamental role in transforming consumer-brand community interactions into consumer-brand relationships.

AB  - It goes without saying that technology has influenced virtually all spheres of our lives, and teaching English as a foreign language (EFL) is not an exception to this rule. Also, teachers' undeniable and decisive role in the integration of technology into teaching is not to be taken a blind eye on. With this in mind, this study explored Iranian high school EFL teachers' attitudes toward, their perceived competency in, and their actual use of instructional technology in their classrooms. 120 randomly selected junior and senior high school Iranian EFL teachers filled out The Survey of High School EFL Teachers' Attitudes toward Computer Technology. Over 600 junior and senior high school students filled out Students' Questionnaire Surveying the Use of Educational Technology by English Teachers in Classrooms. The results indicated that even though Iranian teachers have an overall positive attitude toward (computer) technology, they are not sufficiently competent to use it in their classes, and this lack of competence may be one of the main barriers to the full use of technology in their classes.

AB  - Background: Big events (i.e., unique historical disruptions) like the COVID-19 epidemic and its associated period of social distancing can transform social structures, social interactions, and social norms. Social distancing rules and the fear of infection have greatly reduced face-to-face interactions, increased loneliness, reduced ties to helping institutions, and may also have disrupted the opioid use behaviors of people who use drugs. This research used Reddit to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the social networks and social processes of people who use opioids.
   Methods: Data were collected from the social media forum, Reddit.com. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. (March 5, 2020, to May 13, 2020), 2,000 Reddit posts were collected from the two most popular opioid subreddits (r/OpiatesRecovery, r/Opiates). Posts were reviewed for relevance to COVID-19 and opioid use resulting in a final sample of 300. Thematic analysis was guided by the Big Events framework.
   Results: The COVID-19 pandemic was found to create changes in the social networks and daily lives among persons who use opioids. Adaptions to these changes shifted social networks leading to robust social support and mutual aid on Reddit, including sharing and seeking advice on facing withdrawal, dealing with isolation, managing cravings, and accessing recovery resources.
   Conclusions: Reddit provided an important source of social support and mutual aid for persons who use opioids. Findings indicate online social support networks are beneficial to persons who use opioids, particularly during big events where isolation from other social support resources may occur.

AB  - Objective To provide an updated evaluation of otolaryngology residency program websites during a socially distanced application cycle. Criteria were selected to evaluate for level of comprehensiveness, new content accommodating a virtual interview cycle, and stated commitment to diversity and inclusion. Study design Review of otolaryngology residency program websites. Setting Online websites between December 2020 and January 2021. Methods Otolaryngology residency program websites were evaluated for selected criteria. Programs were categorized by geographic location, size, and Doximity rankings. Differences between groups were analyzed using Student's t-test and analysis of variance with a significance level of P < .05. Results 118 otolaryngology residency program websites contained a mean (SD) of 16.3 (4.7) of 31 criteria (52.6%). Fewer than one third included virtual/video tours of facilities or the surrounding area. Only 33% had a stated commitment to diversity and inclusion. There was no difference in number of criteria included when categorized by geographic location (P = .22). Larger programs (17.9 vs 14.5, P < .001) and programs ranked in the top 50 by Doximity (17.7 vs 15.2, P = .003) included a significantly greater number of criteria. Conclusion While the comprehensiveness of otolaryngology residency program websites has improved, considerable room for improvement remains. Programs should strive to maintain updated websites that highlight training opportunities, program culture, and commitment to diversity and inclusion. Programs also should consider prioritizing the development of new online resources that may be especially useful to applicants during a virtual interview cycle.

AB  - The recent COVID-19 pandemic, and associated mitigation strategies of social distancing and self-isolation, has elevated the importance of telecommunications networks. The recent COVID-19 pandemic, and associated mitigation strategies of social distancing and self-isolation, has elevated the importance of telecommunications networks. In the current era there is little dispute amongst governments and at the highest levels of the United Nations in respect of the right of all citizens, regardless of their station in life, to have unfettered access to the Internet. However, despite substantive investments in telecommunications infrastructure development, a plethora of policy interventions and three world summits on the Information Society, more than half of the world's population remain unconnected. Over recent years, an emerging solution to the problem has been a bottom-up model of telecommunications ownership, referred to ascommunity networks. There are varying approaches to community networks and different modes of implementation are observed across the globe. However, there is little evidence and consensus on what are all of the necessary elements of the system that comprise a successful community network. In light of this, this paper takes a first step towards the development of a comprehensive framework of the community network ecosystem. Based on the extant literature, a four-pronged People, Technology, Organization and Environment (PTOE) framework is derived. This is then subjected to qualitative analysis against descriptive reports of 11 existing community networks. The final framework and its sub-components provides a holistic and comprehensive perspective of the community network ecosystem. It serves as a basis for further analysis and research of community networks models and also as a means of informing practical implementation of both current and future community networks.

AB  - The so-called attitude-behaviour-gap of ecology might have changed to a "producer-people-gap". In summer 2017 in Germany, the intention of private house-builders to buy an exterior insulation system based on renewable materials was measured as positive, with a mean of 5.2 on a 1-7 Likert scale. But the intentions of professionals were clearly below, e.g. craftsmen, with an average of 3.6 on the same scale - although both groups, the privates and the professionals, judged that there is a clear trend towards such products.
   Because of these findings, an additional investigation of management by producers was conducted in autumn and winter 2017/2018, in which a very critical atmosphere towards renewable materials was found. It was analyzed that the managements' attitudes might not be a basic refusal of renewable material in general, but rather a fear of costs of research and development of new products.
   A concept was tested, to see if it would be possible to cause an attitude change within the professional key target groups just by applying marketing instruments. Five articles in key media of this market have been published between February and May 2018. In the following evaluation (n = 150) in May 2018 significant effects of the communication have been measured: The intention of decision-makers in craftsmen's businesses to buy an exterior insulation system based on renewable material rose significantly (0.01 Lv.) from a mean of 3.6 in 2017 to 4.4 in 2018.

AB  - Impacts of Internet use on political information seeking and subsequent processes have been subject to much debate. A 2-session online field study presented online search results on political topics to examine selective exposure and its attitudinal impacts. Session 1 captured attitudes, including their accessibility. Session 2 tracked what online search results participants selected and how long they read them; participants then reported attitudes again. The study represented a 4x8x2x2 within-subjects design: 4 topics, 8 browsing intervals each, with articles presenting opposing stances, with low versus high source credibility. Attitude-consistent messages and messages from high-credibility sources were preferred. Exposure to attitude-consistent search results increased attitude accessibility and reinforced attitudes, whereas exposure to attitude-discrepant content had opposite effects, regardless of messages' source credibility.

AB  - With the increased presence of social media tools such as LinkedIn and Faceboolc, social network information is now commonplace. Social media websites prominently display the social distance or so-called "degrees of separation" among users, effectively allowing people to view their shared social ties with others, including prospective teammates they have not met. Through the presentation and manipulation of social network information, this longitudinal experiment investigated whether dispositional and relational variables contribute to "swift trust" among new virtual teammates. Data from 74 participants were collected to test a path analytic model predicting that social ties and propensity to trust influence perceptions of a new teammate's trustworthiness (ability, benevolence, and integrity) as well as the willingness to trust that new teammate when given the opportunity to do so. Path analysis indicated good model fit, but showed no significant evidence that social ties or propensity to trust affect perceived trustworthiness at the initial point of team engagement. Additionally, only one component of perceived trustworthiness (perceived ability) and propensity to trust were found to predict trusting behavior towards a new, unknown, teammate.

AB  - This article explores the uses of social media by journalists and their views about these tools in four European countries. It examines how professional variables, namely media sector, length of professional career and size of organisation, influence use of and views about social media. The analysis is based on findings from a questionnaire survey of journalists in Finland, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom. It demonstrates that patterns of uses and opinions, while sharing some features, do vary across the four countries, with UK journalists being the most avid users of social media and those with the most positive attitudes towards these tools. The findings also reveal that influences of the examined professional variables vary and they do not explain overall patterns in social media use and attitudes. Thus, these variables do affect practices in some contexts, but they do not provide an overall explanation of social media appropriation in professional practices. The article argues that journalists, similar to audiences, are increasingly fragmented and their professional practices are influenced by a myriad of different variables.

AB  - Humans' ability to represent their body state from within through interoception has been proposed to predict different aspects of human cognition and behaviour. We focused on the possible contribution of interoceptive sensitivity to social behaviour as mediated by adaptive modulation of autonomic response. We, thus, investigated whether interoceptive sensitivity to one's heartbeat predicts participants' autonomic response at different social distances. We measured respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) during either a Social or a Non-social task. In the Social task each participant viewed an experimenter performing a caress-like movement at different distances from their hand. In the Non-social task a metal stick was moved at the same distances from the participant's hand. We found a positive association between interoceptive sensitivity and autonomic response only for the social setting. Moreover, only good heartbeat perceivers showed higher autonomic response 1) in the social compared to the non-social setting, 2) specifically, when the experimenter's hand was moving at boundary of their peripersonal space (20 cm from the participant's hand). Our findings suggest that interoceptive sensitivity might contribute to interindividual differences concerning social attitudes and interpersonal space representation via recruitment of different adaptive autonomic response strategies.

AB  - Integrating predictions from the theory of human values with the theory of planned behavior (TPB), our primary goal is to investigate mechanisms through which individual values are related to entrepreneurial career intentions using a sample of 823 students from four European countries. We find that openness and self-enhancement values relate positively to entrepreneurial career intentions and that these relationships are partly mediated by attitudes toward entrepreneurship, self-efficacy, and, to a lesser extent, by social norms. Values and TPB constructs partially mediated cross-country differences in entrepreneurial intentions. Spanish students showed lower entrepreneurial intentions as compared to Dutch, German, and Polish students, which could be traced back to lower self-enhancement values (power and achievement), less positive attitudes toward entrepreneurship, and differences in social norms.

KW  - FACE-WORK
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the communicative rituals of opening and closing manifested in e-mail-based Internet Public Library's (IPL's) online reference interaction.
   Design/methodology/approach - A total of 400 transcripts comprising user queries and responses by IPL librarians are examined. The opening and closing elements are identified to examine the way in which 1PL librarians and users construct social space; that is, communicate their interpersonal and affective stances during the course of seeking and offering information.
   Findings - The results of data analysis show regular patterns of verbal and structural politeness indicators of opening and closing e-mail discourse. Linguistic elements such as greetings and acknowledgement are included in all the sampled transcripts; i.e. a 100 percent occurrence. Closing rituals have a 95 percent occurrence of linguistic features such as acknowledgement and invitation for follow-up. In contrast, there is a low occurrence of personalized openings through greeting by user name (26 percent). This lack of personalization also occurs in closings: personalized farewell through use of librarian name appears in only 8 percent of closings.
   Research limitations/implications - The employment of the various politeness tactics in opening and closing reflects the librarian's attention and concern to user's information needs, interests and wants. Such communicative competence narrows social distance and brings forth close socio-interpersonal space for interaction; this may, in turn, improve the overall quality of reference service. Research findings also indicate that more use of personal names may decrease the social distance between the librarian and user, resulting in increased solidarity and proximity.
   Originality/value - The study provides new insights into linguistic politeness and the functions of address forms such as personal names with a view toward developing effective opening and closing rituals that contribute to the enhancement of virtual reference services.

AB  - African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans are disproportionately affected by cancer, yet underrepresented in cancer clinical trials. Because of this, it is important to understand how attitudes and beliefs about clinical trials vary by ethnicity. A national, random sample of 860 adults was given an online survey about attitudes toward clinical trials. We examined willingness to participate in clinical trials, attitudes toward clinical trials, trust in doctors, attitudes toward alternative and complementary medicine, and preferred information channels. Results indicate that African-American and Hispanic-American participants have more negative attitudes about clinical trials, more distrust toward doctors, more interest in complementary and alternative medicine, and less willingness to participate in clinical trials than white/non-Hispanics, although specific factors affecting willingness to participate vary. The channels people turn to for information on clinical trials also varied by ethnicity. These results help explain the ethnic disparities in cancer clinical trial enrollment by highlighting some potential underlying causes and drawing attention to areas of importance to these groups.

AB  - This study investigates the theoretical mechanisms by which the variations in source attribution (multiple sources vs. single source) and specialization (multifunctionality vs. single functionality) of Internet of Things (IoT) devices influence the quality of human-IoT interaction. Results from a between-subjects experiment (N = 100) indicate that IoT devices that elicit the sense of multiple agencies and are specialized in a single function induce greater social presence and perceived expertise, which, in turn, lead individuals to show a more positive attitude toward the devices and to ascribe greater quality to the information transmitted by them. The results also reveal that the effect of multiple source attribution is more pronounced for individuals for whom the content of the information has low personal relevance.

AB  - Brand placements are gradually becoming an important part of promotional toolkit of many major companies. However, despite the increasing volume of research on brand placements during the last decade, several important questions still remain unanswered. The purpose of this research is to investigate the effectiveness of brand placements in television sitcoms and contrast it with the effectiveness of 30-second commercials. The authors administer a quasi-natural experiment to a sample of research panel participants to investigate how brand placements in television sitcoms affect their attitudes and purchase intentions. Results of the study suggest that people have a more positive attitude toward brand placements than toward traditional television commercials. Moreover, placements can be more effective than 30-seconds commercials when targeting audiences with low attitude toward advertising. Finally, a combination of a brand placement and a commercial within one program doesn't significantly increase brand attitudes and purchase intentions compared with sole exposure conditions.

AB  - Despite the continuing, adverse impact of discrimination on the lives of racial and ethnic minorities, the denial of discrimination is commonplace. Four experiments investigated the efficacy of perspective taking as a strategy for combating discrimination denial. Participants who adopted a Black or Latino target's perspective in an initial context were subsequently more likely to explicitly acknowledge the persistence of intergroup discrimination than were non-perspective takers (Experiments 1-3) or participants who adopted a White target's perspective (Experiment 1). Perspective taking also engendered more positive attitudes toward a social policy designed to redress intergroup inequalities (i.e., affirmative action), and this relationship was mediated by increased recognition of discrimination (Experiments 2a and 2b). Increased identification with the targeted outgroup, as reflected in automatic associations between the self and African Americans, was found to underlie the effect of perspective taking on sensitivity to discrimination (Experiment 3). The collective findings indicate that perspective taking can effectively combat discrimination denial. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate factors mediating the effects of a European school-based intervention (Unplugged) based on a social influence approach to youths' substance use.
   Methods: Schools in seven European countries (n = 143, including 7,079 pupils) were randomly assigned to an experimental condition (Unplugged curriculum) or a control condition (usual health education). Data were collected before (pretest) and 3 months after the end of the program (posttest). Multilevel multiple mediation models were applied to the study of effect mediation separately for tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis use. Analyses were conducted on the whole sample, and separately on baseline users and nonusers of each substance.
   Results: Compared with the control group, participants in the program endorsed less positive attitudes toward drugs; positive beliefs about cigarettes, alcohol, and cannabis; and the normative perception of peers using tobacco and cannabis. They also increased in knowledge about all substances and refusal skills toward tobacco. Decreased positive attitudes toward drugs, increase in refusal skills, and reappraisal of norms about peer using tobacco and cannabis appeared to mediate the effects of the program on the use of substances. However, mediating effects were generally weak and some of them were only marginally significant.
   Conclusions: This study lends some support to the notion that school-based programs based on a social influence model may prevent juvenile substance use through the modification of attitudes, refusal skills, and normative perceptions.

AB  - Background: First case of COVID-19 was reported in December 2019 and within a timespan of few months, it has become a pandemic. It has created havoc globally and India is no exception. Globally, it is emphasized that preventive measures play an important role in controlling the rapid spread of COVID-19. In India, 68% of population is rural and this population is going to play a crucial role in the containment of the pandemic. Realizing the key position of rural population in COVID control, this study was conducted to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices of rural population about the disease. Method and Material: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted on patients and their relatives from 1st April, 2020 to 31st May, 2020. A total of 372 participants hailing from rural areas were enrolled. Results: Most common source of information for the participants was through television (54.8%) and radio (49.2%). Only 77% claimed that they were using face mask and 72% claimed to be following social distancing. A large (60%) proportion of the participants did not know that COVID-19 could spread from asymptomatic patients. Education of participants was a key determinant for use of social distancing and face mask as a preventive tool. With increasing age, the practice of social distancing and the use of face mask were decreasing in our study. Conclusion: Television/Radio channels form an important source of information and need to be used more effectively to educate the people about the disease and create awareness about effective preventive measures. People need to be educated about the role of asymptomatic carriers in spreading the disease.

AB  - Norms have a pervasive influence on behavior, yet previous research has not addressed that people often face conflicting norms from multiple ingroups. The current research addresses this gap in the context of proenvironmental behavior and demonstrates two effects predicted by the novel theoretical position we offer: People can be de-motivated by norm-conflict, or conversely, norm-conflict can encourage people to take action. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that norm-conflict is associated with increased perceived effectiveness for those with positive attitudes to the issue and reduced perceived effectiveness for those with moderate attitudes, and effectiveness perceptions mediated an indirect effect on behavioral intentions. Study 3 found that perceived effectiveness also moderates the effects of norm-conflict such that norm-conflict only influences intentions when perceived effectiveness is high. Norm-conflict is both positively and negatively related to behavioral decision making, suggesting additional considerations in the design of social norms-based interventions.

AB  - Purpose The spread of fake news on social networking sites (SNS) poses a threat to the marketing landscape, yet little is known about how fake news affect consumers' perceptions, attitudes and behaviors. This study aims to explore when consumers believe fake news, whom they blame for it (e.g. negative attitudes toward brands or SNS) and when they choose to share it. Design/methodology/approach Data obtained from 80 open-ended, semistructured interviews, conducted with SNS consumers and experts, is analyzed following the principles of grounded theory and the Gioia methodology. Findings Factors affecting consumers' perceptions of fake news include skepticism, awareness, previous experience, appeal and message cues. Consumers' brand- and SNS-related attitudes are affected by consumers' blame, which is determined by consumers' perceptions of the vetting efforts, role and ethical obligation of SNS. Consumers' motives for sharing fake news include duty, retaliation, authentication and status-seeking. Theoretical and practical implications derived from the study's novel conceptual framework are discussed. Practical implications This study identifies communication strategies that marketing professionals can use to mitigate and counter the negative effects of fake news. Originality/value By simultaneously considering consumers' perceptions of the source, information and medium (i.e. SNS), this study presents a novel conceptual framework providing a marketing-centered, dynamic view on consumers' fake news experience and connecting consumers' perceptions, attitudes and behaviors in the context of fake news.

T2  - SAUDI PHARMACEUTICAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - KNOWLEDGE
AB  - Introduction: The pharmacovigilance system is playing a vital role in the process of patient safety through reporting of ADRs and other drug-related problems. Although, the. Pharmacovigilance system is well established in other Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC). In Kingdom of Bahrain, the Pharmacovigilance system is still in its early stages. Establishing a successful Pharmacovigilance system in Bahrain requires a collective effort from various stakeholders such as the ministry of health and the National Health Regulatory Authority (NHRA). Aim: To assess the current status of the Pharmacovigilance system in Bahrain and the feasibility of its development. Objectives: To investigate the current Pharmacovigilance activities in Bahrain, to explore the attitude / knowledge of healthcare providers towards PV systems and to identify the limitations, and barriers of the PV system in Bahrain. Methodology: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study utilising an online survey composed of 24 questions. It was distributed to pharmacists, physicians, and nurses working at government and private hospitals in Bahrain through emails and social media. In addition, a telephone interview was performed with a pharmacist working for NHRA in Bahrain. Ethics approval was prior to commencing the study. Results: More than half of the respondents (69.8%) did not report any ADRs so far in their practice, whereas 30.2% had done so. A total of 95.8% of those who have never reported before were willing to report in the future. Participants who received training regarding reporting ADRs reported lower positive attitudes (3.3 +/- 0.8 vs 3.6 +/- 0.6). In addition, the participants were more knowledgeable about the ADRs reporting process than the PV system. The results showed the absence of an active PV program. The activity of PV in Bahrain is limited to receiving notifications and periodic safety update records from manufactures or the GHC. Conclusion: Despite the average level of knowledge of healthcare providers towards the PV system, the results indicated a negative attitude. Moreover, some barriers were reported. Establishing a specialised PV centre is the next step to improve the status of PV system in Bahrain. (C) 2022 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of King Saud University.

AB  - The current study extends family communication patterns (FCP) research to assess how family communication schemata (conversation and conformity orientation dimensions) influence systematic processing of health appeals intended to persuade individuals to seek family health history information, emphasizing an updated conceptualization of family conformity (i.e., the expanded conformity orientation scale). Our results suggest that conversation orientation and the conformity dimension of parental control are the primary drivers of systematic processing of family health history messages. Systematic processing, in turn, was significantly associated with more positive attitudes and greater intentions to seek health information from family members. Our results suggest family communication patterns may impact individual engagement with family health history campaign messages, thus campaign designers may want to consider how best to tailor messages to match family communication characteristics.

AB  - In this research, we integrate social impact theory (SIT) and social cognitive theory (SCT) to examine how group ethical voice, as a form of social influence, reduces group abusive supervision. Drawing on SIT, we hypothesize that the strength of this relationship is contingent on the group's power, size, and social distance from the group leader (i.e., interaction frequency). Results from data collected over two time periods from 521 employees in 98 work groups (Study 1) reveal that group ethical voice reduces group abusive supervision, controlling for general group voice and group performance. Furthermore, we found that the relationship between group ethical voice and group abusive supervision was strongest when the group is larger, powerful, and interacts frequently with the group leader. These findings are replicated in Study 2, a time-lagged study of employees across three time periods. Study 2 also shows that the interactive effects of group ethical voice, group power, and social distance (but not group size) on abusive supervision are mediated by leader reflective moral attentiveness. Specifically, in powerful and socially proximal groups, group ethical voice reduces abusive supervision by fostering greater reflective moral attentiveness in group leaders.

AB  - The present research demonstrates that pride has divergent effects on prejudice, exacerbating or attenuating evaluative biases against stigmatized groups, depending on the form of pride experienced. Specifically, three experiments found that hubristic pride-associated with arrogance and self-aggrandizement-promotes prejudice and discrimination, whereas authentic pride-associated with self-confidence and accomplishment-promotes more positive attitudes toward outgroups and stigmatized individuals. Findings generalized to discriminatory judgments (Experiment 2) and were found to be mediated by empathic concern for the evaluative target. Together, these experiments suggest that pride may be a cause of everyday prejudice and discrimination but that these social consequences depend on whether hubristic or authentic pride is experienced, and the degree to which empathic concern is subsequently aroused.

AB  - Nowadays, the concept of smart sustainable governance is wrapped around basic principles such as: (i) transparency, (ii) accountability, (iii) stakeholders' involvement, and iv) citizens' participation. It is through these principles that are influenced by information and communication technologies (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), and artificial intelligence, that the practices employed by citizens and their interaction with electronic government (e-government) are diversified. Previously, the misleading concepts of the smart city implied only the objective of the local level or public officials to utilize technology. However, the recent European experience and research studies have led to a more comprehensive notion that refers to the search for intelligent solutions which allow modern sustainable cities to enhance the quality of services provided to citizens and to improve the management of urban mobility. The smart city is based on the usage of connected sensors, data management, and analytics platforms to improve the quality and functioning of built-environment systems. The aim of this paper is to understand the effects of the pandemic on smart cities and to accentuate major exercises that can be learned for post-COVID sustainable urban management and patterns. The lessons and implications outlined in this paper can be used to enforce social distancing community measures in an effective and timely way, and to optimize the use of resources in smart and sustainable cities in critical situations. The paper offers a conceptual overview and serves as a stepping-stone to extensive research and the deployment of sustainable smart city platforms and intelligent transportation systems (a sub-area of smart city applications) after the COVID-19 pandemic using a case study from Russia. Overall, our results demonstrate that the COVID-19 crisis encompasses an excellent opportunity for urban planners and policy makers to take transformative actions towards creating cities that are more intelligent and sustainable.

AB  - This study investigated how, through knowledge calibration and a causal path model, psychological distance can explain the level of satisfaction with nuclear energy policy. The investigation used multiple regression analysis and path analysis to explore relationships among variables. Data from 1056 adults revealed that more knowledge-calibrated individuals have more positive attitudes toward nuclear energy policy. In addition, the psychological distance influences policy satisfaction by mediation of perceived risk of nuclear energy. This study aimed to increase the understanding of the dynamic of satisfaction with and acceptance of nuclear energy policy among stakeholders. Thus, based on the construal level theory, the study addressed the importance of knowledge and psychological distance in explaining variation in satisfaction and acceptance about nuclear policy.

AB  - Given the reliance of military recruiting efforts on prior service enlistments, it is imperative that motivators and barriers to prior service recruiting receive greater research attention. This research applied the theory of planned behavior (Ajzen, 1991, 2001) to predict prior service members' intentions to join the Reserve, thereby advancing research beyond post hoc evaluation of existing recruitment strategies. Results indicated that prior service members in the Individual Ready Reserve were more likely to intend to join the Reserve if they held positive attitudes toward the Reserve and felt that alternative careers compared negatively against military service. Commitment mediated the relationship between satisfaction and Reserve intentions and perceived social support had a greater effect on Reserve intentions when influence of relevant others was high.

AB  - Despite visions of social network technology (SNT) for collaborative knowledge construction, recent research in secondary schools suggest that students use these tools mainly for knowledge sharing of study-related artifacts. We extend these findings to higher education settings and report on two survey studies that map characteristics of students? self-directed use of SNTs for study purposes, in undergraduate university programs (N = 264) and teacher training colleges (N = 449). The combined findings confirm that students use SNTs extensively for uploading, linking and downloading study-related artifacts in peer-directed SNT groups. They regard these practices positively and believe they improve academic achievements. Sharing was predicted by positive attitudes toward sharing and collectivist value orientations, motivated overall by prosocial reasons and less frequent in competitive study programs. Use of shared materials was associated with performance-avoidance achievement goals and lower GPA. Findings, directions for future research and implications are discussed in the context of learning theories, as well the knowledge sharing literature.

KW  - RECALL FREQUENCY

AB  - Attitude toward dreams is a variable closely linked to dream recall frequency. Even though research has looked into different aspects of this variable, studies investigating positive and negative attitudes in the general population are still lacking. The present representative survey (N = 2,019) indicates that the general emotional tone of dreams is quite closely related to the attitude toward dreams-a relationship neglected by previous studies. It seems very important to differentiate between positive and negative attitudes toward dreaming, and it also seems very important to differentiate between attitudes toward positively toned and negatively toned dreams. In order to understand the underlying mechanisms of the stable gender difference, for example, it seems promising to study of dream socialization-that is, the process of how children learn about attitudes toward dreaming from other people (family, friends) or media.

AB  - Indigenous people are the most disadvantaged population within Australia. The Bachelor of Nursing program at a large university in Western Sydney embedded Indigenous health into the undergraduate teaching program. This paper reviews the negative responses received towards course content on evaluation of the Indigenous health unit and explores the predictors for the negative attitudes towards Indigenous Australians. Two surveys were used (baseline and follow-up) to: I. Determine the main predictors for negative attitudes towards Indigenous people and; 2. Explore students' perceptions of the educational quality of the Indigenous health unit. The surveys allowed collection of socio-demographic, academic data and included the 18 item 'Attitude Toward Indigenous Australians' (ATIA) scale and open-ended responses. Students who were: 1. Overseas born, 2. Enrolment category: International student and; 3. Whose primary source of information about Indigenous Australians were the media and school were significantly more likely to have higher negative attitudes towards Indigenous Australians. Qualitative data revealed some unfavourable comments dismissing the value and educational quality of the content within the Indigenous health unit. Community engagement is paramount to enhancing the student experience. Movement away from media driven 'hype' to an educated perspective is necessary to create an accurate portrayal of the Indigenous community. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We argue that, to effectively understand media effects in authoritarian societies, researchers must assess different types of media strategies adopted by authoritarian leaders. Using survey data from two Chinese cities, we examine the effects of two types of media strategies adopted by the Chinese government, targeting political attitudes and nonpolitical values and norms, respectively. Following a new line of research, we contrast China's domestic-controlled media to foreign free media. After accounting for the selection bias in Chinese urbanites' media access, we do not find sufficient evidence for the effect of the media strategies directly targeting their democratic conceptions. However, sufficient and robust evidence shows that more intensive consumption of diverse media sources, including foreign media, does significantly but indirectly counteract the Chinese government's political campaigns targeting its citizens' democratic conceptions, via thwarting the government's media strategies to cultivate a collectivistic norm in the society.

AB  - This study used Witte's extended parallel process model to examine the relationships between the use of fear appeals and college students' attitudes and behavioral intentions toward global warming. A pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design was adopted. Three hundred forty-one college students from six communication courses at two universities were recruited for this experiment. The results show that when in a high-threat condition, both high-and low-efficacy messages resulted in positive attitudes and behavioral changes, while in a low-threat condition, low-efficacy messages led to negative changes in attitudes and behavioral intentions. This study suggests that when attempting to promote low carbon-emitting behaviors among college students, messages should contain both threat and efficacy information, but messages that contain low-threat and low-efficacy information should be avoided.

AB  - This article undertakes a micro-level analysis of public opinion towards military action in Libya. It examines the effect of sociological factors and political attitudes. It finds evidence of a gender gap in support for military action. The effects of partisanship are mediated by attention to politics. Politically attentive Conservative and Liberal Democrat partisans are more supportive of military action. Public opinion is also affected by ideological beliefs, economic perceptions and pre-existing foreign policy attitudes. The findings contribute to research on public opinion and military intervention and to scholarly understanding of foreign policy attitudes in Britain.

AB  - Pictures have been used for a wide range of marketing purposes, but few studies have focused on the specific uses of abstract versus concrete images in marketing field. This study explores the impact of image type on consumer attitudes based on the conception of imagery elaboration. We find that the interaction between product category and image type has a significant effect on consumer attitudes. Specifically, for hedonic product, abstract image is more likely to motivate consumers to form a positive attitude than concrete image, whereas for utilitarian product, concrete image is more effective. We also show the mediating role of imagery elaboration. The interaction of product category and image type has a significant effect on imagery elaboration: in the case of hedonic product, product with abstract image was found to be better for evoking imagery elaboration, whereas in the case of utilitarian product, adding a concrete image to the product was more successful at generating imagery elaboration. Furthermore, imagery elaboration has a significant effect on consumer attitudes. This study offers specific suggestions that companies can incorporate into product design and marketing.

AB  - Do girls have more competition anxiety and exogenous cognitive load than equally able boys during the playing of stressful competitive on-line games? This question led to the adoption of a technology acceptance model to compare the influence factors of competitors in sequential and synchronous games. Confirmatory factor analysis of the data on 220 students in the 6th grade indicated that girls did have a higher cognitive load and more competition anxiety from synchronous types of competitive games, but they showed beliefs in technology acceptance constructs that were similar to that of boys. Even with high cognitive load and competition anxiety, the boys and girls didn't show a decrease in their perceived ease of playing and sense of usefulness in using this game to learning Chinese characters for two types of competitive games, and they both showed a positive attitude and intentions to play the game. This study implied that the game designers should consider reducing the competition anxiety and cognitive load by extending the time-frames for sequential competition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Covid-19 Lockdown Affects Hearing Disability and Handicap in Diverse Ways: A Rapid Online Survey Study

AB  - Objectives:
   The aim of this study was to explore the perceived effects of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) social distancing restrictions and safety measures on people with hearing loss.
   Design:
   Participants were 129 adults (48.1% female, mean age 64.4 years) with an audiometric hearing loss, living in Glasgow, Scotland. A rapidly deployed 24-item online questionnaire asked about the effects of certain aspects of lockdown, including face masks, social distancing, and video calling, on participants' behavior, emotions, hearing performance, practical issues, and tinnitus. Data were analyzed descriptively across the entire sample, and with Chi-squared tests for differences between subgroups self-reporting relatively good and relatively poor unaided hearing, respectively. Additional free-text responses provided further perspectives.
   Results:
   Behavior: Video calls are used more frequently than prelockdown. The better-hearing group use their hearing aids less. Emotions: There is increased anxiety (especially among the worse hearing group) concerning verbal communication situations and access to audiology services, and greater rumination about one's own hearing loss. Enjoyment of group video calls is mixed. The worse hearing group shows substantial relief at not being obliged to attend challenging social gatherings. Across both groups, a majority would like to see all key workers equipped with transparent face masks. Hearing performance: A large majority finds it hard to converse with people in face masks due to muffled sound and lack of speechreading cues, but conversing at a safe distance is not universally problematic. In the worse hearing group, performance in video calls is generally inferior to face-to-face, but similar to telephone calls. Those who use live subtitling in video calls appreciate their value. TV and radio updates about Covid-19 are easy to follow for most respondents. There is only weak evidence of face mask fixtures interfering with hearing aids on the ear, and of tinnitus having worsened during lockdown.
   Conclusions:
   With due regard for the limitations of this rapid study, we find that there are many negative-and a few positive-effects of Covid-19 restrictions and safety measures on people with hearing loss. From a societal perspective, the widespread adoption of clear face masks may alleviate some of the difficulties and anxieties this population experience. From an individual perspective, one may consider using live subtitles on video calls. Manufacturers of hearing devices should consider developing processing modes and accessories specifically designed for video calls. Finally, repair and maintenance services should be resumed as soon as it is safe to do so.

AB  - We aimed to assess the attitude towards influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccinations among coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) recovered patients. We performed a cross-sectional study consisting of a standardized telephone interview carried out between September and November 2020 targeting a cohort of adult in- and out-patients that had recovered from COVID-19 after the first wave (March-May 2020) at Udine Hospital (Italy). Overall, 599 people participated (320 female, median age 53 years) and most had experienced an acute COVID-19 with mild illness (409, 68.3%). The majority were hesitant or undecided towards influenza (327, 54.6%) and SARS-CoV-2 (353, 59.2%) vaccines. Older age, public work exposure, and previous 2019 flu shots were the main factors associated with a positive attitude toward both vaccinations (p < 0.05). Being hospitalized during the acute COVID-19 phase was associated with the willingness to get a flu shot (94/272, 34.5%) but not SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (70/244, 28.7%). Vaccine hesitancy is diffuse and multifactorial also among COVID-19 recovered.

KW  - ACHIEVEMENT
AB  - This study was designed to exemplify how hands-on based teaching strategies enhanced students' knowledge and positive attitudes towards sharks. Hands-on activities for sharks' biological and morphological features were carried out. Eleven elementary school students from a remote area in Taiwan were recruited and assigned to the hands-on condition. They were encouraged to draw pictures of sharks before and after the instruction as the main data for pre- and post-test comparison. Two years later, the retention test and attitude inventory towards sharks were implemented. The results revealed that large effect size emerged for both the post-test and retention test. In regards to attitude inventory, students involved in hands-on activities also significantly outperformed the baseline group. Many of them have taken notice of television programs and books about sharks or marine ecology since the hands-on activities, indicating the instruction had a beneficial impact on their extracurricular lives. Empirical findings of this study suggest hands-on instruction is a powerful strategy for learning, both for immediate and prolonged effects on improving students' knowledge and attitudes toward sharks.

AB  - Despite the fact that mid-life and older women are a major consumer group for cosmetic procedures (e.g., botox, face lifts), few studies have been done on their attitudes toward these procedures and their willingness to undergo them. The purpose of the present study was to gather information about the popularity of these procedures among a group of 57 mid-life American women, examine whether some personality and attitudinal measures might predict attitudes toward these procedures, and consider the ramifications of the data for the treatment of women in feminist therapy. About one third (38.5%) of our sample had had one or more cosmetic procedures, and 81% said that they would have a procedure if cost were not an issue. Positive attitudes toward cosmetic surgery and preoccupation with being over-weight best predicted women's interest in cosmetic procedures. The popularity of these procedures is discussed in light of the double standard of aging and age discrimination, weight as a "normative discontent," and the ubiquity of advertisements for, and normalization of, these procedures in the popular media.

AB  - This research examined public opinion toward genetically modified plants and animals for food, and how trust in organizations and media coverage explained attitudes toward these organisms. Nationally representative samples (N = 8821) over 10 years showed Australians were less positive toward genetically modified animals compared to genetically modified plants for food, especially in years where media coverage was high. Structural equation modeling found that positive attitudes toward different genetically modified organisms for food were significantly associated with higher trust in scientists and regulators (e.g. governments), and with lower trust in watchdogs (e.g. environmental movement). Public trust in scientists and watchdogs was a stronger predictor of attitudes toward the use of genetically modified plants for food than animals, but only when media coverage was low. Results are discussed regarding the moral acceptability of genetically modified organisms for food, the media's role in shaping public opinion, and the role public trust in organizations has on attitudes toward genetically modified organisms.

AB  - This study compared views on homosexuality among US adults who varied in their consumption of pornography. Nationally representative cross-sectional data generated by the General Social Survey (GSS) between 2000 and 2012 were employed. Pornography consumers expressed more positive attitudes toward gay individuals' civil liberties, more moral acceptance of homosexuality, and more support for same-sex marriage. Moderation analyses indicated the importance of consumers' views on personal freedom and morality. Associations between pornography consumption and positive views on homosexuality were strongest when consumers placed a premium on personal freedom and adopted a relativistic perspective on morality. Mediation analyses indicated that pornography consumption indirectly predicted more positive views on homosexuality through a nontraditional attitude toward sex. Supplementary analysis of nationally representative three-wave GSS panel data confirmed the temporal sequencing of these links. Prior pornography consumption predicted a more positive subsequent attitude toward nontraditional sex, which in turn predicted more positive subsequent views on homosexuality.

AB  - Mental health problems are common in childhood and tend to be more frequent in populations at risk of poverty or social exclusion (AROPE). The family environment can play a role in reducing the impact of economic hardship on these problems. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of multidimensional poverty on the mental health of children aged 7-11 years and the role of the family environment in two areas of Spain. Participants were 395 and 382 children aged 7 and 11 from Gipuzkoa and Valencia, respectively. Internalizing and externalizing problem scales of the child behaviour checklist (CBCL) were used. AROPE indicators were obtained by questionnaire, and three dimensions of the family context (Organization of the Physical Environment and Social Context, Parental Stress and Conflict, and Parental Profile Fostering Development) were measured through subscales 3, 4 and 5 of the Haezi-Etxadi family assessment scale (7-11) (HEFAS 7-11), respectively. Data were analysed using negative binomial regression and Structural Equation Modelling. AROPE prevalence was 7.1 and 34.5% in Gipuzkoa and Valencia, respectively. In both cohorts, there was a significant increase in internalizing and externalizing problems among participants with a higher AROPE score. However, AROPE did not affect internalizing problems in children from families living in a better physical environment and with social support (Subscale 3). The AROPE effect was jointly mediated by subscales 4 and 5 in 42 and 62% of internalizing and externalizing problems, respectively. Preventing economic inequities by economic compensation policies, improving the neighbourhood and immediate environment around the school, and promoting positive parenting programmes can improve mental health in childhood.

AB  - Background: During COVID-19 pandemic, Indian health authorities implemented massive measures to control the rapid spread of infection. Nonetheless, even during pandemic, pregnant women need constant obstetrics consultations during the antepartum period and adequate care during intrapartum and postpartum period for uneventful outcome. Undeniably, adherence to these control measures is largely affected by knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. Aims and Objectives: To assess knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 amongst pregnant women and to find the association of demographic variables (age, place of residence, and education) with KAP. Materials and Methods: The cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted for pregnant women attending the outpatient department of Obstetrics in a tertiary care Defense hospital. We investigated 506 pregnant women serially from Obstetrics OPD of the hospital for KAP towards COVID-19 with a questionnaire of 14 questions. The study population was assessed for the KAP score and association of demographic variables with KAP. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the findings. Median and standard deviation (SD) were calculated for KAP and Pearson's Chi-square test was used to analyze the association of demographic variables with KAP. Results: In our study scores for adequate knowledge, positive attitude, and good practices were 75.3 %, 73.9%, and 92.7 % respectively. The analysis of the association of various demographic variables with KAP about COVID-19 revealed significant association. Conclusion: The majority of pregnant women was knowledgeable about COVID-19 and had positive attitude and good practices. However, health authorities may need to take proactive steps for this vulnerable subpopulation.

AB  - BACKGROUND The National Center for Statistics and Analysis reports at least eight deaths and 1,160 daily injuries due to distracted driving (DD) in the United States. Drivers younger than 20 years are most likely to incur a distraction-related fatal crash. We aimed to determine short- and long-term impact of a multimodal educational program including student-developed interventions, simulated driving experiences, and presentations by law enforcement and medical personnel.
   METHODS A single-day program aimed at teen DD prevention was conducted at a high school targeting students aged 15 years to 19 years old. Students were surveyed before, after, and at 6 weeks. We surveyed age, gender, knowledge, and experience regarding DD. Summary statistics were obtained at each survey time point. Bivariate and multivariable analysis were conducted to assess whether change in responses varied over time points. Multivariable models were adjusted for sex and urban and rural driving.
   RESULTS Preintervention, postintervention, and 6-week follow-up surveys were completed by 359, 272 (76%), and 331 (92%) students, respectively. At baseline and 6-week follow-up, the most frequent passenger-reported DD behaviors were cell phone (63% [63% at follow-up) and radio use (61% [63%]). Similarly, the most frequent driver-reported DD behaviors were cell phone (68% [72%]) and radio use (79% [80%]). When students were asked, How likely are you to use your cell phone while driving? they answered never 35%, 70%, and 46% on the preintervention, postintervention, and 6-week surveys. They were less likely to report consequences to be worse or change in attitude to a great extent at 6 weeks (p < 0.01). Gender and urban or rural driving were not significantly associated with responses.
   CONCLUSIONS While DD education may facilitate short-term knowledge and attitude changes, there appears to be no lasting effect. Research should be focused toward strategies for longer-term impact.

AB  - Morocco, a multilingual country with historical and geo-political legacies, has opened a hot debate on languages recently. Within this debate, this article investigates spontaneous comments in social media on languages in Morocco, especially adopting English as a first foreign language. It aims to bring this topic to the surface and thus discuss it in the light of research on language attitudes and language awareness. To do so, it analyses the reactions to texts about the declarations by the Minister of Higher Education shared in social networks and sites. The data consisting of 2,018 comments is classified according to 12 frequent patterns whose frequencies are calculated. The findings show that most of Moroccans have positive attitudes towards English while some show opposing reactions towards French. These participants hold ambivalent opinions about the rest of languages used in Morocco; however, they tend to insist on Morocco having a clear language policy which, seemingly, prioritises the mother tongues, Arabic and Amazigh. The discussions show that some investigated reactions are mitigated as they may be illusionary.

AB  - This study is aimed at answering the male perception about gender related stereotypes that make up major part of printed fashion advertisements. Carried out on Pakistani men, this paper attempts to fill the research gap related to how gender stereotypes are perceived by men as consumers of printed fashion advertising. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were carried out with Pakistani men who shop for their own clothing. The empirical data was coded manually.
   The findings revealed a positive attitude of men towards traditional masculine displays in advertisements. Any deviances from the traditional masculine displays were met with negative criticism. The interviewed men also asserted that they did not feel constrained when put into categories of certain social persona or groups.
   The conclusion implied that classical stereotypical gender roles were deeply embedded in the minds of the interviewees and unless the advertising reproduction of such images is not revised, such mindsets will continue to exist, grow and create difficulties in the transition of the society towards fairness and equality.

AB  - The 2016 European Union (EU) refugee crisis exposed a fundamental distinction in political attitudes between the political left and right. Previous findings suggest, however, that besides political orientation, ideological strength (i.e., political extremism) is also relevant to understand such distinctive attitudes. Our study reveals that the political right is more anxious, and the political left experiences more self-efficacy, about the refugee crisis. At the same time, the political extremesat both sides of the spectrumare more likely than moderates to believe that the solution to this societal problem is simple. Furthermore, both extremes experience more judgmental certainty about their domain-specific knowledge of the refugee crisis, independent of their actual knowledge. Finally, belief in simple solutions mediated the relationship between ideology and judgmental certainty, but only among political extremists. We conclude that both ideological orientation and strength matter to understand citizens' reactions to the refugee crisis.

TI  - Supporting the Iron Fist: Crime News, Public Opinion, and Authoritarian Crime Control in Guatemala
T2  - LATIN AMERICAN POLITICS AND SOCIETY
LA  - English
AB  - Authoritarian responses to rising violent crime rates have become a serious problem in Central America. Inspired by theories of agenda setting and media framing, this article examines the influence of news media coverage of crime on attitudes toward crime control. Using an original survey experiment, it tests the relationship between crime news, fear of crime, trust in government institutions, and support for authoritarian crime control measures in Guatemala. It finds that crime news influences support for authoritarian crime control via its effect on lowering citizen trust in government institutions. Exposure to crime news also affects self-reported victimization rates and levels of support for a presidential candidate promoting iron fist policies. These findings not only give insight into the relationship between crime news and political attitudes but also have implications for the rule of law and the politics of crime in new or fragile democracies.

TI  - How Does Local TV News Change Viewers' Attitudes?The Case of Sinclair Broadcasting
T2  - POLITICAL COMMUNICATION
LA  - English
KW  - Local TV news
KW  - partisan bias
KW  - media effects
AB  - How does local television news shape viewers' national political attitudes? The answer is unclear, because local news typically focuses on local, not national, stories, and is politically neutral. But the rise of Sinclair Broadcasting, now the nation's second-largest owner of local TV stations, upends that assumption. News on Sinclair-owned stations focuses more on national topics, and presents them with a right-wing slant. Given this, we might expect it to shift its viewers' attitudes in a pro-Republican direction. Using data on Sinclair's acquisition of local TV stations between 2008 and 2018, I show that living in an area with a Sinclair-owned TV station lowers viewers' approval of President Obama during his tenure in office, and makes viewers less likely to vote for the Democratic nominee for president. This has important implications for our understanding of the effects of local TV news, as well as for media trust, as I discuss in the conclusion.

AB  - Accessible summary
   What is known about the subject?
   People with learning disability are more likely than the general population to develop schizophrenia.
   Personal recovery philosophies are based on positive attitudes and an optimism that recognizes and values people and their strengths and capacity to achieve goals.
   Little is known from previous studies about the illness perceptions of learning disability practitioners who work with people that experience both a learning disability and schizophrenia.
   The illness beliefs of learning disability practitioners about schizophrenia may mediate the potential for social exclusion and limit recovery outcomes.
   What this study/paper adds to existing knowledge?
   The findings show that the illness beliefs of learning disability practitioners and support workers regarding schizophrenia are pessimistic in terms of the consequences for people with schizophrenia and learning disability and their relatives as well as the chronic course of the illness.
   What are the implications for clinical practice?
   This study identifies the nature of LD practitioner perceptions about schizophrenia and provides guidance about how personal recovery philosophies can be applied to the management of LD and schizophrenia.
   The beliefs of learning disability practitioners and support workers regarding schizophrenia need to be reframed to support better recovery outcomes and social inclusion for this group.
   The findings from this study can inform the development of training in bio-psycho-social models of schizophrenia, recovery approaches, family/carer interventions, clinical supervision, mentorship and reflection on clinical practice, which could be potentially useful strategies to help facilitate a reframing of beliefs.
   Background and purpose of study: The prevalence of schizophrenia in people with learning disability is 3-4%. This is the first study to investigate the illness perceptions of learning disability (LD) practitioners towards people with schizophrenia. Methods: Learning disability practitioners (n = 210) that work with people with LD and schizophrenia completed a modified version of the Illness Perception Questionnaire Schizophrenia Carers Version (IPQ-SCV). Descriptive and correlational analyses were conducted for all of the IPQ-SCV subscales. Results: A significant positive correlation was found between consequences relative and consequences patient (0.495, P < 0.001), and a negative correlation was found between timeline episodic and timeline chronic (-0.243, P < 0.001) subscales. Discussion: Consistent with previous evidence found regarding negative staff attitudes to schizophrenia recovery outcomes, course and chronicity, the current investigation has extended and confirmed these observations to staff working with individuals with comorbid schizophrenia and learning disability. Implications for practice: This study identifies the nature of LD practitioner perceptions about schizophrenia and contributes to the development of the recovery philosophy in relation to the management of LD and schizophrenia. The findings inform the design of training modules in bio-psycho-social models of schizophrenia, recovery approaches, family intervention, clinical supervision and reflection. These can help LD practitioners to reframe their schizophrenia/LD illness beliefs.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate undergraduate nursing students' use of mobile learning (m-learning) and the factors contributing to their use of m-learning.
   Design/methodology/approach In total, 586 nursing students from three universities in Ghana participated in this study. Survey questionnaires were used to collect data. Descriptive statistics, sample t-test and multiple regression were used to analyze the data.
   Findings The research found that most students owned smartphones. Mobile technology was mainly used for doing homework. The result indicates that gender differences exist in terms of perceived usefulness of m-learning. In addition, age differences exist with regard to the perceived ease of use of m-learning. Furthermore, students showed positive attitudes toward the use of technology. Finally, perceived usefulness and attitudes toward the use of technology predicted students' intention to use m-learning.
   Originality/value Despite the abundance of research on nursing education in other countries, there is a lack of research on nursing students' use of m-learning and factors influencing their implementation of m-learning in higher learning institutions in Ghana. This study is important because it provides a clear description of nursing students' use of m-learning and factors affecting their use in schools. Also, the author suggests that information from this study assists school administrators and nursing educators to understand students' positions regarding m-learning in classroom.

AB  - The #MeToo campaign has reminded us that male sexual violence, harassment, and abuse towards women is not a new phenomenon. But alongside the visibility of the perpetrators and experiences of myriad women, this recent campaign raises a set of questions as to how this type of violence towards women is normalised and legitimated. Our focus here is on the ways in which male sexual violence towards women is normalised and legitimated through the use of humour. Existing research on responses to, and discussions of, rape jokes and rape culture have primarily focussed on online discourses or television coverage of rape joke controversies. The focus in this paper is if, and how, serious newspaper discourse contributes to the normalisation of male sexual violence towards women. In order to evaluate this, we undertake a thematic analysis of UK newspaper coverage of rape jokes. While there is the potential for the telling of rape jokes to be emancipatory, our findings suggest that news coverage of rape jokes does the ideological work of strengthening rather than challenging gendered power relations. We argue that news coverage of rape jokes in the UK predominantly reinforces and normalises male sexual violence towards women.

AB  - Digital information and communication technologies feature prominently in programmes to promote social inclusion and to implement extensive reform in public service provision across Europe. The transition to an all-digital communications environment and the digital 'switchover' of public services bring to the fore a need to rethink access as a goal of public policy. This article probes patterns of internet diffusion among disabled people using capabilities framework and resource-based models of access. The analysis highlights the multi-dimensional character of media access capability as the space to evaluate policies for social inclusion; the relational character of disability as a phenomenon of the interface between personal circumstances and structural disadvantage; a capability failure resulting from a gap in policy commitment to promote universal access for disabled people and other excluded groups; and a requirement for policies sensitive to the need for additional resources to equalize the media access capabilities of these individuals.

AB  - The risk information seeking and processing model predicts information-seeking behavior based on a number of factors, including information insufficiency. Using the risk information seeking and processing model, the present study experimentally manipulated the two components of information insufficiency (i.e., sufficiency threshold and current knowledge). Sufficiency threshold was manipulated using information about radon risk with varying levels of social distance, whereas current knowledge was manipulated using information about radon coping strategies. Results showed that the high sufficiency threshold condition resulted in greater information seeking intention. On the other hand, the current knowledge manipulation did not affect information seeking intention.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to investigate the effect of sensory marketing on customer loyalty of private sports clubs, with the mediating role of perceived value. The sample was composed of 385 people (18 to 65 years old) who attended private sports clubs in Tehran in 2019. The three instruments used were: Sensory Marketing Questionnaire, Perceived Value Questionnaire, Behavioral and Attitudinal Loyalty Questionnaire. The data analysis showed that sensory marketing through perceived value can be effective in the behavioral and attitudinal loyalty of customers of private fitness clubs. Therefore, the managers of sports clubs should go beyond measuring customer satisfaction and the quality of services provided and focus on customer loyalty, because the key to attract and retain customers is to improve their positive attitude towards sports service providers.

AB  - The use of mobile technology, such as sports bracelets, is gaining popularity as it modifies the ways and processes of learning and teaching in college physical education (PE). However, little empirical evidence can be seen in literature to demonstrate crucial factors that influence university students' acceptance of sports bracelets. Guided by the technology acceptance model (TAM), this study hence aimed at explaining university students' intention to use sports bracelets. In total, 445 university students in China responded to a 19-item survey package. Results indicated that users' attitudes toward technology and perceived usefulness were significant predictors of intention to use sports bracelets. Meanwhile, users' intrinsic sports motivation significantly promoted users' positive attitudes toward this technology and was significantly influenced by perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Overall, our findings highlighted the importance of stimulating young adults' intrinsic sports motivation that facilitates their intention to use sports bracelets such that to develop a healthy lifestyle that benefits their physical health.

AB  - Applying selected psychoanalytic constructs from Freud and Klein to recent pervasive rhetoric around anti-immigration in the United States, we conducted a critical discourse analysis of media and policy representations of immigrants in recent news coverage in the United States regarding the Trump Administration's response to (1) asylum claims related to domestic violence and gang violence and (2) undocumented immigrants. We illustrate how feared bad object/immigrants are constructed alongside the imagined good object/nationalism, as exemplified by Trump's motto - "Make America Great Again" (MAGA). We argue how this paranoid-schizoid position reifies racism veiled under nationalism and discuss how social workers could work together toward the depressive position re-imagining America-as-the-whole.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to clarify the relationship between consumer accountability and responses to egoistic and altruistic appeals. It proposes that when consumers' relationships with others are heightened in the form of accountability, different prosocial message appeals become effective. The study expands the understanding of how marketing may enhance the efficacy of prosocial campaign messages. Design/methodology/approach The study utilized three online experimental studies to test hypotheses across different population samples and health product categories. Self-benefit and other-benefit appeals were tested to decrease meat consumption (Study 1), increase vaccination intent (Study 2) and purchase oxybenzone-free sunscreen (Study 3). Results provide converging evidence for the proposed interaction between appeal type and accountability. Findings When consumers believe their choices will be known or discussed with others, they are more persuaded by other-benefit or altruistic appeals. Contrary to some existing research, Study 3 found that when public accountability was heightened, hybrid appeals were less effective than a solely altruistic appeal in generating purchase intent, digital engagement and attitude change, even controlling for social desirability. Research limitations/implications Public accountability was manipulated only in an online setting, and future studies should replicate with greater ecological validity. Results inform how scholars, brands and organizations should approach message efficacy in prosocial campaigns, particularly when an individual's relationship with others may become salient. Practical implications The paper includes implications for the development and deployment of various organizational strategies such as changing the appeal depending on where a message will be viewed by consumers. Importantly for digital campaigns, maximum digital engagement arises from an altruistic appeal in a public context. Originality/value This paper fulfills an identified need to understand how organizations can successfully encourage prosocial consumer behavior, as well as bridges literature gaps on accountability and appeal efficacy.

AB  - Introduction: asthma tends to be more severe with worse symptoms in Africa due to late diagnosis and delayed initiation of treatment. To identify patient and treatment-related factors which influence the appropriate use of asthma medications. Methods: the study was institution based cross-sectional design. Patients were invited to provide information regarding the use of their asthma medications and factors potentially associated with appropriate use of these medications. A stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the most important factor at a 0.05 level of significance. Results: respondents with better knowledge of their asthma medications were more likely to use them appropriately (OR 5.82 [CI 95% 2.25-15.04]) as were those with positive attitudes and beliefs towards asthma and asthma medications (OR 3.88 [CI 95% 1.44-10.44]). Conclusion: patients need to understand the importance of adhering to the prescribed regimen for their asthma medications even in the absence of overt symptoms in order to optimize clinical outcome.

AB  - The relationship between functional body image and children's experiences in differing physical activity contexts, including physical education, sports club participation and habitual physical activity, and gender differences, was investigated. Participants were 300 grade-six students (150 girls), who were assessed for functional body image (Embodied Image Scale), attitude toward physical education, sports club participation (questionnaires) and physical activity (accelerometers). General-linear-mixed-modelling was used to investigate relationships between functional body image and the three physical activity contexts. Results indicated that children who held more positive attitudes towards physical education and those who were a member of a sports club had better functional body image; and that a positive effect of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity on behavioral functional body image was evident among boys only. Our data suggest that future interventions aiming to improve children's functional body image may benefit from focusing on physical education in schools and encouraging participation in organized sports clubs.

AB  - Evidence on the association of cognitive ability with economic attitudes is mixed. We conducted a meta-analysis (k = 20, N = 46,426) to examine the relationship between objective measures of cognitive ability and economic ideology and analyzed survey data (N = 3,375) to test theoretical explanations for the association. The meta-analysis provided evidence for a small positive association with a weighted mean effect size of r = .07 (95% CI = [0.02, 0.12]), suggesting that higher cognitive ability is associated with conservative views on economic issues, but effect sizes were extremely heterogeneous. Tests using representative survey data provided support for both a positive association of cognitive ability with economic conservatism that is mediated through income as well as for a negative association that is mediated through a higher need for certainty. Hence, multiple causal mechanisms with countervailing effects might explain the low overall association of cognitive ability with economic political attitudes.

AB  - This study explores the effects of gender stereotypes on evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) recommendations. We predict that gender stereotypes will affect human-AI interactions, resulting in somewhat different persuasive effects of AI recommendations for utilitarian vs. hedonic products. We found that participants in the male AI agent condition gave higher competence scores than in the female AI agent condition. Contrariwise, perceived warmth was higher in the female AI agent condition than in the male condition. More importantly, a significant interaction effect between AI gender and product type was found, suggesting that participants showed more positive attitudes toward the AI recommendations when the male AI recommended a utilitarian (vs. hedonic) product. Conversely, a hedonic product was evaluated more positively when advised by the female (vs. male) AI agent.

AB  - Individuals differ in the extent to which they believe online communication can contribute to the growth of close relationships - a concept defined as the perceived reality of online interactions. Perceived reality may function as a self-fulfilling prophecy: individuals who have positive attitudes toward online interactions will make behavioral choices that lead to positive outcomes. A sample of 207 undergraduates was assigned to a hypothetical online or face-to-face interaction with a stranger. In the online condition, levels of perceived reality predicted willingness to self-disclose and to provide social support within the interaction, which in turn predicted positive expectations of the interaction's success. This research reinforces the importance of studying users' attitudes as predictors of the outcomes of online interaction.

AB  - Despite the increasing awareness of digital games' potential for language learning, only a handful of studies focus on their integration into classrooms. Informed by bridging activities, this mixed methods case study recruited six students to engage in instructed gameplay in class and game-related activities after class. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected and analyzed so as to measure participants' learning outcome, document their engagement, and explore their perceptions of game-based language learning. Results suggest progress in vocabulary recall and transfer. Participants also reported gains in writing and listening, satisfaction with the project, along with a positive attitude towards GBLL. Moreover, it is found that the instructor has a pivotal role to play in pre-game setup, in-game guidance, and post-game feedback. The study yields empirical evidence regarding the benefits of GBLL and may hold pedagogical implications for the integration of games into educational settings. The limitations of this research and future directions are also discussed.

AB  - This study explores how New Zealand primary school students' experiences of school libraries affected their attitudes towards reading for pleasure once they entered secondary school. Two hundred and seventy-six students in their first year at high school completed a survey asking about their primary school libraries. The students were asked to self-identify as keen readers, occasional readers or non-readers. The results were analysed in a spreadsheet, considering variables such as attitude to reading, former school and family background. The students were mainly positive about their libraries, but were bothered by cramped and noisy environments and books they perceived as babyish. Students from schools with a librarian were more positive about reading for fun than those from schools where the library was not prioritised. Students from a family background where reading was encouraged were more likely to maintain a positive attitude to reading by the time they reached high school.

AB  - The literature points toward a limited understanding regarding the relationship between managers' cognition and their environmental behavioral intentions. Using behavioral reasoning theory, this study examines the relationships between managers' cognition and their behavioral intentions toward environmental initiatives. Data was collected from 256 managers working in manufacturing firms in India and modeled by structural equation modeling. The modeling of data suggests that managers' reasoning for and against energy-saving initiatives is positively associated with their self-enhancement values (SEV) and negatively with their self-transcendence values (STV). Managers' reasoning regarding the energy-saving initiatives fully and positively mediates the manifestation of SEV into their positive attitude toward energy saving. The same reasoning fully and negatively mediates the relationship between STV and the attitude toward energy-saving initiatives. Industry experience of the managers also strengthens the relationship between their values and their "reasoning for" energy-saving initiatives. The study also offers directions for future research and consequent implications.

AB  - This research tries to measure the direct effects of media exposure, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) compliance on customer perception; and, to analyze the moderating role of firm's reputation risk. Data is collected from sports manufacturing industry, Sialkot, Pakistan. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling technique was used for analysis. The results showed positive effects of firm's media exposure and CSR compliance on customer perception. This suggests that firms which maintain positive image in the media and consider contributing positively in society and doing business with ethics, they attract positive attitude of the customers towards products and firms as well. Moderating results show that interaction of firm's reputation further strengthens the effects of both media exposure and CSR initiatives on customer perception. Results also revealed the positive effects of firm's reputation risk on customer perception. The paper discusses implications of this research for the existing literature, practitioners, and policymakers.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on our daily lives and functioning. To reduce the potential transmission, countries throughout the world practiced social distancing. Unfortunately, this social distancing often contributed to a sense of social isolation and physical inactivity. Two physician athletes on opposite coasts of the United States sought to change this narrative by promoting physical activity among the general population with the #SocialDistancingFitnessChallenge. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in March and April 2020, these physicians would post exercises during the 5-day workweek-one would post yoga/flexibility exercises, while the other would post high-intensity cardio and strength exercises on two social media platforms. Some posts would amass over 100,000 views. They received daily feedback on how this challenge not only encouraged others to be engaged in physical activity during the most challenging pandemic of our lifetimes, but it also improved their mental health and outlook on the future amid great uncertainty.

AB  - The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus in late 2019 brought severe devastation to the world. The pandemic spread across the globe, infecting more than ten million people and disrupting several businesses. Although social distancing and the use of protective masks were suggested all over the world, the cases seem to rise, which led to worldwide lockdown in different phases. The rampant escalation in the number of cases, the global effects, and the lockdown may have a severe effect on the psychology of people. The emergency protocols implemented by the authorities also lead to increased use in the number of multimedia devices. Excessive use of such devices may also contribute to psychological disorders. Hence, hence it is necessary to analyze the state of mind of people during the lockdown. In this paper, we perform a sentiment analysis of Twitter data during the pandemic lockdown, i.e., two weeks and four weeks after the lockdown was imposed. Investigating the sentiments of people in the form of positive, negative, and neutral tweets would assist us in determining how people are dealing with the pandemic and its effects on a psychological level. Our study shows that the lockdown witnessed more number positive tweets globally on multiple datasets. This is indicative of the positivity and optimism based on the sentiments and psychology of Twitter users worldwide. The study will be effective in determining people's mental well-being and will also be useful in devising appropriate lockdown strategies and crisis management in the future.

AB  - The United States is one of the hardest-hit countries by the COVID-19 pandemic and yet there is widespread hesitancy to take the vaccine. In order to address vaccine hesitancy and foster public understanding of the COVID-19 vaccine, it is necessary to strategize public health messages based on evidence. To this end, we use experimental data to examine the effects of four message frames on participants' attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine and their vaccine intention. The primary purposes of this paper are to examine the 1) impact of loss vs. gain frames and individual vs. collective frames and 2) role of perceived benefits on participants' attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine and their vaccine intention. Our findings show that participants with higher perceived benefits and exposed to the loss frame showed higher positive attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine and greater intention to vaccinate. Similar patterns were revealed in case of the individual frame message. Implications are discussed.

AB  - This study examines the nation branding of South Korea through the Oscar-winning film Parasite (2019) to understand the South Korean government's approach toward cultural diplomacy, and its outcomes. Despite growing depoliticalization and decentralization, South Korea's cultural diplomacy policy remains unilateral in embracing Parasite's success for nation branding while drawing on expanding private-sector resources to produce and market the film. To explicate South Korea's nation brand vis-a-vis Parasite, a Leximancer analysis of 8808 texts investigated concepts that are associated with the film as a complex bundle of images, meanings, associations, and experiences in the minds of international audiences. The texts associate Parasite with the national entity of South Korea and the country's most significant cultural content export, the Korean Wave. Sentiment analyses through Leximancer also show positive attitudes, thus helping to reinforce the nation branding of Parasite and its successes as a tangible South Korean national resource, consistent with a soft power approach.

AB  - Purpose Drawing from uncertainty reduction theory and uncertainty management theory, the aim of the research is to investigate the influence of positive change orientation (i.e. change self-efficacy, positive attitudes toward change, perceived control) on the perceived change uncertainty and behavioral change support (i.e. compliance, cooperation and championing) relationship. Design/methodology/approach The paper hypothesizes that employees' positive change orientation partially mediates the relationship between perceived change uncertainty and behavioral change support. The research data were collected from employees and their supervisors in three sequential phases. The research model was tested with the use of Structural Equation Modeling. Findings The research findings suggest that employees' change self-efficacy and attitudes toward change partially mediates the negative relationship between perceived change uncertainty and behavioral change support. Practical implications The results support that change management practitioners will benefit significantly if they manage to influence their employees' positive change orientation as well as to decrease the perceived uncertainty to provoke change supportive behaviors. Relevant suggestions are made. Originality/value The originality of this study lies in the finding that employees' change self-efficacy as well as their attitudes toward change partially mediates the relationship between perceived change uncertainty and behavioral change support. Further, the research findings add to the uncertainty reduction theory and uncertainty management theory as well as other related notions.

AB  - This study examined the effects of chief executive officers' (CEOs) self-disclosure on consumer-brand relationships and the moderating role of brand relationship norms. To test the proposed hypotheses, a 2 x 2 factorial design was implemented with self-disclosure (high vs. low) and relationship norms (exchange v. communal) as the between-subjects factors. The results showed the interplay between the level of CEOs' self-disclosure on Instagram and the type of relationship norms between consumers and brands and their effects on consumers' attitudinal and behavioral responses. For participants primed with the communal norm, high CEO self-disclosure induced more positive attitudes toward the CEO and the brand as well as higher consumer intentions for self-disclosure, than the low CEO self-disclosure; these results were reversed for participants in the exchange norm condition. This study advances the theoretical understanding of brands' social media engagement using CEOs and provides practical implications.

AB  - Background: Homophobia or the reaction against homosexuals could be based on the structural ideology of the society, on its institutions or on power relationships, which can incite contempt, sometimes even to deadly violence, regarding those not complying the national culture reference model. Such behaviors are born from the belief that homosexuality must be fought against and opposed as it threatens social order, and could be increased augmented by the campaigns of politicians spread in the mass media.
   Methods: The aim of this study is to investigate and compare homophobia in Italy and Spain, two Mediterranean countries related from a cultural and traditional background and for general acceptance of homosexuals, and to verify the role of current national culture on recently rising homophobic attitude. Italian and Spanish subjects were studied by means of self-administered questionnaires consisting of: Modern Homophobia Scale to evaluate homophobic attitudes, Homophobia Scale to evaluate the affective, cognitive and behavioral components towards homosexuality, Stereotype Content Model to identify stereotypes about homosexuality, the scale of 11 Emotions and the subscale of Prejudice Attitude Test assessing the social distance, to assess the prejudicial behavior across the two countries.
   Results: Results showed that despite homophobia levels are low for both populations, with positive emotion and stereotype, Italians showed a greater social distance and a lower quantity and quality of contacts with homosexuals than Spanish. Comparing for political orientation, ideological right-flaw Italians resulted in significantly higher personal discomfort, aggressiveness and cognitive negativism, and lower quantity of contacts than Spanish. Social distance was higher scored in right-flaw than left-flaw oriented subjects from both Italy and Spain, with Italians scoring higher than Spanish. An alternative interpretation of homophobic attitude in Italy, known for recently rising attempts to homosexuals, was provided in comparison with Spain. Political orientation could provide for the differences observed in social distance in each country, but not between them. Specifically, this study's results indicate that genderist and homophobic campaigns from the Italian right parties could have transmitted values and attitudes of greater prejudice and rejection towards homosexuals.
   Conclusions: This research contributes to the objective of raising awareness about the mechanisms underlying the homophobic matrix conveyed from national culture, politics and mass media, and its consequences on psycho-social disease.

AB  - Imagined stereotypes of Roma are prevailing across Europe and have an impact of discrimination and social exclusion of the Roma. In 2011, Denmark published their National Roma Inclusion Strategy as a response to the Europe 2020 Growth Strategy. This study analyses how the Roma are represented in the national policy and in ongoing discourse regarding Roma in newspaper articles published around the time of the publication of the Strategy. A critical discourse analysis was conducted, and the findings show that a profound stigmatization of the Roma was common and acceptable in both Danish nationalistic media discourse and in the paternalistic policy discourse. The Roma were represented as an alienated, non-empowered group in contrast to the majority population and lacking any useful qualities. There was a lack of Roma voices in both policy and newspapers. The discourses regarding Roma in Denmark are lacking both Roma influence and initiatives to change Roma conditions.

AB  - Supply Chains have been more and more suffering from unexpected industrial, natural events, or epidemics that might disrupt the normal flow of materials, information, and money. The recent pandemic triggered by the outbreak of the new COVID-19 has pointed out the increasing vulnerability of supply chain networks, prompting companies (and governments) to implement specific policies and actions to control and reduce the spread of the disease across the network, and to cope with exogenous shocks. In this paper, we present a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) framework to model the spread of new epidemics across different distribution networks and determine social distancing/treatment policies in the case of local and global networks. We highlight the relevance of adaptability and flexibility of decisions in unstable and unpredictable scenarios.

AB  - The need for intervention strategies aiming to reduce teachers' use of violent discipline methods has been expressed repeatedly, especially for countries where this practice is socially and legally accepted. Nevertheless, initial targets for interventions are not clearly identified, as factors contributing to teachers' use of violence are still understudied. In the present study, we examined the interplay between teachers' own experiences of violence, their attitudes, current stress, and their use of violent discipline in a representative sample of 173 Tanzanian primary school teachers (53.7% female, M-age = 38.1 years, SDage = 10) using structural equation modeling. Our model showed good model fit (chi(2) [48, n = 173] = 78.058 (p = .004), CFI = .962, TLI = .948, RMSEA = .060 [90% CI [.034, .084], PCLOSE = .233], SRMR = .048). Results indicated direct associations between positive attitudes toward violent discipline (beta = .41), stress (beta = .23), and teachers' own experiences of violence (beta = .21) with teachers' use of violence. Teachers' own experiences of violence were significantly associated with positive attitudes (beta = .39), and these significantly mediated the association between teachers' own experiences of violence and their use of violent discipline (beta =.23). Our findings underscore the relevance of past experiences, societal norms, and current working conditions in understanding teachers' violence against students. Interventions aiming to reduce teachers' use of violent discipline may focus on stress management, societal norms, personal beliefs on violent discipline, and how teachers' own previous experiences of violence may influence teacher's disciplining behavior.

AB  - Trans women face multiple social, economic and health inequalities and the impact of gender oppression and violence is even more profoundly experienced by trans women sex workers, although in culturally specific ways. This paper presents a pilot study conducted to explore and engage with the context of trans women sex workers in Lido Tre Archi, Italy. In line with the community psychology values of social justice, social change and participation, we outline our engagement process and key challenges observed when attempting action research with such a highly marginalised group. Data were collected in the form of ethnographic notes from informal consultations with different stakeholders and participant observations, and of documents (newspaper articles, picture captions) and were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings are organised in three themes relating to the social, policy and physical context in Lido Tre Archi demonstrating evidence of the contextual challenges and how they intertwine to generate a spiral of marginalisation and social exclusion for the participants. We take a collaborative and reflexive stance in our work and conclude with recommended steps and potential limitations to initiate an action research project.

AB  - Background Vaccination programs are effective only when a significant percentage of people are vaccinated. Social media usage is arguably one of the factors affecting public attitudes toward vaccines. Objective This study aims to identify if the social media usage factors can predict Arab people's attitudes and behavior toward the COVID-19 vaccines. Methods An online survey was conducted in the Arab countries, and 217 Arab nationals participated in this study. Logistic regression was applied to identify what demographics and social media usage factors predict public attitudes and behavior toward the COVID-19 vaccines. Results Of the 217 participants, 56.2% (n = 122) were willing to get the vaccines, and 41.5% (n = 90) were hesitant. This study shows that none of the social media usage factors were significant enough to predict the actual vaccine acceptance behavior. However, some social media usage factors could predict public attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccines. For example, compared to infrequent social media users, frequent social media users were 2.85 times more likely to agree that the risk of COVID-19 was being exaggerated (OR = 2.85, 95% CI = 0.86-9.45, p = .046). On the other hand, participants with more trust in vaccine information shared by their contacts were less likely to agree that decision-makers had ensured the safety of vaccines (OR = 0.528, 95% CI = 0.276-1.012, p = .05). Conclusion Information shared on social media may affect public attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, disseminating correct and validated information about the COVID-19 vaccines on social media is important to increase public trust and counter the impact of incorrect misinformation.

AB  - The electric transition of the airline industry is emerging, closely following the automobile industry. Nonetheless, very little is known about airline customers' readiness for traveling on the electric alternative of an airplane. This study was designed to examine customers' intricate decision-making process for adopting electric airplanes and paying conventional flight prices for such electric-airplane flights. Our results from the structural analysis revealed that reducing customers' perceived risk and increasing new product knowledge is critical in boosting trust and positive attitude toward electric airplanes that significantly elicit their adoption and pay intentions. In addition, the effectiveness of the higher-order structure of perceived risk was uncovered, and both attitude and trust were significant mediators. Our theoretical framework satisfactorily accounted for behavioral intentions. Our results help airline practitioners invent efficient strategies to boost customers' willingness to travel on electric airplanes adapting the electric transition of the airline industry.

TI  - Understanding collective regularity in human mobility as a familiar stranger phenomenon
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - Beyond the physical structures that contain daily routines, urban city dwellers repeatedly encounter strangers that similarly shape their environments. Familiar strangers are neither formal acquaintances nor completely anonymous faces in daily urban life. Due to data limitations, there is a lack of research focused on uncovering the structure of the "Familiar Stranger" phenomenon at a large scale while simultaneously investigating the social relationships between such strangers. Using countrywide mobile phone records from Andorra, we empirically show the existence of such a phenomenon as well as details concerning these strangers' relative social relations. To understand the social and spatial components of familiar strangers more deeply, we study the temporal regularity and spatial structure of collective urban mobility to shed light on the mechanisms that guide these interactions. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between social distances and the number of encounters to show that more significant physical encounters correspond to a shorter social distance. Understanding these social and physical networks has essential implications for epidemics spreading, urban planning, and information diffusion.

AB  - An increasing number of people tend to eat alone due to social changes and an altered attitude towards cooking and eating practices. Anecdotal reports indicate that solo diners tend to use information and communication technology devices, for example, the smartphone, as part of the eating experience. While lab studies suggest that the devices contribute to an increased high-calorie food intake and decreased feeling of satiety, these studies disregard the everyday experience and motivation of solo diners. We conducted an exploratory study to investigate how solo diners use digital devices as part of their daily eating experience. Semi-structured interviews with solo diners (N = 12) were analyzed using thematic analysis in an inductive approach leading to six themes. The themes focus on (1) the perception of a meal; (2) the experience of a solo diner; (3) the purpose of using an information and communication technology device; (4) the perceived influence of the devices; (5) factors decreasing and increasing the use; (6) and the potential to promote healthier food consumption. Our results indicate that the use of digital devices while eating alone can lead to distraction, being unaware of the food texture and the amount that is eaten. The devices can also induce a positive influence by providing entertainment and mitigating negative emotions like loneliness and boredom. The devices have the potential to contribute to healthy eating practices by providing education and by influencing the speed of eating through elements of sound. Although the use of devices might negatively affect eating behavior, their ubiquitous presence also offers the opportunity to reach specific, vulnerable populations.

AB  - Purpose The support of host country nationals (HCNs) is critical for expatriate adjustment and performance. Drawing from social identity theory and self-categorization theory, this study investigates the antecedents of HCNs' support toward expatriates in Central/South America, focusing on cultural similarities and expatriate race. Design/methodology/approach We conducted a quasi-experimental study to understand the antecedents that promote the willingness of HCNs to offer required support to expatriates. Data were gathered from 117 Latin American participants, who were asked to respond to questions about their perceptions of expatriates from the USA and their willingness to offer support to those expatriates. Findings Overall, our findings suggest that HCNs are likely to provide support to expatriates when they perceive the expatriates as similar in terms of culture and race. Specifically, African Americans received more positive attitudes and support than White Americans in South/Central America. The effect of cultural similarity on HCN willingness to support expatriates was mediated by perceived trustworthiness. Originality/value The present study extends the research on HCN support to expatriates, to Central/South America, an important region that has been under-studied in the expatriate-HCN context. Another novel feature of our study is that we investigate the role of expatriate race and cultural similarity and illuminate the underlying mechanism of the relationship between expatriate race and HCN support.

AB  - Previous work at St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, demonstrated a need for genetic counseling (GC) services, with 4% of pediatric, neonatal intensive care, and prenatal patients identified as having indications for genetic evaluation (Quinonez et al, 2019). The aim of this study was to investigate SPHMMC patients' familiarity with, knowledge of, and attitudes toward GC services. Surveys were adapted from previous work in North America populations (Riesgraf et al, 2015 and Gemmell et al, 2017) and administered to 102 patients, and results were compared to North American populations using Student's t test. 30% of respondents reported at least some familiarity with GC, primarily via the media or healthcare providers. Patients had generally positive attitudes toward GC, reporting they would trust information provided by a genetic counselor and that GC is in line with their values. Knowledge of GC showed similar trends overall when compared to results from North American populations. Our work indicates limited exposure to GC in this population, but generally positive feelings toward GC. Patients' attitudes toward GC were comparable to rural North American populations surveyed using the same tool on most items; however, cultural differences including views on abortions and directiveness of healthcare providers could account for discrepancies and are important considerations when implementing genetic services globally.

AB  - Introduction: Safety culture environment is one of the main barriers to improve patient care safety. Assessment of healthcare providers' perspectives towards patient safety and its no-blame culture helps to identify the most problematic areas for improvement. Objectives: The researchers attempted to assess healthcare providers' perspectives towards patient safety culture in one of the challenging high risk environment, hence establishing priorities for the patient safety improvement. Methods: This exploratory study adopted a qualitative design, it was conducted in the four general Pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) of Cairo University Children Hospital in Egypt, recruiting 30 healthcare providers for Focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviewing 8 hospital key personnel using semi-structured guide consisted of open-ended questions followed by brain storming sessions. Results: The participants' age ranged from 25 to 48 years, their median work duration in the hospital was11 years and 84.9% of them had never attended patient safety training. All participants saw patient safety as an important aspect of patient care quality and a priority to the hospital and that proper incidence reporting, infection control, team work and non-punitive culture can improve patient safety practices. The most prioritized intervention to be implemented is to 'conduct patient safety training sessions'. Conclusion: All participants had positive attitude towards patient safety culture. The PICUs patient safety practices had much room for improvement.

AB  - This study investigated the impact of listening to music during exercise on perceived enjoyment, attitudes and intentions towards sprint interval training (SIT). Twenty men (24.8 +/- 4.5years) and women (20.1 +/- 2.6years) unfamiliar with SIT exercise completed two acute sessions of SIT, one with and one without music. Perceived enjoyment, attitudes and intentions towards SIT were measured post-exercise for each condition. Attitudes and intentions to engage in SIT were also measured at baseline and follow-up. Post-exercise attitudes mediated the effects of enjoyment on intentions in the music condition (95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.01, 0.07], (2)=0.36) and in the no music condition (95% CI: [0.01, 0.08], (2)=0.37). Attitudes towards SIT were significantly more positive following the music than no music condition (P=0.004), while intentions towards SIT were not (P=0.29). Further, attitudes and intentions towards SIT did not change from baseline to follow-up (Ps > 0.05). These findings revealed that participants had relatively positive attitudes and intentions towards SIT, which did not become more negative despite experiencing intense SIT protocols. This study highlights the importance of acute affective responses to SIT exercise for influencing one's attitudes and intentions towards participating in SIT exercise. Such factors could ultimately play a key role in determining whether an individual engages in SIT exercise in the long term.

AB  - Background. Although the benefits and importance of vaccination before and right after pregnancy, are well known, vaccination coverage among pregnant women remains very low. The aim of our study was to evaluate pregnant women's knowledge and attitude towards vaccination.
   'Study design. A cross sectional study was performed from October 2018 to June 2019 at the University of Messina.
   Methods. We gave pregnant women >18 years old a non-self-compiling paper questionnaire. We stratified the sample according to age (<30 and >30 years old), marital status (single/divorced, in a relationship and married) and level of education (<8 and >8 years of school attendance). All possible correlations between collected data were analysed using software R.
   Results. The sample included 156 women (mean age 32 +/- 0.49 years old). Only 1.4% of the subjects were aware of all the vaccines indicated for children. Luckily, 86.7% of the sample had a positive attitude, believing in the effectiveness and safety of immunization, despite a limited lack of confidence and a belief in false myths was expressed by some of the subjects. Interestingly, results showed that information about vaccination were more frequently obtained from family/friends (52.6%), mass media (49.1%), blogs/forums (19.3%), rather than from medical institutions (only 17.5%) or the family physician (only 35.0%), reflecting the quality of the information obtained.
   Conclusions. Our results proved that a general positive attitude emerged among our sample towards vaccination, however, correct information was not always provided to women, making it a crucial issue for public health in the future.

AB  - Purpose: Because a traditionally instructed dental radiology lecture course is very time-consuming and labour-intensive, online courseware, including an interactive-learning module, was implemented to support the lectures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the perceptions of students who have worked with web-based courseware as well as the effect on their results in final examinations.
   Materials and methods: Users (n(3+4) = 138) had access to the e-program from any networked computer at any time. Two groups (n(3) = 71, n(4) = 67) had to pass a final exam after using the e-course. Results were compared with two groups (n(1) = 42, n(2) = 48) who had studied the same content by attending traditional lectures. In addition a survey of the students was statistically evaluated.
   Results: Most of the respondents reported a positive attitude towards e-learning and would have appreciated more access to computer-assisted instruction. Two years after initiating the e-course the failure rate in the final examination dropped significantly, from 40% to less than 2%.
   Conclusions: The very positive response to the e-program and improved test scores demonstrated the effectiveness of our e-course as a learning aid. Interactive modules in step with clinical practice provided learning that is not achieved by traditional teaching methods alone. To what extent staff savings are possible is part of a further study.

AB  - Wearable devices, including smartwatches, smart glasses, and fitness trackers, are becoming increasingly popular, and greater emphasis is being placed on their health-related functions. In light of this new development, this study explores the role of smartwatches as mobile health communication tools and proposes information tailoring (personalization vs. customization) and regulatory framing (promotion vs. prevention-framed) as potential strategies for promoting the tendency for self-preservation. Results from a between subjects experiment (N=100) revealed that a customized as opposed to a personalized health message was more effective in promoting self-preservation and inducing positive attitudes toward and representativeness of the message. Meanwhile, regulatory framing was found to have no effects on the outcome. Theoretical and design implications of the key findings are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The political divide between liberals and conservatives has become quite large and stable, and there appear to be many reasons for disagreements on a wide range of issues. The current research sought to explain these divides and to extend the Uncertainty-Threat Model to intergroup relations, which predicts that more dispositional, perceived-threat and uncertainty-avoidance will be related to more political conservatism. Given that conservatism is also often related to more negativity to low-status groups such as immigrants, the relationship between political ideology and negative attitudes toward immigrants may be mediated by more threat and uncertainty-avoidance. Study 1 tested this mediational hypothesis in a correlational design and showed that both uncertainty-avoidance and perceived realistic and symbolic threat significantly mediated the relationship between political ideology and attitudes toward immigrants, and that perceived threat was the more influential mediator. Study 2 extended threat management to perceived threats from unspecified outgroups, as opposed to the immigrant outgroup, and it replicated all significant mediations. Study 3 replicated the mediations observed in Studies 1 and 2 for political ideology to attitudes toward immigrants with uncertainty-avoidance and perceived threat from immigrants as mediators; it further replicated the mediations to the negative attitudes measure that had been used in Study 2 and it extended it to an objective and indirect bias measure [i.e., Affect Misattribution Procedure (AMP)]. Overall, almost all of the results supported the idea that perceived threat and uncertainty-avoidance both mediate the relationship between political ideology and attitudes toward immigrants, and that threat management, as opposed to negativity bias, may be a central concern separating liberals and conservatives. Within all three studies, we also observed more evidence for the Uncertainty-Threat Model predictions than we did for the alternative Extremity Hypothesis, which predicted a quadratic relationship between political ideology and threat and uncertainty, and between political ideology and attitudes toward immigrants.

AB  - Previous studies have distinguished cognitive, occupational status and network mechanisms in the relation between education and ethnocentrism. Hypotheses on these mediating mechanisms are derived from socialization theory, realistic group threat and contact theory. In the current study we use structural equation modeling to investigate the explanatory power of these three mechanisms simultaneously. The analysis is based on a representative population survey from the Netherlands (NELLS 2009, n = 1910). The results show that more than half of the initial association between education and ethnocentrism can be attributed to cognitive ability and occupational status mechanisms. The remaining part of the overall association, however, still has to be modeled as a direct relationship between education and ethnocentrism. This direct association can be attributed either to social desirability or to a direct liberalizing effect of education on social and political attitudes. Our analysis tentatively suggests that the rise of average education levels in Western societies might lead to less ethnocentric attitudes via the cognitive sophistication mechanism.

AB  - How does the North Korean government view China? This study examines North Korea's foreign policy on China by analyzing the strategic options of North Korean leaders and applying sentiment analysis to Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reports about China. It is found that North Korea's generally positive attitude toward China contains nuanced types of sentiments and that North Korean leaders have managed the expression of these sentiments in the media to achieve political goals at domestic and international levels. Our findings also suggest that, first, China may not be the key to the solution of the Korean nuclear issue. Second, Kim Jong Un was not a weak leader from the beginning of his rule. Rather he had acquired a substantial amount of authority before Kim Jong Il passed away. Based on our findings, an analysis of the future development of the North Korea-China relationship is also provided.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 has redefined how we carry out our daily activities with emphasis on safety measures like social distancing, the use of face masks and proper hygiene. With nursing personnel at the forefront of combating the menace created by this pandemic, the use of ICT has remained a vital technology that must be embraced by all in order to carry out a safe nursing practice. Therefore, becoming ICT compliant is no more an option to stay relevant and alive during this COVID era. This data article presents the outcome of a survey carried out among Moroccan nursing students. This was done with a view to assess their readiness and willingness to accept and use ICT as well as social media for learning and discharging their duties during and after this COVID era. Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model was adopted to structure the questionnaire items used in this survey. This was then administered to Moroccan nursing students via online Google forms. Seven hundred and two (702) respondents completed the questionnaire. After data screening and cleaning, normality assessment of the data was carried out in terms of skewness and kurtosis. Afterwards, Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to establish the statistical significance of the data in terms of the reflective indicator loadings, internal consistency reliability and convergence. This dataset includes the questionnaire used (in English and French), the responses obtained in spreadsheet format, the charts generated from the responses received, the SPSS file and the statistical analysis file. This dataset will help policy makers understand how nursing students use ICT and social media platforms and how these could be adopted as a more secure means of learning and discharging their during the COVID-19 era and beyond.

AB  - Self-esteem (a positive attitude toward oneself) and self-efficacy (confidence in one's ability to perform actions that lead to desired outcomes) are predictors of affective well-being. However, there is a lack of longitudinal research on their relative importance in predicting positive and negative affect. This study sought to examine the relative strength of these 2 variables in predicting affective well-being. Data from the German Aging Survey (DEAS), collected in 4 waves between 2008 and 2017, were used. The random-intercept cross-lagged panel model was used for data analysis. Within-person results showed that self-esteem and self-efficacy did not predict future levels of negative affect. Self-esteem, but not self-efficacy, was found to be a predictor of future levels of positive affect. In addition, positive affect predicted future self-efficacy. A longitudinal mediation model showed that self-esteem predicted future self-efficacy via positive affect. Thus, self-esteem contributes directly to future levels of positive affect and indirectly to future levels of self-efficacy.

AB  - The development of robot technology provides many possibilities for the life support of the elderly. This study explored the acceptability of robots to assist the elderly from the perspective of future designers. A quantitative questionnaire (58 copies) and a qualitative one-to-one interview (10 people) were conducted to explore the attitude of future designers towards the use of robots to assist the elderly. One-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test statistic was used to analyze the data of the questionnaire. The results show that the mean and median of 11 of the 12 dimensions of the acceptability questionnaire are greater than 3 (3 represents uncertain and neutral attitude), and 10 have statistical significance (p < 0.05). Also, the interview results show the positive attitude of future designers. The research shows that future designers hold a positive and open attitude towards the use of robots to assist the elderly. The research findings can help people understand the attitude of future designers and provide some reference for subsequent robot design and development.

AB  - Objective Investigate the role of generalized self-efficacy (GSE) in compliance with COVID-19 health behaviours such as wearing masks and social distancing. Design Two studies conducted online in the US: 312 adults in Study 1 and 253 adults in Study 2. Main outcome measures In Study 1, participants reported compliance with four health behaviours related to COVID-19: social distancing, hand washing, avoiding non-essential travel, and wearing masks. In Study 2, participants reported expected compliance with wearing masks when it was framed as a national requirement, a state requirement, or a recommendation. Results In Study 1, GSE positively affected reported compliance with COVID-19 health behaviours. This result was mediated by the perception that these behaviours would offer enhanced control. Psychological reactance negatively affected reported compliance, while trust in science-based institutions and perceived threat from COVID-19 exerted positive effects. In Study 2, requiring (vs. recommending) masks led to higher willingness to comply with COVID-19 health behaviours. This was moderated by GSE, which significantly impacted compliance only when masks were required rather than recommended. Conclusion Higher GSE predicted increased compliance with health behaviours related to COVID-19, such as wearing masks. This effect was strongest when these behaviours were framed as required rather than recommended.

AB  - Appearance-based stereotyping and stigma emerge in early childhood and can exist by the age of 4 years. Children from stigmatized groups (e.g., higher weight and visible difference) are at increased risk of experiencing judgment and unwanted behaviors (e.g., teasing) from other children, resulting in negative outcomes such as poorer psychological adjustment and quality of life. To understand appearance stigma in children further, this study evaluated children's attitudes toward various socially stigmatized appearances. Three hundred and ninety-six children (aged 4-10 years, 54% female, and 83% White), from six primary schools in England, viewed in a randomized order, five digitally designed, realistic child characters. The images included characters with: No stigmatized appearance; wearing glasses; of higher weight; with a facial burn; and in a wheelchair. Measures assessed children's attitudes and possible friendship behaviors toward the individual characters. Children had significantly less positive attitudes and friendship behaviors toward the higher-weight character and character with a facial burn compared to the characters with no stigmatized appearance, wearing glasses, and in a wheelchair (p < .05). Additionally, children were least likely to choose the higher-weight character as a best friend, followed by the character with a facial burn. Findings can help to inform future interventions designed to promote acceptance of socially stigmatized appearances in young children. These preliminary findings suggest stigma reduction efforts in young children are warranted.

AB  - Background: Beliefs about low back pain (LBP) have been widely studied. Research supports the importance of attitudes and beliefs in the development of disability. However, public opinions about LBP have been the subject of few studies to date and more research into public attitudes has been advocated to inform future public health initiatives.
   Objectives: To investigate public attitudes and beliefs about LBP, and the association of these with demographic variables. In addition, to determine whether certain group differences in demographic characteristics were useful in predicting individuals with negative attitudes about LBP.
   Methods: A stratified sample of 3400 households were invited to participate in the Jersey Annual Social Survey. One thousand five hundred and seventy-four (46.3%) responded and 1132 (71.9%) were identified as being of working age. Complete responses to the Back Beliefs Questionnaire were provided by 1023 (65.0%).
   Results: Respondents were grouped according to pain report: no current pain, current pain not LBP, and current LBP. Significant differences existed between subgroups for most demographic characteristics. Moreover, beliefs about LBP differed significantly between the 3 groups [F (2,1019) = 17.72, P < 0.001]. Further analyses were carried out for the subgroups separately. For the Current LBP group, beliefs differed significantly by educational level [F(2,186) = 14.65, P < 0.001], perceived general health [F (2,187) = 4.42, P < 0.05], acceptability of work absence [F (2,189) = 10.69, P < 0.001], LBP impact on activity [F (2,186) = 6.38, P < 0.01], and previous LBP absence [t (185) = 4.84, P < 0.001]. Multiple regression using these characteristics produced an adjusted R-2 of 0.25 [F (4,181) = 16.33, P < 0.001] for the prediction of back beliefs.
   Discussion: Implications for public health initiatives and future research are discussed.

AB  - While it has been well established that breastfeeding provides the best nourishment for children, few women achieve the recommended breastfeeding duration. Negative media messages have been identified as one explanation for the lack of individual and public support for breastfeeding. This study explored the influence of media on the knowledge and attitudes of a nearly childless population to ascertain if and how entertainment media can positively impact perceptions of breastfeeding. Using cultivation and parasocial interaction, this research measured entertainment television's effect on breastfeeding attitudes using randomized-group experiments involving 375 students. Overall, participants generally held positive attitudes but were uncomfortable seeing breastfeeding. Moreover, results indicate that viewing a prime-time television clip that depicted public breastfeeding not only significantly lessened the extent to which participants believed that breastfeeding was a private activity but also improved attitudes and support for breastfeeding in public. This study concludes that more pro-breastfeeding media messages in entertainment media could help create a climate conducive to breastfeeding success.

AB  - This study provides evidence for the independent and additive effects of story exploration and character customization induced by fictional narratives on causal attribution and support formarginalized groups. In Study 1 (N = 163), participants read a story about a transgender teenager. Story exploration influenced identification and narrative engagement, increasing external attribution for the character's negative actions, as well as engendering more positive attitudes toward transgender individuals. Study 2 (N = 116) replicated these results in the context of undocumented immigration. Study 3 (N = 230) focused on a story about a Muslim teenager. Analysis suggested that the strongest impact on causal attribution is achieved by allowing readers to design the main character (i.e., customization) and control the narrative (i.e., exploration).

AB  - Purpose of the Study: We report the results of a study designed to assess whether and how much informal caregivers are willing to pay for technologies designed to help monitor and support care recipients (CRs) in performing kitchen and personal care tasks.
   Design and Methods: We carried out a web survey of a national sample of adult caregivers (age 18-64) caring for an older adult (N = 512). Respondents completed a 25 min online survey that included questions about their caregiving situation, current use of everyday technology, use of specific caregiving technologies, general attitudes toward technology, and questions about technologies designed to help them monitor and provide assistance for CRs' kitchen and self-care activities.
   Results: About 20% of caregivers were not willing to pay anything for kitchen and self-care technologies. Among those willing to pay something, the mean amount was approximately $50 per month for monitoring technologies and $70 per month for technologies that both monitored and provided some assistance. Younger caregivers, those caring for a person with Alzheimer's disease, and caregivers with more positive attitudes toward and experience with technology were willing to pay more. Most caregivers feel that the government or private insurance should help pay for these technologies.
   Implications: Caregivers are receptive and willing to pay for technologies that help them care for their CR, although the amount they are willing to pay is capped at around $70 per month. The combination of private pay and government subsidy may facilitate development and dissemination of caregiver technologies.

AB  - The ascent of populism has been linked with economic and cultural disruptions of modernization. From this perspective, it could be implied that factors such as psychological insecurity and uncertainty are key in making voters gravitate toward the populist narrative. The present research aimed at highlighting the psychological determinants that uncertainties deriving from modernization processes may activate in populist voters. Specifically, we focused on immigration in Italy, investigating whether and how support for different populist parties relates to development of negative attitudes toward immigrants. Two samples of Italian adults (total N = 1655), who voted in the Italian general elections of March 4, 2018 took part in the research. Multigroup path analysis showed that assumption of anti-immigration stances through the joint mediating role of Dangerous World Belief and Right-Wing Authoritarianism was shared by different groups of populist voters. However, different populist voters differed in the strength of the path passing through Competitive Jungle World Belief and Social Dominance Orientation. Results underline the relevance of social worldviews and ideological attitudes in shaping the attitudes of the Italian populist electorate.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the cultural differences in internet banking adoption between the USA and Malaysia. It aims to provide marketing recommendations based on specific cultural dimensions to promote internet banking.
   Design/methodology/approach - With four added variables (attitude towards use, perceived credibility, self-efficacy, and anxiety), the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model was used. A questionnaire was developed based on the research model and distributed to 1,050 internet banking users from two countries. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied to 666 valid questionnaires to test the research hypotheses.
   Findings - Results show that due to cultural differences, global consumers have different internet banking adoption patterns. Consumers in the USA have a more positive attitude towards use. Moreover, perceived credibility plays an important role in influencing internet banking in the USA. On the other hand, performance expectancy has a direct influence on internet banking adoption in Malaysia. Cultural dimensions such as individualism/collectivism, power distance, uncertainty avoidance, monochronic/polychromic, and high context/low context were used to explain these findings. Based on the findings, marketing recommendations that help promote internet banking in both countries were provided.
   Originality/value - This is the one of the pioneer studies that highlights the importance of cultural differences in promoting internet banking services. It contributes to the literature by developing and testing a comprehensive research model using SEM.

AB  - Consumers' awareness of green products has increased in the last few years, but studies show that the demand for green products has been stagnant. The purpose of this study is to explore the roles of consumers' perceived readiness to be green and subsequently, how readiness to be green affects consumers' purchase intention towards green products in an emerging market, Indonesia. A total of 916 survey responses were collected in three universities, two major shopping malls and several housing areas in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The findings reveal that consumers' attitude (ATT), subjective norm, perceived behavioural control (PBC), pro-environmental self-identity (PEI), ethical obligation and consumers' readiness to be green are the determinants of intention to purchase green products. Consumers' readiness to be green mediates the effects of ATT, PBC, PEI and perceived sense of responsibility on purchase intention. The study provides further insights into the discrepancy between professed positive attitudes towards the environment and the slow uptake of green behaviour in an emerging market.

AB  - COVID-19 and subsequent social distancing guidelines have changed many aspects of people's daily lives including the way that they interact within their social environment. Pandemics are inherently social phenomena, and public health measures intended to curtail transmission of COVID-19 (e.g., quarantine and social distancing) have consequences for individuals with anxiety and depression. Using qualitative methods, respondents with previously diagnosed anxiety or depression identified ways in which COVID-19 affected their symptoms at multiple levels of the social ecological model (SEM). Key themes reported were organized following the SEM. Emergent themes at the individual level are isolation/loneliness, fear of contracting COVID-19, and uncertainty about the future. Themes at the interpersonal level are: fears of family contracting COVID-19, separation from family members, and domestic relationships. Themes at the level of community and societal stressors are: employment, community and societal systems, media, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings demonstrate the ways that mental health, physical health/safety, and social environments are interrelated in the experience of COVID-19 for individuals diagnosed with anxiety or depression. These findings make a significant contribution to the literature as this is the first article to document mental health stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic among individuals with diagnosed anxiety and depressive disorders.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of attitude toward leisure and satisfaction with leisure policy on satisfaction with leisure activities and level of happiness in Korean caregivers for young children. Data were collected from 864 participants (397 men and 467 women) using the 2018 National Leisure Activity Survey (NLAS). The results showed that there were no significant differences between male and female caregivers in terms of satisfaction with leisure policy, satisfaction with leisure activities, and level of happiness. Women had more positive attitudes toward leisure. Satisfaction with leisure activities mediated the relationship between attitude toward leisure, satisfaction with leisure policy, and level of happiness; there were no significant differences between men and women with regard to the variables. The study suggests that attitude toward leisure and satisfaction with leisure policy promote the happiness of Korean caregivers for young children.

AB  - Poaching rhinos to sell their horns is one of the most pressing threats to wildlife and constitutes an illicit yet extremely profitable business. Employing construal level and reactance theory, two studies examine which marketing campaign is most effective in countries where the crime is actually taking place by distinguishing supply (=poachers in Kenya) and demand (=consumers of Chinese traditional medicine in China). Both studies follow a 2 x 2 between-subject design with an additional control group whereby temporal distance and social distance are manipulated to outline weaknesses of current antipoaching campaigns and identify alternatives that are more effective. Results suggest that economic and identity-related factors can explain consumers (China) and poachers (Kenya) intentions to purchase traditional Chinese medicine with rhino horn or sell rhino horn. In both countries, marketing campaigns featuring temporal distance were superior to close counterparts; yet, the mediating variables differ for each country. Close temporal distance elicits reactance. Interestingly, poachers do not seem to discriminate between close and far social distance. The findings have lifesaving implications for wildlife, profound practical implications for non-governmental organizations, and governmental agencies' additional theoretical contributions.

AB  - Based on the terror management health model (TMHM), we examined the impact of terrorist attacks as reminders of death on implicit alcohol-related attitudes, including the moderating role of conscious death-related thoughts and alcohol-based self-esteem (ABS). With an online experiment (N = 487), we analyzed how thoughts and memories about a recent terrorist attack unconsciously (with a delay task) and consciously (without a delay task) affected implicit alcohol-related attitudes. We found that such thoughts increased the death-thought accessibility. While no main effect of the salience of the terrorist attack on alcohol-related attitudes existed, respondents with low ABS had more positive attitudes, when unconsciously thinking about the attack as compared to the control group. Respondents with high ABS in the delay task had lower alcohol-IAT scores. Overall, this study provides evidence that thoughts about terrorism that can be provoked through media affect alcohol-related attitudes. Such attitudes may cause negative health consequences through health-related decisions.

AB  - The theorization and empirical exploration of contextual effects is a long-standing feature of public opinion and political behavior research. At present, however, there is little to no evidence that citizens actually perceive the local contextual factors theorized to influence their attitudes and behaviors. In this article, we focus on two of the most prevalent contextual factors appearing in theoriesracial/ethnic and economic contextto investigate whether citizens' perceptions of their local ethnic and economic contexts map onto variation in the actual ethnic composition and economic health of these environments. Using national survey data combined with Census data, and focusing on the popular topics of immigration and unemployment, we find that objective measures of the size of the immigrant population and unemployment rate in respondents' county and zip code strongly predict perceived levels of local immigration and assessments of the health of one's local job market. In addition to demonstrating that citizens are receiving the treatment, we show that perceptions of one's context overwhelmingly mediate the effect of these objective contextual factors on relevant economic and immigration attitudes. The results from our analyses provide scholars with unprecedented evidence that a key perceptual process presumed in various contextual theories of political attitudes and behavior is, in fact, valid.

TI  - Covid19 and protest repertoires in the United States: an initial description of limited change
T2  - SOCIAL MOVEMENT STUDIES
LA  - English

KW  - pandemic
KW  - protest
KW  - repertoire
AB  - The Covid19 pandemic did not cause a dramatic change in the dominant protest repertoire in the United States. Street protests and all the associated behaviors such as marching, carrying signs, chanting, and speeches continued to be the major form of activity. Nonetheless, based on media reports and Crowd Counting Consortium data, we observed three important changes. First, protestors' issues of concern shifted to public health and economic policies. Second, some but not all protestors made tactical adjustments by embracing social distancing or shifting to formats that did not require social distancing such as car caravans. Third, medical facilities much more commonly served as a location for demonstrations. Preliminary analysis also leads us to believe that protestors did not use online tools in dramatically new ways but probably did make use of these tools far more frequently. In short, this was probably more of a quantitative growth than a qualitative shift.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading across the globe, and it could take years for society to fully recover. Personal protective equipment (PPE), various hygiene measures, and social distancing have been implemented to reduce "human to human " contact, which is an essential part of outbreak prevention. The pressure of the pandemic combined with decreased communication and social contact have taken a toll on the mental health of many individuals, especially with respect to anxiety and depression. Effective use of robots and technology as a substitute for-or in coordination with-traditional medicine could play a valuable role in reducing psychological distress now more than ever. This paper summarizes the results of a comprehensive review of clinical research on PARO, a therapeutic seal robot, which has been used extensively as a biofeedback medical device and socially assistive robot in the field of mental health. PARO has proven to be an effective and economical non-pharmacological intervention method for both mental and physical well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilization of PARO during these times has provided more data for consideration and has helped in mitigating the negative stigma surrounding using robots in therapeutic settings.</p>

AB  - Background: Cancer patients, being immunocompromised, are at higher risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The current study determines cancer patients' knowledge, attitude, perception, and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Pakistan from 1 April 2020 to 1 May 2020. The study respondents were cancer patients with ages equal to or greater than 18 years. Following a request for participation, the URL for the survey was distributed on numerous channels. Other social media platforms, including WeChat, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Messenger, and LinkedIn, were used to increase cancer patient interaction. The questionnaire comprised five different sections such as: (1) sociodemographic information, (2) knowledge, (3) attitude, (4) perception, and (5) impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients. Descriptive medical statistics such as frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation were used to illustrate the demographic characteristics of the study participants. To compare mean knowledge scores with selected demographic variables, independent sample t-tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used, which are also practical methods in epidemiological, public health and medical research. The cut-off point for statistical significance was set at a p-value of 0.05. Results: More than 300 cancer patients were invited, of which 208 agreed to take part. The response rate was 69.33% (208/300). Gender, marital status, and employment status had a significant association with knowledge scores. Of the total recruited participants, 96% (n = 200) (p < 0.01) knew about COVID-19, and 90% were aware of general symptoms of COVID-19 disease, such as route of transmission and preventive measurements. In total, 94.5% (n = 197) (p < 0.01) were willing to accept isolation if they were infected with COVID-19, and 98% (n = 204) (p < 0.01) had reduced their use of public transportation. More than 90% (n = 188) (p < 0.01) of cancer patients were found to be practicing preventative measures such as using a face mask, keeping social distance, and avoiding handshaking and hugging. Around 94.4% (n = 196) (p < 0.01) of cancer patients had been impacted by, stopped or had changed cancer treatment during this pandemic, resulting in COVID-related anxiety and depression. Conclusion: The included cancer patients exhibited a good level of COVID-19 knowledge, awareness, positive attitude, and perception. Large-scale studies and efforts are needed to raise COVID-19 awareness among less educated and high-risk populations. The present survey indicates that mass-level effective health education initiatives are required for developing countries to improve and reduce the gap between KAP and COVID-19.

AB  - Background: An emerging respiratory disease abbreviated as coronavirus disease 2019 was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan city of China. The virus is zoonotic and tends to be transmitted between animals to humans and humans to humans. The major route of transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 is droplet and close contact. The Ethiopian Ministry of Health has initiated training for health care workers at a different level. Thus, the main objective of this study is to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of health workers in Ethiopia toward coronavirus disease 2019 and its prevention techniques.
   Method: An institution-based multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted in each of eight teaching and referral hospitals. A total of 422 Ethiopian healthcare workers were selected for the assessment of knowledge, attitude, and practice toward coronavirus disease 2019. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. A logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with the attitude and knowledge of healthcare workers toward coronavirus disease 2019 at a significance level of p < 0.05.
   Result: Three hundred ninety-seven healthcare workers participated in the study, with a response rate of 94%. Among these, 88.2% and 94.7% of respondents had good knowledge and positive attitudes, respectively. A respondent with a history of chronic medical illness (odds ratio: 0.193, 95% confidence interval: 0.063-0.593), social media, telecommunication, and television/radio as a source of information were significantly associated with knowledge (odds ratio: 3.4, 95% confidence interval: 1.5-7.4, OR: 4.3, 95% confidence interval: 1.3-14.3 and odds ratio: 3.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.4-7.2). In addition, respondents with a history of chronic medical illness were significantly associated with a negative attitude toward coronavirus disease 2019.
   Conclusion: The knowledge and attitude were good while; the practice was relatively low. Sources of information such as social media, telecommunication, and television/radio were positively associated with healthcare workers' knowledge about coronavirus disease 2019.

KW  - IMPACT
AB  - Environmental education is essential to stem current dramatic biodiversity loss, and childhood is considered as the key period for developing awareness and positive attitudes toward nature. Children are strongly influenced by the media, notably the internet, about biodiversity and conservation issues. However, most media focus on a few iconic, appealing, and usually exotic species. In addition, virtual activities are replacing field experiences. This situation may curb children knowledge and concerns about local biodiversity. Focusing our analyses on local versus exotic species, we examined the level of knowledge and the level of diversity of the animals that French schoolchildren are willing to protect, and whether these perceptions are mainly guided by information available in the internet. For that, we collected and compared two complementary data sets: 1) a questionnaire was administered to schoolchildren to assess their knowledge and consideration to protect animals, 2) an internet content analysis (i.e. Google searching sessions using keywords) was performed to assess which animals are the most often represented. Our results suggest that the knowledge of children and their consideration to protect animal are mainly limited to internet contents, represented by a few exotic and charismatic species. The identification rate of local animals by schoolchildren was meager, suggesting a worrying disconnection from their local environment. Schoolchildren were more prone to protect "virtual'' (unseen, exotic) rather than local animal species. Our results reinforce the message that environmental education must also focus on outdoor activities to develop conservation consciousness and concerns about local biodiversity.

AB  - This study aims to establish correlations between the use of digital devices for literacy activities and the demographic and socio-cultural characteristics of parents, children and the family during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bulgaria. The study includes parents of 172 children aged 2 to 8 who completed online questionnaires related to home learning activities and the use of digital devices by families and children. The findings show that parents have a positive attitude towards engaging in literacy and reading activities through digital devices with their children, but do not support the excessive use of digital devices by children. We found that older children, girls, and children who use digital devices to communicate with family members and friends are more likely to engage in literacy activities through digital devices. Our findings corroborate other recent studies in underscoring the importance of partnership between children and their parents for children's development in today's environment.

AB  - This article discusses results of a survey on the utilization of and attitudes and beliefs towards the use of popular culture among faculty in higher education. A total of 212 faculty members from a mid-sized public regional university provided responses, with the majority indicating that they utilize popular culture in their classroom teaching with some frequency. Overall, the sample exhibited moderately high levels of confidence in their ability to use popular culture effectively, and found popular culture to be both important to incorporate and beneficial for enhancing critical thinking. Significant differences in both frequency of use and attitudes and beliefs were found among teaching disciplines, with those in Humanities and Social Sciences utilizing popular culture more frequently and having more positive attitudes and beliefs towards popular culture than participants in natural sciences and mathematics. A set of guidelines were provided to help advance the use of popular culture in higher education.

AB  - Purpose The research examined factors of academic studies as perceived by Jewish and Arab students in Israel, and changes in their implementation of activities in a multicultural context in the field of education, comparing between undergraduates studying for a BA in education and graduate students for MA in education and attending a course titled "Multiculturalism in the Global Era". Design/methodology/approach The findings are derived from a questionnaire distributed to Arab and Jewish students (N = 434), studying together in the Faculty of Education of one academic college in Israel. In total, 251 of them were graduate students, and 183 who were undergraduates. Findings It was found that insofar as the students from either programme acquired knowledge and tools regarding multiculturalism, they reported (1) more positive attitudes regarding the "Other" group and regarding multiculturalism, (2) implementation of a larger number of activities relating to multiculturalism in the field of education, (3) Arab students performed more activities in multicultural contexts and (4) older students performed a larger number of activities in multicultural contexts. The research findings also indicated a direct relation between participation in the course and activities conducted in the field of education. In addition, students' acquiring of knowledge on multiculturalism mediated the relation between participation in the course and implementation of multicultural activities in the field of education. Originality/value The research stresses the importance of higher education institutions in promoting knowledge and practice of multiculturalism in Israeli society.

AB  - Introduction: The emergence of the new Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a major impact on global health system. This cross-sectional study was designed to appraise the knowledge and attitude of healthcare workers towards COVID-19 and find out their understanding about clinical aspects of the infection.
   Methodology: A total number of 1023 of healthcare workers responded to an online questionnaire and provided their data between February and March, 2020 in Jeddah city, Western province, Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire was distributed to physicians, nurses, pharmacists, technical staff and administrative staff working in clinical settings.
   Results: Results revealed that mean scores for knowledge and attitude were 20.793 2.436 and 4.744 +/- 0.297 respectively. More than 88% of participants displayed positive knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19. Knowledge data showed that social media and the workplace, were the main sources of information for the majority of respondents. Approximately 99.12% of respondents were aware of the viral pandemic, and the causative agent. Statistically significant association was found when compared the demographic characteristics with the mean knowledge while no statistical significance was observed when compared demographic characteristics with the mean attitude score except with marital status.
   Conclusion: This study showed that healthcare workers had sufficient knowledge and positive attitude towards COVID-19. However, hospital staff should be periodically given sufficient training to effectively cope with such outbreaks in the future.

AB  - Background: The general attitude of HIV-positive surgical patients toward research has not been described, and it is uncertain whether interventions aimed at improving general attitudes toward research are required in this group. The aim of this pilot survey was to address the aforementioned paucity in the literature.
   Methods: This was a prospective survey of 39 HIV-positive surgical patients. The 7-item Research Attitudes Questionnaire (RAQ) and a demographic characteristics questionnaire were administered to each study participant. Likert responses for the RAQ were converted into numeric values, and cumulative research attitude scores were computed for each study participant. A descriptive analysis of study participant responses to the RAQ was performed. Statistical associations between demographic characteristics and cumulative research attitude scores were also assessed.
   Results: Depending on the RAQ item, between 74.3% and 95.9% of study participants responded positively toward research. Negative responses ranged between 0.0% and 10.3%, while neutral responses to RAQ items ranged between 2.6% and 23.1%. Female study participants had lower median research attitudes scores when compared with their male counterparts (p = 0.014).
   Conclusion: In general, study participants expressed a positive attitude toward research. The proportion of neutral responses for some RAQ items suggests there are certain aspects of research which require clarification to prospective research participants. Efforts should be made to improve female HIV-positive surgical patients' overall attitude toward research.

AB  - Knowledge of appropriate behavior during an earthquake is crucial for the prevention and mitigation of natural disaster. Several studies confirm that disaster-risk education should be part of the national primary and secondary school curricula. The school plays an important role in developing a positive attitude towards safety as well as in increasing young people's social responsibility. This can especially be achieved by "active educational methods based on real situations". Narrative learning, according to this pedagogical vision, is seen as an educational approach mostly suitable for the development of cognitive abilities and knowledge in action, supporting processes of meaning construction through risk education contexts. In this paper, we present a methodology to design digital storytelling, a "media rich" strategy able to support the learning process in a civil emergency context and an authoring tool for creating Storytelling Complex Learning Objects (SCLOs), as a complex learning resource characterized by an adaptive mechanism that exploits a template-based approach, which is focused on the design of teaching situations suitable for achieving specific learning goals. The integration of this new kind of learning object with an advanced e-learning platform, namely Intelligent Web Teacher (IWT), that allowed us to carry out a full experimentation of the overall learning process, from content creation, to learning path packaging and adaptive delivery. The experimentation results demonstrate the effectiveness of both SCLO and authoring tool from a pedagogical and usability point of view. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Individuals living in long-term residential care homes are often viewed through a negative lens. These residents have increasingly complex care needs, and their functional, communication and cognitive challenges can support conceptualizations of difference and disability perpetuating negative stereotypes of age and dementia. However, engaging in meaningful activities and relationships with older adults, including those with dementia, has been shown to promote positive attitudes. Specifically, intergenerational programming that provides opportunities for meaningful engagement between children and older adults has been shown to support positive emotional experiences through socializing and building relationships. This qualitative study explored the development of relationships between school-aged children and older adults with dementia living in a long-term residential care home. Residents in long-term care homes and children typically have limited opportunities to interact with each other; in this study, participating in an intergenerational dance programme provided an opportunity for meaningful relationships to develop. This paper focuses on the development of the children's attitudes and understandings of their much older dance partners. Seven girls between the ages of seven and nine participated in ballet classes with residents in a long-term care home for one hour each week over a six-month period. All of the residents had a diagnosis of moderate to advanced dementia. Further, all of the residents also had other chronic health issues such as cardiac, respiratory and/or neurological diseases. The children were interviewed at the baseline, three- and six-month intervals. Prior to beginning the dance programme, the children anticipated their dance partners to be unwell and unable. However, by the end of six months, the children described the residents much more positively highlighting their abilities and strengths. Over time, through participating in a structured intergenerational programme, the children's views of disability and difference disappeared as they formed dance partnerships and developed meaningful relationships.

AB  - The natural radiation environment in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) differs significantly in composition and energy from that found on Earth. The space radiation field consists of high energetic protons and heavier ions from Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR), as well as of protons and electrons trapped in the Earth's radiation belts (Van Allen belts). Protons and some heavier particles ejected in occasional Solar Particle Events (SPEs) might in addition contribute to the radiation exposure in LEO. All sources of radiation are modulated by the solar cycle. During solar maximum conditions SPEs occur more frequently with higher particle intensities. Since the radiation exposure in LEO exceeds exposure limits for radiation workers on Earth, the radiation exposure in space has been recognized as a main health concern for humans in space missions from the beginning of the space age on. Monitoring of the radiation environment is therefore an inevitable task in human spaceflight. Since mission profiles are always different and each spacecraft provides different shielding distributions, modifying the radiation environment measurements needs to be done for each mission. The experiments "Dose Distribution within the ISS (DOSIS)'' (2009-2011) and "Dose Distribution within the ISS 3D (DOSIS 3D)'' (2012-onwards) onboard the Columbus Laboratory of the International Space Station (ISS) use a detector suite consisting of two silicon detector telescopes (DOSimetry TELescope = DOSTEL) and passive radiation detector packages (PDP) and are designed for the determination of the temporal and spatial variation of the radiation environment. With the DOSTEL instruments' changes of the radiation composition and the related exposure levels in dependence of the solar cycle, the altitude of the ISS and the influence of attitude changes of the ISS during Space Shuttle dockings inside the Columbus Laboratory have been monitored. The absorbed doses measured at the end of May 2016 reached up to 286 mu Gy/day with dose equivalent values of 647 mu Sv/day.

AB  - Background Older adults are at a higher risk from COVID-19. Individual preventive behaviors including frequent hand washing, mask wearing, and social distancing play important roles in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 in the community. This study aimed to identify the determinants of three preventive behaviors of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic by using an Integrated Social Cognition Model. Methods Using a prospective study design, 516 Chinese older adults from Hubei province of China (mean age = 67.55 years, SD = 6.60, 57.9% females) completed two online questionnaire surveys. The demographics, social cognition constructs (motivational self-efficacy, risk perception, attitude, subjective norm, health knowledge, intention, volitional self-efficacy, planning, action control) and three preventive behaviors were measured during the first-wave online survey from 18 May 2020 to 7 June 2020. One month later, three preventive behaviors were measured again during the second-wave online survey. Data were analyzed by structural equation modelling. Results Models showed attitude, motivational self-efficacy and subjective norm were consistent predictors of intention, motivational self-efficacy was a consistent predictor of volitional self-efficacy, planning and volitional self-efficacy were consistent predictors of action control, and health knowledge was a consistent predictor of behaviors across all three preventive behaviors. In addition, mediating relationships were found in the model of hand washing behavior. In particular, planning (beta = .109, p = .042) and action control (beta = .056, p = .047) mediated between volitional self-efficacy and hand washing respectively. Action control also mediated between planning and hand washing (beta = .087, p = .044). Moreover, the inclusion of past behaviors in three models attenuated most of the structural relations. Conclusions The current study's findings basically supported the Integrated Social Cognition Model and identified key modifiable determinants of preventive behaviors. Based on this model, future interventions aiming to promote COVID-19 preventive behaviors among older adults are warranted.

AB  - This study explored how 26 Chinese EFL teachers perceived community-based, technology-supported professional development practices. The methods of data collection in this study blend quantitative and qualitative techniques: 1) questionnaire survey of teachers' satisfaction about community-based technology-supported professional development practices; 2) online teacher discussion postings; 3) teacher self-reflection journals; and 4) semi-structured interviews. Data analysis revealed a generally positive attitude and empowering feelings in these Chinese EFL teachers who viewed technology-facilitated practices as affording constructive functions for their professional development. Results also revealed a range of factors that apparently mediated/limited EFL teachers' participation in the professional development activities. This study thus contributes to the understanding of the reality in relation to actual utilization of technological resources in second-language teacher development in the context of a developing country such as China.

AB  - This paper intends to analyze how Afro-Brazilian religious minorities (like Candomble and Umbanda) are responding to the Covid-19 crisis in Brazil both at a religious and political level. Drawing a comparison between the reactions of Neo-Pentecostal churches and Afro-Brazilian religions, we will describe how the pandemic outbreak and the social distancing measures allowed Afro-religious practitioners to occupy new online spaces. In doing so, these religions found new modalities of practising rituals and transmitting sacred knowledge in the digital world. Despite the fundamental importance of bodily engagement in these religious expressions, Candomble and Umbanda practitioners are increasing their presence online through producing different types of pedagogical, educational and ritual contents. While on the one hand, this new content aims at promoting social distancing and sanitary precautionary measures, on the other hand, it involves a restructuring of the dynamics of legitimation and power that are present in Afro-religious social structures. We will analyze these changing dynamics as consequences of the "crisis of the body" that resulted from the lockdown measures.

AB  - Background A growing number of health care organizations are implementing a system of electronic patient records (EPR). This implies a change in work routines for nursing staff, but it could also be regarded as an opportunity to improve the quality of care.
   Objective The objective of this paper is to obtain more insight into the usefulness of EPR as perceived by nursing staff and to clarify the determinants of nursing staffs acceptance of EPR Determinants were tested using an extended version of the Technology Acceptance Model
   Design Nursing staff members (NAs and RNs) completed a survey questionnaire about the use of EPR in health care, and their experiences, perceptions and attitudes regarding EPR
   Settings All nursing staff members were working in Dutch hospitals, psychiatric organizations, care organizations for mentally retarded people, home care organizations, nursing homes or homes for the elderly
   Participants The study population is a nationally representative Dutch research sample, further referred to as the Nursing Staff Panel The Panel consists of a permanent group of Nursing Assistants (NAs) and Registered Nurses (RNs), who are prepared to fill in a postal questionnaire twice a year on average In January 2009, 685 participants completed the questionnaire
   Results Nursing staff members associate EPR with improved care, especially qualitatively better and safer care They also expect an increase in costs of care, while anticipating only a relatively small rise in the number of patients that can be cared for. In general, the effects of EPR on the work circumstances of nursing staff are expected to be negative. Job-related characteristics were found to be determinants of attitudes towards using EPR A relatively positive attitude towards EPR was found in three categories of nursing staff in particular, e staff working at least 3011 per week, staff already using EPR and staff working in hospitals Nursing staff in management positions also tend to have a more positive attitude When the Technology Acceptance Model was tested, attitudes towards EPR were primarily associated with job-related characteristics and perceived usefulness with respect to quality of care
   Conclusions The implementation strategies for EPR need to take account of the job characteristics of the intended future users If implementation is to be successful, it is important that the users understand the beneficial effects of EPR on the quality of care (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved

AB  - Many studies have illustrated how digital media can facilitate political criticisms and protests, but recent scholarship has noted the ability of authoritarian states to control the Internet and undermine its oppositional character. This study focuses on the "hybrid regime" of Hong Kong, where the progovernment forces have tried to counteract the formation of an online counterpublic sphere by setting up numerous online outposts since the mid-2010s. It examines how exposure to progovernment online media content is related to political attitudes. In addition to a direct relationship, drawing on inoculation theory, this article contends that progovernment online media may also consolidate support for the government by neutralizing the influence of online alternative media. Survey data analysis shows that exposure to progovernment online media content indeed related to more conservative views, and the connection between online alternative media use and prodemocracy attitudes was weaker among older citizens regularly exposed to progovernment online media.

AB  - The aim of the present study (n = 113) was to examine how (objective and subjective) information on peers' preparation, confidence, and past performance can support students in answering correctly in audience response systems (aka clickers). The result analysis shows that in the "challenging" questions, in which answers diverged, students who received additional information about peers' self-reported preparation and/or confidence outperformed students who were only given the objective percentage with or without past performance feedback. In addition, students expressed a positive attitude towards the activity, commenting its usefulness in better understanding course material and identifying misconceptions.

AB  - Should we ask children to be more healthy or less unhealthy? Drawing from both prospect and psycholinguistic theory, we manipulate the framing (gain versus loss) and linguistic polarity (affirmation versus negation) of a child-directed health message. Results from two experiments demonstrate that, in a behavioral adoption context, a message employing gain framing or affirmation leads to more positive attitudes and greater intention to adopt the target behavior; while in a behavioral cessation context, messages utilizing loss framing or negation are most effective. Results also indicate a developmental-based boundary for message polarity, with effects not observed for younger children.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic increases the complexity of planning for hurricanes as social distancing is in direct conflict with human mobility and congregation. COVID-19 presents not only urgent challenges for this hurricane season due to the likeliness of continued or heightened COVID-19 threat, but also challenges with the next hurricane season with additional waves of the pandemic. There is severe urgency to understand the impact of COVID-19 risk perceptions and the extent people are willing to risk their lives by sheltering in place rather than evacuating during severe hurricanes. In June 2020, a survey (in both English and Spanish) of 40 questions was disseminated through regional planning councils, emergency management, and the media to Florida residents. A total of 7,072 people responded from over 50 counties. Most data obtained were ordinal or categorical in nature, encouraging usage of nonparametric analysis and chi-square tests. Almost half the respondents view themselves as vulnerable to COVID-19 due to preexisting health conditions, and 74.3% of individuals viewed the risk of being in a shelter during the COVID-19 pandemic as more dangerous than enduring hurricane hazards. Additionally, there was a significant number of individuals who would choose to not utilize a public shelter during COVID-19 when they would have previously. Officials can use the results of this study regarding how household evacuation plans change with social distancing to better inform strategies of shelter preparedness and COVID-19 risk mitigation to minimize risk to those in harm's way of storm surge and other hurricane effects during a mandatory evacuation order.

AB  - Background Moving palliative care from a solely clinical focus to a more population based and community orientated approach is the hallmark of a much advocated public health approach to palliative care. Young adults are a vital cohort of the public, yet their understanding of palliative care has not been investigated. This study aimed to explore young adults' understanding of palliative care and identify factors that influence their engagement. Methods A purposive sample of young adults (n = 24) aged 18-29 years were recruited from one UK University. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken face to face or via telephone or Skype between November 2017 and February 2018. Thematic analysis using a framework approach and underpinned by a socioecological perspective was used to analyse the interviews. Results Three thematic categories were identified relating to intrapersonal and interpersonal influences, cultural and social influences and organisational and public policy influences. Palliative care was understood as supportive comfort care, delivered in the absence of cure, associated with the end of life and specifically focused on death and dying. Negative attitudes related to the context of care, which represented a static and hopeless situation. Whilst some reported positive attitudes, potential engagement was seen to be governed by a lack of knowledge and protective cultural norms. In terms of demonstrating readiness to engage with palliative care, participants requested clear information and suggested a normalising of palliative care through the education system. Conclusion Young adults in this study were ready to find out more about palliative care and identified social media as a platform upon which to engage this population. However, their perception of a society that views palliative care as a subject for those directly affected, creates a barrier to engagement. This study identified the ingredients of a public health message and mediums for disseminating the message. However, findings also suggest that a cultural shift is required to recognise the potential of engaging young adults in health issues that cross the life span, empowering them not only as individuals but as vital members of community and society.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to assess household preparedness for emergency events and its determinants in China.
   Design A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted on 3541 households in China in 2015.
   Participants Households were selected using a stratified cluster sampling strategy, representing central, eastern, western and southern regions of China. The designed questionnaires were administered through face-to-face interviews.
   Outcome measures Household emergency preparedness was measured with 14 indicators, tapping into the supply of nine emergency necessities (food and water, extra batteries, battery-powered radio, battery-operated torch, first-aid kit, gas mask, fire extinguisher, escape ropes, whistle), coverage of accident insurance, knowledge of local emergency response systems (emergency numbers, exit routes and shelters) and availability of a household evacuation plan. If an individual acted on 9 of the 14 indicators, they were deemed well prepared. Logistic regression models were established to identify predictors of well preparedness based on 3541 returned questionnaires containing no missing values.
   Results Only 9.9% of households were well prepared for emergencies: 53.6% did not know what to do and 31.6% did not want to think about it. A higher level of preparedness was found in the respondents who have attained higher education (adjusted OR=0.826 compared with the higher level), participated in emergency training activities (adjusted OR=2.299), had better emergency knowledge (adjusted OR=2.043), reported less fate-submissiveness (adjusted OR=1.385) and more self-reliance (adjusted OR=1.349), prior exposure to emergency events (adjusted OR=1.280) and held more positive attitudes towards preparedness (adjusted OR=1.286).
   Conclusion Household preparedness for emergency events is poor in China. Lack of motivation, negative attitude to preparedness and knowledge shortfall are major but remediable barriers for household preparedness.

AB  - To control COVID-19, several strategies were proposed in Iran since the start of the outbreak. The number of reported infected people and its consequent death toll herald relative inadequacies in the quality and extent of the measures in curbing the COVID-19 transmission cycle. This study was conducted to investigate knowledge, attitude, precautionary practices and degree of fear related to COVID-19 in a sample of Iranian population. This study was conducted among 457 residents of Kurdistan Province, Iran, through social networks and social media (WhatsApp and Telegram). Knowledge, attitude and practice and fear of COVID-19 were collected using valid tools. Multiple logistic regression and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with binary outcome attitudes, practices and continuous variables knowledge and fear of COVID-19, respectively. The mean (SD) age of participants was 37.86 (10.42); of them, 252 (55.1%) were men, and more than two-thirds were married (74.8%). About 10% of the respondents were in believed that COVID-19 could create a type of social stigma. Level of knowledge about COVID-19 in 77.8% of the study attendees was acceptable, and 352 of them (70%) were confident that the virus would eventually be successfully controlled in the world, but only 252 of the attendants (50%) had confidence about successful control of COVID-19 in Iran. Applying multiple logistic regression, knowledge (OR: 1.18, p = 0.028) and fear (OR: 1.04, p = 0.028) of COVID-19 were associated with positive attitude towards controllability of COVID-19. Gender (OR: 1.96, p = 0.012), sources of information (OR: 5.00, p = 0.005) and knowledge (OR: 1.27, p = 0.006) were also indicated association with taking precautionary practices to control COVID-19. Further studies are recommended to boost level of knowledge, strengthen positive attitude and ameliorate behavioural pattern for successful control of COVID-19 in Iran.

AB  - Introduction: Studies suggest that exposure to televised electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) advertising contributes to the recent increase in e-cigarette use among youth. This study examines the relationship between perceptions of e-cigarette advertisements and attitudes toward and intentions to use e-cigarettes among youth who had never used e-cigarettes.
   Methods: In May 2014, we conducted an online survey of 5020 youth aged 13 to 17. Participants were randomly assigned to answer questions about their attitudes toward and intentions to use e-cigarettes before or after viewing e-cigarette advertisements. Perceived effectiveness (PE) of advertisements was measured after ad exposure. Ordinary least squares models were used to assess the relationship between PE and study outcomes.
   Results: Among never e-cigarette users, greater PE was associated with more positive attitudes toward e-cigarettes (b = 0.74, P < .001) and intentions to use e-cigarettes (b = 0.16, P < .001). Findings suggest that PE is predictive of outcomes controlling for study condition, youth demographics, and media use variables.
   Conclusions: After ad exposure, youth who have never used e-cigarettes previously perceive e-cigarettes as cooler, more fun, healthier, and more enjoyable. Youth who thought the ads were more effective were more likely to have a positive attitude toward e-cigarettes and greater intention to try e-cigarettes in the future. Restricting televised e-cigarette advertising may reduce e-cigarette initiation among youth.
   Implications: Previous studies demonstrate that, among adults, PE is antecedent to actual ad effectiveness across a range of behaviors. To our knowledge, this is the first study to document the relationship between PE and advertising effectiveness among youth. It provides evidence that PE may be a useful tool to quantify the potential influence of advertising on youth-advertising that, in this case, is designed to market a consumer good that may be harmful to youth but that may also be used to develop public health campaigns.

AB  - Electronic mental health services (eMHSs) offer additional options for the dissemination of psychological interventions for university students. Still, many university students are reluctant to use eMHSs. Narrative messages may help increase the awareness and acceptance of quality-approved programs. However, little is known about the usefulness of narrative messages to improve attitudes towards eMHSs. In this experiment, we thus aimed to explore in how far different ways of targeting information to students affect their attitudes towards eMHSs for stress prevention and therapy, and to identify potential determinants of attitude change. N = 451 students (Mean = 32.6 years, SD = 10.2, 75% female, 7% with eMHS experience) were randomly assigned to one of four study arms involving information designed to induce different levels of perceived similarity. While the active control condition only received general information (arm 1, "information only", n = 116), the other experimental arms were additionally exposed to testimonials on specific eMHSs either addressing an unspecified audience (arm 2, n = 112), employees (arm 3, n = 115) or working university students (arm 4, n = 108). Two-way ANOVA revealed no impact of information on the alteration of attitudes towards eMHSs for stress coping (d = 0.20). Only a small effect of target-group specific testimonials on attitudes towards online therapies was identified at post-intervention (d = 0.29). Regression analyses demonstrated significant influences of source credibility and perceived similarity on attitudes for preventative eMHSs (p(s)<0.01), as well as a partial mediation effect of perceived similarity in favor of testimonials targeted to students (95% CI [0.22, 0.50]). Overall, this study indicated no meaningful impact of information on attitudes and limited evidence for benefits of tailored narrative messages. Since attitudes were already positive at baseline, further research with a representative student sample mimicking real-world decision scenarios is needed to gain an in-depth understanding of acceptance-facilitating message features that may contribute to promote the adoption of evidence-based eMHSs.

AB  - Two experimental studies in Poland examined how perceived and manipulated realism of comedic violence may influence consumer responses to brands. Disposition to laughter, measured by katagelasticism (the joy of laughing at others), gelotophilia (the joy of being laughed at), and gelotophobia (the fear of being laughed at), was included as a potentially important factor in driving individual responsiveness to humorous messages. The results reveal that highly violent humor-compared with less violent humor-lowered perceptions of realism and produced negative brand attitudes. Manipulated realism led to less positive attitudes than manipulated unrealism in a high comedic violence condition but had no effect on brand evaluations when comedic violence was low. In both studies, the effects of realism on brand attitudes grew with increasing levels of katagelasticism and gelotophilia.

AB  - What is the relationship between party polarization, media fragmentation, and partisan-ideological sorting? The growth and availability of partisan media-afforded through the expansion of cable, satellite, and Internet penetration-is often linked to the consistency and extremity of individuals' political attitudes and partisan identities. At the same time, the literature on mass audiences and media choice suggests that the effects of choice and partisan media should be differential according to levels of political interest. This debate has yet to fully articulate a role for elite party polarization, which has been identified as a primary cue to facilitate mass partisanship and sorting. Synthesizing these bodies of scholarship, we utilize a variety of data to assess the influence of elite polarization, media fragmentation, and political interest on partisan-ideological sorting. We find that sorting is consistently connected to perceptions of polarization and qualified evidence that media fragmentation is related to partisan-ideological sorting. The expansion of cable and satellite programming is positively related to sorting, but this effect is isolated to individuals highly interested in news and politics.

AB  - A considerable number of studies have investigated the influence of new media on political attitudes and behaviors. However, much of this research focuses on young people, ignoring other age cohorts, particularly Baby Boomers (born between 1946 and 1964). To fill this gap, this research examines the influence of attention to specific forms of traditional and online media on Baby Boomers' online and offline political participation during the fall 2012 U.S. presidential campaign. Drawing on a Baby Boomer survey panel, responses were collected during the 2012 general election to analyze the empirical relationship between attention to traditional and online media sources and political participation. Data analyses reveal that Boomers' attention to traditional media sources, particularly television, did not increase their offline and online political participation. Instead, various forms of offline and online participation were consistently heightened by Boomers' attention to presidential candidate websites. In addition, attention to Facebook for campaign information was positively linked to online engagement. Boomers' attention to blogs, Twitter, and YouTube were associated with only certain types of online and offline activities.

AB  - Given the rapidly growing population of Muslims in Western societies, it is imperative to develop a better understanding of the mental health needs and concerns of this community. Muslim religious beliefs have an impact on the mental health of individuals, families and communities. The lack of understanding of the interplay between religious influences on health or sickness behaviors can have a significant effect upon the delivery of nursing practice. The Muslim community is experiencing social exclusion (social exclusion correlates with mental health problems) related to their cultural and religious identity. In addition, the emergence of radical extremism and the resulting media coverage have magnified this problem. Misunderstanding the worldview of the patient can lead to ethical dilemmas, practice problems, and problems in communication. Often, Muslim individuals are stigmatized and families are rejected and isolated for their association with mental health problems, addiction and suicide. There are indicators that Muslims experience mental ill health, but that they either are unidentified by mainstream mental health services or present late to the services. The aims of the paper are to examine the religious and cultural influences on mental health beliefs of Muslims, and provide an understanding of mental health problems, and its implications in counseling and spiritual interventions.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to investigate if different types of negative electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) have various negative effects on the attitude of the consumer toward a product (Laptop) and whether this newfound attitude remains unaffected by the subsequent influence of positive eWOM. Design/methodology/approach A quantitative study in Germany was conducted. In the two-part experimental setting, first, a factorial repeated-measures between-subjects design was used in which the types of negative eWOM have been manipulated. The second part is characterized by a mixed between-within subjects design to test the durability of attitudinal changes. Findings The results demonstrate that destructive and ethical eWOM only provoke a small decline in consumer attitude compared to functional product criticism. Furthermore, the examination shows that renewed positive eWOM can improve the attitude, whereas ethical criticism is the most difficult to correct. Research limitations/implications The study views negative eWOM differentiated. Researchers could adopt this approach by analyzing online communication more precisely. Ambivalent relationships between negative eWOM and their outcomes can be explained. Practical implications The findings lessen the fear of permanent loss of brand reputation caused by negative reviews. The harmful effects on the attitude can be compensated through targeted marketing management actions. The study shows which content companies need to focus on. Originality/value Previous literature has predominantly overlooked the complex nature of negative eWOM. Therefore, the study provides first empirical results about the divergent effect of different content types of negative eWOM on consumer attitude toward a product. Additionally, the durability of consumer negativity could be measured over time.

AB  - This study adopted a two (author: algorithm or journalist) by two (notification of author: real or inverse) between subject design to investigate how the public and journalists perceive the quality of algorithms written articles compared with human journalist's work. Findings showed that both the public and journalists' evaluations were varied by the manipulation of author notification. That is, the public gave higher scores to the algorithm's work when it was notified as the real author, but they gave lower scores to the algorithm's work when the author was notified as a journalist. It confirmed the public's negative attitude toward journalists' credibility and craving for new information and communication technology (ICT) products/services in Korea. Based on journalists' resistance to change and innovation and the theory of prejudice, it was expected that journalists would be favorable to another journalist's work and unfavorable to an algorithm's work. However, contrary to the hypothetical expectation, journalists also gave higher scores to an algorithm's work and lower scores to a journalist's work. Implications relating to the intrusion of algorithm-written articles into journalism were discussed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak has recently reached the status of a global pandemic. People should abide by governmental rules to avoid spreading contagion. These rules could be associated with the concept of "social distancing", namely avoiding contact with others. In such an unprecedented situation, social gathering and display of affection should be considered potentially harmful, while isolation is deemed altruistic. The distinction between prosocial and antisocial behavior is suddenly ambiguous, and research is needed to understand citizens' behavior during the pandemic, in order to adapt public health communication to multiple kinds of recipients. 465 participants filled in an online questionnaire on their experience and behavior during the first weeks of the quarantine, and on antisocial personality (Dark Triad Dirty Dozen). Results showed that machiavellianism and psychopathy are negatively correlated with adoption of healthy behaviors and positively associated with the tendency to continue living one's own life "as nothing happened". Also, sex differences relates to healthy or antisocial behaviors, significantly mediated by machiavellianism. It is possible that non-conforming to recommendations is not influenced by aggression, but by individuals persevering in their activities independently of the quarantine, consistently with machiavellianism. Discussion deals with suggestions for effective communication of good practices in the pandemic.

AB  - Background: While some data on net durability have been accumulating in recent years, including formative qualitative research on attitudes towards net care and repair, no data are available on how the durability of a net is influenced by behaviour of net maintenance, care and repair, and whether behavioural change interventions (BCC) could substantially impact on the average useful life of the net.
   Methods: The study used an intervention-control design with before-after assessment through repeated cross-sectional household surveys with two-stage cluster sampling following Nasarawa State's December 2010 mass campaign. All campaign nets were 100-denier polyester, long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN). Baseline, midline, and endline surveys occurred at one-year intervals, in March 2012, March 2013, and April 2014, respectively. Outcome measures were the proportion of confirmed campaign nets with observed repairs, and the proportion in serviceable condition, measured with proportionate hole index (pHI) and according to WHO guidelines.
   Results: For all respondents, exposure to BCC messages was strongly correlated with increased positive attitude towards care and repair, and increases in attitude were positively correlated with observed net repairs, and with the proportion of nets in serviceable condition. In a multivariate regression model, positive care and repair attitude (OR 6.17 p = 0.001) and level of exposure (1 source: OR 4.00 p = 0.000; 3 sources: OR 9.34 p = 0.000) remained the most significant predictors of net condition, controlling for background and environmental factors. Nets that were tied up had 2.70 higher odds of being in serviceable condition (p = 0.001), while repairs made to nets were not sufficient to improve their pHI category. Estimated median net lifespan was approximately one full year longer for nets in households with a positive compared to a negative attitude.
   Conclusion: Exposure to multiple channels of a comprehensive BCC intervention was associated with improved attitude scores, and with improved net condition at endline. It is possible for BCC interventions to change both attitudes and behaviours, and to have an important effect on overall median net lifespan. Care and repair messages are easily incorporated into existing malaria BCC platforms, and will help contribute to improved net condition, providing, in principle, more protection from malaria.

AB  - The influence of partisan identification infiltrates all aspects of a democracy. This study employs an innovative design to explore the presidential debate-viewing experience among young citizens. Data were collected from across the United States for all three 2016 presidential debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump using pretest/posttest surveys and debate viewers' Twitter posts. Examining Twitter expression as a form of political elaboration, the study employs a social identity theoretical perspective to better understand the process through which viewers form political attitudes. Applying the theory of identity-motivated elaboration (TIME) to presidential debates, the current research illuminates how partisan social identification changes the way viewers think about political issues and, resultantly, evaluate candidates and form political opinions. A strong partisan social identification results in greater identity-consistent elaboration and Twitter expression throughout one's presidential debate viewing, which results in more biased candidate image evaluations and, subsequently, stronger preference for the in-party candidate.

AB  - The intricate connection between nation branding efforts and the emotions they evoke has been inadequately addressed in existing branding and international relations literature. I propose a heuristic account that theorizes this relationship. By tracing the branding efforts made by China and the de-branding efforts made by Shen Yun Performing Arts (a troupe established by Falun Gong practitioners), I argue that these authentic Chinese cultural presentations elicit certain emotions. The emotional works are different for Chinese domestic audiences and for international audiences. I propose a duplex model to account for the emotional processes in these two groups of audiences. Four operating emotionspride, guilt, admiration, and angersolidify into various political attitudes toward China. Finally, I discuss the contributions of this duplex model and its further complications.

AB  - In this paper we propose a computational approach that applies data mining techniques to analyze the citizen participation recorded in an online digital platform. Differently to previous work, the approach exploits external knowledge extracted from Open Government Data for processing the citizens' proposals and debates of the platform, enabling to characterize targeted issues and problems, and analyze the levels of discussion, support and controversy raised by the proposals. As a result of our analysis, we derive a number of insights and conclusions of interest and value for both citizens and government stakeholders in decision and policy making tasks. Among others, we show that proposals targeting issues that affect large majorities tend to be supported by citizens and ultimately implemented by the city council, but leave aside other very important issues affecting minority groups. Our study reveals that most controversial, likely relevant, problems do not always receive sufficient attention in e-participation. Moreover, it identifies several types of controversy, related to ideological and socioeconomic factors and political attitudes.

AB  - Research question:In this study we examine whether knowledge management (KM), along with innovation concepts (attitude toward innovation, open innovation, and innovativeness), evokes direct and indirect influences on organizational performance of nonprofit sports clubs. Research methods:A total of 266 valid questionnaires were collected online from board members of nonprofit sports clubs in Iran. Structural equation modeling was used to investigate the relationships between variables. Results and findings:The results indicate that KM has a positive effect on organizational performance via two different sequential mediators: attitude toward innovation and innovativeness, and open innovation and innovativeness. KM has a direct positive effect on sport clubs' innovativeness and organizational performance. Implications:Nonprofit sports clubs should take advantage of promoting KM processes such as facilitating the development and sharing of new knowledge through relying on internal and external knowledge sources. By doing so, sports clubs can enhance capabilities to exploit external knowledge and foster a positive attitude towards newness and innovation which can help them to innovate more and perform better. The study provides theoretical and managerial implications that help sports clubs innovate and increase multiple aspects of their organizational performance.

AB  - The study aimed to assess the impact of awareness of citizens and residents in Saudi Arabia toward the home isolation and social distancing during lockdown that might decrease the outbreak of COVID-19, to measure the importance of social behavior to maintain the constant decline of COVID-19 cases and to determine if there is a difference in the level of awareness and behavior between citizens and residents in Saudi Arabia toward the governmental measures during the pandemic. We have adopted a cross-sectional survey design to investigate the impact of Saudi lockdown on blockade COVID-19 by using an anonymous online questionnaire. The targeted population of the study was Saudi citizens and non-Saudi residents of different ages. The collected data were entered into Microsoft Excel (version 2011) and analyzed by using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 23. The Chi-square test with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was used to examine significant associations between the socio-demographic characteristic of participants, their awareness, and their behavior towards the COVOD-19 pandemic. AP value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The total number of the current study participants was 1168. The majority (70.50%) were married males with children (73.50%). Three-quarters of the participants were equally distributed between the age groups of 30-39, 40-49, and 50-59 years old. Almost all (90.90%) of the participants have received higher education, 73.60% living in the central region, and in large and crowded cities (75.30%). More than half (58.50%) of the Saudi respondents know about the coronavirus from media sources, while for the non-Saudis, 54.50% are well informed regarding the virus. The results of the current study revealed that the majority of the population in the country believe in home isolation and social distancing for the COVID-19 blockade. Additionally, they also consider non-compliance to these measures as one the main factor for the disease outbreak. Most of the participants were committed to home isolation, social distancing, and personal protective measures including wearing masks, gloves, and avoiding face contact. (C) 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide an understanding of the country-of-origin (COO) effect on overseas distributors' behaviour in international marketing channels. Integrating the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and the concepts of country-induced biases, the current study develops an empirically testable model that explains and predicts overseas distributors' behaviour in international marketing channels.
   Design/methodology/approach - Hypotheses were tested using primary data stemmed from a survey of channel relationships between exporters and their overseas distributors. Data were collected from 103 distributors in the USA.
   Findings - Empirical evidence shows that attitude towards foreign brands, social valuation of the origin of brands, and perceived behavioural control affect overseas distributors' intention to place foreign brands. In addition, country-induced bias factors - buyer animosity and country-related affect to the origin of manufacture - are considered to be the antecedents of attitude towards foreign brands.
   Research limitations/implications - Because this study adopted a cross-sectional design, the limitations of this method can be applied to the study. In addition, because of the research context, the results of the present research may lack generalizability. This manuscript, however, integrated the TPB and the concepts of country-induced biases and addressed the calls for research on the COO effects on overseas distributors' decision in international marketing channels.
   Practical implications - The manuscript suggests that to build positive attitudes towards foreign brands, a firm should focus on promotions through various media in international markets to lower animosity and the perceived risk to the origin of manufacture. In addition, firms with foreign brands need to identify and target a segment that feels comfortable about spending their resources on those brands. Finally, international marketers should focus on creating positive attitudes towards foreign brand goods and proper pricing strategies.
   Originality/value - This manuscript fills the knowledge gap of the COO effect on organizational buyer behaviour in international marketing channels.

AB  - Introduction: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is not always executed in compliance with contemporary guidelines and the quality of CPR may differ among hospitals within the same country or among categories of healthcare providers and medical specialties. The aim of this study was to assess attitudes of cardiology healthcare professionals towards CPR guidelines.
   Methods: An anonymous questionnaire was posted online during 2009. Responders were asked about their age, gender, occupation, and training/experience in CPR. Responders' attitudes towards CPR were assessed using 7 questions regarding the accuracy of their opinions about the automated external defibrillator, public defibrillation programs, CPR performance, and therapeutic hypothermia. A score (0 to 7) was formed by assigning grade 1 to answers that accorded with European Resuscitation Council (ERC) guidelines and grade 0 to all other answers. The reliability analysis for this score yielded a Cronbach's alpha of 0.78.
   Results: There were 544 responders (158 females), median age 34 years (30, 40). Median score was 5 (3, 6). Attending an ERC resuscitation course (beta=0.33, SE beta=0.05, p<0.001), age (beta=-0.15 SE beta= 0.05, p=0.002), involvement in > 10 CPRs /year (beta=0.19, SE beta=0.05, p<0.001), and being a physician (beta=0.17, SE beta=0.05, p=0.001) were all independent predictors of score. Attendance at an ERC course (OR: 2.7 [1.5 to 4.7]), being a physician (OR: 2 [1.3 to 5]) and involvement in > 10 CPRs /year (OR: 1.7 [1.1 to 2.7]) were also independent predictors for attitudes that accorded with contemporary guidelines regarding therapeutic hypothermia.
   Conclusions: Attending an ERC resuscitation course, frequent involvement in CPR attempts, younger age, and being a physician were all independent predictors for more positive attitudes towards the guidelines. These factors, with the exception of age, were also associated with positive attitudes towards the implementation of therapeutic hypothermia.

AB  - Background: Loneliness is a public health problem that is expected to rise during the COVID-19 pandemic, given the widespread policy of quarantine. The literature is unclear whether loneliness during COVID-19 is similar to those of non-pandemic seasons. This study examined the expression of loneliness on Twitter during COVID-19 pandemic, and identified key areas of loneliness across diverse communities. Methods: Twitter was searched for feeds that were:(1) in English; (2) posted from May 1, 2020 to July 1, 2020; (3) posted by individual users (not organisations); and (4) contained the words 'loneliness' and 'COVID-19'. A machine-learning approach (Topic Modeling) identified key topics from the Twitter feeds; Hierarchical Modeling identified overarching themes. Variations in the prevalence of the themes were examined over time and across the number of followers of the Twitter users. Results: 4492 Twitter feeds were included and classified into 3 themes: (1) Community impact of loneliness during COVID-19; (2) Social distancing during COVID-19 and its effects on loneliness; and (3) Mental health effects of loneliness during COVID-19. The 3 themes demonstrated temporal variations. Particularly in Europe, Theme 1 showed a drastic reduction over time, with a corresponding rise in Theme 3. The themes also varied across number of followers. Highly influential users were more likely to talk about Theme 3 and less about Theme 2. Conclusions: The findings reflect close-to-real-time public sentiments on loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic and demonstrated the potential usefulness of social media to keep tabs on evolving mental health issues. It also provides inspiration for potential interventions to address novel problems-such as loneliness-during COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The rapid development of social media tools has increased interest in their pedagogical value. It has been suggested that social media tools such as wikis can promote online collaborative and interactive learning. This study investigated the value of wilds in supporting collaborative group writing quality among secondary school students in Hong Kong. Students from a local secondary school engaged in group writing projects using Pbworks, a popular wild tool. Data were gathered from (1) the revision tracking history, (2) a questionnaire on the perceived pedagogical value of the wild, and (3) group interviews with students. Findings showed that students who made more collaborative revisions on the wild produced higher-quality writing output. In general, students reported a moderately positive attitude towards the pedagogical value of the wild. The findings suggest that wikis promote collaborative writing, but teachers need to adopt pedagogical strategies that would equip students to use wilds. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The number of bilingual voters in the United States is at an all-time high. As a consequence, political candidates and interest groups often engage in persuasive communications in languages other than English; some states translate ballots measures into multiple languages, and disinformation campaigns are conducted using several languages. However, we still know very little about how this multilingual information environment affects voters' political attitudes and behaviors. In this chapter, we make two points. First, we argue that political scientists and communication researchers can use basic insights from psychology to advance our understanding of how bilingual voters make sense of the political world. Second, studying bilingual decision making in the domain of politics can provide psychologists with important theoretical insights into how the information environment interacts with psychological processes to influence behaviors. To best illustrate our arguments, we use examples from three important domains: voting, political persuasion, and the generation and spread of political misinformation.

AB  - Ghosting is the practice of ending a relationship without explaining to the partner and avoiding any communication attempts. Orbiting is identical to ghosting, but the disengager still visibly follows the former partner on social media. Despite the increasing attention that ghosting and orbiting have gained in the popular press, they remain largely unexplored phenomena in scientific inquiry. In this work, we explored the psychological and behavioral reactions to ghosting and orbiting from the victim's perspective, comparing them to the experience of being rejected through direct communication. Participants were randomly assigned to recall one of three conditions (ghosting, orbiting, and rejection), and the reports of 208 young adults were analyzed through qualitative thematic content analysis. The results described different stages of reactions that follow event detection and that are respectively characterized by 1) surprise and confusion, 2) anger, sadness, and guilt, 3) attempts of relational repair, 4) acceptance. The specificities of being a victim of ghosting and orbiting are presented, comparing them with social rejection. The results are discussed in the light of the existing literature on social exclusion, suggesting that ghosting and orbiting can be considered forms of ostracism. Connections between the proposed stage model and traditional relationship dissolution theories are highlighted, and relevant implications for future research and interventions are presented.

AB  - Gender is a key lens through which to understand industrial agricultural production in rural twenty-first century communities. Here, I examine the gendered imaginaries of dairy production that perpetuate the meaning of "farmer" as masculine and white. The expertise of Mexican immigrant workers, and particularly that of women on spousal visas, challenges such assumptions and highlights the role of unremunerated labor in sustaining the industrial food chain. Everyday experiences of gender and race are shaped not only by local-level assumptions but also by federal-level immigration policies and employer recruitment practices that result in a mostly male immigrant agricultural workforce. In this article, I draw on interviews with rural Minnesota community members, as well as local and regional news coverage, to examine how gender and race intersect to marginalize the work and expertise of Mexican immigrants in the rural Midwest. In this case, Mexican immigrant mothers frame their labor as part of a complex calculus of immigration benefits and sacrifices.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Perceptions of how societies should care for the elderly people can differ among countries. This study examines to what extent individuals' value of informal care is shaped by the politico-economic system in which they grew up and if this value adjusts once an individual lives in a different politico-economic system.
   Research Design and Methods: We use data from the German Family Panel and take advantage of the unique setting of the German separation and reunification. Probit models are used to examine the effect of being born in East Germany on individuals' value of informal care relative to employment at different birth cohorts and survey waves (N = 14,093). Average marginal effects are calculated.
   Results: Twenty years after reunification, East Germans who spent their adolescence under communism exhibit a higher value of informal care relative to employment than West Germans who grew up in a western social market economy. Differences in values between East and West Germans do not significantly converge over time.
   Discussion and Implications: Individuals' value of informal care is deeply shaped by the politico-economic system in which they grew up. If immigration policies are introduced to increase the care for elderly people, differences in individuals' cultural perceptions of elderly care should be considered as these will not suddenly adjust.

AB  - The present study explores the effects of product-focused virtual reality (VR) media type (termed virtualgraph) such as still and motion pictures, on product attitudes in terms of user attitudes, and telepresence. Two experiments were conducted. In experiment 1, all 51 participants were shown product images produced by each type of media type, and the users' attitudes and telepresence were measured. Virtualgraph had the highest recorded telepresence and was associated with the most positive attitudes toward the products compared to still pictures and motion pictures. In experiment 2, which was designed to assess the delayed effects, participants were contacted via cellular phone four weeks following experiment 1. The results demonstrated that participants in the virtualgraph group maintained a more stable attitude toward the products over time compared to those in the still picture and motion picture groups.

AB  - From the perspective of communication and media studies, this article explores a comparison between the image of older adults presented on media and online self-representation facilitated by the use of smartphones. The qualitative textual analysis was conducted with a sample (228 posts, from 1 January to 31 December,2019) selected from a representative WeChat Public Account targeting at older adults in China. The results demonstrate that leisure and recreation is the most frequently mentioned topic (58%) with memories of past life receiving the least references (3%). The striking features of popular posts among older people include a highly emotional tone, bright colours and multimedia. Sentiment analyses shows 68.42%, 13.16% and 18.42% of positive, neutral and negative emotions, respectively. A generally positive attitude of self-representation is in a sharp contrast with the stigmatic media image of older adults. The article concludes that the visibility of Chinese older people may help to reduce the stigma surrounding old age in China.

AB  - Despite extensive research on diffusion and adoption of innovations, late adoption of digitized products has received little attention. This study explores the determinants of late adoption of digital innovations and selects five variables: a) attitude toward a technology, b) negative word of mouth about the technology, c) global brand image, d) consumer innovativeness, and e) lead-user profile.The results of a binary logistic regression with late adopter as the target variable show that with exception of negative word of mouth, all the variables have a negative effect on the probability of moving on the adoption scale from late to early adopter. Furthermore, increasing the positive attitude of consumers toward a technology (i.e. reducing consumers' skepticism) could be more effective to accelerate the rate of adoption than projecting the global image of the company. Understanding the determinants of late adoption will allow companies to develop technologies that diffuse faster and will help them to follow NPD, marketing, and sales strategies, which could accelerate the rate of adoption of digital innovations.

AB  - Objective: To research the relationship between the initial attitude of hospice patients towards hospice care and different patient characteristics.
   Design: Retrospective chart review.
   Participants: 433 consecutive patients with the determined attitude towards hospice care, in the first Croatian hospice, the Marija K. Kozulic from March 2013 to March 2016.
   Methods: We evaluated the relationship between patient attitude towards hospice care and characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, level of education, the presence of cancer, performance status, initial and final opioid dose, the use of anxiolytics and antipsychotics, fluid intakes, participation in physiotherapy, discharge status and survival in hospice.
   Results: Patients were divided into four different groups based on their attitude towards hospice care: acceptance, rejection or anger, depression, bargaining or adapting, and uninformed or partially informed. Our research shows that the majority of patients (69%) has a positive attitude towards hospice. There were no significant differences regarding age, gender, marital status, as well as survival and discharge status between the groups. However, patients exhibiting depression, bargaining or adapting had significantly higher opioid doses in therapy (on average, 145.8 mg OME/day), and the highest elevation of opioid doses during their stay (on average, 52 mg OME/day) compared to other groups.
   Conclusion: Most patients have a positive attitude towards hospice care. However, the differences in attitude might not influence the length of survival or discharge percentage. However, patients exhibiting depression, bargaining or adapting might be in risk of over-treatment with opioids and could potentially gain significant benefits from the addition of anti-depressants, or sessions with a psychologist.

AB  - Introduction: Coronaviral disease-19 is the global challenge for medical fraternity and public health sector. Need of social distancing has compelled physicians and surgeons to continue medical education through virtual mode like webinar. Objective: To study the perceptions, practice and preferences of medical residents and professionals about webinar-based teaching. Methods: An internet-based google-sheet questionnaire was circulated via email and social media for opining different facts about webinar-based teaching. Responses were analysed further to find the facts and preferences. Results: Our study showed that majority of participants found webinars as a useful and sustainable mode of teaching however some of them felt it as an overdone action resulting in unnecessary stress. Conclusion: Teaching through virtual mode (e.g. webinar) is definitely a valuable tool for medical education especially during the need of social distancing. Its frequency, quantity, and quality should be monitored properly for the optimum outcome.

AB  - While previous research has demonstrated a reduction in physical pain sensitivity in response to social exclusion, the manipulations employed have arguably been far removed from typical daily experience. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of relatively ordinary social encounters on the perception of pain. Healthy participants rated the intensity and unpleasantness of painful stimuli before and after engaging in a structured interaction with a confederate who was instructed to either be warm and friendly or indifferent. A control group was asked to perform a similar structured activity, but alone. Consistent with predictions, participants who experienced the mildly negative social exchange reported lower pain intensity and unpleasantness after the encounter relative to baseline, whereas those exposed to the positive social exchange did not evidence any change in pain ratings. These results were not mediated by changes in mood or perceived connectedness. If mildly negative social encounters can provoke an analgesic effect, it is possible that social hypoalgesia may be considerably more commonplace than previously realized. Discussion focuses on the role of stress-induced hypoalgesia, and the implications of the results for clinical assessments of pain. (C) 2010 International Association for the Study of Pain.

AB  - Background Education is recognised as a strong determinant of health. Yet there is increasing concern that health in adolescence may also influence educational attainments and future life chances. We examined associations between health in early adolescence and subsequent academic and employment outcomes, exploring potential mediators of these relationships to inform intervention strategies.
   Methods We used data from the Longitudinal Study of Young People in England. Adolescent health was measured at waves 1 and 2. Outcomes included educational attainment at age 16 years and being NEET (not in education, employment or training) at age 19 years. Associations were adjusted for ethnicity, area-level deprivation and early adolescent academic attainment. Where significant associations were identified, we examined the role of hypothesised mediators including attendance and truancy, classroom behaviour, substance use and psychological distress.
   Results Health conditions in early adolescence predicted poor subsequent education and employment outcomes (ORs ranged from 1.25 to 1.72) with the exception of long-term chronic conditions and NEET status, which were unassociated. The most consistent mediating variable was social exclusion. School behaviour, truancy and substance use were significant mediators for mental health. Long-term absences mediated associations between mental health and physical health and later outcomes.
   Conclusions Health is a key component of academic and vocational achievement. Investment in health is a way of improving life chances. The identification of key mediators such as social exclusion and truancy indicate areas where screening for health conditions and provision of targeted support could improve educational, employment and health outcomes.

AB  - Health indeed is Wealth. The Corona Virus Pandemic has impacted the best health-care systems world-wide; even as the world grapples with the massive loss of human life causing pain to millions. The Pandemic is no more just a medical health challenge; it has thrown up spiritual and emotional challenges as it is affecting our belief system.
   "Prevention is Better than Cure is the mantra". Since there is no allopathic medicine solution available; people are adopting various measures like social distancing and personal sanitization. There is an urgent need to assist the individuals to take all the preventive measures possible to boost their immunity, improve the respiratory system, and lessen the anxiety, stress, and depression. It can be difficult to not feel anxiety and sometimes panic over the coronavirus outbreak, with the onslaught of updates on news and social media.
   Yoga has emerged as the perfect tool that an individual can follow to establish physical, mental, and spiritual balance to develop robust health and combat physical and emotional challenges. Yoga offers another path, a fresh perspective with which to deal with events that are beyond our control. The different asanas of yoga can help us to prevent COVID-19 by boosting our immune system and managing the stress that one is going through in this time of uncertainty.
   This study tries to specifically evaluate the impact of the preventive measures undertaken through Yoga practice. 126 respondents from different states of India were requested to perform yoga daily for 30 days. Significant changes were observed and are mentioned in detail.

AB  - The 2019 Coronavirus Pandemic challenges the delivery of care for patients with head and neck cancer. An important aspect of this care has been the evolution of enhanced survivorship services, which include surveillance for recurring cancer and prevention of second primaries. The application of evidence-based approaches to the identification and management of treatment and tumor-related toxicities has embraced the use of validated patient-reported outcomes instruments, health promotion, and care coordination. In this manuscript, we describe how our multidisciplinary team of survivorship providers has accommodated to the need to provide patients with social distancing while acknowledging the importance of continued care during treatment and through the spectrum of survivorship.

AB  - Many states have become concerned with Russian cyberattacks and online propaganda. The Ukrainian government responded to the information threat in 2017 by blocking access to several Russian websites, including VKontakte, one of the most popular social media websites in Ukraine. By exploiting a natural experiment in Ukraine, I find that the sudden censorship policy reduced activity on VKontakte, despite the fact that a vast majority of the users were legally and technically able to bypass the ban. Users with strong political and social affiliations to Russia were at least as likely to be affected by the ban as those with weak affiliations. I argue that the ease of access to online media-not political attitudes toward the state-was the main mechanism behind the users' response to the ban. These findings suggest that this pragmatic view on the effects of censorship holds, even in the highly politicized military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which later evolved into a full-scale Russian invasion.

AB  - The goal of this study is twofold: firstly, we want to explore specific identity that has been emerging as a consequence of many EU-related changes (e.g. development of transport, ICT, increasing number of different EU programs and new EU policies); secondly, we want to test the role of social media in building this new identity that we call EUens (European Union citizens). Conducting in-depth interviews with 25 EUens we find that some issues which are commonly seen as important factors in European identity construction, such as class and political attitudes, do not play any significant role in constructing European identity for members of our group. Secondly, our analysis suggests that social media have potential of becoming important driver of European identity.

AB  - This study investigated whether the effects of viewing pro-environmental messages within a narrative context affected intention to perform ecofriendly behaviors through the accessibility of participants' (N = 332) environmental attitudes. One week after an online pretest, participants viewed one of two television clips that either included or did not include pro-environmental messages. Participants then completed attitude accessibility latency measures and reported behavioral intent to perform several ecofriendly behaviors. Reinforcement of pro-environmental attitudes by the pro-environmental messages occurred through the accessibility of the attitudes, which, in turn, predicted intention to engage in the depicted ecofriendly behaviors. Consistent with a category activation hypothesis, accessible attitudes toward the specific behaviors depicted in the program predicted the accessibility of attitudes toward ecofriendly behaviors that were not depicted or explicitly discussed in the program, and these accessible attitudes predicted intention to engage in ecological behaviors not depicted in the program. These findings are a first demonstration that portrayals of specific behaviors in a narrative television program can increase behavioral intention for related behaviors not shown in the program and that these effects occur through the activation of existing, positive attitudes.

AB  - The implementation of the German energy transition (Energiewende) is unclearly framed. The future of the transition depends on more than just technological development or economic feasibility. Rather, a positive attitude and an understanding by the general public are critical to its success. Therefore, communicating the complex, polarized and long-term process in an objective way is essential. We show that despite the alleged clarity of goals, German stakeholders have very diverse reasons for their support of the energy transition. One key reason mentioned is climate protection. Another important goal is the desired independence from energy imports. This diversity is at the heart of the communication challenges. We see a wide variety of goals triggering trade-offs and challenges in understanding the process. Therefore, we suggest an infographic as an approach to communicating the energy transition to the general public with a focus on goals and related future challenges of the transition. We conclude that communication tools should promote an inclusive discussion and debate regarding the goals and challenges of a process, such as the energy transition, to help answer the question: How do we want to live in the future?

AB  - What drives a person to take part in a collective action and engage in political protest? This is a question that has long interested social scientists. Recent theoretical and empirical research in industrialised countries that centres on the political behaviour of individuals examines five main factors - grievances, efficacy, identity, emotions and social embeddedness - to understand what leads citizens to join social protests. Drawing on such research and using Israel National Election Studies (INES) data, this article examines the political attitudes of participants in the widespread 'Social Justice' protests that took place in Israel in 2011, with the aim of explaining what motivates civic participation in such protests. By analysing the profile of the demonstrators, our findings provide additional empirical evidence to the theoretical approach and assist in understanding political protest behaviour in general.

AB  - Today marketers have realized the potential of one of the most prominent digital communication tool of modern times - the 'Mobile Phone' which is also known as 'third screen of communication' after television and internet that enables them to communicate with their target customers in customized, relevant, specialized, measurable and interactive manner. Indian mobile marketing landscape is witnessing a significant augmentation with each passing year. Mobile phone is writing new rules in Indian digital arena with more than a 1.18 billion in February, 2018(TRAI). India has emerged as a leading contributor along with China towards smartphone usage. The present study dealt with understanding the consumers' attitude towards mobile marketing along with understanding consumers' response towards mobile ads. Data was collected from Delhi area from 205 respondents. Non-probability sampling was used to collect the data. Structured questionnaire based on 5 point Likert scale was used to collect the data. Data was analyzed with the help of non-parametric tests like one sample bi-nomial test and one sample wilcoxon signed rank test. It was concluded from the study that consumers had positive attitude towards mobile marketing.

AB  - Empirical studies have persistently reported negative attitudes of meat eaters toward vegetarians and vegans (veg*ns), but scant attention has been paid to veg*ns' attitudes toward meat eaters. We aimed to investigate the attitudes of meat eaters and veg*ns from both perspectives. In addition, we explored the attitudes of occasional meat eaters. We performed a cross-sectional study (Study 1) among meat eaters, veg*ns, and occasional meat eaters, as well as a content analysis of publicly available tweets (Study 2). Study 1 (N = 477, M-age = 23.45, SD = 5.91) showed that the attitudes of veg*ns toward meat eaters are significantly more negative compared to the attitudes of meat eaters toward veg*ns, but both were lower than the midpoint on scales measuring negative attitudes toward the other. Study 2 showed that only a small portion (<1%) of tweets (N = 1,328) on meat eating or veg*nism contained signs of negative attitudes. The two studies provide little evidence of the existence of strong negative attitudes.

AB  - Lack of cohesion among the elites within a society invites conflict. However, the robustness of the elites' power is demonstrated by their capacity to recycle, propelling the system to persist. There is a great degree of ingrained public mistrust in the elite despite the latter's regeneration, because of their inclination to build bureaucratic systems that are costly in terms of treasure. Despite waves of revolutions and uprisings in MENA, the political outcomes were no different in style from their predecessors. In some cases, it was simply a reproduction of autocracies and cronyism through the revolving door of power and wealth. The common denominator among elites is how to capture the state's rents in order to maximize their own self-interest. Using the Arab Barometer data, our study will not be focused on the political identity of the elite, but on public perception in evaluating public institutions and political attitudes. Elites are perceived negatively because they missed opportunities to provide exemplary leadership, as well as economic development and accountability. The outcomes are political turmoil, social injustice and economic inequality.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered countermeasures like #StayAtHome initiatives, which have changed the whole world. Despite the success of such initiatives in limiting the spread of COVID-19 to #FlattenTheCurve, physicians are now confronted with the adverse effects of the current restrictive pandemic management strategies and social distancing measures.
   Objective: We aim to draw attention to the particular importance and magnitude of what may be the adverse effects of COVID-19-related policies.
   Methods: We herein report a case of an otherwise healthy 84-year-old woman with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to COVID-19-related directives. #StayAtHome policies and consequential social isolation have diminished our patient's social life and reduced her healthy movement behaviors. The patient spent long hours in a seated position while focusing on the intensive flow of media information regarding the pandemic.
   Results: Reduced mobility due to preventive social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic was the only identified cause of the DVT.
   Conclusions: While evaluating the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and governmentally implemented containment measures, including social isolation and mobility reduction, adverse events should be considered. Digital approaches might play a crucial role in supporting public health.

AB  - Though the contemporary media environment is filled with many different sources disseminating communications about science-including journalists, politicians and opinion leaders, and researchers-few studies have examined how messages about science communicated by different sources directly influence audience opinion about scientific research itself. This experiment (N = 170) used stimuli articles that reflected different presentation sources (3: political/public relations/researcher) and types of science research (2: "hard"/"soft") to examine effects on people's attitudes toward the featured research project's (a) utility and (b) worthiness of federal grant funding, while controlling for individual differences in political attitudes and interest in science. Overall, political-source messages suppressed ratings of the project's worthiness of funding and utility, and while messages from the researcher source produced greater utility ratings compared to the public relations source for soft science projects, this pattern was reversed for hard science research. Additionally, different sources influenced people's comprehension of articles they read. We interpret these results within the larger landscape of science communication and conclude with brief practical recommendations for those engaging in science communication.

AB  - Paying attention to the rising popularity of virtual assistants (VAs) that offer unique user experiences through voice-centered interaction, this study examined the effects of modality, device, and task differences on perceived human likeness of, and attitudes toward, voice-activated VAs. To do so, a 2 (modality: voice vs. text) x 2 (device: mobile vs. laptop) x 2 (task type: hedonic vs. utilitarian) mixed factorial experimental design was employed. Findings suggest that voice (vs. text) interaction leads to more positive attitudes toward the VA system mediated by heightened perceived human likeness of the VA, but only with utilitarian (vs. hedonic) tasks. Interestingly, laptop (vs. mobile phone) interaction also enhanced perceived human likeness of the VA. This study offers theoretical and practical implications for VA research by exploring the combinational effects of modality, device, and task differences on user perceptions through human-like interactions.

AB  - This study examined suicide stigma in relation to Korean cultural characteristics, such as Collectivism, Chemyon sensitivity (concern about losing a socially acceptable face), the tendency toward conformity, and the emphasis on the interdependent self. We found that these characteristics were connected to suicide stigma in Korea. Those with high Chemyon sensitivity tended to perceive that suicidal people were incompetent, immoral, selfish, and deviated from society. Conformity tendency was positively associated with five stigma factors: incompetence, glorification, immorality, selfishness, and social exclusion. Those who perceived themselves as interdependent tended to consider suicidal people incompetent, lacking morality, self-centered, and deviant.

AB  - The rise of cyberbullying has been of great concern for the general public. This study aims to explore public attitudes towards cyberbullying on Chinese social media. Cognition and emotion are important components of attitude, and this study innovatively used text analysis to extract the cognition and emotion of the posts. We used a web crawler to collect 53,526 posts related to cyberbullying in Chinese on Sina Weibo in a month, where emotions were detected using the software "Text Mind", a Chinese linguistic psychological text analysis system, and the content analysis was performed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model. Sentiment analysis showed the frequency of negative emotion words was the highest in the posts; the frequency of anger, anxiety, and sadness words decreased in turn. The topic model analysis identified three common topics about cyberbullying: critiques on cyberbullying and support for its victims, rational expressions of anger and celebrity worship, and calls for further control. In summary, this study quantitatively reveals the negative attitudes of the Chinese public toward cyberbullying and conveys specific public concerns via three common topics. This will help us to better understand the demands of the Chinese public so that targeted support can be proposed to curb cyberbullying.

AB  - This study investigated how migration interrupts self-identity processes and the role of future self-perceptions in psychological adaptation. A longitudinal model was tested, in which self-concept clarity mediated the relationship of future self-continuity and positivity with life satisfaction over time. Data were collected three times over a year from 101 adult recent migrants (51.5% female, M-age = 28.5, SDage = 8). The model partially supported the mediational hypothesis. Having a more positive attitude toward one's future self in the host society was associated with increased self-concept clarity six months later, which in turn led to greater life satisfaction another six months later. Findings suggest that migrants who envision a desirable future self in their host environment experience better adaptation outcomes over time.

AB  - In an attempt to explore how local traditional narrative manifests in a globalized media format, we analyzed five aesthetic elements of Korean traditional performances in Infinite Challenge (Muhan tojon) in terms of the sinmyong narrative. In the Infinite Challenge show, the personae release pent-up energy through endless challenges, sustain positive attitudes towards life by wiping away tears through laughter, have fun with playful deception games or word play, act like childish fools (pabo) and pranksters (kondal) who indulge their unbound desires, and interact with participatory audiences in an open structure. Coupled with previous research confirming that traditional communication styles shape modes of expression in contemporary media content, we believe this study can provide empirical evidence to substantiate the creative potential of local traditional narrative in indigenizing global media programs.

AB  - Strategies such as behavioural substitution, self-monitoring, social support as well as planning and urge management can assist gamblers to limit or reduce their gambling behaviours. Not all gamblers implement strategies before, during or after gambling, even though the use of strategies is recommended by the gambling and treatment industry. Australian gamblers completed an online survey with follow-up (n = 411) to determine the predictors of intention to use strategies and the actual use of strategies. Results indicated 92% of gamblers attempted at least one strategy to stick to their limits over the 30-day period (median = 30 strategies, IQR = 11 to 56). Gamblers indicated a positive attitude towards strategy engagement and perceived themselves as having control over their use but the role that important others (e.g., family members) could play in strategy implementation warrants further examination. To improve strategy engagement, prevention and intervention programmes should target factors associated with intentions rather than focusing on behaviour.

AB  - Over the last decade, medical education changed from traditional teaching methods to telematic and networking scholar and e-learning approach. The objective of the present systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness and teachers/student's acceptability of e-learning applied to the field of orthodontics and paediatric dentistry. A database search of the literature was conducted on PubMed and Embase databases from January 2005 to May 2021. A total of 172 articles were identified by the electronic search, while a total of 32 papers were selected for qualitative analysis. Overall, 19 articles investigated the effectiveness of e-learning, and no difference of acceptability was reported between e-learning and traditional methods for a wide part of the articles selected. A total of 25 papers provided a satisfaction questionnaire for learners and all were positive in their attitude towards e-learning. The results showed that e-learning is an effective method of instruction, complementing the traditional teaching methods, and learners had a positive attitude and perception. The evidence of the present study reported a high level of acceptability and knowledge level of e-learning techniques, compared to frontal lecture methods, in the fields of orthodontics and paediatric dentistry.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine preschool teachers and parents' attitudes and their practices regarding the use of digital technologies during preschool education. The main research questions the study intended to address focused on teachers' and parents' attitudes and practices about the role of digital technology supplies in young children's development. The study used a mixed research approach, using in-depth interviews and an online questionnaire The results have shown that only one of the eight preschool teachers reported a positive attitude regarding the impact of digital technology in children's development. Most of the interviewed preschool teachers showed preference towards authentic play and activities exercising children's psycho-motor skills. However, most of parents have suggested that their children, starting from early years of their development, are exposed to different digital technologies. In conclusion, there are two contradictory findings (progressive and regressive philosophies) among parents and preschool teachers regarding their perceptions and practices on the use of digital technologies in young children's learning and development. The study advocates for continuous cooperation between parents and teachers to ensure prospects of maximizing benefits and alleviating potential risks of using digital technologies in early childhood education.

AB  - Objective Within the school context, the need to belong is a fundamental psychological construct associated with a variety of important adolescent school-based and quality-of-life outcomes. The objective of the present study is to investigate the mediating effect of loneliness on the association between school belonging constructs (i.e., social inclusion and exclusion) and subjective well-being and mental health problems among adolescents.
   Method Participants of this study included 244 adolescents in grades 9-12 attending a high school in a city of Turkey. They were comprised of 52.5% female and 47.5% male and ranged in age between 14 and 18 years (M = 16.27, SD = .1.02).
   Results Findings of the study indicated that school-based social inclusion and exclusion significantly predicted loneliness, mental health problems, and subjective well-being. Mediation analyses showed that loneliness partially mediated the relationship of social inclusion with mental health problems and subjective well-being. Thereafter, loneliness had a full mediating effect on the association between social exclusion and subjective well-being and partially mediated the effect of social exclusion on adolescent mental health problems. Social inclusion and exclusion also indirectly predicted mental health problems through subjective well-being.
   Conclusion Findings of this study suggest that loneliness is an important mechanism that may help to explain the effect of school belongingness on adolescent well-being and mental health. The results highlight the importance of school belongingness-based preventions and interventions targeting to promote mental health and well-being in school settings.

AB  - The paper explored how to promote constructive intergroup relations among children and young people in a context of protracted conflict. Across two studies, the Empathy-Attitudes-Action model was examined in middle childhood and adolescence. More specifically, we tested the relations among dispositional empathy, out-group attitudes, and prosocial behaviors for youth born after the peace agreement in Northern Ireland. In one correlational (Study 1: N = 132; 6-11 years old: M = 8.42 years, SD = 1.23) and one longitudinal design (Study 2: N = 466; 14-15 years old), bootstrapped mediation analyses revealed that empathy was associated with more positive attitudes toward the conflict-related out-group, which in turn, was related to higher out-group prosocial behaviors, both self-report and concrete actions. Given that out-group prosocial acts in a setting of intergroup conflict may serve as the antecedents for peacebuilding among children and adolescents, this study has intervention implications.

AB  - Aim of this research was to investigate the neurobiological correlates of fear of missing out in response to the social exclusion and social inclusion cue.
   Fear of Missing Out scale (FOMOs), Social Media Engagement Questionnaire (SMEQ), and Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ) were administered to twenty-six healthy participants. Afterward, EEG activity was acquired during a visual task showing exclusion and inclusion social images.
   Event Related Potentials (ERP) and sLoreta analyses were performed.
   In the ERP analyses the main effect of condition was found in temporo-parietal and frontal montages. sLoreta analyses showed a greater intensity of the left secondary somatosensory cortex (BA7) in inclusion compared with exclusion condition and a greater intensity of left temporal-parietal junction (BA41, BA42, BA43) and left prefrontal cortex (BA47) in exclusion versus inclusion condition. Moreover, the main finding of correlations analyses was that the FOMOs score was positively correlated with ASQ-need for approval and with right middle temporal gyrus (BA21) only during inclusion condition.
   Findings sustain that fear of missing out is associated to a greater sensitivity towards social inclusive experiences rather than social exclusion and with need of belong. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - One question is how long patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer wish to receive therapy. The perceptions of > 100 patients and physicians were analyzed to compare different prognostic conditions. The patients' attitudes were generally positive and not directly linked to the expected benefits, suggesting that other factors in conjunction with the clinical assessment, such as the doctor patient relationship, should be considered to understand patients' motivations.
   Introduction: Pemetrexed maintenance therapy (MT) after induction with platinum-based chemotherapy has recently become a common treatment strategy for advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the benefits of MT should be weighed with consideration of the patients' perceptions and preferences. The aim of the present study was to evaluate patients' attitudes toward MT and to describe physicians' awareness of their patients' inclinations. Materials and Methods: We administered a 12-question anonymous survey and the Distress Thermometer Questionnaire to patients with advanced or recurrent nonsquamous NSCLC. The survey was also distributed to the referring physicians. Results: From December 2014 to July 2015, 92 patients and 37 physicians were enrolled. All 92 patients completed the questionnaire at TO (before starting chemotherapy) and 56.5% also did so at T1 (after completion of induction). The physicians completed the survey only at TO. Most patients had a positive attitude toward MT at both TO (78.9%) and T1 (86.5%), and 100% of the physicians thought their patients would be in favor of MT. The physicians believed that their patients' attitudes toward MT would decrease proportionally with the reduction in the magnitude of the overall survival increase and expected benefits. The decrease expected by the physicians was much greater than that reported by the patients. This was especially true for an overall survival increase as small as 1 month (51.9% of patients accepting MT vs. 13.5% supposed by physicians) or when the only treatment benefit was radiologic tumor stabilization (69.3% of patients accepting MT vs. 37.8% supposed by physicians). Conclusion: NSCLC patients have a generally positive attitude toward MT, which is not directly proportional to the expected benefits and greater than the attitude expected by physicians.

AB  - Background: The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (SBA) is the most significant cleanliness campaign by the Government of India. Youth are the strong pillars of the development of any country. There is a need to bring a big change to the youth about the cleanliness drive. This study aims to assess the perception of SBA and attitude towards cleanliness among dental students of Kanpur city. Materials and Methods: This study is a descriptive, cross-sectional survey, which comprised of 390 undergraduate and postgraduate students. A pretested, self-administered, close-ended questionnaire consisting of 11 questions were included to evaluate the perceptions and attitudes regarding SBA among the dental students. Data were analyzed using IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 21 (IBM Corp. Released 2012. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Categorical data were compared using the Chi-square test. All values were considered statistically significant for a value of P <= 0.05. Results: The results of the study revealed that there is a positive attitude among study participants towards cleanliness, but efforts are still required to emphasize the importance of cleanliness among the many inhabitants. To implement SBA effectively, it is important to highlight the urgent need for public awareness. Conclusion: This study found that the majority of the participants was having positive attitude and perception towards SBA, yet initiatives and approaches are still needed to help bring positive actions among those who are reluctant to follow proper cleanliness, sanitation, and hygiene practices.

AB  - In recent years, scholars have increasingly revealed the importance of celebrities in society, among them celebrity politicians. These celebrities not only influence political attitudes but also serve as role models for many individuals. Yet, little is known regarding what types of role models' politicians serve as in the context of health. To fill this gap, we examined three influential contemporary political leaders: Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu, and the type of mediated role models each possibly comprise in the context of healthy living. By conducting a qualitative content analysis, we analyzed 90 articles from 2018 to 2019 from two leading newspapers in each of the three politician's countries, namely Russia, the USA, and Israel as well as the respective politician's Facebook pages. Our findings point to three types of potential role models' as political leaders: a health-promoting model (Putin), a hybrid model (Trump), and a model of non-existence (Netanyahu), as the literature points to mediated role models influencing individuals' beliefs and behaviors. This study contributes to the understanding of mediated types of role models' politicians potentially serve as in the context of health vital to people's personal health.

AB  - Consumers' participation in automobile recalls for environmental defects (ARED) can enhance the recall's completion rate, reduce vehicle exhaust emissions, and improve air quality. This study investigates consumers' intention to participate in ARED on the basis of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and extends it by adding the constructs of perceived environmental benefits, personal benefits, and personal costs. A total of 628 respondents participated in the online questionnaire survey, and a structural equation model was adopted to analyze the collected data. Results show that perceived behavioral control and positive attitude toward participating in ARED positively affect consumers' participation intention. Attitude is mainly explained by perceived environmental benefits, whereas subjective norm is mainly explained by perceived environmental and personal benefits. On the basis of these results, we provide some implications to motivate consumers to participate in ARED.

AB  - This paper explores the extent to which religiosity entails special choices of values, the differences between the values of religious and non-religious people and whether there are significant dissimilarities in the ways they relate to politics in Hungary. The results derived from our representative sample have shown the dual nature of the value orientations of people who consider themselves religious. The attitude of religious people is characterized by a duality of leader cult and secularised belief. Predominantly religious people hold secularized values, but their personal life worlds reflect an inherited traditionalism concerning their viewpoint on their political leader. Consequently, they have a positive attitude towards governmental measures which result in restrictions on constitutional and parliamentary government, as well as on the Western system of democratic institutions, while at the same time they are drifting away from their Christian values.

KW  - ICT

AB  - The current study aims to investigate students' attitudes towards the use of distance education during COVID-19 in Morocco. The first cases of COVID-19 starting from the first weeks of March 2020 has obliged educational authorities to suspend face-to-face education. Immediately, distance education was declared the alternative means to complete the academic year. Moroccan TV channels started broadcasting lessons for different levels at different times. Moreover, teachers and students started using social media and university platforms to share lessons. However, not all students agree with distance education in the adopted format. Accordingly, the current study investigates the attitudes of Moroccan English Department students at Moulay Ismail University. A mixed-method design was adopted by triangulating data from five-point Likert scale questionnaires and a focus group. The results showed that students generally prefer face-to-face education rather than distance education. However, part-time students reported positive attitudes towards distance education. It is recommended that both distance education and face-to-face education should be planned by teachers, coordinators, and administrators.

AB  - The study aimed to examine the influence of media and peers on attitudes towards cosmetic surgery using a sociocultural framework. A sample of 351 Australian women aged 18-69 years completed measures of media exposure, friend conversations, internalisation of appearance ideals, appearance comparison, body dissatisfaction, and attitudes towards cosmetic surgery. Correlational analysis showed that almost all media and friend variables were significantly correlated with positive attitudes towards cosmetic surgery. A structural equation model based on the sociocultural model showed a good level of fit to the data. The effects of media exposure and friend conversations on body dissatisfaction and attitudes towards cosmetic surgery were mediated by internalisation. We concluded that media exposure and friend conversations affected attitudes towards cosmetic surgery both directly and indirectly. Our results contribute to the understanding of the sociocultural mechanisms underlying women's motivations for cosmetic surgery. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Structural Equation Modeling was used to test the integrated study model to get correct and unbiased path coefficients with the help of 227 responses. The study results revealed that greater the environmental knowledge of environmental friendly products, the more positive attitude towards environmental friendly products was perceived and international tourists perceived it significantly high in comparison to domestic tourists Interestingly Control on Availability didn't impact purchase intentions of tourists in the current study, a finding different from literature across other contexts. Attitude didn't have significant mediating effect in the relationship between environmental knowledge and purchase intentions. On the other hand, purchase intentions positively influenced purchase behavior of tourists. Practical implications are discussed at large.

Guided by queer theory, we firstly explore cultural and religious dimensions defining acceptable and unacceptable sexual behaviour; their influence on attitudes towards the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning (or queer) and intersex (LGBTQI) community, leading to their daily negative encounters; and, lastly, we suggest community dialogues as a mediator that influences more positive attitudes and guides acceptability towards this vulnerable population. Three main themes emerged after the adoption of a thematic analysis: there is denial of the LGBTQI existence; stigma and discrimination towards this minority population also prevail; and the LGBTQI population in Lesotho experience emotional and physical attacks.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors affecting individuals' intentions to adopt Islamic banking. Most of the previous studies have used theory of reasoned action and theory of planned behaviour; however, decomposed theory of planned behaviour, which is proven robust and superior, has been used in very few studies. The present study gauges this gap and proposes a comprehensive model for adoption of Islamic banking. The study also incorporated antecedents of attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control to enhance understanding of factors relevant to the adoption of Islamic banking. A sample of 186 bank customers has been selected for data collection. Variance-based partial least-squares structural equation modelling was employed for data analysis. Results show that attitude and subjective norms have significant positive relationship with intention to adopt Islamic banking. The result depicts that attitude is determined by awareness, uncertainty, relative advantage and compatibility. Subjective norm is determined by normative beliefs. Perceived behavioural control is determined by self-efficacy and resource facilitation condition. The findings of the study are important for Islamic banks to revamp their marketing strategies. Marketing managers should try to develop positive attitude through creating awareness and benefits of Islamic banking services. Positive word of mouth is also an important aspect which can be created through enhancing the service delivery to the existing customers.

AB  - Combating harmful misinformation about pharmaceuticals on social media is a growing challenge. The complexity of health information, the role of expert intermediaries in disseminating information, and the information dynamics of social media create an environment where harmful misinformation spreads rapidly. However, little is known about the origin of this misinformation. This article explores the processes through which health misinformation from online marketplaces is legitimized and spread. Specifically, across one content analysis and two experimental studies, the authors investigate the role of highly legitimized influencer content in spreading vaccine misinformation. By analyzing a data set of social media posts and the websites where this content originates, the authors identify the legitimation processes that spread and normalize discussions about vaccine hesitancy (Study 1). Study 2 shows that expert cues increase the perceived legitimacy of misinformation, particularly for individuals who generally have positive attitudes toward vaccines. Study 3 demonstrates the role of expert legitimacy in driving consumers' sharing behavior on social media. This research addresses a gap in the understanding of how pharmaceutical misinformation originates and becomes legitimized. Given the importance of the effective communication of vaccine information, the authors present key challenges for policy makers.

AB  - Using open-source data, we show that despite significant reductions in global public transit during the COVID-19 pandemic, similar to 20% of ridership continues during social distancing measures. Current urban transport data collection methods do not account for the distinct behavioural and psychological experiences of the population. Therefore, little is known about the travel experience of vulnerable citizens that continue to rely on public transit and their concerns over risk, safety and other stressors that could negatively affect their health and well-being. We develop a machine learning approach to augment conventional transport data collection methods by curating a population segmented Twitter dataset representing the travel experiences of similar to 120,000 transit riders before and during the pandemic in Metro Vancouver, Canada. Results show a heightened increase in negative sentiments, differentiated by age, gender and ethnicity associated with public transit indicating signs of psychological stress among travellers during the first and second waves of COVID-19. Our results provide empirical evidence of existing inequalities and additional risks faced by citizens using public transit during the pandemic, and can help raise awareness of the differential risks faced by travellers. Our data collection methods can help inform more targeted social-distancing measures, public health announcements, and transit monitoring services during times of transport disruptions and closures.

AB  - Objective: To assess the association between lifestyle and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among Chinese adults and provide recommendations for increasing vaccination rates. Methods: From August 6, 2021 to August 9, 2021, we recruited 29,925 participants from 31 Chinese provinces via an online questionnaire. We designed a question to assess COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and used 16 items to assess lifestyle by calculating lifestyle scores. Odds ratios (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were used to estimate the association by using binary logistic regression models. Results: The overall prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was 8.40 % (95 % CI: 8.09-8.72), and the median lifestyle score was 65.00 (interquartile range: 59.00-71.00). After adjusting for potential confounders, the COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy rate decreased significantly with an increase in lifestyle score (P for Trend <0.001). Low COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy rate was associated with lifestyle factors including adequate sleep, never smoking, intermittent drinking, good relationships, working and studying, using hand sanitizer, wearing masks, less gathering activities, and keeping social distance (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Our findings indicate that high lifestyle score is associated with low vaccine hesitancy rate among Chinese. The government should view the smokers (or the drinkers) as the key to further boosting the vaccination rate. In addition, the publicity and education about wearing masks and keeping social distance should be prioritized.

AB  - Objective: Even though the dual process of aggression is acknowledged as a mediator of violent behavior, few studies have explored the implicit aspect of violence-supportive cognition. The current study advances understanding of the implicit attitude toward violence and suggests evaluative conditioning (EC) as a strategy to change the implicit violence-supportive attitude of juvenile offenders. Method: A total of 100 juvenile offenders and nonoffenders were randomly assigned to a treatment or control condition, and EC or control intervention was followed depending on the condition. The explicit and implicit attitudes toward violence of the juvenile offender and nonoffender groups were assessed pre- and postintervention by a self-report and implicit association test. Results: Preintervention results indicated that the offender group revealed a less negative implicit attitude toward violence than the nonoffender group did, whereas there was no significant group difference in the explicit attitude toward violence. Postintervention results showed a significant improvement in the violence implicit association test score after the EC intervention in the treatment condition of the offender group. Conclusions: These findings indicate that implicit and explicit attitudes could be expressed independently and that juvenile offenders have more implicit violence-supportive cognition than do nonoffenders. EC intervention was found to be an effective method to correct the implicit attitude toward violence of the juvenile offender group, which suggests that specific interventions for violence-supportive implicit attitudes should be considered.

AB  - This study examined the use and effects of fantasy in food advertising targeting children. A content analysis documented the prevalence of fantasy appeals, including fantasies that center on product ingredients, animals, and adventures. A qualitative analysis of 8- and 9-year-old children's responses to food advertisements revealed substantial variability in their understanding of advertising, inference of manipulative intent, and use of persuasion knowledge. An experiment among 8- through 10-year-old children found that fantasy was associated with positive attitudes toward an advertisement when perceived manipulative intent was low and negative evaluations when perceived manipulative intent was high.

KW  - Preventive behavior

KW  - COVID-19
AB  - The present study examines whether people respond heterogeneously to statewide social distancing mandates as a function of factors that proxy for health risk, economic insecurity, and media consumption. Using longitudinal data of 7400 American adults between March 10 and June 23, 2020, the study examines social-distancing and mask-wearing behaviors. We use a staggered difference-in-difference model to explore whether state policies lead to preventive behaviors. We further examine heterogeneity in individual responses to state mandates by including interaction terms with health risk, economic insecurity, and media consumption. The study finds that state policies lead to increased adoption of these behaviors. Our findings also suggest that old age and living with the elderly are key predictors of preventive behavior adoption in the presence or even absence of state mandates. However, the economically insecure, such as the unemployed, those with low incomes and net worth, or without health insurance, are less likely to adopt preventive behaviors regardless of the mandates. The adoption of the behaviors is also polarized between CNN users and Fox News/Social Media users, with greater compliance by the former.

AB  - Prevention focus is a self-regulatory orientation that serves the need for security, and promotion focus is a self-regulatory orientation that serves the need for growth. From mid-March to early April 2020, did people judge prevention focus to be more useful than promotion focus for responding to COVID-19? Our study tested and showed support for this hypothesis with 401 American and Canadian participants, who we sampled in 100-person waves on the first 4 Thursdays of the pandemic. For this study, we developed a new measure of the judged usefulness of promotion and prevention focus. Additionally, results showed that the judged usefulness of promotion and prevention focus related positively to support of the psychological needs for autonomy and relatedness, respectively, in responding to COVID-19. Exploratory analyses showed that day-to-day differences in autonomy, competence, and relatedness support and in promotion and prevention focus tended to be small, which is notable given the large-scale changes to social distancing, employment, and media coverage of the virus during this time. Our research could be useful for crafting persuasive advocacy and narrative communications that encourage social distancing to protect others about whom people care most.

AB  - Does exposure to cyberattacks influence public support for intrusive cybersecurity policies? How do perceptions of cyber threats mediate this relationship? While past research has demonstrated how exposure to cyberattacks affects political attitudes, the mediating role played by threat perception has been overlooked. This study employs a controlled randomized survey experiment design to test the effect of exposure to lethal and nonlethal cyberattacks on support for different types of cybersecurity policies. One thousand twenty-two Israeli participants are exposed to scripted and simulated television reports of lethal or nonlethal cyberattacks against national infrastructure. Findings suggest that exposure to cyberattacks leads to greater support for stringent cybersecurity regulations, through a mechanism of threat perception. Results also indicate that different types of exposure relate to heightened support for different types of regulatory policies. People exposed to lethal cyberattacks tend to support cybersecurity policies that compel the government to alert citizens about cyberattacks. People who were exposed to nonlethal attacks, on the other hand, tend to support oversight policies at higher levels. More broadly, our research suggests that peoples' willingness to accept government cybersecurity policies that limit personal civil liberties and privacy depends on the type of cyberattacks to which they were exposed and the perceptions associated with such exposure.

AB  - Rally 'round the flag effects (J. E. Mueller, 1970) represent sudden and dramatically powerful situation-specific shifts in attitudes toward the American president. However, the extant literature has yet to fully clarify the nature of the psychological dynamics associated with this effect. These ambiguities reflect fundamental differences of opinion among scholars on some very basic questions such as whether overtly experienced emotion should mediate these attitudinal shifts or whether these changes reflect more general shifts in conservative ideology. Across 4 experiments, the authors sought to gain greater clarity on these and other important matters using a multimethod approach in which the authors varied whether participants viewed documentary footage of the 9/11 attacks (Experiments 1-2), generated autobiographical memories of that event (Experiment 3), or retrieved nonpolitical memories from their past (Experiment 4). The authors discuss the relevance of the present findings for theory and research across a variety of different theoretical and methodological paradigms, including social psychological models of threat, emotional appraisal models, and the political science literature.

AB  - The current study utilized the 2018 Washington State Healthy Youth Survey to explore the relations among school district political attitudes, bullying experiences, and mental health outcomes, particularly for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) students. Although bullying was associated with greater psychological distress (i.e., anxiety, depression, and suicidality) for all students, LGBTQ+ students experienced more bullying and psychological distress. Bullying experiences mediated the relation between LGBTQ+ identity and psychological distress. However, school district voting record moderated the relation between LGBTQ+ identity and bullying, such that LGBTQ+ students in more conservative districts, or districts with more votes for Donald Trump in the 2016 election, experienced more bullying, which was associated with greater psychological distress. Additionally, increased teacher intervention during instances of bullying was related to less bullying for LGBTQ+ students. Finally, in more conservative-leaning districts, LGBTQ+ students reported less teacher intervention, which was associated with more bullying and psychological distress. Given that political conservatism was related to higher rates of bullying and poorer mental health outcomes for LGBTQ+ students, we recommend improving school-based LGBTQ+ bullying policies to prioritize the mental health of LGBTQ+ youth.

AB  - Limited efforts have been made in middle- and low-income countries to raise public awareness of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) over the past ten years. We report data from a general population survey exploring the relationship between awareness, knowledge, and attitudes regarding autism in Malaysia. A questionnaire consisting of items related to awareness, knowledge, and attitudes regarding ASD was distributed. The scores of knowledge of ASD and attitude towards ASD were 6.87 (SD = 4.17; with a total possible score of 12) and 6.39 (SD = 2.77; with a total possible score of 9), respectively, indicating that, on average, the participants had moderate levels of knowledge and attitude. Structural equation modeling showed that improving awareness and knowledge about ASD will enhance more positive attitudes towards ASD. Efforts should be geared towards disseminating information about ASD, in order to increase acceptance of the disorder.

AB  - In Spring/Summer 2020, most individuals living in the United States experienced several months of social distancing and stay-at-home orders because of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Clinicians, restaurant cooks, cashiers, transit operators, and other essential workers (EWs), however, continued to work outside the home during this time in order to keep others alive and maintain a functioning society. In the United States, EWs are often low-income persons of color who are more likely to face socioeconomic vulnerabilities, systemic racism, and health inequities. To assess the various impacts of COVID-19 on EWs, an online survey was distributed to a representative sample of individuals residing in six states during May/June 2020. The sample included 990 individuals who identified as EWs and 736 nonessential workers (NWs). We assessed differences between EW and NW respondents according to three categories related to health equity and social determinants of health: (1) demographics (e.g. race/ethnicity); (2) COVID-19 exposure risk pathways (e.g. ability to social distance); and (3) COVID-19 risk perceptions (e.g. perceived risk of contracting COVID-19). EWs were more likely to be Black or Hispanic than NWs and also had lower incomes and education levels on average. Unsurprisingly, EWs were substantially more likely to report working outside the home and less likely to report social distancing and wearing masks indoors as compared to NWs. EWs also perceived a slightly greater risk of contracting COVID-19. These findings, which we discuss in the context of persistent structural inequalities, systemic racism, and health inequities within the United States, highlight ways in which COVID-19 exacerbates existing socioeconomic vulnerabilities faced by EWs.

AB  - Background: Web-based social networks are a powerful communicative element and their use is increasingly widespread. Persons living in extreme social exclusion such as individuals experiencing homelessness can benefit from the positive elements of communication and relationship associated with social networking sites.
   Objective: This study aimed to suggest the comparison of a Facebook training course and an office software course and their effect on psychological well-being in a group of individuals experiencing homelessness.
   Methods: An experimental and longitudinal study was designed. Individuals experiencing homelessness were randomly assigned to either the Facebook group or the office software group, and their social skills, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and satisfaction with life were measured on 4 occasions: pretest, at the end of the training course, 1 month later, and 3 months later. A mixed analysis of variance of repeated measures (2 x4) was performed.
   Results: A total of 92 individuals experiencing homelessness participated in the study. The number of cases in which the 4 measurements were completed was 71 (35 in the intervention group and 36 in the control group). The mixed analysis of variance of repeated measures and the multiple regression analysis indicated a significant increase of the 4 analyzed parameters, with greater significance in the areas of social skills and self-esteem. The critical levels associated to the interaction Time xProgram were significant in all variables and levels. Therefore, the scores in the 4 analyzed constructs were not equal according to the program carried out throughout the work. The effect size associated to the interaction Time xProgram in the social skills scores was large (eta(2) =0.32); in the self-esteem and self-efficacy scores, it was medium, (eta(2) =0.13); and in the satisfaction with life scores, it was small (eta(2) =0.09). The results of the adjustment of the different models of multiple linear regression indicate that the number of hours devoted weekly to the use of Facebook was a predictor of the increase in the scores of social skills (B=3.43, r(2 )=.405) and self-esteem (B=.382). Age (B=.175) and self-efficacy (B=.09) were also variables, which with independence and in equal conditions, predicted self-esteem (r(2 )=.29). Finally, self-esteem (B=.69) was also a predictor variable of the increase of satisfaction with life (r(2) =.195).
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that Facebook could be a key element in homeless psychological well-being and socialization.

AB  - Consumers tend to express positive attitudes toward communication sources that reflect their predispositions toward these sources, that is, their habitual cuing. To move beyond the effects of communication sources such as advertising, word of mouth (WOM), and critical reviews, this article applies a dual-process model to determine how the interaction of habitual cuing and the media features of a movie influence evaluations of movie advertising. Six quasi-experimental designs and an analysis of variance to assess the data indicate that greater cultural discount of an original movie leads to more favorable consumer evaluations when the habitual cuing has come through WOM rather than reviews; numbered sequels also gain favorable evaluations as a result of forward spillover effects or reduced satiation. Finally, for named sequels, consumers exhibit more favorable evaluations when habitual cuing comes through reviews rather than WOM.

AB  - This study advances our understanding of mainstream US journalists' perceptions of their industry's ethical climate by extending first- and third-person perception to this domain. These journalists believe that colleagues in their same organization act unethically significantly less often and act ethically significantly more often than those at other organizations and in related industries. The first- and third-person perceptions are a linear function of social distance but are not the mirror image of each other in this domain. In addition to theoretical contributions, suggestions for ways these perceptions can be used to improve journalists' moral judgment are offered.

TI  - THE MEDIA'S ROLE IN SOCIAL INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION
T2  - MEDIA INTERNATIONAL AUSTRALIA
LA  - English
AB  - Definitions of social inclusion and exclusion are fluid, and researchers and policy-makers have not agreed upon an all-encompassing definition. For wider society, social inclusion requires the transformation of these emerging definitions into 'lived experience' and actions. For the media, reporting on social inclusion is complicated by the confusion about what social inclusion is and to whom it is intended to apply, and by the gap between the ideal and the slower pace of societal change. Until recently, media studies researchers have focused largely on the issue of social exclusion and the media. The goal of this themed issue of MIA is to address some of the gaps in scholarly knowledge about the media's role in social inclusion and exclusion, and the context of that role within the wider social and political discourses. Our aim is to move beyond existing understandings of the media's role in social exclusion to look at spaces and places where there have been attempts to provide inclusion and whether they have worked, but also what issues and problems might have beset them.

AB  - To manage emerging human-wildlife conflicts, wildlife managers will require more information regarding trends in wildlife damage and public perceptions of control measures. In 2017, we administered an online survey to Georgia Agriculture and Natural Resources (ANR) county cooperative extension agents to assess the types of inquiries or complaints about nuisance wildlife they had received during the previous year. We asked questions about the common species creating problems, the nature of the damage reported, and perceptions of client preferences regarding different types of nuisance wildlife control. We compared the results of our 2017 survey to a similar survey conducted in Georgia in 2002 to determine how human-wildlife conflict issues may have changed over time and how ANR agents could serve as information sources regarding these changing trends. In 2017, ANR agents received more inquiries about deer (Odocoileus virginianus) than any other species. Other species frequently identified included armadillos (Dasypus novemcinctus), wild pigs (Sus scrofa), moles (Scalopus spp.), squirrels (Sciurus spp.), and voles (Microtus spp.). Complaints about voles had increased since the previous survey (P = 0.019), as well as complaints about unknown sources of damage (P = 0.041) and requests for more general information on wildlife damage (P = 0.041). Fewer complaints about bats (Order: Chiroptera; P = 0.0007), woodpeckers (Family: Picidae; P = 0.021), squirrels (P = 0.047), and moles (P = 0.026) were reported during this survey than were reported in the 2002 survey. More ANR agents in Georgia received complaints about wild pigs (P = 0.00004). Most complaints about nuisance wildlife referred to damage to yards or landscapes, followed by gardens, and then row crops. Complaints about damage to row crops had increased since the 2002 survey (P = 0.046), while complaints about damage to houses or barns had decreased (P = 0.01). Lastly, ANR agents believed their clients were not opposed to lethal control of nuisance wildlife. We believe these findings highlight the many benefits of targeting ANR agents as key informants and recommend that other managers implement similar techniques to acquire information on nuisance wildlife trends within thew own states.

AB  - The mechanism connecting the antecedents to positive attitudes like affective commitment (AC) and positive behaviors like organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) is an under-researched area in the field of positive organizational scholarship. Drawing on Social Exchange Theory (SET), this study empirically validates family motivation and civility as antecedents of affective commitment and organizational citizenship behavior through the mediating mechanism of self-efficacy. The process by Hayes (2013) was used to analyze time-lagged and multi-source data collected from 335 employees of educational and telecom sector. Results indicate that the relationship of affective commitment with family motivation and civility is partially mediated whereas the relationship of organizational citizenship behavior with family motivation and civility is fully mediated by self-efficacy. This study adds to the literature of family-work enrichment accounts by validating family motivation as a novel antecedent for positive behavioral outcomes. The implications of the study are discussed.

AB  - Agility in modem era is one of the most important components of organizational superiority towards each other and achieving goals successfully. The speed of doing things and reacting appropriately to the changes are considered as the key factors of success in the present century. However, with a brief glance at the governmental agencies in developing countries, we will find that these agencies are struggling with many problems which prevents their quick and agile performance. Therefore, this research was designed and conducted to explain and identify the effective factors on organizational agility in governmental agencies. The research method used is a case study in which the researcher tried to examine and scrutinize the organizational agility components by studying the taxation organization and conducting open and semi-structured interviews meticulously. Finally, the effective factors were identified. this category was called the meta-organization factors including factors such as economic conditions, media, inter-organizational relationships, intelligent clients, laws and political attitudes. The snowball method has also been used for sampling in the research. At the end of the article, the research model is also stated.

AB  - With the growing popularity of the internet and the continued growth, universities are focusing more on web-based strategies to deliver higher education (e.g., e-learning). Despite this, very little research on e-learning service quality has been done to test the effectiveness of these efforts. Therefore, we researched two hundred-ten teachers, including 111 men and 99 women, who participated and used the quality of e-learning teaching questionnaires at several Vietnamese universities. In addition, we use the t-test and MANOVA test to assess each gender and experience group of the lecture. The results found that regarding the quality of e-learning teaching questionnaires scores, men were found to have higher scores than women. However, the teachers who had gone under the study showed a positive attitude to E-learning quality through lectures, and they would be interested in performing E-learning. Evaluating the quality of e-learning teaching is possible and well received by the lecturers. In addition, the assessment of quality learning helps to improve the system of e-learning at Vietnamese universities.

AB  - Given that today's younger generation will face the future environmental consequences of ecologically harmful purchasing habits, it is necessary to understand how the youth inherit green purchase attitudes from the older generation. This study aimed to examine the intergenerational transmission of green purchase attitudes from parents to their adolescent children in a non-Western country, the Philippines. Moreover, this study sought to investigate the mediating role of adolescents' social responsibility in the link between Filipino parents' and their adolescent children's green purchase attitudes. Using 437 parent-adolescent dyads, our findings revealed that parents who endorse positive attitudes toward purchasing green products could influence their adolescent children's favorable attitudes in buying ecofriendly products via an increase in adolescents' social responsibility. Implications for parenting, education, and policy as channels to promote environmentally responsible purchasing in non-Western and developing nations such as the Philippines are discussed.

The aim of this program is the restoration of dignity to patients and institutions. Media play an important role in shaping the view of an average person on psychiatric patients and most programms use media as a mediator to promote a positive attitude to psychiatric disorders. Apart from ignorance, fear and hostility they have to deal with self-stigma, as well. Through anti-stigma programs, psychoeducation of patients and families about the disorder and treatment options we can give them an acitve role in the treatment, restore dignity, self-confidence, quality of life and reintegrate them into the society.

AB  - Background
   Behavioral intentions (motivational factors), attitudes, subjective norm (social pressures), and perceived behavioral control promote or discourage smoking behavior among adolescents.
   Objective
   To assess students' behavioral intentions, attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control on smoking using the Theory of Planned Behavior. The prevalence of smoking among the adolescents is also calculated.
   Methods
   In this cross-sectional study, structured self-administered questionnaires were used to collect data from adolescents in primary and secondary schools. Data on demographics, behavioral intentions, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control towards smoking were collected. Pearson product moment correlations and logistic regression models were used to determine factors associated with current smoking.
   Results
   A total sample of 2554 (mean age = 15; Range = 12-18 years) students participated in the study. Twenty-nine percent (n = 728) of the students had tried smoking at least once. Smoking was predicted by attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and intention.There was a strong association between having a parent or guardian, caregiver or close friend who smoked (p < 0.001) and being a smoker. The majority of students (57%) conveyed that adults talked to them about the harmful effects of cigarette smoking and 50% had discussed smoking concerns with their friends. Students who had positive attitudes towards smoking like "smoking makes you confident" were more likely to be current smokers (OR: 1.63, 95% CI: 1.03-2.59). The feeling or conviction that they could refuse a cigarette if offered was an impediment from smoking (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.13-0.26).
   Conclusions
   Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control contributed significantly to the students' smoking. Right attitudes must be cultivated and behavioral control must be strengthened for early effective interventions to curtail smoking among adolescents.

However, one major issue that is generally overlooked is whether the thematic relevance of emotive triggers leads to differential effects on people's reactions to international terrorism. Specifically, does angerregardless of its sourcetend to drive people towards supporting an aggressive foreign policy option to counter terrorism, or do the thematic underpinnings of anger (i.e., the specific contents that trigger this particular emotion, such as watching a news story about a recent terrorist attack) matter vis-a-vis the policy choice? To address this gap, this study experimentally examines the impact of angerinduced by thematically relevant versus irrelevant emotive triggerson people's cognitive processing and foreign policy preferences regarding international terrorism. Overall, we find that the induction of anger via thematically relevant emotive triggers leads to a higher tendency for selecting a military option, a lower amount of information acquisition, and a shorter processing time in response to terror-related incidents.

AB  - Purpose This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the types and sources of information sought by older adults along with their motivations in the Midwestern United States. Design/methodology/approach Interviews were conducted with 30 older adults residing in rural communities around the Midwestern United States during late-summer (July/August) 2020, using a protocol based on Dervin's Sense-Making Methodology. The resulting data was analyzed using standard content analysis procedures, guided by the theoretical frameworks based on Dervin's Sense-Making and Williamson's Ecological Model of Information Behavior. Implications of COVID-19 for the normative behaviors described in these models are discussed. Findings Findings show that older adults were concerned primarily with health and political information during this period, but that this information was not necessarily sought only to address an informational need, but also to satisfy the need to maintain social and emotional connections in coping with isolation and loneliness. Sources of information that allowed for social interaction with people were favored. Wider personal networks (community members) were strained by the social distancing measures and closures. These findings have theoretical and practical implications for considering the impact of social restrictions on information seeking behaviors of older adults in a time of crisis. Originality/value This study is the first, known to the authors, that applied the two adopted theoretical frameworks to explore information seeking behaviors of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - In Mexico, many seniors are alone for most of the day or live in public nursing homes. Simple interaction with computer systems is required for older people. This is why we propose the exploration of a medium well known by seniors, such as the television (TV). The primary objective of this study is to improve the quality of life of seniors through an easier reminder system, using the television set. A technological platform was designed based on interactive television, through which seniors and their caregivers can have a better way to track their daily activities. Finally, an evaluation of the technology adoption was performed with 50 seniors living in two public nursing homes. The evaluation found that the elderly perceived the system as useful, easy to use, and they had a positive attitude and good intention to use it. This helped to generate initial evidence that the system supported them in achieving a better quality of life, by reminding them to take their medications and increasing their rate of attendance to their medical appointments.

AB  - Background Previous research has shown that high levels of trait social anxiety (SA) disrupt the social repair processes following a painful social exclusion, but the cognitive mechanisms involved in these processes and how trait SA may disrupt them remain unknown. Methods We conducted a preregistered study on Prolific participants (N = 452) who were assigned to experience either social exclusion or inclusion and were then exposed to follow-up opportunities for social reconnection. Results Moderated mediation analyses revealed that irrespective of levels of SA, participants responded to social pain with heightened approach motivation and greater downstream positive affect. Exploratory analyses revealed that heightened desire to affiliate was driven by increased curiosity and attention to social rewards. Moreover, higher SA was associated with lower overall desire to affiliate and this relationship between SA and affiliation was mediated by diminished reward responsiveness. Conclusions Findings highlight the roles of goal pursuit and social reward responsiveness in social repair and how high levels of trait SA may disrupt these processes.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the awareness and attitudes of medical radiologists toward the subspecialty of oral and maxillofacial (OMF) radiology. Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used, and an electronic questionnaire was sent out to radiologists in Saudi Arabia. The data from the 19-questions survey was collected between September 2018 and June 2020. Results: Despite the frequency of requests for imaging of the OMF region, most of the radiologists (82.8%) in our study have never consulted with an OMF radiologist. The majority of the radiologists (61.2%) reported not knowing an OMF radiologist, and another significant number (40.8%) had instead consulted with head and neck medical radiologists or neuroradiologists. In contrast, 80% were willing to collaborate with OMF radiologists in the future, and 70.7% supported establishing an online referral system to OMF radiologists. Conclusion: Most of the radiologists in this study were not aware of the subspecialty of OMF radiology. The majority of medical radiologists showed a positive attitude and willingness to collaborate with their dental counterparts. OMF radiologists should make their services available, accessible and proactively seek collaboration with other professionals.

AB  - Covid-19 will have significant impacts on the world, changing many aspects of our lives, including urban life and work routines. Challenges arising from the spread of the coronavirus are likely to push the digital infrastructure of cities, accelerating the transition towards the smart city. Additionally, we may see a permanent shift towards remote work arrangements, notably telecommuting and smart working. In the aftermath of the pandemic, the affirmation of such a scenario requires us to reflect on the challenges of an interconnected society produced by Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). Taking remote working as an illustrative example, the paper offers a critical reflection on how ICTs can influence our perceptions of places and argues that places play a key role in influencing the patterns of remote workers' identity construction. The authors caution about the dark side of digital connectivity, pointing at the risks that a prolonged detachment from reality and the loss of places can put on remote workers' identity. In order to overcome potential tensions, remote workers should avoid too much connectivity continuously balancing identity performance in both physical and virtual workplaces. Implications for both organizational and urban design are provided.

AB  - This article examines political transportation-the construction of mental models that represent a political world and result in the absorption and positioning of oneself within the constructed world. Specifically, we propose that when citizens become immersed in the political narrative crafted by a politician, they become more likely to see the political world as personally relevant and, subsequently, become more committed to supporting that candidate. Further, the degree of political immersion should depend upon which media platform a campaign message is delivered through. These expectations were tested using an experiment where partisans were exposed to a campaign message delivered in the form of a television ad, a political e-mail, or a series of tweets. Results demonstrate that Twitter was the least likely to lead to political immersion. Further, results provide support for our theoretical model, where there is an indirect effect of campaign messages on political attitudes and behavior through immersion and perceived personal relevance. Taken together, this study demonstrates the utility of applying the concept of narrative transportation to politics.

AB  - Although comprehensive digitalization (e.g., the provision of skills and resources) had already been placed on Austria's education policy agenda prior to the emergence of COVID-19, there is evidence that educators had some difficulty ensuring digital learning opportunities for their students when schools closed in early 2020. Against this backdrop, the present study, which drew on qualitative data from the large-scale INCL-LEA (Inclusive Home Learning) study, aimed to determine whether secondary school teachers (n = 17) from Viennese schools met the prerequisites for successfully implementing digital instruction, formulated in the Will-Skill-Tool model developed by Christensen and Kzenek (2008). Findings reveal that teachers primarily associated their sufficient digital skills with three factors: (1) basic interest and competence, (2) recently attended training, and/or (3) a positive attitude toward changing teaching practices. Interestingly, some educators recognized that digitization offers great potential for implementing individualized teaching approaches. However, the findings point to the didactic necessity of digital socialization in terms of social communication and inclusion when establishing emergency digital education.

AB  - Apart from the economic impact of the online gambling industry, the social, public order and health-related consequences of the industry merit analysis to inform appropriate action, regulatory or otherwise. The omnipresence of ICTs, the inability to use technologies properly, along with the growth of online gambling channels, have acted simultaneously as a catalyst for the spread of pathological and problematic gambling. In this context, social networks have become a highly effective platform to instil positive attitudes towards the products of gambling operators. This work uses the Natural Language Processing based web application "GPLSI Social Analytics" to track, in real time, the conversations generated on Twitter about the Spanish domain accounts of the main online sports gambling operators. The findings indicate that most of the messages about these operators are positive and Nu/prise is the predominant emotion associated with them. The notion of responsible online gambling barely receives a mention in the conversations analysed. Given the role of new technologies as access facilitators and potential enhancers of addictive behaviours, it is necessary to adopt measures directed at social networks that guarantee the coexistence of the right to freedom of expression with the protection of the most vulnerable populations.

AB  - Positive attitudes toward change (PATC) are an important current issue in public organizations facing profound financial and managerial reforms. This study aims to identify social and organizational antecedents of PATC. The investigated population is composed of middle managers working in Swiss public hospitals (N = 720), which are currently being confronted by major reforms. Partial mediation effects of organizational commitment (OC) in the relationships between independent variables and PATC are also controlled. The findings show that perceived social support (work relationships with colleagues and supervisors) as well as perceived organizational support (employee voice and participation, information and communication, work-life balance) are positively and significantly related to PATC. Stress perception is shown to have a negative impact on PATC. This article provides valuable contributions with respect to antecedents of attitudes toward change in a population of public middle managers.

AB  - This study aimed to explore the relationship between knowledge sharing intentions and the perceptions of individual technology users who are members of virtual communities. We characterized learners' perceptions of new technological products or services by including both an individual's psychological state of readiness to accept technology and also compatibility as factors affecting technology acceptance. By adopting virtual communities as samples for this empirical study, the Technology Acceptance Model, Technology Readiness Index, and the factor of compatibility were integrated in order to explore users' perceptions of technology. We analyzed the responses of 218 participants from these virtual communities using structural equation modeling. The empirical results showed that an individual's positive attitude, such as optimism, toward the Technology Readiness Index positively affects acceptance of technology; an individual's negative perception of the Technology Readiness Index, such as discomfort, has a negative effect on his or her sense of the perceived ease of technology and compatibility in regard to prior experience and technology. A sense of insecurity toward the new technology also showed a significant effect on the individual's perceptions of the usefulness of technology. The results of this research demonstrated that improving an individual's degree of adaptability to technology could increase knowledge-sharing intentions in virtual communities. Meanwhile, the degree of the individual's discomfort with technology did not hinder knowledge-sharing intentions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose - Brands facing a crisis have to decide whether to disclose crisis-related information themselves or to wait and take the risk that a third party breaks the news. While brands might benefit from self-disclosing the information, it is likely that the impact of crisis communication on customers' evaluation of the brand depends on the type of crisis. This study aims to investigate the influence of type of crisis on the relationshp between disclosure and brand outcomes.
   Design/methodology/approach - A 2 x 2 between-subjects experiment with 180 Dutch participants was conducted.
   Findings - Results show that self-disclosure of a negative incident positively affects consumers' attitude, trust and purchase intention compared to third-party disclosure. Additionally, disclosure and crisis type interact. In times of a product-harm crisis, self-disclosure does not represent an advantage to third party disclosure, while in times of a moral-harm crisis disclosure by the brand is able to maintain customers' positive attitude towards and trust in the brand compared to disclosure by a third party. Moreover, blame attribution mediates the effect of crisis type on brand evaluations.
   Originality/value - Recent research indicates that self-disclosing crisis information instead of waiting until thunder strikes has beneficial effects for a brand in times of crisis. However, these studies use the context of product-harm crises, which neglects the possible impact of moral-harm crises. Furthermore, this study adds the impact of blame attributions as a mediator in this context.

AB  - We explore how negative attitudes toward the unemployed are related to countries' overall and long-term (LT) unemployment rate. Insights from the risk attribution and position theory are combined with the in-group-out-group conflict model, derived from migration literature. Multilevel analyses are performed on two waves (2008 and 2016) of the European Social Survey. Negative attitudes toward the unemployed are measured via the item "most unemployed people do not really try to find a job." Results show that in countries with a high LT unemployment rate and/or an increase in this rate, people are more likely to hold negative attitudes toward the unemployed. Moreover, this is more pronounced among people in secure job conditions (those with a permanent contract and/or perceiving job security).

TI  - Resumption of School amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Rapid Assessment of Knowledge, Attitudes, and Preventive Practices among Final-Year Senior High Students at a Technical Institute in Ghana
T2  - EDUCATION RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
LA  - English
AB  - Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about significant challenges to Ghana's education system, leading to the closure of schools for months. On 31 May 2020, the government of Ghana took a bold decision based on expert advice to reopen schools for final-year students amid the COVID-19 pandemic. However, data for students' knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 are limited. We sought to investigate students' level of knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 at Tamale Technical Institute, Ghana. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 175 final-year students from June to August 2020. A validated questionnaire adapted from previous studies was distributed to the students in their various classes by the researchers. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, analysis of variance, and multivariate logistic regression. All analyses were significant at a p value of less than 0.05. Results. The mean age of the study participants was 21.1 years (SD = 2.67), with more males (72.0%) than females participating in the study. The majority (69.7%) of the students trust traditional media sources, i.e., television and radio to receive COVID-19-related information. Awareness about COVID-19 was high (98.3%), and in total, 62.9% (n = 110) had good knowledge, 58.3% (n = 102) had positive attitudes, and 54.9% (n = 96) had good practices towards COVID-19. Factors associated with knowledge were receiving education on COVID-19 (AOR = 0.23; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.55) and mother level of education (AOR = 0.13; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.66). Positive attitudes towards COVID-19 were 63% less likely among students who did not receive education on COVID-19 (AOR = 0.37; 95% CI: 0.15, 0.90). Students who received education on COVID-19 exhibited good practice towards COVID-19 than students who did not receive education on COVID-19 (p = 0.014). Conclusion. Final-year students of Tamale Technical Institute possess good knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward COVID-19. Our findings demonstrate the significant role of health education in improving students' knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19. We recommend continuous and targeted health education to mitigate the widespread misconceptions about COVID-19 through the use of traditional media such as television and radio.

AB  - The authors conducted an experiment among U.S. college students (N=115) to assess the effects of anger- and sadness-framed television antismoking advertisements on viewers' emotional response, impressions of the speaker, source likability, and empathy toward the speaker. The study was based on the fundamental assumptions of discrete emotions and was operationalized using the principles of universal facial expressions. The authors also constructed a path model to investigate how these variables predicted one's attitude toward smoking, attitude toward the tobacco industry, and intentions to smoke. Supporting study hypotheses, the anger-framed message increased the perceived dominance of the speaker relative to the other conditions. Perceived dominance, in turn, was negatively associated with smoking attitudes and, indirectly, smoking intentions. Contrary to study hypotheses, the sadness-framed message did not increase sad emotional responses, source likability, or empathy relative to the no emotion-framed message. The anger-framed message unexpectedly appeared to decrease these outcomes. Empathy and source likability were associated with positive attitudes toward the tobacco industry, but these attitudes did not predict intentions to smoke. The authors discuss the implications of these findings.

AB  - In this paper, an Ensemble of Kalman filter (EnKf) approach is developed to estimate unmeasurable state variables and unknown parameters in a COVID-19 model. We first formulate a mathematical model for the dynamic transmission of COVID-19 that takes into account the circulation of free coronaviruses in the environment. We provide the basic properties of the model and compute the basic reproduction number R-0 that plays an important role in the outcome of the disease. After, assuming continuous measurement of newly COVID-19 reported cases, deceased and recovered individuals, the EnKf approach is used to estimate the unmeasured variables and unknown COVID-19 transmission rates using real data of the current COVID-19 pandemic in Cameroon. We present the forecasts of the current pandemic in Cameroon and explore the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as mass media-based sensitization, social distancing, face-mask wearing, contact tracing and the desinfection and decontamination of infected places by using suitable products against free coronaviruses in the environment in order to reduce the spread of the disease. Through numerical simulations, we find that at that time (i) R-0 approximate to 2.9495 meaning that the disease will not die out without any control measures, (ii) the infection from COVID-19 infected cases is more important than the infection from free coronaviruses in the environment, (iii) the number of new COVID-19 cases will still increase and there is a necessity to increase timely the surveillance by using contact tracing and sensibilisation of the population to respect social distancing, face-masks wearing through awareness programs and (iv) the eradication of the pandemic is highly dependent on the control measures taken by governments.

AB  - A growing body of research suggests that affective computing has many valuable applications in enterprise systems research and e-businesses. This paper explores affective computing techniques for a vital sub-area in enterprise systems-consumer satisfaction measurement. We propose a linguistic-based emotion analysis and recognition method for measuring consumer satisfaction. Using an annotated emotion corpus (Ren-CECps), we first present a general evaluation of customer satisfaction by comparing the linguistic characteristics of emotional expressions of positive and negative attitudes. The associations in four negative emotions are further investigated. After that, we build a fine-grained emotion recognition system based on machine learning algorithms for measuring customer satisfaction; it can detect and recognize multiple emotions using customers' words or comments. The results indicate that blended emotion recognition is able to gain rich feedback data from customers, which can provide more appropriate follow-up for customer relationship management.

AB  - In the current era, interacting with Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an everyday activity. Understanding the interaction between humans and AI is of potential value because, in future, such interactions are expected to become more pervasive. Two studies-one survey and one experiment-were conducted to demonstrate positive effects of anthropomorphism on interactions with smart-speaker-based AI assistants and to examine the mediating role of psychological distance in this relationship. The results of Study 1, an online survey, showed that participants with a higher tendency to anthropomorphize their AI assistant/s evaluated it/them more positively, and this effect was mediated by psychological distance. In Study 2, the hypotheses were tested in a more sophisticated experiment. Again, the results indicated that, in the high-anthropomorphism (vs. low anthropomorphism) condition, participants had more positive attitudes toward the AI assistant, and the effect was mediated by psychological distance. Though several studies have demonstrated the effect of anthropomorphism, few have probed the underlying mechanism of anthropomorphism thoroughly. The current research not only contributes to the anthropomorphism literature, but also provides direction to research on facilitating human-AI interaction.

AB  - Introduction: On December 31, 2020, the Chinese government announced that the domestic coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have obtained approval for conditional marketing and are free for vaccination. This release drove the attention of the public and intense debates on social media, which reflected public attitudes to the domestic vaccine. This study examines whether the public concerns and public attitudes to domestic COVID-19 vaccines changed after the official announcement.Methods: This article used big data analytics in the research, including semantic network and sentiment analysis. The purpose of the semantic network is to obtain the public concerns about domestic vaccines. Sentiment analysis reflects the sentiments of the public to the domestic vaccines and the emotional changes by comparing the specific sentiments shown on the posts before and after the official announcement.Results: There exists a correlation between the public concerns about domestic vaccines before and after the official announcement. According to the semantic network analysis, the public concerns about vaccines have changed after the official announcement. The public focused on the performance issues of the vaccines before the official approval, but they cared more about the practical issues of vaccination after that. The sentiment analysis showed that both positive and negative emotions increased among the public after the official announcement. "Good" was the most increased positive emotion and indicated great public appreciation for the production capacity and free vaccination. "Fear" was the significantly increased negative emotion and reflected the public concern about the safety of the vaccines.Conclusion: The official announcement of the approval for marketing improved the Chinese public acceptance of the domestic COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, safety and effectiveness are vital factors influencing public vaccine hesitancy.

AB  - Aim: To test a theoretical model based on Cohen's dental profession factors (training; practitioner attitudes; geography) to investigate practitioners' willingness to treat adolescents with learning disabilities (LD) in primary dental care. Participants: A sample of all 537 primary care dentists working in a mainly urban area of Northern Ireland and a more rural area of Scotland. Main outcome measure: Willingness to treat adolescents with LD. Method: Questionnaire survey of demographic profile, undergraduate education, current knowledge, attitudes towards individuals with LD and willingness to treat this patient group. A path analytical approach (multiple meditational model) was used. Results: Three hundred dentists participated giving a valid response rate of 61%. Undergraduate education and current knowledge (training) strengthened a social model perspective promoting positive attitudes and willingness to treat adolescents with LD. Undergraduate education and current knowledge about disability did not significantly contribute to dentists whose attitudes were underpinned by the medical model of disability. Therefore geography (rural or urban location) was not an influential factor in willingness to treat adolescents with LD. This does not exclude the possibility that area of work may have an influence as a consequence of undergraduate university attended. Conclusion: This model identifies the importance of undergraduate and continuing dental education with regard to modifying professional attitudes (social and clinical factors) to assist practitioners treat adolescents with LD and provide them with inclusive dental services in primary dental care.

   Design/methodology/approach - An online survey was conducted with a sample of 318 virtual community participants for a structural equation model test.
   Findings - The structural and cognitive social capital, peer influence, and perceived usefulness positively contribute to virtual community participants' attitudes and intentions toward knowledge adoption. Lurkers' attitudes are more influenced by network ties, reciprocity norms, shared vision, and perceived usefulness, whereas posters are more affected by social trust and shared language.
   Research limitations/implications - The results produced in the Chinese context may not fully apply to other cultures.
   Practical implications - Devising effective strategies to increase social capital and content value is crucial for fostering virtual community members' positive attitudes toward knowledge adoption.
   Originality/value - This study is one of the first to combine and examine social capital and technology acceptance theories with regard to the knowledge adoption intentions of posters and lurkers in virtual communities.

Internet-based interventions are particularly suitable for this purpose. They are easily scalable, readily accessible, and the online format allows for adherence to social distancing. For this reason, we developed an internet-based self-help intervention called ROCO to address psychological distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This randomized controlled trial aimed to examine the efficacy of the ROCO intervention.
   Methods: A total of 107 German-speaking adults with at least mild depressive symptoms were randomized either to the intervention group with direct access to the three-week ROCO intervention plus care as usual or the waiting control group receiving care as usual. Primary outcome (depressive symptoms) and secondary outcomes (stress, anxiety, resilience, emotion regulation, health-related quality of life, embitterment, loneliness, optimism, and self-efficacy) were assessed pre- and post-treatment and at a 6-week follow-up using self-report questionnaires (e.g. Patient Health Questionnaire-9 for depressive symptoms).
   Results: The average age was 40.36 years (SD = 14.59) and 81.3% of participants were female. The intervention did not significantly reduce primary depressive symptoms (between-group effect size: d = 0.04) and secondary outcomes such as anxiety and stress symptoms (between-group effect size: d = 0.19). However, the intervention led to a significant increase in emotion regulation skills (between-group effect size d = 0.35) and resilience (between-group effect size d = 0.38).
   Conclusions: The internet-based self-help intervention cannot be recommended for the purpose of reducing depressive symptoms. However, the increase in emotion regulation skills and resilience suggest that the intervention may be suitable for preventive purposes, like improving overall coping with psychological distress or potential stressors. Future research is needed to examine for whom and how the intervention is most effective.

AB  - Using data from the 2007 Baylor Religion Survey, I evaluate whether beliefs in heaven and hell are associated with attitudes toward physician-assisted suicide. I find that those who believe in heaven and those who believe in hell tend to have negative attitudes toward physician-assisted suicide, even when controlling for other religiosity and sociodemographic variables. I also find that the belief in hell mediates the effect of the belief in heaven on attitudes toward physician-assisted suicide, suggesting that the fear of hell, more so than the reward of heaven, may lead people to have negative attitudes toward physician-assisted suicide.

AB  - Background: Studies with healthy volunteers have demonstrated that antidepressants can improve immunoregulatory activity and thus they may have a potential to positively impact the disease course in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic and incurable condition. However, patients' views on the role of antidepressants in the management of their IBD are unknown. Thus, this study aimed to explore patients' experiences and opinions regarding the effect of antidepressants on IBD course before possibly undertaking future treatment trials with antidepressants.
   Methods: Semi-structured in-depth interviews with open-ended questions were conducted with a randomly selected sample of IBD patients recruited at the Australian public hospital IBD clinic and currently receiving antidepressants. A qualitative content analysis was undertaken to summarise patients' responses. A Visual Analogue Scale was used to provide a quantitative assessment of patients' experiences with antidepressants.
   Results: Overall, 15 IBD sufferers currently on antidepressants (nine females, six males) were interviewed. All 15 reported a positive response to antidepressants reporting they improved their quality of life, with minimal side-effects. Five patients (33.3%) felt the antidepressant had specifically improved their IBD course. Three patients noted how they believed the reduction in feelings of stress mediated the positive influence of the antidepressant on IBD course. Ten patients (66.7%) felt the antidepressants had not specifically influenced their IBD. Nine patients (60.0%) had a generally positive attitude towards antidepressants, four patients (26.7%) were ambivalent, and two patients (13.3%) held a negative view towards antidepressants. Twelve patients (80.0%) stated that they would be willing to participate in clinical trials.
   Conclusions: Antidepressants seem to be well tolerated by IBD patients. One third of patients reported an observable improvement of their IBD under the influence of this treatment. The positive attitude towards antidepressants in these participants may make the conduct of clinical trials to further assess for any specific role on IBD course feasible. However, due to a small sample size, a qualitative nature of this study and in light of the results of studies on other populations indicating reluctance to taking antidepressants at least in some patients, these results should be interpreted with caution until confirmed in quantitative studies.

AB  - Social cognitive models examining academic and career outcomes emphasize constructs such as attitude, interest, and self-efficacy as key factors affecting students' pursuit of STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) courses and careers. The current research examines another under-researched component of social cognitive models: social support, and the relationship between this component and attitude and self-efficacy in math and science. A large cross-sectional design was used gathering data from 1,552 participants in four adolescent school settings from 5th grade to early college (41 % female, 80 % white). Students completed measures of perceived social support from parents, teachers and friends as well as their perceived ability and attitudes toward math and science. Fifth grade and college students reported higher levels of support from teachers and friends when compared to students at other grade levels. In addition, students who perceived greater social support for math and science from parents, teachers, and friends reported better attitudes and had higher perceptions of their abilities in math and science. Lastly, structural equation modeling revealed that social support had both a direct effect on math and science perceived abilities and an indirect effect mediated through math and science attitudes. Findings suggest that students who perceive greater social support for math and science from parents, teachers, and friends have more positive attitudes toward math and science and a higher sense of their own competence in these subjects.

AB  - Critics claim that journalists spread a cynical view of politics, as their relation with politicians is characterized by mistrust and hyper-adversarialism. To gain an insight into how cynical journalists themselves are about politics and how this can be explained, this article investigates the role relationship between politicians and journalists in four European countries with different political communication systems. The empirical basis for the study is a survey of over 400 political reporters from the UK, Denmark, Germany and Spain. Compared to their colleagues in Northern Europe, Spanish journalists have the most cynical view of politicians, which can partly be explained by feelings of political pressure. Journalists are cynical when they have a negative view of the role of spin doctors and believe that politicians use the media as a podium where they can be in the spotlight. The possible influence of journalists' political attitudes on news content is discussed.

AB  - The goal of this study was to identify mechanisms associated with chronic loneliness by examining the effect of adolescents' accumulated history of loneliness on responses to new social situations. Specifically, this study investigated whether attributions and emotions in situations of social inclusion and exclusion differ between chronically lonely adolescents and adolescents with a different loneliness history. A total of 730 adolescents (M-age at Wave 1 = 15.43 years) participated in a 4-wave longitudinal study with annual loneliness assessments. A chronic loneliness trajectory was identified, in addition to low-stable, moderate-stable, moderate-increasing, and high-decreasing loneliness trajectories. At Wave 4, vignettes depicting social inclusion and exclusion were presented, and participants rated a set of attributions and emotions following each vignette. Compared with individuals following other trajectories, chronically lonely adolescents were characterized by hypersensitivity to social exclusion (i.e., higher levels of negative emotions) and hyposensitivity to social inclusion (i.e., lower levels of enthusiasm). Further, chronically lonely adolescents had a stronger tendency to attribute social inclusion to circumstantial factors and social exclusion to internal and stable characteristics. This maladaptive attribution style partially mediated their emotional experiences. Together, results indicate that chronically lonely individuals respond to social situations in ways that may perpetuate rather than reduce their loneliness.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper was to validate the short version of personal optimism and self-efficacy optimism scale developed by Gavrilov-Jerkovic et al. (2014) on a sample of 398 employees working in private and public sector organizations in India.
   Design/methodology/approach The study needs to test the psychometric properties of the Indian version of scale by using exploratory factor analysis, convergent validity, discriminant validity and confirmatory factor analysis.
   Findings The results supported for the two-dimensional factor-structure of optimism in consonance with Gavrilov-Jerkovic et al. (2014).
   Research limitations/implications The findings will benefit both the management and the employees. Also, the study expands the existing literature on the variable in the Indian context.
   Originality/value The work validates and provides a unique instrument to measure the employee optimism that can help the management and the employees to focus on themselves to increase the positivity to provide an innovative and creative environment. Also, the work supplements the existing literature on positive attitude or outcome expectancies and helps in establishing the bi-dimensional nature of the construct of optimism.

AB  - Recognition of the health effects of social isolation has led to the media framing it as a public health issue. In this paper, we examine how the media frame social isolation among older people and how the public respond to this framing. Using framing analysis, we analysed an online article, embedded video content and 369 comments posted in response to this article. The article used a recognisable public health framing to understand the causes of social isolation as structural, supported by a video which presented the private face of a public health problem. The online comments largely resisted this framing, arguing that social isolation reflected an individual deficit, best remedied through individual actions such as joining groups or having a positive attitude. Families were also viewed as responsible for the social lives of their members, and social isolation was attributed to neglectful families. Commenters also suggested that alleviating social isolation was the responsibility of neighbours and volunteers. These three arguments accounted for 88% of the comments. Much less commonly, social isolation was described as due to the march of Western civilisation. This analysis shows how the public are active in their response to, and largely rejection of, framing social isolation as a public health issue. Although the health impacts of social isolation were endorsed, this was insufficient for structural explanations to prevail. Public health campaigners need to understand how individualising accounts of health issues are used to undermine public health explanations so as to most effectively challenge them.

AB  - Support for democracy is based on warmth, inclusiveness, and a general belief that others are well-intentioned. It is also related to a willingness to respect the rights of outgroups which do not necessarily share the views of one's ingroup. In this research, we analysed the relationships between different types of national identity and support for democracy. In two surveys (Study 1; American participants, n = 407 and Study 2; Polish participants; n = 570), we found that support for democracy was negatively linked to collective narcissism, measured in relation to the national group, previously associated with negative intra- and inter-group outcomes. The effect of national narcissism on democracy support was present even when accounting for national identification. In Study 2, we also found that this effect was mediated by social cynicism - a negative view of human nature. In both studies, support for democracy was positively linked to a secure national identity, that is national identification without the narcissistic component, which tends to be associated with positive attitudes towards others. We discuss implications for understanding the role of national identity in support for (il)liberal politics.

AB  - Purpose To report changes in adult hospital admission rates for acute ENT infections following the introduction of COVID-19-related physical interventions such as hand washing, use of face masks and social distancing of 2-m in the United Kingdom. Methods Retrospective cohort study comparing adult admissions with acute tonsillitis, peritonsillar abscess, epiglottitis, glandular fever, peri-orbital cellulitis, acute otitis media, acute mastoiditis, retropharyngeal abscess and parapharyngeal abscess in the 1-year period after the introduction of COVID-related physical interventions (2020-2021) with a 1-year period before this (2019-2020) in three UK secondary care ENT departments. Results In total, there were significantly fewer admissions for ENT infections (n = 1073, 57.56%, p < 0.001; RR 2.36, 95% CI [2.17, 2.56]) in the 2020-2021 period than in the 2019-2020 period. There were significant reductions in admissions for tonsillitis (64.4%; p < 0.001), peritonsillar abscess (60.68%; p < 0.001), epiglottitis (66.67%; p < 0.001), glandular fever (38.79%; p = 0.001), acute otitis media (26.85%; p = 0.01) and retropharyngeal and/or parapharyngeal abscesses (45.45%; p = 0.04). Conclusion Our study demonstrates a sizeable reduction in adult admissions for ENT infections since the introduction of COVID-19-related physical interventions. There is evidence to support the use of physical interventions in the prevention of viral transmission of respiratory disease. Preventing ENT infections requiring admission through simple physical interventions could be of great benefit to the quality of life of patients and economical benefit to healthcare systems.

AB  - In this paper, we study the short-run evolution of political trust during the recent covid-19 pandemic using survey data for a sample of young individuals living in Germany, France, Italy, and Spain. In particular, we analyze whether pre-pandemic perceptions and experiences of citizens about various dimensions of local governments and institutional quality had any mediating effect on the evolution of political trust after the outbreak of the covid-19 pandemic. The results show a relative increase in political trust of about 9% in regions with high institutional quality (75th percentile) compared with regions with low institutional quality (25th percentile) over the period 2019-2020. This divergence can be associated with either a better performance of policymakers in high-quality institutions regions, or to more positive attitudes toward politicians by citizens that, before the pandemic, believed to live in regions with efficient institutions. Overall results are not affected by the inclusion of regional fixed effects or by possible differential evolution of political trust according to a large set of observable regional characteristics.

AB  - AimThe aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between social support, decisional conflict, and attitude towards advance directives, and determine whether decisional conflict mediates the relation between social support and advance directives attitude among older adults in South Korea.
   MethodsIn total, 209 community-based older adults (mean age, 74.82 years) participated in this cross-sectional study. Demographic characteristics, self-perceived health status, social support, decisional conflict, and advance directives attitude were investigated via a structured questionnaire. Data analysis was carried out using Pearson's correlation and path analyses.
   ResultsThe mean score of advance directives attitude was 48.01 (range, 35-61). Decisional conflict and social support were both significantly related to advance directives attitude (P<0.001). Additionally, decisional conflict was a mediator between social support and advance directives attitudes.
   ConclusionThe results confirmed the importance of social support for reducing decisional conflict and encouraging positive attitudes toward advance directives. Future studies are needed to support the development of culturally sensitive educational approaches regarding advance directives for older adults in Korea.

AB  - Safety training programs are one of the tools provided for by law in order to promote workers' safe behaviours. However, to date few studies have been carried out in order to assess the effectiveness of these training programs. Our study, conducted on a sample of 345 workers of three companies in northern Italy. aimed to test the hypothesis that the impact of safety training on unsafe behaviours is mediated by workers' psychosocial orientation with regards to safety, in particular by factors such those that the Theory of Planned Behaviour considers predictors of the behavioural intention (i.e., attitudes towards behaviour, subjective norms or perception of safety climate, and perceived behavioural control.). Our results showed that those workers who had attended a training program reported behaving unsafely less frequently than those who had not. This was not due to a better knowledge of the norms, but was mediated by positive attitudes towards safe behaviour and the perception of a safety climate. In addition, we found that liking of the training program played a motivational role in enhancing the effects of training on safe behaviour.

AB  - Social media is increasingly gaining traction as a valuable tool for small business. This is particularly the case in micro enterprises in the Indonesian retail industry, where adoption is anecdotally increasing, but with little understanding of the factors enabling such adoption. Consequently, this study proposes a research model derived from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and the Use of Technology and extended by integrating the task-technology-fit framework, along with price value propositions. Online surveys were sent to micro enterprises operating in the Indonesian retail industry with 153 valid responses received. Data analysis used structural equation modelling with SmartPLS 3. The results show that price value and task-technology-fit are perceived as significant factors for influencing positive attitudes towards the adoption of social media among micro enterprises. In addition, attitude and facilitating conditions were found to have a significant influence on intention to adopt social media. These findings hold import implications to theory and practice in this nascent field of research.

AB  - Recently, Machiavellianism was identified as potential mediator explaining gender differences in meat-eating justification strategies, which in turn predicted meat consumption. The current study aimed to - on the one hand - replicate this empirical finding and to - on the other hand - investigate the mediating role of the Dark Triad with regard to gender differences in pro-environmental attitudes. Five-hundred-forty-eight participants took part in the study. Women compared to men justified meat-eating less and held more positive attitudes toward the environment. More importantly, we replicated the finding that the association between gender and meat-eating justification strategies is mediated by Machiavellianism. Additionally, the association between gender and pro-environmental attitudes was mediated by psychopathy. These findings support the idea that while Machiavellianism is an important mediator explaining gender differences in meat-eating justification strategies, psychopathy is able to explain gender differences in attitudes toward the environment.

AB  - The secondary sneaker market is rather unique in that unlike items in other resale fashion categories (e.g., clothing), sneakers often resell for more than their original retail price. This market has risen to dizzying heights fueled by social media and collaborations with celebrities and designers which, coupled with limited availablility of merchandise, have generated great consumer demand and interest surrounding this market. The aim of this study was to investigate popular culture and social media and their influence on fashion conscious consumers interested in secondary sneaker retailers (i.e., StockX, GOAT) as well as their further impact on purchase intentions. The authors utilized the theory of reasoned action (TRA) to examine consumer behavior toward secondary sneaker retailers. The findings support the TRA, suggesting that the social mechanisms of interest (i.e., popular culture and social media) positively influence consumers, who report high levels of fashion consciousness and subsequent positive attitudes toward the secondary sneaker retailer, subjective norms, and ultimately purchase behavior vis-a-vis secondary sneakers. The findings of this study will enable industry practitioners and members of academia to gain a deeper understanding of this phenomenon.

AB  - Purpose Media-a powerful influence on mental illness stigma-varies by language and culture. Nevertheless, recent meta-analyses have demonstrated scant attention to Spanish language media as well as historically low Latinx participation in mental illness anti-stigma intervention. To better inform how to improve equity in mental health service utilization, this study assessed how language preferences in mass media influence stigma among Latinx adolescents, compared to family language and social preferences. Methods Sixth-graders self-identifying as Latinx self-completed assessments of mental illness knowledge/positive attitudes and desired separation from peers and adolescent vignette characters experiencing mental illness (N = 179; Texas, U.S., 2011-2012). Participants also responded to measures of language preferences (any Spanish versus only English) for consuming media (film/television, music/radio) and speaking with family (parents/grandparents), and social preferences for parties or social gatherings (Latinx versus Anglo persons). Linear regression models adjusting for student and household factors examined the associations between media and family language and social preferences on mental illness stigma. Results Latinx adolescents preferring any Spanish versus English-only media reported less mental illness knowledge/positive attitudes and greater social separation from peers and vignette characters with a mental illness, net of all covariates. Family language and social preferences were not associated with any mental illness stigma outcomes. Conclusions Spanish media preference is associated with greater stigma suggesting more stigmatization may exist in Spanish- versus English-media. Ensuring anti-stigma messaging in Spanish media may reduce disparities in mental illness stigma among Latinx adolescents. These findings have implications for populations with other non-English media preferences.

AB  - Purpose Shifting to mobile-based banking transactions from physical banking transactions can be considered as a social distancing mechanism, which helps to prevent the spread of Covid-19 virus. As the spread of Covid-19 is expected to continue for long, the continued usage of mobile-based payment services as a strategy to maintain social distancing has to prevail. Hence, this study aims to propose an integrated framework of mobile payments adoption and its continuance intention by integrating health belief model (HBM) and expectation confirmation model (ECM) of information system continuance. Design/methodology/approach The subject of the study constitutes new adopters of mobile payments. A total of 654 respondents participated in the survey. The conceptual model was empirically validated using structural equation modeling and serial mediation analysis. Findings The study found that the HBM constructs, namely, perceived severity, perceived susceptibility and self-efficacy significantly influenced adoption/confirmation of mobile-based payment services. The continuance intention was significantly predicted by perceived usefulness and perceived satisfaction. Furthermore, the perceived health threat (comprising perceived severity and perceived susceptibility) indirectly affects continuance intention through confirmation, perceived usefulness and satisfaction. Practical implications There are short-term and long-term implications for the study. Short-term implications include triggering the HBM at policy levels, to adopt mobile payments/banking as a means of social distancing in the wake of the increasing threat of Covid-19 in India. Long-term implication for service providers is to convert adopters into loyal consumers by enhancing usefulness and satisfaction. Originality/value The study proposes a novel attempt to explain the adoption and continuance of mobile-based payment as a preventive health behavior to contain the spread of Covid-19 outbreak. The study proposes an integrated framework of HBM and ECM to explain pre-adoption and post-adoption behavior of consumers with respect to mobile-based payment services during Covid-19 context.

AB  - Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is a well-touted term in management disciplines that connects the business goals and societal values. CSR is used as a strategic approach that gives competitive differentiation through coagulation of both business and overarching societal goals. Organizations believe that goodwill created by CSR activities bestows the strategic competitive advantage and sustainable development. The objective of the study is to measure the impact of CSR activities on purchase intention either directly or indirectly; for this purpose, the study has administered a structured questionnaire and collected responses from Indian citizens purchasing products from FMCG companies topping the CSR spending list and used structural equation modeling to validate the results. The findings suggest that customers process CSR details unconsciously and may not remember the explicit detail, but they are more likely to include the brand in the consideration set evokedby positive attitudes trailing behind.

The study involved a survey followed by interviews, and aimed to capture the dynamic ways in which members of the Australian public perceive the impact of Covid practices - especially public health measures like the introduction of physical and social distancing, compulsory mask wearing, and contact tracing. In the rescripting of public space, different notions of formal and informal surveillance, along with different textures of mediated and social care, appeared. In this article, we explore perceptions around divergent forms of surveillance across social, technological, governmental modes, and the relationship of surveillance to care in our media and cultural practices. What does it mean to care for self and others during a pandemic? How does care get enacted in, and through, media interfaces and public interaction?

AB  - Social media's pervasiveness has created new demands for openness, transparency, real-time communication, and public engagement in diplomacy. In this study, we analyze public engagement strategies for diplomacy on Twitter that were employed by a German ambassador. By applying a text analytics approach, we explored the ambassador's tweets' core themes, how people reacted to those tweets, and what type of topics received higher engagement for 2 years. Eight themes emerged from our analysis of the tweets: democracy, politics and law; society and culture; conflict and violence; personality; environment and health; economic and social development; personal life; and embassy affairs. By analyzing the tweets' content, we present a public engagement model (PEM) for social media communication by highlighting 3 key factors that promote online public engagement: self-disclosure, positive attitude, and inquisitiveness. Results suggest that over 2 years, the German ambassador was a highly engaging personality in Pakistan, with around 4,369 interactions and highlighted positive diplomatic communication on Twitter. Tweets were positive, courteous, respectful, personalized, interactive, and direct.

AB  - This study examines the problem of characterizing the political communications system in Britain as a socio-political phenomenon. In the XX-XXI centuries, the intense growth of knowledge has shaped the socio-cultural and political activity of the population. Political communication becomes a separate area from human activity. In modern conditions, political communication is a set of processes, the source of which should be power. There are many processes in species diversity. Political communications in modern conditions have acquired the status of a social institution. The article attempts to present the institutional status of the phenomenon of political communication as a structure of three main components. First, the state as a governing body, represented by three powers: legislative, executive, and judicial. Secondly, society, which acts as the recipient of the initiatives of state power, or which has a positive attitude towards state policy or, negative and opposes, or has an attitude of waiting to see what happens. At the same time, there are groups in society that tend to actively intervene in politics. The third element of the political communication system is the media.

AB  - Anecdotal media reports suggest that countries led by women politicians have had better outcomes from combating the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper systematizes the evidence by using data on the presence of women heads of state and COVID-19 related infection and death rates in 144 countries. The regression results show that: (1) there is a negative and statistically significant correlation between COVID-19 outcomes and the presence of a woman head of state; (2) there is no evidence that countries led by women responded faster than countries led by men in implementing social distancing measures to "flatten" the infection curve; and (3) countries led by women have a higher rate of universal healthcare coverage than countries led by men; if the countries led by men had comparable levels of investment in a widely available healthcare system, their outcomes from fighting the pandemic would be similar.

AB  - Listening does not relate to improved communications in the way peasants are included in China's digital leap forward. Despite having access to cutting-edge communication technologies, the rural participants of this research find themselves with limited means to be involved in the politics of their village. Hungry for information relevant to participation, local calls for the reinstatement of wired radio and regular meetings in the village of Heyang are informed by memories of Maoist mass line politics. Combining historical analysis with ethnographic fieldwork and reflective listening, this article explores how peasants see discursive engagement as the best means to realize their interests.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a disproportionate effect on ethnic minorities. Across countries, greater vaccine hesitancy has been observed among ethnic minorities. After excluding foreign domestic helpers, South Asians make up the largest proportion of ethnic minorities in Hong Kong. It is necessary to plan for COVID-19 vaccination promotional strategies that cater to the unique needs of South Asians in Hong Kong. Objective: This study investigated the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine uptake among a sample of South Asians in Hong Kong. We examined the effects of sociodemographic data and factors at individual level (perceptions), interpersonal level (information exposure on social media), and sociostructural level (cultural) based on the socioecological model. Methods: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted on May 1-31, 2021. Participants were South Asian people aged 18 years or older living in Hong Kong; able to comprehend English, Hindi, Nepali, or Urdu; and having access to a smartphone. Three community-based organizations providing services to South Asians in Hong Kong facilitated the data collection. The staff of the community-based organizations posted the study information in WhatsApp groups involving South Asian clients and invited them to participate in a web-based survey. Logistic regression models were fit for data analysis. Results: Among 245 participants, 81 (33.1%) had taken at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (one dose, 62/245, 25.2%; and both doses, 19/245, 7.9%). After adjusting for significant background characteristics, cultural and religious reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were associated with lower COVID-19 vaccine uptake (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.71-0.97; P=.02). At the individual level, having more positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.31, 95% CI 1.10-1.55; P=.002), perceived support from significant others (AOR 1.29, 95% CI 1.03-1.60; P=.03), and perceived higher behavioral control to receive COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 2.63, 95% CI 1.65-4.19; P<.001) were associated with higher COVID-19 vaccine uptake, while a negative association was found between negative attitudes and the dependent variable (AOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.62-0.85; P<.001). Knowing more peers who had taken the COVID-19 vaccine was also associated with higher uptake (AOR 1.39, 95% CI 1.11-1.74; P=.01). At the interpersonal level, higher exposure to information about deaths and other serious conditions caused by COVID-19 vaccination was associated with lower uptake (AOR 0.54, 95% CI 0.33-0.86; P=.01). Conclusions: In this study, one-third (81/245) of our participants received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Cultural or religious reasons, perceptions, information exposure on social media, and influence of peers were found to be the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine uptake among South Asians. Future programs should engage community groups, champions, and faith leaders, and develop culturally competent interventions.

AB  - We present two studies examining the role of the British press in promoting heuristic-based decision-making about sexual crime. In Study 1, 1014 press articles were used in order to examine the role of the availability heuristic. That is, we used the recent high-profile Jimmy Savile sexual offending scandal to investigate how this case impacted upon press reporting of sexual crime. We found a 295% increase in the frequency of sexual crime coverage after this case, in addition to a 22:1 over-representation of sexual crime prevalence. Linguistically, tabloid stories about sexual crime did not significantly differ in the 12 months following the Jimmy Savile scandal, though broadsheets were less negative in their coverage after the scandal broke. Tabloid headline descriptors of sexual offenders were also substantially more offensive than those used by broadsheets. In Study 2, tabloid readership was associated with more negative attitudes and preferences for harsher punishments for sexual offenders, which we propose may be attributable to the affect heuristic. We discuss our findings within the context of dual-process cognition, and argue that the national press promote heuristic-based thinking about the issue of sexual offending. Future research avenues, and potential implications for press engagement, are also identified.

AB  - Previous corporate social responsibility (CSR) studies at the employee level have focused on the influence of CSR on employees' positive attitudes and behavior. However, little attention has been paid to the relationship between CSR and unethical behavior and the underlying mechanism. Based on social information processing theory, this study investigates how CSR affects employee cheating via employees' organizational identification and perceived supervisor moral decoupling. Additionally, this study discusses the moderating effect of employee bottom-line mentality on these relationships. We test this two-path model using a sample of MBA students in China. The results indicate that both organizational identification and perceived supervisor moral decoupling mediate the relationship between CSR and cheating, and employee bottom-line mentality moderates the effect of CSR on perceived supervisor moral decoupling. Specifically, for employees low in bottom-line mentality, CSR has a significantly negative impact on perceived supervisor moral decoupling, but the same relationship is insignificant for employees with a strong bottom-line mentality. Overall, our results uncover the relationship between CSR and employee cheating and extend the understanding of the influence of CSR on employees.

AB  - The present study aims to explain the processes through which family- supportive organizational perceptions (FSOP) relate to employee affective commitment. We suggest multiple mechanisms through which this relationship transpires-(a) the focal employee's experience of work-to-family conflict and enrichment and (b) the attitudes of the employee's spouse/partner. Hypotheses are tested with data from 408 couples. Results suggest that employee FSOP is positively associated with employee commitment through both employee work-to-family experiences and partner attitudes. FSOP was positively related to employee work-to-family enrichment, which was positively associated with employee affective commitment. FSOP was negatively associated with employee work-to-family conflict, which related to a partner's more positive attitude toward the employee's work schedule and higher commitment to the employee's firm. Partner commitment was positively and reciprocally related to employee affective commitment. These relationships partially mediated the FSOP-employee affective commitment relationship and varied as a function of parental status and single- versus dual-earner couple status but not as a function of employee gender. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - This research examines how visual representation of social media influencers affects perceptions and attitudes toward influencers and their persuasive messages. Using the theoretical frameworks of the Stereotype Content Model (SCM) and the Behaviors from Interpersonal Affect and Stereotypes (BIAS) Map, Study 1 demonstrated that influencers with broad smiles were perceived as warmer and more competent and evaluated more positively than those with closed smiles. Study 2 revealed that warmth and competence judgments led to admiration toward the smiling influencers, which in turn resulted in positive attitudinal and behavioral responses to their persuasive messages. By investigating the mediating effects of judgments and emotional responses toward influencers, this study reveals social cognitive mechanisms underlying psychological processing of influencer messaging.

AB  - This article examined how the group membership of the person being judged influenced the level of moral reasoning. Nearly 200 ordinary Italians were given two measures of moral ingroup inclusiveness (the Bogardus social distance scale and a self-categorization measure) and the short form of Rest's Defining Issues Test (DIT). The protagonists in the dilemmas were either Italian (ingroup member) or Romanian (outgroup member). Overall, the post-conventional score (P score) was related to higher inclusiveness. However, respondents with a narrow moral ingroup scored lower on post-conventional reasoning when the protagonists were Romanian (outgroup members) than when they were Italian. By contrast, those respondents with an inclusive moral ingroup obtained identical P scores on both types of dilemmas. Inclusiveness of the moral ingroup also mediated the relation of political affiliation and post-conventional reasoning.

AB  - Anti-immigrant attitudes are not only widespread among Eurosceptic nationalists, but also among people who feel that immigration threatens European values and identity. We therefore assumed that the connection between nationalism and xenophobia can only partially explain the rise of hostile attitudes in the post-2015 period. In two online surveys (N = 1,160), we compared how (a) glorification versus attachment and (b) national versus European identity can predict anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim attitudes in Hungary. In the first study, national and European glorification predicted higher anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim prejudice. However, attachment with Europe predicted positive, while attachment with Hungary predicted negative attitudes towards immigrants. We replicated this pattern in a second study and found that the different predictions of national versus European identities were mediated by attitudes towards the EU. Eurosceptic attitudes were associated with increased hostility towards both immigrants and Muslim people and reflected a perceived contradiction between the interest of the nation and that of the EU. We conclude that for a better understanding of intergroup hostility towards Muslim immigrants in Europe, we need to simultaneously consider the psychological phenomenon of ingroup glorification and the values and norms of the social categories with which people identify.

AB  - Purpose This study relied on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to assess factors that affected event fans' decisions regarding their intention to attend events by using social network websites. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of event fans' attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control on their intentions to go to events based on social networking sites (SNSs) marketing. In addition, the researchers examined the impact of perceived enjoyment on event fans' attitudes towards events pages on SNS. Design/methodology/approach This study used a quantitative research method and used an online survey distributed on Qualtrics and based on the TPB. Populations in the study were followers of events pages on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. The sample was convenience. Findings By using the partial least square-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), the study found that all the research hypothesis were supported except (H2). While event fans' attitudes had not a statistically significant impact on their behavioral intentions towards using social media to go to events (H2), perceived enjoyment had a statistically significant impact on event fans' attitudes towards events pages on SNS (H1). According to the research findings, event fans were influenced by their subjective norms (H3) and perceived behavioral control (H4). These factors significantly influenced event fans' behavioral intention, which led to their actual behavior (H5). Practical implications - This study provided evidence supporting that subjective norms and perceived behavioral control were effective in forming intention towards events page, which in turn affected actual behavior, while perceived enjoyment was effective in forming events fan attitudes towards events' social media pages. This may indicate a need for positive images of the events depicted through social media. In addition, when using social media as a marketing medium for events, event marketers and organizers should understand how other important people's opinions and perceptions affect the intention and behavior formation. This implies the need to stress the social acceptance of the events, and use family ties, family and other social- units elements of events. Social implications - This study provided statistical evidence supporting the applicability of the TPB within the context of event marketing and using social media. This implies a better understanding of the rational decision- making process, along with the social factors affecting the process of forming behavioral intentions and intentions. Furthermore, perceived enjoyment was incorporated within the model. Perceived enjoyment was effective in forming positive attitudes towards events' social media pages. This highlights the need to provide information and contents in an enjoyable and user- friendly way. Originality/ value - The value of this study is derived from its aim to highlight the importance of social media as an effective marketing tool for events. Moreover, this study sought to contribute to the literature on social media by exploring how social media affected event attendees' behavior and attitudes and by gauging the impact of social media on the event industry.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has arguably facilitated a shift toward increased sedentariness and reduced physical activity. Moreover, there is mounting evidence that mental health has also declined during the pandemic. However, it remains unknown to what extent social distancing (SD) behaviors and mental health have affected the physical activity levels of the general population.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of SD behaviors and prevailing mental health on the odds of being physically active during the early COVID-19 pandemic response.
   Methods: A total of 4819 adults (2474/4819, 51.3%, female) from the US population with a median age of 46 (IQR 35-59) completed an online survey during the early pandemic response (April-June 2020). The survey included questions on adherence to 11 SD behaviors, and validated questionnaires which assessed self-reported physical activity, depression, anxiety, and mental well-being. Respondents were categorized into 2 physical activity groups: inactive (0-599 metabolic equivalent of task [MET]-minutes/week) and active (600 MET-minutes/week). A logistic generalized additive model (GAM) was used to determine which SD factors and mental health outcomes were associated with physical activity level.
   Results: The GAM analysis revealed that wearing a facemask in public (odds ratio [OR] 1.46, 95% CI 1.14-1.79; P=.003), limiting the use of public transport (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.19-1.83; P=.001), and restricting travel outside the house (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.19-2.05; P=.002) were SD behaviors associated with higher odds of being more physically active. Conversely, avoiding physical activity outside the house was associated with higher odds of being inactive (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.46-0.63; P<.001). Leaving the house more frequently, and a higher mental well-being were associated with increasing odds of being physically active (P<.001). Engaging with a moderate number of SD behaviors (3-7 total) was positively associated with physical activity, whereas a very high SD vigilance (ie, engaging with 10 total behaviors) decreased the odds of being active during the early pandemic response.
   Conclusions: Based on the findings of our study, we suggest that future public health messaging of SD guidelines should include (1) a clear portrayal of the benefits of regular exercise on mental health; and (2) a specific focus on how to be physically active outdoors in a COVID-safe manner.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of using narratives to communicate a controversial health issue, gaming disorder, on adolescents' issue attitudes. In a between-subjects experiment, 115 adolescent participants read either a narrative or an informational message on gaming disorder. Results indicated that compared to the informational message, the narrative health message generated more positive attitudes toward the medical view of problematic gaming and greater attitude certainty. Transportation mediated the narrative's effect on attitudes. Behavioral involvement moderated the narrative's effect on attitudes and attitude certainty, such that the positive effects of the narrative on attitudes and attitude certainty were more pronounced for high-involvement adolescents than for low-involvement adolescents. In addition, behavioral involvement also enhanced the effect of message absorption on attitudes. By extending our research on narrative effects to the adolescent population, this study presents findings with both theoretical and practical implications.

AB  - Grounded in multidisciplinary literature from public relations, sport communication, and marketing, this study examined consumer reactions to sustainability initiatives launched by major sports leagues. Through an online survey (N = 254), the results showed that sports league-cause fit resulted in more positive organization-public relationships (OPRs) such as through trust, commitment, satisfaction, and control mutuality. Further, the findings revealed that a closer geographic proximity of the sustainability initiative and an increased perceived impact (donation amount and number of beneficiaries affected) triggered higher perceptions of trust, organizational authenticity, and fandom toward the sponsoring sports league. Interestingly, a significant two-way interaction between spatial proximity and impact suggested that lower perceptions of the impact of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) program evoked more positive attitudes when involving local beneficiaries, whereas higher perceptions of impact improved organizational attitudes when the beneficiaries were located faraway. Lastly, the findings indicated that the OPR variables, especially trust, as well as fandom, and organizational authenticity elicited higher supportive intentions (e.g., support CSR cause, donate, volunteer, share on social media) toward the sports league. Theoretical implications for fit, construal level theory, and CSR impact as well as implications for sport communication practitioners are discussed.

AB  - In 2016, the Special Region of Yogyakarta ranked 9th as the province with the highest number of people suffering from HIV/AIDS, especially in the Sleman District. Globally, AIDS is the second leading cause of death in adolescents aged 10-19 years. This study to aimed out factors affecting the behavior of adolescents toward HIV/AIDS prevention. This study used a cross-sectional study design. The sampling technique used was stratified random sampling that resulted in 59 respondents from 11th-grade students at Sleman 2 Senior High School who were selected as samples. Data were collected using a questionnaire and analyzed using Chi-square test and multiple logistic regression. The results showed that most respondents 66.1% had sufficient knowledge. More than a half (54.2%) of students showed supportive attitude. Information was mostly obtained from electronic media. Thirty-one students (52.5%) showed a positive attitude toward HIV/AIDS prevention. Chi-square test result showed that factors significantly related to adolescent's behavior toward HIV/AIDS prevention were knowledge and attitude. The most influential variable was attitude (p-value = 0.008; PR = 4.4; 95% CI = 1.4-13.1).

AB  - This study examines the influence of online product review and product knowledge on the attitude towards online shopping, which leads to online purchase behavior. Data are collected from an online questionnaire with the use of Google Forms posted on three popular toy enthusiast websites in Malaysia. Using a self-selected sampling procedure, 263 usable responses are obtained. Partial Least Squares Path Modeling (PLS-PM), using R, is performed to test the research hypotheses. Results show that, in general, respondents perceive online product review as a helpful tool in enabling them to learn more about toy products and in making them feel confident in purchasing toys online. Results also reveal that both perceived helpfulness of online product review and consumers' product knowledge are positively related to attitude towards online shopping. Similarly, a positive attitude towards online shopping leads to actual online purchases of toy products. Attitude is found to mediate the relationship between perceived helpfulness of online product review and online purchase behavior. This study suggests that firms should use online product review as an innovative marketing tool to acquire market intelligence and to establish ongoing rapport with their online customers.

AB  - Objective The aim of this study is to evaluate the attitude, knowledge and anxiety status of individuals about COVID-19 at the first period of the outbreak. Methods This was an observational study carried out in Turkey. An online semi-structured questionnaire was developed by using google forms and the link of the questionnaire was sent through emails, WhatsApp and other social media to the contacts of the investigators between 20th March 2020 and 25th March 2020. The questionnaire contained 21 questions and Beck anxiety scale. Results About 1070 people were included in the study. Approximately one-fifth of the participants had no idea about treatment and immunisation against COVID-19. According to the categorisation of Beck Anxiety Inventory scores 8.6% showed severe anxiety symptoms. Anxiety levels of women, healthcare workers and those with psychiatric illness were higher (P < .05). It was observed that women, healthcare professionals, those with chronic diseases and those with moderate to severe anxiety used the medical facemask more frequently (P < .05). About 73% of the participants thought that they fully implemented the proposed measures; 25.2% of them stated that population did not take any measures for the COVID-19. Conclusion According to the results of the study individuals usually had better awareness and positive attitudes towards COVID-19 pandemic, but there were also things that needed improvement. The most important measure to be taken in order to prevent anxiety from increasing is to ensure the correct access of information and to establish psychological support lines.

AB  - Background: Organs transplantation is the only treatment for end-stage organ failure. However, the disparity between organs availability and the number of patients in the waiting lists is widening globally, especially in Iraq for many reasons. This study aims to assess the level of attitudes and perceptions among Iraqi young adults towards organs donation and transplantation as the first study to be conducted in Iraq for such purpose.
   Methods: This observational study was conducted among 912 Iraqi young adults through a structured questionnaire which was disseminated among social media platforms. Participants consented before filling the questionnaire and their responses were analyzed to test the hypothesis of the study.
   Results: Most of the participants were females, Muslims and in their undergraduate level. Overall, 84.2% of the participants were willing to donate their organs after death and (97.9%) of them actually agreed to sign for organs donation. Most of those who were not willing to donate have no idea whether their religion approves it or not. There was no statistically significant difference in willingness to donate between different socioeconomic classes or residency areas.
   Conclusions: Most of the participants are convinced with donating their organs after death and are willing to sign for organ donation programs, advocating for initiating an official governmental transplant agency with multiple local committees distributed among health directorates all over the country managing it. The hesitancy to donate organs was attributed mostly to religious and associated with lack of knowledge issues, thus education might be the key to positive attitudes.

AB  - Identifying stakeholder beliefs and attitudes is critical for resolving management conflicts. Debate over outdoor cat management is often described as a conflict between two groups, environmental advocates and animal welfare advocates, but little is known about the variables predicting differences among these critical stakeholder groups. We administered a mail survey to randomly selected stakeholders representing both of these groups (n = 1,596) in Florida, where contention over the management of outdoor cats has been widespread. We used a structural equation model to evaluate stakeholder intention to support non-lethal management. The cognitive hierarchy model predicted that values influenced beliefs, which predicted general and specific attitudes, which in turn, influenced behavioral intentions. We posited that specific attitudes would mediate the effect of general attitudes, beliefs, and values on management support. Model fit statistics suggested that the final model fit the data well (CFI = 0.94, RMSEA = 0.062). The final model explained 74% of the variance in management support, and positive attitudes toward lethal management (humaneness) had the largest direct effect on management support. Specific attitudes toward lethal management and general attitudes toward outdoor cats mediated the relationship between positive (p < 0.05) and negative cat-related impact beliefs (p < 0.05) and support for management. These results supported the specificity hypothesis and the use of the cognitive hierarchy to assess stakeholder intention to support non-lethal cat management. Our findings suggest that stakeholders can simultaneously perceive both positive and negative beliefs about outdoor cats, which influence attitudes toward and support for non-lethal management.

AB  - This study examined the short-term efficacy of Media Aware, a classroom-based media literacy education (MLE) program for improving adolescents' sexual health outcomes. In a randomized control trial, schools were randomly assigned to the intervention (N = 5 schools) or health promotion control (N = 4 schools) group. Students completed questionnaires at pretest (N = 880 students) and immediate posttest (N = 926 students). The Media Aware program had a significant favorable impact on adolescent outcomes related to sexual health, including increased self-efficacy and intentions to use contraception, if they were to engage in sexual activity; enhanced positive attitudes, self-efficacy, and intentions to communicate about sexual health; decreased acceptance of dating violence and strict gender roles; and increased sexual health knowledge. Program effects were also found for media-related outcomes, including enhanced media deconstruction skills and increased media skepticism. Media deconstruction skills mediated the program's impact on students' intentions to communicate with a medical professional about sexual health issues. This study provides support for the use of MLE with adolescents to promote sexual health.

   Aim: The aim is to assess the impact of the social distancing measures caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual function and quality of life of noninfected reproductive-age women, living with their sexual partner.
   Methods: Observational analysis on sexually active women, living with their partner, and without COVID-19 infection was performed. The population previously answered FSFI, FSDS, and SF-36 questionnaires. 4 weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures, these women were invited to complete the same questionnaires by e-mail for an evaluation during the COVID-19 outbreak.
   Main Outcome Measures: The primary endpoint was the assessment of the women's sex function change during the social restriction period, by analyzing the FSFI and FSDS questionnaires. The secondary endpoint was the evaluation of the impact on the quality of life calculated by the SF-36 questionnaire.
   Results: 89 patients were considered. The median age was 39 (28-50) years. Mean sexual intercourses/month decreased from 6.3 +/- 1.9 to 2.3 +/- 1.8, mean difference: -3.9 +/- 1.2. FSFI decreased significantly (29.2 +/- 4.2 vs 19.2 +/- 3.3, mean difference: -9.7 +/- 2.6) and FSDS increased significantly (9.3 +/- 5.5 vs 20.1 +/- 5.2, mean difference: 10.8 +/- 3.4). The SF-36 showed a significant change from 82.2 +/- 10.2 to 64.2 +/- 11.8 4 weeks after the introduction of the restrictive measures; mean difference: -17.8 +/- 6.7. The univariable analysis identified working outside the home, university educational level, and parity >= 1 as predictive factors of lower FSFI. In multivariable analysis, working outside the home and combination of working outside the home thorn university educational level thorn parity >= 1 were the independent factors of a lower FSFI.
   Clinical Implication: The negative impact of the COVID-19 epidemic period on sexual function and quality of life in women shows how acute stress might affect the psychological state. Thus, psychological or sexual support could be useful.
   Strengths and Limitations: To our knowledge, this study is the first that analyzes the change in sexual activity in women during the COVID-19 outbreak period. The limitations were the low number of the analyzed participants, psychological tests were not included, and no data were collected on masturbation, self-heroism, solitary, and nonpenetrative sex. Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic and the restrictive social distancing measures have negatively influenced the sexual function and quality of life in not-infected reproductive-age women who live with their sexual partners.

AB  - Although there has been much recent attention to empowerment in public sector research, most of this research focuses on structural empowerment, rather than psychological empowerment, and thus focuses on management practices, rather than on employees' motivational states. This article examines the processes through which transformational leadership and transactional leadership affect employees' feelings of psychological empowerment, focusing specifically on the role of goal specificity as a mediating variable. Using data collected from state government employees, the structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses found support for hypotheses that goal specificity mediates the relationships between both transformational and transactional leadership and psychological empowerment. These results contribute to the discussion of transformational and transactional leadership approaches with regard to goal setting in the public sector and provide practical implications that public managers' leadership behaviors can help employees develop positive attitudes toward goal specificity, which can then lead to feelings of psychological empowerment.

LA  - English
AB  - The subject of this paper is a content analysis of the articles in the media about the Macedonian-Romanian Orthodox Church relations. According to the content analysis of the sample of articles in the media about the relations between the Macedonian Orthodox Church - the Ohrid Archbishopric (MOC-OA) and the Romanian Orthodox Church (ROC), it can be concluded that the analyzed texts are mostly informative and transmit a positive attitude. The articles stress the extremely good, very close and friendly relations between MOC-OA and ROC. At the same time, the analysis shows that the Romanian Orthodox Church is considered one of the greatest supporters of the MOC on the road to its recognition and acceptance into the Orthodox world. The established close contacts contribute to the active engagement of the ROC as a "lobbyist" for the MOC-OA for recognizing its declared autocephality.

AB  - The connection between evaluation practice and its ultimate goal-social betterment-is indirect. With little or no direct control over social programs and policies, many evaluators rely on the actions of stakeholders to bridge the gap between evaluation practice and its purpose. Consequently, communicating with influence becomes key. The present empirical study tested the influence of evaluation findings on reader attitudes. It also extended current research on communication in evaluation by empirically testing whether visual data displays are related to evaluation influence. Findings suggested evaluators can shape reader attitudes through evaluation reports; however, readers responded differently based on the report's consistency with their initial attitudes. Additionally, evaluators should be cautious about overestimating the effects of data visualization on readers' attitudinal responses. Overall, findings provided a rationale for continued use of, and further research into, tailored evaluation reports.

AB  - Objectives: Waterpipe smoking can lead to negative health outcomes. In this study, we examined responses to anti-waterpipe smoking public service announcements (PSAs). Methods: In a pilot study, current waterpipe smokers (N = 20) and susceptible waterpipe never smokers (N = 25) were randomized to view either 3 anti-waterpipe PSAs, created by the Truth campaign, or 3 control videos. Participants answered questions pertaining to message acceptance at 3 time-points and perceived risk and motivation to quit or avoid waterpipe at 4 time-points. Results: Participants were recruited from the community (N = 45; M-age = 22.4 years). Whereas waterpipe smokers and never smokers who viewed the PSAs significantly increased in acceptance of (p < .05) and positive attitudes towards (p < .05) the messages with increased viewing of the messages, waterpipe never smokers did so at a significantly higher rate (ps < .05). Waterpipe never smokers who viewed the PSAs had increased perceived severity and susceptibility of health harms of waterpipe compared to the control (ps < .05). We also found gender differences. Conclusions: The 3 tested PSAs from the Truth campaign show evidence of effectiveness against waterpipe use.

AB  - Background Chronic patients persistently seek for health information on the internet for medication information seeking, nutrition, disease management, information regarding disease preventive actions and so on. Consumers ability to search, find, appraise and use health information from the internet is known as eHealth literacy skill. eHealth literacy is a congregate set of six basic skills (traditional literacy, health literacy, information literacy, scientific literacy, media literacy and computer literacy). The aim of this study was to assess eHealth literacy level and associated factors among internet user chronic patients in North-west Ethiopia. Methods Institutional based cross-sectional study design was conducted. Stratified sampling technique was used to select 423 study participants among chronic patients. The eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) was used for data collection. The eHEALS is a validated eight-item Likert scaled questionnaire used to asses self-reported capability of eHealth consumers to find, appraise, and use health related information from the internet to solve health problems. Statistical Package for Social science version 20 was used for data entry and further analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the association between the eHealth literacy skill and associated factors. Significance was obtained at 95% CI andp < 0.05. Result In total, 423 study subjects were approached and included in the study from February to May, 2019. The response rate to the survey was 95.3%. The majority of respondents 268 (66.3%) were males and mean age was 35.58 +/- 14.8 years. The multivariable logistic regression model indicated that participants with higher education (at least having the diploma) are more likely to possess high eHealth literacy skill with Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 3.48, 95% CI (1.54, 7.87). similarly, being government employee AOR: 1.71, 95% CI (1.11, 2.68), being urban resident AOR: 1.37, 95% CI (0.54, 3.49), perceived good health status AOR: 3.97, 95% CI (1.38, 11.38), having higher income AOR: 4.44, 95% CI (1.32, 14.86), Daily internet use AOR: 2.96, 95% CI (1.08, 6.76), having good knowledge about the availability and importance of online resources AOR: 3.12, 95% CI (1.61, 5.3), having positive attitude toward online resources AOR: 2.94, 95% CI (1.07, 3.52) and higher level of computer literacy AOR: 3.81, 95% CI (2.19, 6.61) were the predictors positively associated with higher eHealth literacy level. Conclusion Besides the mounting indication of efficacy, the present data confirm that internet use and eHealth literacy level of chronic patients in this setting is relatively low which clearly implicate that there is a need to fill the skill gap in eHealth literacy among chronic patients which might help them in finding and evaluating relevant online sources for their health-related decisions.

AB  - This study examines how cost-benefit attitudes have a mediating role between residents' attitudes toward and support for tourism development. The theory of reasoned action (TRA) and social exchange theory (SET) are underpinning theories to support the hypotheses. The research was conducted in Sirnak province (Turkey), where tourism has not yet developed. A total number of 332 questionnaires were completed. The data were analysed using structural equation modelling. Results showed that residents' negative and positive attitudes toward tourism have direct effects on cost-benefit attitudes and indirect effects on support for tourism. It has also been determined that cost-benefit attitudes have a mediation role between residents' attitudes toward and support for tourism. The research contributes to the literature by adding social-psychological expressions to the residents' attitude concept toward tourism development. The research is also unique, because it was conducted in a place where tourism has not yet developed.

AB  - Importance Local variation in the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) across the United States has not been well studied.
   Objective To examine the association of county-level factors with variation in the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number over time.
   Design, Setting, and Participants This cohort study included 211 counties, representing state capitals and cities with at least 100 000 residents and including 178 892 208 US residents, in 46 states and the District of Columbia between February 25, 2020, and April 23, 2020.
   Exposures Social distancing, measured by percentage change in visits to nonessential businesses; population density; and daily wet-bulb temperatures.
   Main Outcomes and Measures Instantaneous reproduction number (R-t), or cases generated by each incident case at a given time, estimated from daily case incidence data.
   Results The 211 counties contained 178 892 208 of 326 289 971 US residents (54.8%). Median (interquartile range) population density was 1022.7 (471.2-1846.0) people per square mile. The mean (SD) peak reduction in visits to nonessential business between April 6 and April 19, as the country was sheltering in place, was 68.7% (7.9%). Median (interquartile range) daily wet-bulb temperatures were 7.5 (3.8-12.8) degrees C. Median (interquartile range) case incidence and fatality rates per 100 000 people were approximately 10 times higher for the top decile of densely populated counties (1185.2 [313.2-1891.2] cases; 43.7 [10.4-106.7] deaths) than for counties in the lowest density quartile (121.4 [87.8-175.4] cases; 4.2 [1.9-8.0] deaths). Mean (SD) R(t)in the first 2 weeks was 5.7 (2.5) in the top decile compared with 3.1 (1.2) in the lowest quartile. In multivariable analysis, a 50% decrease in visits to nonessential businesses was associated with a 45% decrease in R-t(95% CI, 43%-49%). From a relative R(t)at 0 degrees C of 2.13 (95% CI, 1.89-2.40), relative R(t)decreased to a minimum as temperatures warmed to 11 degrees C, increased between 11 and 20 degrees C (1.61; 95% CI, 1.42-1.84) and then declined again at temperatures greater than 20 degrees C. With a 70% reduction in visits to nonessential business, 202 counties (95.7%) were estimated to fall below a threshold R(t)of 1.0, including 17 of 21 counties (81.0%) in the top density decile and 52 of 53 counties (98.1%) in the lowest density quartile.(2)
   Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, social distancing, lower population density, and temperate weather were associated with a decreased R(t)for SARS-CoV-2 in counties across the United States. These associations could inform selective public policy planning in communities during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.

AB  - Psychological contract breach (PCB) may trigger negative attitudes in employees and ultimately cause further negative behaviors. By drawing on social exchange theory, this study aims to explore the link between PCB and counterproductive work behavior (CWB) by focusing on the mediating role of organizational cynicism and work alienation. We administered a cross-sectional survey of 484 energy company front-line employees. The conceptual model was examined via structural equation modeling. The results suggested that organizational cynicism and work alienation sequentially mediated the relationship between PCB and CWB. This study elucidated the mechanisms underlying the relationship between PCB and CWB by introducing negative attitudes (i.e., organizational cynicism and work alienation) into the model, and offered further evidence that organizations should pay more attention to employees' PCB and negative attitudes in order to reduce their CWB.

AB  - The present study focuses on the effects of graphic warnings related to excessive gambling. It is based upon a theoretical model derived from both the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) and the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM). We focus on video lottery terminal (VLT), one of the most hazardous format in the gaming industry. Our cohort consisted of 103 actual gamblers who reported previous gambling activity on VLT's on a regular basis. We assess the effectiveness of graphic warnings vs. text-only warnings and the effectiveness of two major arguments (i.e., family vs. financial disruption). A 2 x 2 factorial design was used to test the direct and combined effects of two variables (i.e., warning content and presence vs. absence of a graphic). It was found that the presence of a graphic enhances both cognitive appraisal and fear, and has positive effects on the Depth of Information Processing. In addition, graphic content combined with family disruptions is more effective for changing attitudes and complying with the warning than other combinations of the manipulated variables. It is proposed that ELM and PMT complement each other to explain the effects of warnings. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - This study uses the internal structural modeling approach to examine the motivation of eighty international adult students learning Arabic as a less commonly taught language. Grounded within social psychological and social cognitive theories of motivation, the study specifically investigates the role of self-efficacy, attitudes, and orientations in learning Arabic. Results show that intrinsic orientation plays a mediating role between self-efficacy and attitudes, on the one hand, and motivational intensity and expectancy of success, on the other. Learners of Arabic proved to (1) have a high sense of self-efficacy for language learning, (2) be intrinsically oriented, and (3) hold positive attitudes toward foreign language learning, the target language, and the context of learning. Integrative orientation, extrinsic orientations, and social attitudes did not, however, contribute to the definition of motivation for learning Arabic as an L2 (second language). In light of these findings, it could be argued that learning a less-commonly taught language such as Arabic is more motivated by intellectual, aesthetic motives than pragmatic, utilitarian ones.

AB  - The main challenge of advertising is to catch consumers' attention and evoke in them positive attitudes to consequently achieve product preference and higher purchase intentions. In modern advertising, visual metaphors are widely used due to their effects such as improving advertising recall, enhancing persuasiveness, and generating consumers' positive attitudes. Previous research has pointed out the existence of an "inverted U-curve" that describes a positive relationship between the conceptual complexity of metaphors and consumers' positive reactions to them, which ends where complexity outweighs comprehension. Despite the dominance of visual metaphors in modern advertising, academic research on this topic has been relatively sparse. The inverted U-curve pattern has been validated regarding ad appreciation, ad liking, and purchase intention by using declarative methods. However, at present, there is no evidence of consumers' neurophysiological responses to visual metaphors included in advertising. Given this gap, the aim of this research is to assess consumer neurophysiological responses to print advertisements that include visual metaphors, using neuroscience-based techniques. Forty-three participants (22W-21M) were exposed to 28 stimuli according to three levels of visual complexity, while their reactions were recorded with an electroencephalogram (EEG), eye tracking (ET), and galvanic skin response (GSR). The results indicated that, regardless of metaphor type, ads with metaphors evoke more positive reactions than non-metaphor ads. EEG results revealed a positive relationship between cognitive load and conceptual complexity that is not mediated by comprehension. This suggests that the cognitive load index could be a suitable indicator of complexity, as it reflects the amount of cognitive resources needed to process stimuli. ET results showed significant differences in the time dedicated to exploring the ads; however, comprehension doesn't mediate this relationship. Moreover, no cognitive load was detected from GSR. ET and GSR results suggest that neither methodology is a suitable measure of cognitive load in the case of visual metaphors. Instead, it seems that they are more related to the attention and/or emotion devoted to the stimuli. Our empirical analysis reveals the importance of using neurophysiological measures to analyze the appropriate use of visual metaphors and to find out how to maximize their impact on advertising effectiveness.

AB  - Objective: To assess the knowledge and attitude about the emergency contraceptives among nursing and midwifery students in tertiary care hospitals in Karachi.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study was carried out in the nursing school of Dow University Hospital and & Civil Hospital Karachi. Duration of the study was January 2017 to June 2017. All nursing and midwifery students, after verbal consent, were interviewed face-to-face using a pretested structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed to assess knowledge and attitudes; the way in which the respondents think and behave towards emergency contraceptives (EC). Some questions were objective in nature with 'Yes' or 'No' options, whereas few questions were of multiple choice. The variables were age, educational level, religion, marital status, source of information, EC types and method of use, side effects and source of availability and the attitudes of participants towards the use of EC (11 items). The data was recorded in MS Excel (2010 version). Data analysis was done by SPSS 16. Mean and SD of age was calculated while the categorical variables were analysed by using frequency and percentages. Chi-square test was applied and significance of test was decided at p-value 0.05.
   Results: There were 149 respondents out of the 165 targeted population. The response rate was 90.30% among nurses and midwives working in public sector of health care system in Karachi, Pakistan. The mean age of the respondents was 20.63 +/- 1.69 years. Most respondents were between the ages of 20-35 years; 98 (65.8%), with majority having educational level of matriculation; 66 (44.3%). There were nurses and midwives with optimum knowledge for EC based on the scale of having three or more correct responses out of four items. The best positive attitude was scaled by correct response of seven or more items out of eleven. The association of demographic factors with attitude towards EC was only significant at p-value 0.05 among married students.
   Conclusion: Awareness regarding EC with optimum knowledge and positive attitude was found in about two-thirds of nurses and midwives. Information must be spread through media and training to remove barriers and misconceptions among nurses and midwives.

AB  - News coverage around monuments and statues have served as spaces of resistance for marginalized communities. The Statute of Liberty protest of Patricia Okoumou challenged the U.S. immigration policies by connecting collective memory to media narratives. This paper argues that competing understandings of Okoumou's protests appeared in mainstream media and the social media platform, Twitter. In response, Okoumou would start her own website and blog in order to illuminate herself as a voice of authority. This paper builds on the reinforced understandings of the racialized protests and how Black women engage in these discussions on social media. In order to keep her message clear, Okoumou created a digital space to oppose the mainstream media message. Thus, this study adds to the centering of Black women's bodies as a form of discourse of experiences and self-definition because Okoumou declared her existence and rose to find her voice on her personal digital platforms.

AB  - (1) Background: in the last decade, various investigations into the field of robotics have created several opportunities for further innovation to be possible in student education. However, despite scientific evidence, there is still strong scepticism surrounding the use of robots in some social fields, such as personal care and education. (2) Methods: in this research, we present a new tool named the HANCON model, which was developed merging and extending the constructs of two solid and proven models-the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model used to examine the factors that may influence the decision to use a telepresence robot as an instrument in educational practice, and the Post Acceptance Model used to evaluate acceptability after the actual use of a telepresence robot. The new tool is implemented and used to study the acceptance of a double telepresence robot by 112 pre-service teachers in an educational setting. (3) Results: the analysis of the experimental results predicts and demonstrate a positive attitude towards the use of telepresence robot in a school setting and confirm the applicability of the model in an educational context. (4) Conclusions: the constructs of the HANCON model could predict and explain the acceptance of social telepresence robots in social contexts.

AB  - This study took frequency of use and the adoption process into account to define the participants and external variables of the research model. School electronic textbooks are a daily-use technology and they are adopted in a compulsory, top-down way. Their introduction can evoke feelings of anxiety among teachers because of a possible increase in workload. This compulsory adoption process contrasts with that for most other technologies, which are voluntary and less disruptive. In a school context, instructional designs of electronic textbooks that help explain user acceptance are sufficient in a bottom-up, but not a top-down, approach. To address this, individual, organizational, and social factors were included in our research model. A survey questionnaire to collect data from 306 in-service teachers from eight secondary schools was used. The results showed that anxiety and positive attitude were the main barrier and catalyst, respectively, to the acceptance of such technology. One suggestion for researchers and two suggestions for school leaders on the adoption process were made.

AB  - Media consumption can influence viewer perceptions and attitudes. Recent research on media's effect on college students has failed to address gender differences. Using Mere Repeated Exposure Theory (traditionally used in marketing research), this study aims to answer three research questions regarding college media consumption and college perceptions: What types of fictional college media do college students consume? How does college media consumption differ by gender? How does fictional college media consumption relate to perceived college expectations? Results suggest that college students who consume high amounts of fictional college media are more likely to have positive attitudes towards partying and socializing in college. High consumers of college media, however, do not believe that college media influences their college perceptions. Men are more likely to socialize in college and are more aware than women that college media influences their college perceptions. Women are more likely to believe that college is difficult regardless of media consumption.

AB  - As the world's largest consumer group, Generation Z's (Gen Z) influence and purchase ability facilitate the upgrading of consumption. This study investigated a new phenomenon: food favorability, that is, customer preference for diet and food, using a mixed-methods approach in three studies. Taking Chinese Gen Z as an example, Study 1 developed a conceptual model of food favorability among Gen Z based on grounded theory with dish evaluation, dietary choice, marketing innovation, and service quality as the core categories. Study 2 underwent a rigorous scale development by establishing a food favorability scale to measure Gen Z's preference for diet and food. Using this scale, Study 3 further confirmed the positive effect of Gen Z's food favorability on purchase intention, when food preference played a mediating role in this process. Moreover, social distance promoted the positive prediction of food favorability on preference. This study systematically constructs the concept of Gen Z's food favorability, expanding the "theoretical territory" of their consumption characteristics. Additionally, the theoretical basis of "intervention measures" is provided for the sustainable tourism and catering industries.

AB  - COVID-19 has been a global healthcare concern impacting multiple aspects of individual and community wellness. As one moves forward with different methods to reduce the infection and mortality rates, it is critical to continue to study the impact that national and local "social distancing" policies have on the daily lives of individuals. The aim of this study was to examine loneliness in relation to risk assessment, measures taken against risks, concerns, and social media use, while adjusting for sociodemographic variables. The cross-sectional study collected data from 3474 individuals from the USA, the UK, Norway, and Australia. Loneliness was measured with the de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale. Multiple linear regression was used in the analysis of associations between variables. The results showed that concerns about finances were more strongly associated with social loneliness, while concerns about the future was more strongly associated with emotional loneliness. Longer daily time spent on social media was associated with higher emotional loneliness. In conclusion, pandemic-related concerns seem to affect perceptions of loneliness. While social media can be used productively to maintain relationships, and thereby prevent loneliness, excessive use may be counterproductive.

AB  - Human resource practices requiring employee participation or involvement in work-related decision-making have been commonly believed to be beneficial to work outcomes; however, we suggest that the effects of those practices on work outcomes can be limited by individual preferences, which influence the perceived quality of supervision. Drawing upon prior research on work structure, person-environment (P-E) fit perspective, and perceived organizational support, we examine the joint effects of autonomy and preference for autonomy on employee work outcomes (task performance and organizational citizenship behaviors) that are mediated via perceived supervision (individualized consideration) among U.S. state government employees. The results showed that the congruence between autonomy and preference for autonomy was associated with the highest level of perceived individualized consideration by supervisors, highlighting the important role played by perceptions of the supervisor behavior in promoting employees' positive attitudes at work.

AB  - To investigate how early elementary science and technology (S&T) education, with hands-on experimentation and inquiry-based learning, impacts pre-service teachers' attitudes and confidence to teach S&T education, we used a cross-sectional survey. Our participants were 27 pre-service teachers enrolled in an Ontario elementary S&T teacher education methods course. Those who were taught S&T through hands-on experimentation exhibited more positive attitudes toward S&T and were statistically more confident when reading, understanding, and critically evaluating common S&T media reports. They were also more confident to teach S&T through hands-on experimentation and inquiry-based learning. In almost all cases, participants valued learning S&T by doing S&T (i.e., actively participating/interacting), which influenced their confidence, interest, and desire to embrace hands-on experimentation for their future roles as elementary teachers.

AB  - This study demonstrates that the utilization of a computer-aided decision support system (DSS) for diagnosis related groups (DRGs) coding called DRG-DSS, can both help coders to increase their coding quality and also reduce the time required to train them. However, an information system is of no real value if its intended users are not prepared to avail themselves of it. A quasi-experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance of the DRG-DSS in a hospital. Twelve DRGs coders were recruited and randomly assigned to experimental or control group to code 180 respiratory cases. Both object and subject-based indicators were used to measure the performance of DRG-DSS through a two-stage evaluation process. The results show that the DRG-DSS can effectively enhance the coding quality and all the users had a positive attitude with respect to the system's perceived ease of use and usefulness. Following presentation of the research findings, their implications and limitations are discussed, along with suggestions for future work. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examined the influence of consumer's brand familiarity and the information quality of social media content on their involvement with a brand on the brand's social media pages. Also studied were the influence of involvement on consumer's attitude towards the brand's social media page and the effect of their attitude on future purchase intention from the brand. The results indicated that both brand familiarity and information quality had significant effects on a consumer's involvement with a brand on its social media page, yet the brand's social media content had a greater influence on a consumer's involvement with the social media page. Further, involvement with a brand's social media led to a positive attitude towards the brand's social media page, which in turn influences future purchase intention from the brand. However, the involvement did not directly influence future purchase intention from the brand. The results suggest the significant importance of quality of social media content.

AB  - Background: Nonverbal communication is a critical feature of successful social interaction and interpersonal rapport. Social exclusion is a feature of schizophrenia. This experimental study investigated if the undisclosed presence of a patient with schizophrenia in interaction changes nonverbal communication (ie, speaker gesture and listener nodding). Method: 3D motion-capture techniques recorded 20 patient (1 patient, 2 healthy participants) and 20 control (3 healthy participants) interactions. Participants rated their experience of rapport with each interacting partner. Patients symptoms, social cognition, and executive functioning were assessed. Four hypotheses were tested: (1) Compared to controls, patients display less speaking gestures and listener nods. (2) Patients increased symptom severity and poorer social cognition are associated with patients reduced gesture and nods. (3) Patients partners compensate for patients reduced nonverbal behavior by gesturing more when speaking and nodding more when listening. (4) Patients reduced nonverbal behavior, increased symptom severity, and poorer social cognition are associated with others experiencing poorer rapport with the patient. Results: Patients gestured less when speaking. Patients with more negative symptoms nodded less as listeners, while their partners appeared to compensate by gesturing more as speakers. Patients with more negative symptoms also gestured more when speaking, which, alongside increased negative symptoms and poorer social cognition, was associated with others experiencing poorer patient rapport. Conclusions: Patients symptoms are associated with the nonverbal behavior of patients and their partners. Patients increased negative symptoms and gesture use are associated with poorer interpersonal rapport. This study provides specific evidence about how negative symptoms impact patients social interactions.

AB  - The current research answers the question how Twitter users express their evaluation of topical social problems (explicitly or implicitly) and what linguistic means they use, being restricted by the allowed length of the message. The article explores how Twitter users communicate with each other and exchange ideas on social issues of great importance, express their feelings using a number of linguistic means, while being limited by a fixed number of characters, and form solidarity, being geographically distant from each other. The research is focused on the linguistic tools employed by Twitter users in order to express their personal attitude. The subject chosen for study was the migration processes in Europe and the USA. The aim of the current investigation is to determine the correlation between the attitudes of English-speaking users towards migration and the way they are expressed implicitly or explicitly. The authors make an attempt to define which tools contribute to the implicit or explicit nature of the utterances. The material includes 100 tweets of English-speaking users collected from February 1 to July 31, 2017. The choice of the time period is defined by significant events in Trump's migration policy and their consequences. The research is based on the content analysis of the material carried out by means of the Atlas.ti program. The software performs the coding of textual units, counts the frequency of codes and their correlation. The results of the research show that Twitter users tend to express their critical attitudes towards migration, rather than approve of it or sympathise with migrants. Criticism is more often expressed implicitly rather than explicitly. In order to disguise the attitude and feelings, the English-speaking users of Twitter employed irony, questions and quotations, while the explicit expression of attitudes was done by means of imperative structures. It is also worth mentioning that ellipses, contractions and abbreviations were used quite frequently due to the word limit of tweets. At the same time, the lack of knowledge about extralinguistic factors and personal characteristics of users makes the process of interpretation of tweets rather challenging. The findings of the current research suggest the necessity to take into account implicit negative attitudes while carrying out the analysis of public opinion on Twitter.

AB  - In this two-part study, a content analysis of advertisements published in Cambodian and Vietnamese magazines was first conducted to determine the kinds of advertising appeals (functional, individualistic, and collectivistic) that were most frequently employed. The findings indicated that across product types, the Cambodian ads contained more individualistic appeals. The Vietnamese ads, on the other hand, depicted more collectivistic and functional appeals. Next, an experiment was conducted to determine audience response to the use of three appeals in ads that promote four product types (informative, affective, habit-forming, and self-satisfaction). Vietnamese participants responded more positively to functional appeals across product types. They also preferred collectivistic rather than individualistic appeals for ads that promote habit-forming and self-satisfaction products. Cambodian consumers, on the other hand, registered more positive attitudes toward ads with individualistic and functional appeals.

AB  - Students' attitudes, their perceptions of cognitive and affective quality as predictors of attitudes, and the resulting intention toward learning with serious games remains ambiguous, largely due to the use of imprecise measures. The presented studies have aimed to develop and test a measurement of students' attitudes, perceptions, and intentions to learn with serious games in general, and to use the instrument to examine differences for the most common types of serious games, that is quiz, simulation, and adventure. To this end, a pretest (n = 301) and two main studies (Study 1: n = 135, Study 2: n = 375) were conducted. The developed instrument shows high reliability and convergent validity. Results demonstrate positive attitudes, positive cognitive perceptions, and high positive and low negative affective perceptions of students toward learning with serious games in general, as well as with different game types. Findings from a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), however, indicate differences between the three game types that could be related to the perceptions of cognitive and affective quality. Predominately, compared to quizzes and adventures, simulations were perceived as more supportive for the comprehension and application of knowledge while promoting a less positive affect. Additionally, there was a significant difference due to gender. Whereas females reported higher perceptions of negative affective quality compared to males when serious games were addressed in general, answers to questions about the specific game types revealed a more detailed picture. In contrast to previous findings in existing literature, female students reported a more positive attitude, as well as higher perceptions of positive affective quality, than males for all three game types. These results stress the importance of examining the types of serious games separately and considering gender when evaluating students' attitudes and perceptions when learning with serious games.

AB  - Extant literature on social media in education highlights the importance of improving social media-supported learning environments. This study adds to the literature by examining students' perception and participation for three types of Twitter-based instrumental activitiesbackchanneling, exploring hashtags, and topics discussionin two unique undergraduate classrooms (education vs. communication) over the period of a 14-week semester. By employing a comparative case study research design, this study revealed insights into how students may respond to the same Twitter classroom integration activities to a varying degree according to their differences in pre-class perceptions and behavioral patterns. We found that both classes manifested an overall positive attitude toward the integration of Twitter in class along with active participation. However, the communication students manifested a more favorable pre-perception of Twitter and showed a higher participation pattern in class. We also provide pedagogical implications and recommendations for instructors intending to apply or replicate the three instructional activities employed in this study.

Governments responded to the pandemic with various forms of lockdowns and social distancing, leading to increased dependence on digital services for work, social engagement, and leisure activities. We identify consumer valuations through surveys where respondents express their reservation prices for digital services such as email, search, and social media. We compare our results to surveys done in 2016 and 2017 and find an about five-fold increase in valuations.

AB  - Based on social comparison and social identity theory, we argue that average partisans in contemporary U.S. politics view elections as group competitions in which partisan identities are at stake. Using nationally representative survey data, we demonstrate that stronger partisan identities, more than ideological identities or issue preferences, are associated with a greater sense of partisan hostilityspecifically, party rivalry and anger. That hostility mediates the impact of partisan identities on political attitudes and actions. As a result, strong partisan identifiers hold the most hostile and uncivil attitudes and are the most likely to participate in elections. Thus, in the context of elections, the behavior of partisans resembles that of sports team members acting to preserve the status of their teams rather than thoughtful citizens participating in the political process for the broader good. We explore the implications of these findings for the current state of American politics.

AB  - This project employs 2008 National Election Study (NES) data to explore whether parents are different than nonparents in terms of their political attitudes and candidate evaluations. We find that parenthood does have political consequences although often not in ways suggested by conventional wisdom. Rather than finding parents to be a conservative group, our results support the idea that raising children has liberalizing effects on the attitudes of women. Fatherhood shapes attitudes less than motherhood, but these fewer effects are in a conservative direction. We argue that the distinctive politics of mothers and fathers reflects the impact of parenting as a gendered socialization experience combined with the contrasting parenthood themes articulated by the Republican and Democratic parties. Finally, despite media coverage suggesting Sarah Palin's "Hockey Mom" image would attract parents, especially mothers, to her candidacy and the Republican ticket we find no support for this idea.

AB  - Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy seems likely to increase mortality rates and delay the easing of social distancing restrictions. Online platforms with large audiences may influence vaccine hesitancy by spreading fear and misinformation that is avoided by the mainstream media. Understanding what types of vaccine hesitancy information is shared on the popular social web site Twitter may therefore help to design interventions to address misleading attitudes. This study applies content analysis to a random sample of 446 vaccine hesitant Covid-19 tweets in English posted between 10 March and 5 December 2020. The main themes discussed were conspiracies, vaccine development speed, and vaccine safety. Most (79%) of those tweeting refusal to take a vaccine expressed right-wing opinions, fear of a deep state, or conspiracy theories. A substantial minority of vaccine refusers (18%) mainly tweeted non-politically about other themes. The topics on Twitter reflect vaccine concerns, but those stating vaccine refusal in non-political contexts may unsettle the wider Twitter network by reaching outside right-wing areas of Twitter.

AB  - It is commonly believed that the general public is heavily dependent on the media for its political news and views and that, as a consequence, the media exercise a strong influence over public opinion and behaviour. However, many millions in the Western world strongly believe things that are barely ever mentioned in the mainstream media, just as many millions also firmly reject or ignore some of the messages that are repeated incessantly by them. This confirms sixty years of experimental psychology research showing that most individuals are capable of preserving their beliefs, even in the face of overwhelming evidence, argument and logic to the contrary. Consistent with this, political science research finds little evidence of strong media influence on the party voting, political attitudes and election agendas of citizens. They have their own ways of gathering political information about the world around them, and they do not necessarily believe what they read in the papers, unless they are so inclined to start with. Consequently, media influences on mass opinion and behaviour are weaker than commonly assumed and, such as they are, their effects are more beneficial than harmful for democracy.

AB  - Background: Medical Faculties Network (MEFANET) has established itself as the authority for setting standards for medical educators in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, 2 independent countries with similar languages that once comprised a federation and that still retain the same curricular structure for medical education. One of the basic goals of the network is to advance medical teaching and learning with the use of modern information and communication technologies.
   Objective: We present the education portal AKUTNE.CZ as an important part of the MEFANET's content. Our focus is primarily on simulation-based tools for teaching and learning acute medicine issues.
   Methods: Three fundamental elements of the MEFANET e-publishing system are described: (1) medical disciplines linker, (2) authentication/authorization framework, and (3) multidimensional quality assessment. A new set of tools for technology-enhanced learning have been introduced recently: Sandbox (works in progress), WikiLectures (collaborative content authoring), Moodle-MEFANET (central learning management system), and Serious Games (virtual casuistics and interactive algorithms). The latest development in MEFANET is designed for indexing metadata about simulation-based learning objects, also known as electronic virtual patients or virtual clinical cases. The simulations assume the form of interactive algorithms for teaching and learning acute medicine. An anonymous questionnaire of 10 items was used to explore students' attitudes and interests in using the interactive algorithms as part of their medical or health care studies. Data collection was conducted over 10 days in February 2013.
   Results: In total, 25 interactive algorithms in the Czech and English languages have been developed and published on the AKUTNE.CZ education portal to allow the users to test and improve their knowledge and skills in the field of acute medicine. In the feedback survey, 62 participants completed the online questionnaire (13.5%) from the total 460 addressed. Positive attitudes toward the interactive algorithms outnumbered negative trends.
   Conclusions: The peer-reviewed algorithms were used for conducting problem-based learning sessions in general medicine (first aid, anesthesiology and pain management, emergency medicine) and in nursing (emergency medicine for midwives, obstetric analgesia, and anesthesia for midwifes). The feedback from the survey suggests that the students found the interactive algorithms as effective learning tools, facilitating enhanced knowledge in the field of acute medicine. The interactive algorithms, as a software platform, are open to academic use worldwide. The existing algorithms, in the form of simulation-based learning objects, can be incorporated into any educational website (subject to the approval of the authors).

AB  - Women's sport, and perhaps especially women's football, in England has enjoyed much greater media visibility and support over the past decade. But we still know relatively little about the response of fans of men's football to the rise of the women's game and their views on attending it. This paper highlights responses from 2,347 fans of the men's game in Britain to BBC terrestrial coverage of the FIFA Women's World Cup of 2015. It also investigates general views on women's football, experiences of attending matches and the perceived barriers to match attendance. It argues that there remains residual resistance to the women's game, but also increasing reflexivity about its performance and prospects. Concerns over the financial excesses of the men's game and about the values expressed in its elite versions additionally contribute to more positive attitudes and expectations in our sample about the future of elite women's football.

AB  - Adolescents with positive attitudes towards the legal authorities are unlikely to adopt delinquent behaviours. To examine the role school can play in shaping such attitudes, we questioned 465 middle school students to assess how their emotional relationships with teachers (teachers' compassionate love, teachers' esteem) relate to their attitudes towards authority (trust in the justice system, positive evaluation of the law). We also assessed whether these associations were mediated by school belonging. Results showed that teachers' compassionate love and teachers' esteem were (respectively) directly and indirectly linked to students' attitudes towards authority. In both cases, school belonging acted as either a partial or a total mediator. This is consistent with the group engagement model and suggests that students' attitudes towards legal authorities are linked to their affective relationships with teachers, partly because their positive perceptions of teacher-student relationships strengthen their feelings of school membership.

AB  - Suicide represents a very important issue in public health. For approaching attitudes toward suicide, we have developed an instrument that, following previous recommendations, assesses specific thoughts related to the perception of suicide utility in the press. First of all, we will test the psychometric properties of the scale we created ad hoc for assessing suicide utility perception. After that, we expect to find that the suicide utility perception in the press will have a statistically significant impact on positive attitudes toward terminally ill patients' suicide (Hypothesis 1). In addition, this relationship will be mediated by suicide legitimation (Hypothesis 2). This mediation will be moderated by depressive symptomatology (Hypothesis 3). The sample was composed of 66 Spanish participants. Suicide legitimation was significantly related to the positive evaluation of terminally ill people's euthanasia. Finally, when the levels of depression's psychological concomitants increased, the support for terminally ill people's euthanasia increased as well. Implications and limitations have been discussed.

AB  - Due to the significance of the "refugee crisis" for European residents, the present research examined the link between residents' support for newly arriving migrants and different types of intergroup contact with migrants. We compared the associations between support for migrants, and both positive and negative direct and mass mediated contact. In the link between contact and support, we examined the mediating role of residents' attitudes towards migrants and the moderating role of their political orientation. In a Swiss sample (N = 861), only direct but not mass mediated contact was associated with support for migrants. Both positive and negative direct contact was linked to (higher vs. lower) support for migrants through (more vs. less positive) attitudes towards migrants. Relevant for interventions aimed at improving relations of host society with migrants, both positive and negative contact influenced support for migrants through attitudes, especially in people with a right wing political orientation.

AB  - Psychological reactance theory posits that when people are faced with threats to, or elimination of, behavioral freedom, they experience an aversive motivational state (i.e., psychological reactance). Recent research indicates that people's state of mind affects reactance arousal processes. We hypothesized that being in a state of threatening uncertainty would cause people to experience less psychological reactance to a freedom-threatening communication than those in a state of certainty. We randomly assigned 114 students from a North American University to an uncertainty- or certainty-inducing recall task; they were then exposed to a reactance-arousing message. Compared to participants primed to feel certain, those primed with threatening uncertainty reported significantly less threat and more positive attitudes in response to a freedom threatening communication. Mediation analysis revealed an indirect effect of feelings of threatening uncertainty on people's behavioral intentions, through perceptions of the controlling message. Results support our hypothesis: people in a state of uncertainty experience less psychological reactance than those in a state of certainty.

AB  - The current study examined whether children in elementary school in the United States held stereotypes and prejudicial attitudes about Arab Muslims relative to other groups. Children (n = 136), ages 6-11 (55 boys, 81 girls), were read three counterbalanced vignettes about different immigrant families who moved to the United States: one family from the Middle East with clothing markers indicating they are Muslim (e.g., hijab), one family from the Middle East without clothing markers indicating religion, and one White family from Ireland. Children's responses indicated stereotypes associating the Arab Muslim male target as more anti-American and hostile and the Arab Muslim female target as more oppressed than others, both consistent with prevalent media stereotypes. Children's positive and negative affective intergroup attitudes were also measured, along with their attitudes about who can be an American, with children showing both a positivity and negativity bias against Arab Muslims. Children who had some contact with Muslims or were familiar with Islam felt more positively toward Arab Muslims than less informed children. In addition, if children perceived Arab Muslims to be prototypical Americans, and identified as very American themselves, they also held positive attitudes toward Arab Muslims. Implications for prejudice reduction interventions are discussed.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic prompted universities across the United States to close campuses in Spring 2020. Universities are deliberating whether, when, and how they should resume in-person instruction in Fall 2020. In this essay, we discuss some practical considerations for the use of 2 potentially useful control strategies based on testing: (1) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing followed by case-patient isolation and quarantine of close contacts, and (2) serological testing followed by an "immune shield" approach, that is, low social distancing requirements for seropositive persons. The isolation of case-patients and quarantine of close contacts may be especially challenging, and perhaps prohibitively difficult, on many university campuses. The "immune shield" strategy might be hobbled by a low positive predictive value of the tests used in populations with low seroprevalence. Both strategies carry logistical, ethical, and financial implications. The main nonpharmaceutical interventions will remain methods based on social distancing (eg, capping class size) and personal protective behaviors (eg, universal facemask wearing in public space) until vaccines become available, or unless the issues discussed herein can be resolved in such a way that using mass testing as main control strategies becomes viable.

AB  - This study explores whether exposure to advertisements that focus on the negative effects of tobacco industry advertising and promotion at the point of sale (anti-POS advertising) influence: (i) attitude toward POS advertising; (ii) perceived impact of POS advertising on youth smoking; and (iii) support for a ban on tobacco promotion at the POS among adult non-smokers in New York. Data are from a split-sample, experimental study, using an online media tracking survey with embedded TV, radio and print advertising. Exposure to anti-POS advertising was associated with higher odds of holding a negative attitude toward POS advertising (OR 2.43, P<0.001) and support for a ban on tobacco promotion at the POS (OR 1.77, P<0.05), but not with perceived impact of POS tobacco advertisements on youth smoking. Findings suggest the possibility that a mass media campaign could be used to influence public attitude toward POS advertising and support for a ban on tobacco promotion at the POS.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine antecedents of customer engagement on social media and how these platforms can enhance customers' continuation intention. Customer engagement is manifested by the continued use of social media and is expected to occur when customers have a positive attitude toward social media. Thus, the main objective of this research is to explore the factors that affect customers' attitude toward social media, which in turn is expected to result in customer engagement. Attitude toward social media is proposed to have an impact on levels of use and satisfaction is proposed to have a direct impact on customer engagement. An extended technology acceptance model (TAM) is used as the basic model guiding this research.
   Design/methodology/approach - The theoretical model is tested drawing on the results of empirical work in the form of a large scale survey conducted on a random sample of the US general population. Data collection resulted in 388 usable questionnaires. Structural equation modeling is used to analyze data.
   Findings - Results of this research provide support to the research objectives. Two of the three proposed factors extending TAM, namely, perceived connectedness and enjoyment were found to have a significant effect on attitude toward social media use. Attitude toward social media use was found to have a significant effect on level of use and level of use was found to have a significant effect on continuation intention. Additionally, satisfaction was found to have a significant direct effect on continuation intention.
   Practical implications - Findings of this research provide managers with useful insights about what they need to focus on when designing their social media strategies.
   Originality/value - This study provides a different way of theorizing customer engagement by incorporating new variables to TAM that are particularly relevant to the social media context. It also draws a link between attitude toward social media and levels of use, which has been understudied in literature.

AB  - BACKGROUND Many schools transitioned online to reduce viral spread and promote social distancing amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Remote learning may impact health behaviors and coping strategies among adolescents, including reduced physical activity and increased screen time. Social media and peers provide information about the pandemic to adolescents and may influence prevention behaviors. This study aims to assess adolescent knowledge and information about COVID-19, determine students' behavior change, and identify sources students turn to for information on the pandemic.
   METHODS Students from 2 high schools in semi-rural Georgia participated in a cross-sectional online survey in March 2020 (N = 761).
   RESULTS Common sources for COVID-19 news were peers (80%) and social media (58%). Few adolescents (3%) indicated that teenagers were at higher risk of severe illness due to COVID-19. Responses reveal adolescents understand social distancing and many are participating in prevention behaviors, including handwashing (87%) and staying at home as much as possible (87%). Most respondents reported increases in screen time outside of class (82%).
   CONCLUSIONS Findings suggest adolescents are obtaining COVID-19 knowledge from various sources, including social media, with varying degrees of implementation of prevention practices. Increases in screen time and reduced physical activity may impact long-term health among adolescents.

AB  - This study examined the efficacy of a Photovoice-based video as a novel online anti-stigma video in reducing mental illness stigma, as well as the role of empathic concern in stigma reduction. Photovoice is a grassroots process by which members of a marginalized group, such as people with a mental illness, document and convey their experience; in this study's context, the experience of living with a mental illness and the stigma associated with this experience. Canadian undergraduate university students (n = 303; average age = 21) were randomly assigned to view either a Photovoice-based anti-stigma intervention video (n = 156) or a control video (n = 147). Compared to the control condition, the Photovoice-based video was efficacious in reducing mental illness stigma, including reduced fear and anger toward people with a mental illness, decreased perceptions of dangerousness, and decreased desired social distance. In addition, the intervention was efficacious in maintaining reduced desired social distance relative to the control at 1-month post-intervention. Finally, empathic concern was found to mediate the relationship between the Photovoice-based video and reduced mental illness stigma, suggesting that one way the intervention reduced mental illness stigma was by eliciting empathy in the viewer.

AB  - This paper explored how the source of exclusion (ingroup/outgroup) influences ingroup identification and political engagement. It is well documented that social exclusion has a negative impact on individuals' well-being, but less is known how it affects identification with the ingroup, and subsequent behavior. In two studies, one survey (N = 193) and one experiment (N = 384), we explore how exclusion in the context of Brexit impacts identification with the EU and Remain cause and in turn engagement with a pro-EU group. Participants sympathetic to the Remain-side were recruited and findings suggest that exclusion from the outgroup (Leave-sympathizers) increases ingroup identity measures and engagement with a Pro-EU group. Mediation analysis revealed that increased ingroup identity mediated engagement with the ingroup.

AB  - Evidence on the association between internet usage and incidence of depression remains mixed. We examined the associations between different categories of internet usage and developing clinical depression. We used data from the 2013 and 2016 waves of the Japan Gerontological Evaluation Study (JAGES) comprising 12,333 physically and cognitively independent adults aged >= 65 years. Participants were engaged in seven categories of internet usage: communication with friends/family, social media, information collection about health/medicine, searching for medical facilities, purchase of drugs and vitamins, shopping, and banking. We found that internet use for communication had a protective influence on the probability of developing clinical depression defined as the Geriatric Depression Scale scores >= 5 or self-reported diagnosed depression. Our findings support the role of online communication with friends/family in preventing clinical depression among older people. Online communication could be particularly useful in the COVID-19 crisis because many families are geographically dispersed and/or socially distanced.

AB  - Living in a risky society, in which risk and uncertainty are the rule rather than the exception implies that individuals need to develop new psychological resources to face unpredictable changes and to consider risk and uncertainty as opportunities. This study presents a new definition of the construct of Subjective Risk Intelligence and a new scale to measure this construct, composed of four dimensions: imaginative capability, problem-solving self-efficacy, positive attitude toward uncertainty, and emotional stress vulnerability. The structure and the concurrent and discriminant validity of the scale have been verified, and have demonstrated good psychometric features. Indications for future research and applications in interventions are provided.

AB  - Introduction: Specialized registry in the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) is necessary to gather process and report data in an accurate and timely manner. An electronic registry could enable the mother and infant to be monitored and traced through complete and comprehensive data.
   Aim: Registry has been developed on the basis of a literature study and view point of participants about effectiveness and efficiency was evaluated.
   Materials and Methods: A situational analysis was performed to achieve a clear view from current status of NICU data collecting and reporting, then a customized three tier architecture was proposed to design and implement a specialized registry. User satisfaction was evaluated by system usability scale among 30 participants to assess user's attitude about system.
   Results: A comprehensive data model with seven categories was defined by 65 entities, which actually retains part of the infants information. System usability scale was in a high range about 70%. The highest agreement is on reduced registration error. The advantages of system were perceived by users and they had positive attitude about it.
   Conclusion: The use of a suitable architecture and standard templates lead to enhanced acceptability, effectiveness, performance and functionality. Quality of data and health promotion has a direct relationship with system usability. These systems have a great potential to increase safety of patients by providing fast and easy access to information, monitoring and decision support operations.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has created new opportunities for organized criminal groups and confronted them with new challenges. Analysis of how these groups have reacted to the pandemic yields better understanding of how they work and enables the devising of more effective counter-strategies. To this end, we identified illustrative cases regarding the provision of illegal governance and infiltration of the legal economy by conducting a systematic content analysis of international media articles and institutional reports published during the first eight months after the outbreak of the pandemic (January to August 2020). These cases were further analyzed in order to cluster the behavior of criminal groups in response to the COVID-19 emergency, and the means by which they tried to exploit the pandemic to strengthen their political and economic power. We found that different governance-type criminal groups proposed themselves as institutions able to mitigate the burdens imposed by the pandemic by providing support to people in need and enforcing social-distancing measures. Further, identified cases did not provide evidence of groups devoted to the provision of illicit services and goods assuming any governance role. In this respect, the available evidence supports previous knowledge about organized crime. Cases of misappropriation of public funds and organized crime infiltration of the legal economy seem less common, at least in the first phase of the pandemic. The wholesale distribution of pharmaceuticals and medicines has been the sector targeted the most.

AB  - Purpose: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a widespread impact on the health sector worldwide, both in the clinical and research subsector. This has necessitated for the invention of protocols compliant with social distancing policies to efficiently tackle the current needs. Our aim is to describe a novel remote imaging technique, which helped us continue our research with widefield swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (WF SS-OCTA).
   Patients and Methods: As a part of this cross-sectional observational study from August 2020 to September 2020 at Massachusetts Eye and Ear (MEE), we used our institute approved remote desktop, outside of MEE, to gain full access to the on-site WF SS-OCTA device in the imaging room for the purpose of remote imaging. With only the patient being in the imaging room, effective communication was established via video conferencing on an encrypted tablet computer device for the entire procedure.
   Results: We imaged four patients with various retinal pathologies, aged 32-69 years. All images obtained were of high quality and signal strength (median score 9/10 for both) and all patients reported a highly satisfactory, comfortable, and safe experience amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Conclusion: This novel method is better for remote imaging compared to the previously described techniques as it is time and cost effective, requires limited resources without compromising the image quality or patient satisfaction and adheres to the various guidelines for infection control, most importantly social distancing. As a paradigm shift, this can also be employed in future for setups with limited staff like busy emergency departments or a rural setup with limited access or difficult commute, in the "newnormal" era.

AB  - Social media is associated with the rise of new types of celebrities called influencers, who share their current experiences and ideas and often endorse brands. Developing and keeping a large community of followers is one of the most important goals of influencers. The size of their audiences is one of the elements that make them relevant to the advertising industry. The main objective of the present research is to explore the mechanism that determines users' online behavior related to influencers, such as following them on social media. Moreover, the study examined the role of the perceived information quality and of the perceived trust of the influencers in shaping audiences' attitudes toward influencers. The moderating role of the frequency of Instagram and YouTube use on the relationship between perceived information quality and trustworthiness was explored by conducting an online survey (N=1088). The main takeaway from the study is that influencers who want to grow their audiences have to create perceived quality content. This can contribute to both positive attitudes and the development of trust. Also, the frequency of Instagram use has a small moderating role, while the frequency of YouTube use has no effects on the trustworthiness of the influencers.

AB  - The present study investigated the effects of applying cumulative group dynamic assessment (G-DA) procedures (Poehner, 2009) to support EFL writing development in a university context in Iran. It focused on learner achievement, patterns of occurrence of mediation incidents, and learners' and teachers' perceptions towards G-DA. Quantitative data was collected from learners' performance on writing tests and the frequency of occurrence of mediation incidents involving EFL writing components based on Jacobs, Zinkgraf, Wormouth, Hartfield, and Hughey's (1981) scale. Findings revealed that G-DA was more effective than conventional explicit intervention for supporting EFL writing development. Also, it worked best for low ability learners as compared to mid and high ability ones. Besides, the number of mediation incidents declined from 27 in session one to 8 in the final session, confirming the efficacy of G-DA in promoting both EFL writing and learner self-regulation. Most teacher mediation involved language use, vocabulary, and organization and fewer incidents involved content and mechanics. Qualitative data analysis indicated that most learners and teachers held positive attitudes towards the efficacy of G-DA for supporting EFL writing development. However, a few participants asserted that the procedures were unsystematic, stressful, time consuming, and inappropriate for large classes.

AB  - Previous research suggests that people from some religious backgrounds hold more negative attitudes towards gay men than others do. The current research focuses on psychological variables as an alternative explanation to religious affiliation, testing whether masculinity beliefs regarding gay men and their perceived threat to one's masculinity can explain such between-group differences in negative attitudes. With a sample of 155 male heterosexual university students (Muslims and Christians in Germany), we found that Muslims held more negative attitudes towards gay men than Christians did. Yet, this relation was partially mediated by beliefs about the masculinity of gay men and the experience of masculinity threat imposed by gay men, substantially reducing the effect of religious affiliation on antigay attitudes. In sum, similar psychological processes explained antigay attitudes of both Muslims and Christians. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The COVID-19 vaccine has become a strategic vehicle for reducing the spread of the pandemic. However, the uptake of the vaccine by the public is more complicated than simply making it available. Based on social learning theory, this study examines the role of communication sources and institutional trust as barriers and incentives as motivators of people's attitudes toward vaccination and actual vaccination. Data were collected via an online panel survey among Israelis aged 18-55 and then analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings show that social media trust negatively mediates the effect of exposure to information on the vaccine on attitudes toward vaccination. However, mass media trust and institutional trust positively mediate this relationship. Incentives were effective motivators for forming positive attitudes and moderating the effect of institutional trust on attitude toward vaccination. This study facilitates a deeper understanding of health communication theory in pandemics and makes important recommendations for practitioners and policy makers.

AB  - Introduction: Evidence-based dentistry (EBD) can help provide the best treatment option for every patient, however, its implementation in restorative dentistry is very limited.
   Objective: This study aimed at assessing the barriers preventing the implementation of EBD among dental undergraduate and graduate students in Montreal, and explore possible solutions to overcome these barriers.
   Materials and methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted by means of a paper format self-administrated questionnaire distributed among dental students. The survey assessed the barriers and potential solutions for implementation of an evidence-based practice.
   Results: Sixty-one students completed the questionnaire. Forty-one percent of respondents found evidence-based literature to be the most reliable source of information for restorative treatment planning, however, only 16% used it. They considered that finding reliable information was difficult and they sometimes encountered conflicting information when consulting different sources. Dental students had positive attitudes towards the need for better access to evidence-based literature to assist learning and decision making in restorative treatment planning and to improve treatment outcomes. Even for dentists trained in EBD, online searching takes too much time, and even though it can provide information of better quality than personal intuition, it might not be enough to identify the best available evidence.
   Conclusions: Even though dental students are aware of the importance of EBD in restorative dentistry they rarely apply the concept, mainly due to time constraints. For this reason, implementation of EBD would probably require faster access to evidence-based knowledge.

AB  - The current emergence of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19) has put the world in threat. Social distancing, quarantine and governmental measures such as lockdowns, social isolation, and public hygiene are helpful in fighting the pandemic, while awareness campaigns through social media (radio, TV, etc.) are essential for their implementation. On this basis, we propose and analyse a mathematical model for the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission influenced by awareness campaigns through social media. A time delay factor due to the reporting of the infected cases has been included in the model for making it more realistic. Existence of equilibria and their stability, and occurrence of Hopf bifurcation have been studied using qualitative theory. We have derived the basic reproduction number (R-0) which is dependent on the rate of awareness. We have successfully shown that public awareness has a significant role in controlling the pandemic. We have also seen that the time delay destabilizes the system when it crosses a critical value. In sum, this study shows that public awareness in the form of social distancing, lockdowns, testing, etc. can reduce the pandemic with a tolerable time delay.

AB  - The United States has the highest number of COVID-19 cases, yet many Americans have responded indifferently toward policies designed to combat the spread of the virus. While nearly all 50 states have implemented some type of stay-at-home policy to encourage social distancing, there has been high variation in the degree of compliance. We argue that this variance is partly driven by gender resentment. Gender resentment reduces trust in female political leaders and thus decreases compliance with government policy and recommendations. Using data from SafeGraph and the 2016 American National Election Study, we demonstrate that the effect of stay-at-home policies on social distancing is reduced when gender resentment increases in states with female leaders. However, when gender resentment is low, there is no difference in the effect of policies on behavior. This research has important implications for understanding unseen barriers that can mediate the efficacy of female political leaders.

AB  - This paper reports on findings from an examination of a nursing information system through the lens of Activity Theory. The information system was designed to support real-time nursing documentation in acute care hospital contexts. The objective was to enable superior nursing care to ensue by providing nurses with the opportunity to document patient care data into a tablet computer located at the patient bedside. The system was evaluated in a not-for-profit acute care hospital's wards during its implementation. Nurses' interactions with the system and their perceptions were collected and analysed through the lens of Activity Theory. The analysis highlighted nurses' positive attitude towards the system and identified potential mediation capabilities as well as areas for improvements. Activity Theory was found to be useful to examine the positive and potentially problematic aspects of this new nursing information system.

AB  - This article examines how political factors influence anti-immigrant attitudes by focusing on political articulation performed by political parties active at the national level in 26 European countries. Multi-level analysis reveals a significant positive association between general party articulation and anti-immigrant attitudes. In particular, it seems to be when traditional right- or left-wing parties articulate that attitudes towards immigrants turn increasingly negative. Left-leaning individuals are particularly influenced when parties belonging to the political left raise these issues, which indicates that the ideological position of the individual functions as a mediating factor in this regard. The results contribute to a broader understanding of the role of political factors and underscore the importance of their inclusion in cross-national studies of anti-immigrant attitudes.

AB  - Objective: The potential ability for weather to affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission has been an area of controversial discussion during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals' perceptions of the impact of weather can inform their adherence to public health guidelines; however, there is no measure of their perceptions. We quantified Twitter users' perceptions of the effect of weather and analyzed how they evolved with respect to real-world events and time.
   Materials and Methods: We collected 166,005 English tweets posted between January 23 and June 22, 2020 and employed machine learning/natural language processing techniques to filter for relevant tweets, classify them by the type of effect they claimed, and identify topics of discussion.
   Results: We identified 28,555 relevant tweets and estimate that 40.4 % indicate uncertainty about weather's impact, 33.5 % indicate no effect, and 26.1 % indicate some effect. We tracked changes in these proportions over time. Topic modeling revealed major latent areas of discussion.
   Discussion: There is no consensus among the public for weather's potential impact. Earlier months were characterized by tweets that were uncertain of weather's effect or claimed no effect; later, the portion of tweets claiming some effect of weather increased. Tweets claiming no effect of weather comprised the largest class by June. Major topics of discussion included comparisons to influenza's seasonality, President Trump's comments on weather's effect, and social distancing.
   Conclusion: We exhibit a research approach that is effective in measuring population perceptions and identifying misconceptions, which can inform public health communications.

AB  - Attitudes play a pivotal role in the inclusion of children with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in mainstream schools but little is known about factors that influence these. This study investigated the effect of ADHD knowledge and stigma on professionals attitudes towards mainstream inclusion. Teachers, support staff, school managers and educational psychologists completed questionnaires assessing ADHD knowledge, stigma and attitudes towards inclusion. Psychologists displayed more knowledge, had less stigmatising beliefs and more inclusive attitudes than other professions. Regression analyses revealed those with more knowledge of ADHD and less stigma held more positive attitudes towards mainstream inclusion. Results have implications for how to promote inclusive beliefs about ADHD.

AB  - Attitude is a multidimensional and complex notion that considerably empowers or limits the major life activities of humans. Health professionals' attitudes toward people with disabilities are significant factors in the rehabilitation process. Soon after completing their coursework, the final-year students from health science meet the patients and rehabilitate them. This study accordingly aims to assess the attitude toward disability among final-year health science students before and after administering a disability-specific structured teaching program. A total of 243 final-year undergraduate health science students from medical, dental, physical therapy, pharmacy, laboratory sciences, radiology sciences, and nursing aged between 21 and 27 years participated in this study. This work employed the Scale of Attitudes Toward Disabled Persons (SADP) to measure attitudes among participants. The mean pre- and posttest SADP scores were 83.59 +/- 15.45 and 107.83 +/- 62, respectively (p < .001). Students from medical, dental, physical therapy, and nursing showed significant positive attitudes toward disability compared with other students, whereas college students in the final year of health science generally had poor attitudes toward disability. The results indicate that the disability-specific structured teaching program is effective in improving the attitude toward disability among final-year health science students. Accordingly, the authors recommend modifying the disability-related content in the health sciences curriculum.

AB  - Public accountant profile dominated by over-50-year-old people appears to be alarming. The intention towards this profession had better be fostered immixliately; therefore, the predictors to boost the intention need to be known. The study examines the influence of accounting knowledge toward the intention to work as public accountant using the Theory of Planned Behavior approach. A survey of 146 students revealed that there was a significantly positive influence of accounting knowledge toward the intention of becoming public accountant, both directly and indirectly, through the mediation of attitudes and perceived behavioral control. Subjective norms did not function as an appropriate mediation. The findings are expected to contribute to universities and professional accounting bodies. The study urges the accounting educators to redesign and reorganize the curriculum, including a more interesting teaching and learning methods. The professional accounting bodies are expected to cooperate with accounting educators in enhancing the internship program and providing real-case study to instill a positive attitude and assurance toward the students' competence, which, in the end, might spark the intention to work as public accountant. That accounting knowledge positively influences the intention toward public accounting profession through the mediation of perceived behavioral control was statistically supported.

AB  - Objective:Suicide is a complex phenomenon, with numerous factors contributing to an individual's risk of suicide. The aim of the present study was to explore how risk and protective factors for suicide interact with one another in a network sense and to determine which factors were most central to a network of these factors. Method:Using an online survey, cross-sectional data were collected from a sample of 515 individuals who lived in New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. Participants were recruited through either social media or Prolific Academic. A network of 18 risk and protective factors for suicide was estimated using network analysis. Analyses were preregistered on the Open Science Framework. Results:Factors that had the highest strength centrality were feeling depressed, feeling hopeless, perceived burdensomeness, self-esteem, and social support. Factors that were directly associated with suicidal ideation included feeling depressed, perceived burdensomeness, feeling hopeless, self-esteem, resilience, access to mental health services and a positive attitude toward these services. Conclusion:This research demonstrates the importance of examining protective factors as well as risk factors when estimating an individual's suicide risk. The results suggest that interventions targeting depression may be particularly beneficial in reducing suicide risk, but further longitudinal research is required.

AB  - Over the last decade, wearable technology has seen significant developments, making it possible to enhance our lives. One of the areas in which wearable technology can cause large changes is education, where it can be used to make educational experiences intrinsically motivating and more relevant to youth culture. In this paper, we focus on the use of wearable technology to improve the educational environment. The quantity of electronic assets used in the learning environment is rising, which presents a managerial problem when these devices are nonfunctioning. Therefore, we present a mobile application to solve this problem. The suggested approach consists of creating a mobile application named classroom clinic (CRC) to help faculty members and students locate the closest maintenance technician via wearable radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and to provide fast responses to the problems alerted to in the classroom, thereby avoiding any disturbances or delays during the lecture. Moreover, this application allows the maintenance service to efficiently manage any malfunctions of classroom electronic devices. To evaluate the CRC application, a pilot study was conducted at the College of Computer and Information Sciences, female campus of King Saud University, with 15 faculty members and students and 5 clinic members. The results showed high usability rates and generally positive attitudes towards using the app.

TI  - Ethnic Language Use and Ethnic Identity for Sarawak Indigenous Groups in Malaysia
T2  - OCEANIC LINGUISTICS

KW  - BIDAYUH
AB  - This paper examines the link between strength of ethnic identity and extent of ethnic language use for some indigenous speech communities in Sarawak, Malaysia. The domains of language use examined are mass media, education, transactions, friendship, religion, and family. A total of 568 indigenous adolescents in six secondary schools in Sarawak from both urban and rural localities participated in a survey. The results show that ethnic language use is the most extensive among the Penan, followed by the Than, Saban, and Kelabit. Ethnic language use is relatively low for the Kenyah, Melanau, Murut, and Bidayuh. The findings suggest that ethnic language use is more extensive in groups that are numerically dominant, who live in their ancestral home area, and whose language has less regional variation. However, participants from various Sarawak indigenous groups were similar in their positive attitudes toward their ethnic identity, and the range of variation is narrow. The results indicate that strength of ethnic identity and extent of ethnic language use are not directly linked for the Sarawak indigenous speech communities examined. In such contexts, language maintenance may not be the main reason for cultural maintenance, even though it is still relevant for the preservation of cultural knowledge.

Using the Mann-Whitney test, we evaluated the difference between the median number of applied doses during the periods April 2019 to March 2020 and from April 2020 to September 2020. Spatial analysis identified clusters with a high or low percentage reduction in the median applied doses. Prais-Winsten regression models identified temporal trends in the applieddoses from both periods.Results: There was a significant reduction in the median HPV vaccine doses applied, formation of spatial clusters and, after a sharp drop in the number of applieddoses during the months following social distancing. There was a tendency to increase the applied vaccines doses.Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduction of the number of HPV vaccine doses applied as a possible effect of restrictive measures caused by the pandemic.

AB  - The paper examines the representations of Ukrainian refugees in Polish press at the beginning of the 2022 Russian invasion. Using corpus linguistics methods (namely, collocation analysis) it shows that the displaced Ukrainians were mostly referred to as (war) refugees and discussed with respect to their movement and reception in Poland. The study contrasts the construal of Ukrainian refugees in media outlets with different ideological and business aims. The findings are also discussed with respect to how European media tend to cover immigration from other regions, notably the Middle East and North Africa, and how these two types of migration become linked in the analysed news reports. Altogether, while pointing to a potential of the media to shape positive attitudes towards refugees, as attested by their coverage of Ukrainians, the study also highlights the extent to which racism is likely to determine the construal of different groups of migrants.

AB  - Following COVID-19, the CDC asked individuals to social distance and state and local authorities nationwide began issuing curfews and recommendations to "shelter-in-place." Known to be more susceptible to the negative effects of COVID-19 and often coping with higher levels of social isolation, many worried that older adults' mental health would suffer. While computer-mediated communication (CMC) is on the rise among older adults, whether and how older adults leverage the social benefits of CMC remains underexplored. This study assesses older adults' CMC use after COVID and the impact of CMC engagement on access to connection, information, and resources. We follow 22 older adults over 6 weeks, using longitudinal qualitative surveys to study CMC use patterns and mental health outcomes. Results revealed that while older adults exhibited purpose-driven CMC engagement, limited integration into larger online communities restricted access to up-to-the-minute information, notably early in the pandemic. Longitudinal findings show progressively less engagement with online news and information, withdrawal from online social engagement, and a progressive relaxing of social distancing. This study sheds light on how best to reach older adults following disaster, and where older adults may be disadvantaged as social media becomes a modern "emergency broadcast system."

Design/methodology/approach Using a sample of 510 Weibo users in China, the conceptual model is tested by structural equation modeling (SEM) in Lisrel 8.8 statistical software. Findings This study examined that influencers' source characteristics stimulate consumers' positive attitudes (image satisfaction and/or advertising trust), in turn affect consumers' purchase intention. The expertise, originality and homophily of influencers positively affect two attitudes of consumers. The attractiveness only positively affects image satisfaction, and the interactivity only positively affects advertising trust. Besides that, this study also verified the mediating role of consumers' self-brand connection between the two attitudes and purchase intentions. Originality/value By distinguishing two different attitudes of consumers and incorporating consumers' self-brand connection, we proposed a complete theoretical framework for the overall mechanism of influence marketing based on communication-persuasion matrix.

AB  - The aim of this research was to explore gender differences in musical taste and the mediating role of functions of music between gender and musical taste. The research included 740 Croatian and Slovenian students. The results confirmed the existence of gender differences in both musical taste and functions of music. Females preferred the Reflective-Complex musical style, while males showed greater preferences towards Intense-Rebellious style of music. There was no significant gender difference in preferring Traditional and Contemporary Ethno or Energetic and Rhythmic musical style. With regard to the functions of music, there were no significant differences between males and females in identity/culture and background and focus/concentration functions of music. Males assessed political attitudes as a more important function of music than females, while females assessed all other functions of music higher than males did. A complete mediation effect of functions of music was established for gender and Reflective-Complex and Slo-Yugo Pop musical style.

AB  - Research on creative education in Taiwan is at a turning point after entering a new millennium. Developing positive attitudes and creative thinking has become increasingly essential for boosting college students' competitiveness in this fast-paced and changing world. There is a current need to extend knowledge on the association between optimistic attitudes and innovative behaviors. This study explored structural relationships between college students' optimism, creative self-efficacy, and innovative behavior in terms of hypothesized antecedents of optimism (cognitive reappraisal, promotion, and prevention) and the mediating role of creative self-efficacy via a structural equation modeling framework. The 970 participants were undergraduate students from public and private universities in Taiwan. Results indicated that (a) confirmatory factor analyses supported the evidence of construct-related validity of instruments administered in the study; (b) cognitive reappraisal and promotion had positive effects on optimism, but prevention had a negative effect; and (c) creative self-efficacy significantly and partially mediated the relationship between optimism and innovative behavior.

AB  - Recent political contests across Europe and North America have been propelled by a wave of populist, anti-immigrant resentment, and it was widely expected that these populist victories would further fan the flames of xenophobia. This article reports the results of an experiment around the Brexit referendum, designed to test how populist victories shape anti-immigrant attitudes. The study finds that anti-immigrant attitudes actually softened after the Brexit referendum, among both Leave and Remain supporters, and these effects persisted for several months. How could a right-wing, populist victory soften anti-immigrant attitudes? The authors use causal mediation analysis to understand this 'populist paradox'. Among Leavers, a greater sense of control over immigration channelled the effects of the Brexit outcome onto anti-immigrant attitudes. Individuals' efforts to distance themselves from accusations of xenophobia and racism explains the softening of attitudes towards immigration observed among both Leavers and Remainers.

AB  - Prejudice against individuals with mental illness stems from multiple factors, including the personality traits of those harboring the prejudiced attitudes. However, little is known about the personality processes (as opposed to static correlates) leading to negative attitudes and discrimination toward individuals with mental illness. The present research tested a mediational model in which negative attitudes against such people and resulting intentions to discriminate are distally rooted in just-world beliefs, which predispose people toward higher social dominance orientation, a well-known proximal personality predictor of general prejudice. Participants completed measures of behavioral intentions, attitudes toward individuals with mental illness, social dominance orientation, and belief in a just world. The proposed mediational model was supported, and an alternative causal model was not. These results illuminate the personality-process antecedents of attitudes toward individuals with mental illness and provide a foundation for research targeting interventions intended to reduce prejudice and discrimination against this population.

AB  - Citizens' social policy opinions are strongly influenced by a simple heuristic: Are the recipients of social benefits deserving or not? Adding to this growing literature, we provide evidence that the deservingness heuristic does not treat all social benefits alike. Already at the level of preconscious processing, the heuristic displays a bias toward tagging the recipients of health carethat is, sick individualsas deserving. This powerful, implicit effect overrides other opinion factors and produces broad-based support among the public for health careacross levels of self-interest, media frames, ideological divides, and national cultures. In contrast, when the deservingness heuristic is utilized for reasoning about unemployment benefits, implicit psychological constraints are fewer and political conflict erupts depending on differences in interest and worldviews. Using a variety of methodologies, we track this fundamental difference between the politics of health care and unemployment benefits from the level of implicit processing to the level of political attitudes.

AB  - The present article investigates socio-psychological conditions for the formation of ideas about the spiritual ideal for children of primary school age. The criteria (value-positive attitude of the child to the ideals of Beauty and Good, identification with the ideal bearers, imitation of the behaviour of people and literary characters, understanding of children?s own ideas about the spiritual ideal), indicators and levels (high, average, low) for the formation of the idea of a spiritual ideal in children of elementary school age are established. The results based on age and gender specifics and levels of formation of ideas about the spiritual ideal of primary school children are obtained. The factors influencing formation of the spiritual ideal and socio-psychological conditions of its formation are revealed: the peculiarities of relationships with others (parents, teachers, friends, peers, acquaintances and strangers); influence of mass media (TV products, computer network, radio information, books, literary works, magazines, newspapers); artistic aesthetic influence (works of art and theatre, communication with nature, aesthetic priorities and preferences, artistic amateur activities).

AB  - This study evaluates the effectiveness of augmented reality (AR) as an e-commerce tool using two products - sunglasses and watches. Study 1 explores the effectiveness of AR by comparing it to a conventional website. The results show that AR provides effective communication benefits by generating greater novelty, immersion, enjoyment, and usefulness, resulting in positive attitudes toward medium and purchase intention, compared to the web-based product presentations. Study 2 compares the paths by which consumers evaluate products through AR versus web with a focus on interactivity and vividness. It is revealed that immersion mediates the relationship between interactivity/vividness and two outcome variables - usefulness and enjoyment in the AR condition compared to the web condition where no significant paths between interactivity and immersion and between previous media experience and media novelty are found. Participants' subjective opinions about AR are examined through opinion mining to better understand consumer responses to AR.

AB  - Utilizing grounded theory methodology and drawing from sexual script theory as a research lens, we examined familial gender ideologies, media portrayals of Black and Latina women, dating attitudes, and sexual behaviors among 33 low-income early adolescent (aged 11-14) African American and Mexican American young women. Themes revealed divergent experiences for African American and Mexican American young women. In particular, African American participants reported egalitarian familial gender ideologies and sexual objectification of Black women, as well as more open and positive attitudes toward dating and sexuality. In contrast, Mexican American participants reported patriarchal familial gender ideologies and the portrayed mistreatment of Latinas in telenovelas and Spanish language songs, along with cautious attitudes towards dating and sexuality. Additionally, Mexican American participants reported that they censored their communication about sexual matters with their family. Overall, findings suggest that interventions should be tailored accordingly for African American and Mexican American youth. Interventions with African American young women should focus on providing accurate information on safer sexual practices, whereas interventions with Mexican American young women should focus on promoting constructive conceptualizations of gender roles, which could help foster self-efficacy around sexual communication with parents and potential partners.

AB  - This study examines the psychological mechanism of consumers' environmentally responsible behaviors in college sport. The research is guided by a belief-attitude-intention (B-A-I) hierarchy model. The results revealed that consumers who see benefits in a college athletic department's pro-environmental initiatives (PEIs) have positive attitudes toward the PEIs. These attitudes then drive the consumers' intentions to engage in environmentally responsible behaviors. The findings of this empirical study confirmed the causal flow of a B-A-I link in a college athletic department's PEIs. In the hierarchy-of-effects process, belief is a key precursor of action. Attitude appears to function as a mediator between belief and behavioral intention. Practical implications, in terms of communication strategies to strengthen consumers' beliefs about the benefits of PEIs, are presented. In short, the college athletic department is crucial in the fulfillment of an institutional priority.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has had significant consequences on public health and lifestyle and has negatively affected mental health and the level of physical activity worldwide. This study examined the impact of reopening fitness centers and nonessential services and introducing flexible measures to ensure social distancing on physical activity and mental health.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a longitudinal study. A self-administered questionnaire, including personal, behavioral, physical activity, perception of health, and mood state disorder information, was answered by 128 Brazilians in June 2020 (during severe restrictive measures) and again in April 2021 (after fitness centers and nonessential services were reopened).
   RESULTS: The restriction level adopted in April 2021 was significantly lower than that in June 2020 (p<0.001). The level of physical activity (p<0.001) and health status perception (p<0.001) decreased from June 2020 to April 2021. The median values for depression and anxiety did not differ across the study period.
   CONCLUSIONS: The level of physical activity was reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, and anxiety and depression were not improved following less restrictive social distancing measures and the reopening of fitness centers. Thus, the return to a prepandemic level of physical activity and mental health status may not be automatic. The results presented herein suggest that the decrease in physical activity observed in the population may be challenging in the postpandemic period.

AB  - The efforts to promote healthy eating remain ineffective. The inability of these campaigns to counter the marketing resources of the mainstream fast-food chains is among the primary explanations for such failures. However, from the information processing perspective, the message's features may also play a significant role. Cue reactivity research has shown the importance of evaluating visual and verbal cues to avoid undesirable addictive behavioral outcomes. Bridging the evaluative space model (ESM) and the limited capacity model of motivated mediated message processing (LC4MP), the goal of this experiment is to further explore how food-related visual and verbal cues elicit psychophysiological reactivity and how this reactivity in turn affects attitudes toward the promotion. Multilevel modeling results showed that healthy food images paired with encouragement words elicited an uncoupled pattern of the appetitive system activation and received a predominantly positive attitude from audiences (N = 180). Results suggested that thematic congruent messages are preferred in health communication settings. Junk food images, regardless of being paired with encouragement or discouragement verbal cues, should be avoided due to their automatic activation of the appetitive motivational system.

AB  - Recent research has shown that a brief, casual touch administered by an outgroup member reduces prejudice towards the group to which the toucher belongs. In this study, we take the research on physical contact and prejudice a step further by addressing the relation between individuals' amount of Experienced Intergroup Physical Contact (EIPC), across distinct contexts and involving different body parts, and attitudes towards foreign people. Specifically, we hypothesized that the amount of EIPC would be positively associated with both quantity and quality of intergroup contact, but that only quality would mediate the relationship between the amount of EIPC and outgroup attitudes, quality being more directly linked to the evaluative component of outgroup attitudes. To attain this aim, we asked participants to self-report the amount of EIPC, the quantity and quality of their intergroup contact and their attitudes towards foreign people. Consistent with our hypothesis: (1) as EIPC increased, positive attitudes towards foreign people increased; (2) higher levels of EIPC were associated with better quality and higher quantity of intergroup contact; (3) only quality of intergroup contact mediated the relationship between the amount of EIPC and attitudes towards foreign people. Results were discussed in relation to research on intergroup contact and physical contact.

AB  - How do modern individuals form a sense of the vast societies in which they live? Social cognition has evolved to make sense of small, intimate social groups, but in complex mass societies, comparable vivid social cues are scarcer. Extant research on political attitudes and behavior has emphasized media and interpersonal networks as key sources of cues. Extending a classical argument, we provide evidence for the importance of an alternative and internal source: imagination. With a focus on social welfare, we collected survey data from two very different democracies, the United States and Denmark, and conducted several studies using explicit, implicit, and behavioral measures. By analyzing the effects of individual differences in imagination, we demonstrate that political cognition relies on vivid, mental simulations that engage evolved social and emotional decision-making mechanisms. It is in the mind's eye that vividness and engagement are added to people's sense of mass politics.

AB  - The notion of "responsible luxury" may appear as a contradiction in terms. This article investigates the influence of two defining characteristics of luxury products-scarcity and ephemerality-on consumers' perception of the fit between luxury and corporate social responsibility (CSR), as well as how this perceived fit affects consumers' attitudes toward luxury products. A field experiment reveals that ephemerality moderates the positive impact of scarcity on consumers' perception of fit between luxury and CSR. When luxury products are enduring (e.g., jewelry), a scarce product is perceived as more socially responsible than a more widely available one and provokes positive attitudes. However, this effect does not appear for ephemeral luxury products (e.g., clothing). The perceived fit between luxury and CSR mediates the combined effects of scarcity and ephemerality on consumers' attitudes toward luxury products. This study provides valuable insights that luxury brand managers can use to design their CSR and marketing strategies.

AB  - Although extensive research has documented the effectiveness of common or dual in-groups on improving intergroup relations, little is known about how individual-difference variables affect people's willingness to make such re-categorizations in the first place. Here, we demonstrate that individual differences in religious fundamentalism predict willingness to categorize in terms of the common Abrahamic religious origins of Christianity and Islam among Christians and Muslims. Study 1 (n=243 Christians, 291 Muslims) uses multigroup structural equation modeling and Study 2 (n=80 Christians) an experimental manipulation to show that religious fundamentalism causes lower dual Abrahamic categorization, which, in turn, predicts more positive attitudes toward the respective out-group, mediating the negative effects of religious fundamentalism on religious intergroup bias. While making the general case that individual differences may play important roles for dual categorizations, these results also highlight the specific positive potential of dual ecumenical categorizations for improving interreligious relations. Research and societal implications are discussed. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - While the Internet offers many opportunities to access information, training and communication, it has created new grounds for risks, threats and harm. With the rise of populism and extremism, new forms of cyberbullying emerge, more specifically cyberhate. The Internet has become a privileged tool to disseminate hatred, based on racism, xenophobia, bigotry, and islamophobia. Organized groups use the internet as a dissemination tool for their ideas, to build collective identity and to recruit young people. The presence of these groups has been facilitated worldwide thanks to technology. Yet, little attention has been granted to the way the Internet eases the activities of individuals who promote and propagate hate online. The role they play in spreading racism, xenophobia and bigotry is paramount as they regularly comment online about news and events, interacting with like-minded people with impunity because the web prevents people from being easily identified or controlled. While literature on exposure to hateful contents and cyberhate victimization is growing, little is known about who the perpetrators really are. A survey with young people aged 12-20 (N = 1,889) was completed in France and forms the basis of this article. It provides an understanding of the characteristics and associated variables of cyberhate perpetration. The Structural Equation model shows that cyberhate perpetration is heavily related to time spent online, victimization, belonging to a deviant youth group, positive attitudes toward violence and racism. Results from the SEM further suggest that people who suffered from online victimization will themselves have a greater tendency to belong to deviant youth groups. Multiple mediation analysis further suggests that trust in institutions may however prevent young people from belonging to a deviant youth group and decrease positive attitudes toward violence, thus diminishing the tendency to perform hateful aggression.

AB  - We investigated whether existing intergroup contact experiences moderated the associations between prejudicial attitudes and behavioral tendencies towards outgroups across five studies in Turkey (total N = 1,281). Findings showed that among Turks who reported higher levels of cross-group friendship quantity (Study 1) and greater positive (but not negative) contact (Study 2) with Kurds, prejudicial attitudes did not predict negative outgroup behavioral tendencies. Confirming these studies, Study 3 indicated that the association between homophobic attitudes and outgroup avoidance/approach tendencies was weaker among individuals who reported more LGBTI friends. Study 4 replicated the latter finding among children using Syrians as the target outgroup. Study 5 further showed that the buffering role of intergroup contact occurred only among participants who held less certain attitudes towards Syrian refugees. Findings provide insights into how existing contact experiences shape the relationship between negative attitudes towards outgroups and relevant behavioral intentions.

AB  - This study investigates the persuasiveness effectiveness of the interplay effects of message framing, self-construal, and temporal construal (or construal level), on product attitudes, perceived product efficacy, and behavioral intention. The results indicate that for independent-self individuals, gain-framed messages raise more positive product attitudes, product efficacy, and behavioral intention than loss-framed messages when the temporal construal is distant or construal level is abstract. For interdependent-self individuals, loss-framed and mixed-framed messages raise more positive product attitudes, product efficacy, and behavioral intention than gain-framed messages. Interdependent-self individuals respond with more positive attitudes, product efficacy, and behavioral intention toward mixed-framed messages than independent-self individuals. Furthermore, the perceived product efficacy mediates the interaction between message framing, temporal construal, and self-construal for predicting behavioral intention. A match (vs. mismatch) between the message and temporal construal of an advertisement and the self-view of the recipient leads to systematic changes in advertisement effectiveness.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to test theories of organizational justice in the context of a police agency
   Design/methodology/approach - Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) was used to analyze data from a survey of officers in a police force in England.
   Findings - The SEM showed that organizational justice was associated with positive attitudes towards serving members of the public. This relationship was mediated by commitment to elements of community policing and, for community police officers, by general satisfaction with the organization.
   Practical implications - The findings suggest that police managers committed to implementing process-based policing policies may need to ensure their organizations also implement internal policies and practices that are procedurally fair.
   Originality/value - This study is one of the first to apply the well established literature on organizational justice to the context of policing, and the first to examine the impact of organizational justice on alignment with community policing and the service model.

AB  - Previous research has linked people's relational attachment orientations to emotional reactions and coping during crises, and to social trust and trust in societal institutions. The COVID-19 pandemic is a global crisis for which collective efforts, such as social distancing, are necessary to stop the spread of the virus. During previous pandemics, people high in trust have typically adhered to such efforts. In the present study, we investigated whether attachment orientations were related to people's adherence to authorities' guidelines to stop the spread of COVID-19. We also tested whether previous mediational findings-linking attachment-related avoidance to welfare state trust via social trust-would replicate. We used a web-based survey of 620 participants. Our findings showed that attachment-related anxiety was linked to low adherence to social distancing regulations. This finding was especially noteworthy because high attachment-anxious participants also experienced more negative emotions, yet negative emotions were generally linked to high adherence. Thus, people higher in attachment anxiety seem to have more difficulties in avoiding social situations despite heightened risk of catching and spreading the virus. In addition, attachment-related avoidance was negatively related to adherence and to welfare state trust, and its effects on welfare state trust were statistically mediated by low social trust.

AB  - This study tested a new method of using self-affirmation theory to increase adaptive responses to health risk messages. Participants' self-concepts were affirmed via text integrated with risk messages (public service announcements/PSAs) rather than by methods used in most previous studies that have limited applicability for campaigns employing mediated messages. Participants were exposed to health risk PSAs either including or not including affirming text to examine relative effects on message evaluation and adaptive responses. The moderating effect of personal relevance of the behavior on responses was also examined. Participants exposed to PSAs with integrated, affirming text (affirmed participants) reported more positive attitudes toward the PSA, greater self-efficacy, and greater intention to reduce risky behavior than participants exposed to messages without affirming text (non-affirmed participants). Compared to non-affirmed participants, affirmed participants also reported weaker perceptions of risk severity and equivalent perceptions of susceptibility. The personal relevance of the behavior did not moderate any effects of self-affirmation. Implications for health campaigns that employ mass-mediated messages are discussed.

AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to examine Diagnostic Radiography (DR) students' perceptions and attitudes towards the Health Collaboration Challenge (HCC), as an interprofessional learning opportunity.
   Methods: DR students participated in the HCC, an annual intensive interprofessional collaboration and assessment activity involving case-based learning. Students' attitudes towards Interprofessional Education (IPE) were measured using a modified version of the Interprofessional Socialisation and Valuing Scale (ISVS-21) and a bespoke questionnaire with items relating to the HCC. Subsequent focus groups explored students' experience of IPE within the HCC context.
   Results: Survey results (n = 30) suggested a mostly positive attitude towards IPE alongside other health care students, acknowledging the value of interprofessional teams in patient health care. Qualitative themes from focus group participants (n = 8) revealed that DR students, while appreciating the value of shared-decision making, found the HCC assessment distracting. Challenges included the intensive nature of the HCC, roles that DR students undertook in addressing assessment criteria, case complexity and opportunities for DR students to showcase their knowledge.
   Conclusion: Results suggest that the intensive and assessable nature of the HCC can overshadow the value of IPE for DR students, and immersive or staggered approaches to IPE could better align with DR professionals' unique role within the patient care spectrum.
   Implications for practice: Revised IPE models for DR students could include a more immersive environment, conducted over a longer period of time, with meetings at semi-regular intervals to promote an interprofessional-focus over a task-focus approach.

AB  - Objective: The emphasis on reducing the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) has highlighted complex barriers to accessing appropriate services. Internet and social media use by individuals with first-episode psychosis (FEP) was examined to explore how these platforms might be used to facilitate treatment initiation.
   Methods: Participants ages 15-35 were interviewed with the Pathways to Care for Psychosis Questionnaire, an 81-item instrument designed to explore online activity during symptom emergence.
   Results: Of 112 participants, 90% used the Internet and social media daily. The Internet was listed as the most used resource (62%) for information while symptoms were emerging. A minority (19%) shared concerns via social media, and 76% responded favorably to the possibility of receiving online mental health support.
   Conclusions: The Internet and social media were part of daily life for participants with FEP. Activity continued throughout the DUP, offering the prospect of earlier intervention. Participants expressed positive attitudes toward Internet-based outreach and engagement efforts.

AB  - Personal data lie at the forefront of different business models and constitute the main source of revenue of several online companies. In many cases, consumers may have incomplete information or may be inattentive about the digital transactions of their data. This paper investigates whether highlighting positive or negative aspects of online privacy policies, thereby mitigating the informational problem, can affect consumers' privacy actions and attitudes. Results of an online survey experiment indicate that participants adopt a more conservative stance on disclosing sensitive and identifiable information, even when positive attitudes of companies towards their privacy are made salient, compared to when privacy is not mentioned. On the other hand, they do not change their attitudes and social actions towards privacy. These findings suggest that privacy behavior is not necessarily sensitive to exposure to objective threats or benefits of disclosing personal information. Rather, people are inattentive and their dormant privacy concerns may manifest only when consumers are asked to think about privacy. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Media censorship is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes. We conduct a field experiment in China to measure the effects of providing citizens with access to an uncensored internet. We track subjects' media consumption, beliefs regarding the media, economic beliefs, political attitudes, and behaviors over 18 months. We find four main results: (i) free access alone does not induce subjects to acquire politically sensitive information; (ii) temporary encouragement leads to a persistent increase in acquisition, indicating that demand is not permanently low; (iii) acquisition brings broad, substantial, and persistent changes to knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and intended behaviors; and (iv) social transmission of information is statistically significant but small in magnitude. We calibrate a simple model to show that the combination of low demand for uncensored information and the moderate social transmission means China's censorship apparatus may remain robust to a large number of citizens receiving access to an uncensored internet.

AB  - Aims and objectives Overall, this study aimed to describe nursing care for patients with dementia in acute hospitals, with the objectives of describing the provided nursing care (a), nurses' attitudes and perceptions in caring for patients with dementia (b), and exploring how nurses deal with challenging behaviour (c). Additionally, we determined background variables associated with caring for people with dementia. Background Due to comorbidities, people with dementia are frequently admitted to acute care hospitals. Here, they are at high risk of complications. Nurses strive for good care but regularly experience insufficient knowledge and skills regarding caring for people with dementia. Design A cross-sectional survey study design. Methods Data were collected in seven Dutch acute hospitals and through social media. In total, 229 hospital nurses completed the questionnaire. We used the Geriatric In-Hospital Nursing Care Questionnaire and two subscales of Hynninen on managing challenging behaviour. This report followed the STROBE checklist. Results Nurses express that they often apply general preventive interventions not explicitly related to dementia care. In general, nurses have mixed feelings about the nursing care provided in their department. For challenging behaviour, a variety of approaches, including restrictive measures and medication, is applied. The nurses' attitudes and perceptions are influenced by the type of hospital where the nurses work, the level of education, the number of hours nurses work, and if the nurses completed a course on dementia in the last year. Conclusions Despite a positive attitude, nurses do not have the specific knowledge and skills needed to provide proper care. Nurses who recently completed a course on dementia had more positive attitudes and perceptions towards caring for patients with dementia. Relevance to clinical practice The results of this research can be used to improve the quality of nursing care for patients with dementia in acute hospitals.

TI  - A survey on adolescent health information seeking behavior related to high-risk behaviors in a selected educational district in Isfahan
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Backgrounds
   The characteristics and conditions of growth and development have made adolescence one of the most vital and influential ages for prevention and health promotion, especially in the area of high-risk behaviors. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to determine adolescent health information seeking behavior related to high-risk behaviors in a selected educational district in Isfahan (Iran).
   Methodology
   The present study was of an applied type, which was conducted using the survey research method. The statistical population consisted of adolescent students at public schools in Isfahan (6519 subjects), and the sample size was determined to be 364 based on Cochran's formula. The sampling method was of a cluster sampling type, and the data collection tool was a researcher-made questionnaire. The validity of the questionnaire was approved by medical librarians, and using the Cronbach's alpha method, the reliability was obtained to be 0.85. SPSS 16 software was used for data analysis at two statistical levels: descriptive and inferential (independent t-test, one-sample t-test, chi-square, Pearson correlation coefficient and Mann-Whitney).
   Findings
   "Lack of mobility" was the most important health information need related to adolescent high-risk behaviors. The most important sources to obtain health information related to high-risk behaviors were "the Internet" with a mean score of 3.69 and "virtual social media" with a mean score of 3.49 out of 5. Adolescents had a positive attitude towards health information. The most important barriers to seeking health information were mentioned as follows: "difficulty in determining the quality of information found", "absence of appropriate information", and "concerns about the disclosure of their problems or illness to others". From the perspective of adolescents, the most important criterion for the evaluation of information quality was "the trueness and correctness of the information" and the need for health information related to high-risk behaviors was higher in girls than in boys.
   Conclusions/Significance
   Considering adolescents' positive attitude towards use of health information, it is necessary to put valid information at their disposal through different information resources, taking into account their level of information literacy. Accordingly, medical librarians' abilities are suggested to be used for the production, evaluation, and introduction of health-related reading materials in the field of high-risk behaviors in easy language and suitable for adolescents.

AB  - This study empirically examines how risk-taking and risk management affect open innovation (OI) and innovation performance in terms of new product or service success (NPS) and new product or service innovativeness (NPI) and analyses how OI is related to innovation performance and firm performance, utilising a combination of survey and secondary data. To test the proposed hypotheses, we perform structural equation modelling (SEM) based on a sample of 309 German firms. Our findings show that a higher level of risk-taking, as well as more extensive risk management, is associated with an increased OI intensity. Additionally, we find that supporting a positive attitude towards risk-taking, implementing risk management and engaging in OI increases the innovation performance of a firm. However, we can only detect an indirect relationship between OI and firm performance. Overall, our findings contribute to research on drivers and outcomes of OI and drivers of innovation and firm performance.

AB  - Background. Around 75% of the world's population relies on the use of complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) for their healthcare. Thus, we aimed at assessing the attitude and perception of health professional students about CAM and correlate the results with their demographical data. Methods. An observational cross-sectional study was conducted at King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, by enrolling 350 students. A self-administered questionnaire was used for data collection. Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was performed using SPSS. Results. Results of our data suggested that majority of students were aware of the CAM modalities and considered prayers/spirituality (83.6%), massage (72.5%), nutritional supplements (74.1%), cupping (68.5%), herbal medicine (66.2), and yoga (61.6%) as most effective and least harmful CAM modalities. The students acquired more information about CAM from media (55%), books (56%), friends/relatives (59.7%), and other health professionals (58.4%), however, very little information from formal CAM courses or training (36.7%), which shows the lack of courses and trained health professional in the field of CAM. Despite utilizing nonreliable sources of CAM information, the majority of students had positive attitudes and perceptions about CAM usage. Majority of the students (75.8%) believe in the use of CAM for the mental and spiritual aspect of health and think that CAM providers give good information on maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The data also showed a significant mml:mfenced close=")" open="(" separators="|"P<0.05 association between awareness about CAM and gender. A significantly higher percentage of female students were using yoga and aromatherapy, while cupping was mostly used by male students. Similarly, a significant association was found among the different colleges and level of students in most of the CAM modalities. However, no association was found between the awareness and use of CAM with the educational level of parents or relatives in health sector except for acupuncture and cupping, where student's awareness about acupuncture and cupping was found to have a significant positive association with mother educational level. On the other hand, a significant inverse association was found between acupuncture, yoga, cupping, and aromatherapy with family income. Conclusion. In conclusion, despite the lack of proper courses and professionally trained healthcare providers in the field of CAM, students demonstrated positive attitudes and beliefs toward the safety and effectiveness of CAM.

AB  - Simple Summary The public's perception of a livestock industry can affect the sustainability of the industry. We used a random telephone survey of the Australian public to examine the effects on public attitudes of an Australian media campaign exposing animal cruelty in live export of sheep by sea. We found no apparent differences between those respondents that completed the survey before or after this media campaign in their concern for sheep or beef cattle welfare, their attitudes to red meat farming, acceptability of the red meat industry or their trust in farmers in the red meat industry. However, prior to the media campaign, respondents believed sheep to be more comfortable when transported by boats than those who completed the survey after the media campaign. While the media coverage was widespread, caution is required in the interpretation of these results as the survey questionnaire did not specifically ask if the respondents had seen the media coverage. Nevertheless, the coverage appears to have had little impact on public attitudes, either because the message itself had little impact or because of lack of exposure to the message.
   Abstract Public perception of livestock industries and consumer trust in farmers can affect consumer behaviour and impact on social license to farm. Coincidental with a large random telephone survey of Australian public attitudes and behaviour towards the red meat industry, a media campaign exposing animal cruelty in live export of sheep by sea, occurred. Data collected from the nationwide survey of the public attitudes immediately before (n = 278 respondents) and after (n = 224 respondents) this media campaign was utilised in the present study to examine the effects of the media campaign on the public. In general, respondents' attitudes towards the red meat industry were positive. Independent t-tests revealed no significant differences between those respondents that completed the survey before or after the 60 Minutes programme in their concern for sheep or beef cattle welfare, attitudes to red meat farming, acceptability of the red meat industry or their trust in farmers in the red meat industry. However, prior to the media campaign, respondents believed sheep to be more comfortable when transported by boats than did respondents who completed the survey after the media campaign. More respondents after the 60 Minutes programme cited social and internet media as a source of information. Therefore, despite the wide media coverage associated with the 60 Minutes programme, these results indicate little effect on the public's attitudes towards farm animal welfare and the red meat industry. The significant impacts of the programme were reflected in increased community discussion, increased social media activity and an increase in the perceived importance of conditions aboard boats used for live sheep transport.

AB  - This study explores the effect of priming gendered stereotypes on emotions toward immigrants and attitudes toward refugees among Jewish-Israelis and Germans. It aims to contribute a new theoretical perspective on the importance of gendered stereotypes in media discourses. Drawing on previous research, which suggests a theoretical model for examining the indirect effect of stereotypical gendered stereotypes in predicting emotions and attitudes toward outgroups during political conflicts, this study aims to explore the effect of stereotypical gendered priming on emotions toward immigrants and attitudes toward refugees. It uses three online experiments conducted among Germans and Jewish-Israelis: the first two studies examine the effect of gendered stereotypes on emotions toward immigrants and attitudes toward refugees among Jewish-Israelis; the third replicates this model in Germany in order to explore the effect of gendered stereotypes on attitudes toward refugees there. Such empirical examination can promote a better understanding of the role of exposure to gendered stereotypes in shaping public opinion toward marginalized groups. It may also contribute to attempts to promote constructive political debate and media coverage by specifically addressing the societal constructs-gendered stereotypes-that can potentially advance positive political attitudes and behavior.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to identify critical personality traits affecting and influencing buying behaviour in high involvement consumer durables. It also intends to guide practitioners in selecting appropriate marketing frameworks, consumer segments and processes considering the characteristics of consumer behaviour in developing economies. Design/methodology/approach It systematically reviews the literature on consumer personality traits, its measurement and related consumer buying behaviour. It uses data collected from potential car buyers at various car showrooms across the Indian subcontinent. The authors have worked with the online survey firm Qualtrics, to gather a data set of 328 car purchase intenders' responses to their validated survey. The model was tested using the SmartPLS. Findings The personality traits of imagination, agreeableness and social factors positively influenced attitude towards automobiles with advanced technology. Further, in line with the theory of planned behaviour, it is seen that a positive attitude towards advanced technology and design for automobiles makes a person more willing to pay for the same. Research limitations/implications The study is confined to consumers intending to purchase a car, who are Indian residents. Originality/value It adds to the comparatively lesser body of study on the impact of personality traits on intentions and attitudes in high involvement consumer durable purchases. Further, it serves as an empirical examination of the adoption of new technologies, in the context of high involvement consumer durables. For practicing managers, it provides a reference for deciding future development directions and approaches related to the effective market launch strategies and commercialization of advanced technology automobiles in India.

AB  - Objective
   There are limited studies examining knowledge and attitudes among Chinese oncology nurses regarding cancer pain management.
   Methods
   We conducted a cross-sectional survey among oncology nurses from 26 hospitals in China. The nurses completed the Knowledge and Attitudes Survey Regarding Pain (KASRP) questionnaire. Multivariate models were used to identify factors associated with nurses' KASRP score.
   Results
   A total of 982 nurses completed the KASRP (mean score = 21.56 +/- 4.00), and 8 (0.81%) nurses had a passing score. The results of multivariate regression indicated that clinical rank and experience in cancer pain management were associated with good knowledge and attitudes regarding cancer pain management.
   Conclusion
   The Chinese nurses in our study did not have adequate knowledge of or positive attitudes related to cancer pain management. Clinical rank and experience caring for patients with cancer could be used to help identify nurses with inadequate knowledge and attitudes regarding treating cancer pain.

AB  - Concerning the effectiveness of using wikis for project-based learning in higher education, this study compared the perceptions and actions among students in three undergraduate courses of different disciplines, English Language Studies, Information Management, and Mechanical Engineering, who used wilds in their course assignments. Using a triangulation methodology, the study shows that students mostly hold positive attitudes towards the use of wilds for project-based learning. However, significant differences exist in 5 aspects, such as "Motivation" and "Knowledge Management", in the questionnaire among all participants. Additionally, the level of participation and core actions on the wikis vary among students of the three disciplines. These findings can be explained by the variations in participants' previous learning experiences, their technical backgrounds and the relationship between learning goals and collaborative learning. A series of insights are offered in the context of the use of wilds in project-based learning in higher education. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The radiotherapy (RT) community faces great challenges to meet the growing cancer incidence, especially regarding workload and recruitment of personnel. Workflow-related issues affect involved professions differently since they have specific expertise and various roles in the workflow. To obtain an objective understanding of the current working situation and identify workflow bottle necks in RT, we conducted a national survey on this topic in 2018.
   Materials and Methods: All 17 (photon-based) RT departments in Sweden were invited to participate in the study, which targeted both managers and employees in RT. Descriptive statistics were calculated for each profession and for small, medium and large departments (2/3-4/>= 5 linacs).
   Results: Altogether, 364 filled-in questionnaires were returned (32/332 managers/employees; 94% response rate). Managers reported a general need for more staff (all professions). Small departments reported no problems with waiting times (0/3); whereas 2/3 of medium and large departments did (medium: 5/8, large: 2/3). All professions had a positive attitude towards working in RT (mean = 86%, 0/100% =negative/positive attitude). Organizational issues were ranked highest among reoccurring events that were most frustrating/had most negative effect on the work environment. The most severe workflow related problems were reported to originate at contouring.
   Conclusion: Future efforts to improve the modern RT workflow need to focus on how to make positive mechanisms at small departments useful in larger settings. Our data also reveal that strong leadership and improved routines at contouring are warranted by all RT professions to reduce frustration related to organizational issues and to increase work effectivity.

AB  - Since 2020, people have faced the challenge of constructing new visual modes of online workplace meetings, because we had to use our home for working communications purposes and as a new medium. Mediatisation of home involves redefining semiotic resources and communicational norms concerning the appearance of participants, the background, the use of camera and microphone. The results of the poll demonstrate that this redefining has two aspects: 1) the use of semiotic repertoire to transmit meaningful information about the self and own positions, attitudes, and roles in the communication; and 2) normalisation of own and others' actions during online meetings from home. The results of the survey contribute to awareness of how the issue of private and working/corporate places is being debated. The author claims that technical aspects of online meetings are at the beginning of their ethical reconstruction, which would provide online workplace communications with new traditions and rules of use of camera and microphone as meaningful parts of the semiotic repertoire.

AB  - In our study, we aimed to compare the impact of simulations, sequences of printed simulation frames and conventional static diagrams on the understanding of students with regard to the one-dimensional kinematics. Our student sample consisted of three classes of middle years students (N=63; mostly 15 year-olds). These three classes served as comparison groups in our pre-post quasi-experiment, whereby each of them was assigned to one of the experimental treatments, i.e. media types. The results of the ANCOVA showed that students who learned from simulations or from printed sequences of simulation frames significantly outperformed their peers who had learned one-dimensional kinematics from conventional static diagrams. Thereby, we have found that learning from sequences of simulation frames seems to be particularly effective for girls. The use of simulations or printed simulation frames has also proved to be associated with more positive attitudes of students towards kinematics instruction.

AB  - Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's largest city, supports a vibrant street food culture. Most of the city's street-engaged food traders are poor and unskilled women, and there is scant research about how they build social networks and social capital that sustain their microbusinesses. This article focusses on the intimate socialities that street-engaged food traders develop with customers, shop owners and sister-traders in order to stabilise their incomes while their informal street-trading activities are policed and potentially shut down. Recent COVID-19 lockdown and social-distancing measures disrupted the crucial interpersonal relations of street trading and left the traders with no income. This article explores traders' strategies for achieving economic security, and outlines transformations of intimate socialities into mediated and digital relations after the lockdown.

AB  - Reacting to an increase in gratuitous racist and sexist comments made by readers in response to online articles, media outlets in South Africa have begun closing down their comments sections, an action that has been repeated many times over across the globe. After a particularly abusive tirade against a young women who wrote an article about being black in Cape Town, Independent Media established an advisory panel in 2014 to investigate the nature of user-generated content (UGC) on their news site, Independent Online (IOL). One of the panel's recommendations was that what is meant by uncivil discourse on online news sites be delineated more accurately and narrowly. Employing computer-mediated discourse analysis, we explore the nature of civility and incivility generated by readers of online news. We look at readers' posts in response to race-based topics and uncover the complexities inherent in describing both (in)civility and deliberative discourse precisely. Our sample is drawn from the South African newspaper Mail & Guardian Online, one of the few national media establishments that permitted user comments during our data collection phase.

The learners chatted in Japanese and also in English, each for 30 min per week for 7 weeks. The data that were collected consisted of questionnaires, chat transcripts, learners' weekly reports, and interviews held with the learners after the conclusion of the project. Emotional scaffolding found in the data included expressing positive attitudes toward the chats, complimenting an interlocutor about their FL proficiency, and expressing emotions using emoticons. These types of scaffolding triggered positive emotions in the learners and developed emotional intersubjectivity between the interlocutors, while a lack of emotional scaffolding in the communications led the learners to experience negative emotions.

AB  - Aim/Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine whether the authoring of computer games in a mainstream primary school setting can support the learning of game design and programming concepts.
   Background Despite the benefits for students when they learn how to program and the significant body of research regarding this matter, these benefits are still under debate, and the teaching of programming has a relatively undeveloped pedagogy. With this in mind, a project was designed and implemented, having constructionism as its theoretical framework. Also, Microsoft's Kodu Game Lab was used for the development of students' games.
   Methodology The project lasted for almost a school year (fifty two-hour sessions) and the target group was fifth-grade students (ages 10-11). A total of 138 students participated, coming from five schools in Athens, Greece. Students were divided into three groups. While all groups worked in pairs, to the first there was no teachers' guidance, to the second there was limited teachers' guidance, and to the third, a combination of teacher-led and pair work was used. Each group developed three games of escalating complexity and a total of 207 games were analyzed. Data were collected by analyzing students' games and with a short questionnaire.
   Contribution The study contributes to the debate surrounding the pedagogy of computer game authoring as a tool for teaching programming. That is because few studies have examined the above in mainstream settings, having as a target group primary school students. Furthermore, the present study is in contrast to most studies which involved intensive research projects, since it lasted for almost a school year.
   Findings It was found that the most commonly used programming concept was conditions, followed by variables and loops, while Boolean logic and functions were the least used ones. The most problematic concepts proved to be Boolean logic and loops, closely followed by functions. The least problematic concepts were conditions and variables. Also, the number of programming concepts that were used was increasing in each game, while the errors were decreasing. All in all, students' final games fall into the relational level according to a modified version of the SOLO taxonomy. While the findings indicated that, as well as learning some basic programming concepts, students enjoyed the activity and demonstrated positive attitudes to learning programming by developing games; it was also found that the teaching method did not have any effect on the learning outcomes nor in their views for game authoring.
   Recommendations for Practitioners Extended projects can be considered for teaching programming to primary school students, using visual programming tools that allow the development of games. The classes' teachers can undertake the task to teach programming if they are properly trained. The SOLO taxonomy can be used for assessing students' games.
   Future Research Future studies can examine a variety of game-like programming environments and the target group can be older or younger students. The assessment of students' games is also an interesting topic. Finally, research can be conducted by using other devices and compare the results.

AB  - Using online discussion forums and peer-to peer interactive learning currently becomes a common instructional proposition. Such social discourse is educationally adopted to enhance learning and through ideas interchanged in an online setting. The aim of this study was to investigate the use of LINE as an instructional tool complementing language practice to express opinions in an EFL course. In order to examine factors related to student learning performance in the online discussion activity, data were collected from learning score, quantity of interaction, as well as attitude from 83 students. Frequency, mean, and correlation coefficients were employed to analyze. The findings revealed students' positive attitude toward the online activity, with the highest mean score indicating an enjoyable learning environment. The students' learning outcome showed positive correlation with frequency of their interaction; however, it was disassociated with their attitude toward the assigned online task. Furthermore, students' engagement in the learning disclosed no relation with their attitude toward the online educational experience. The finding of the study can be beneficial for online activity course designs in the future. Apparently, student participation is considered a vital variable; thus, motivation strategies are to be carefully planned to facilitate effective online learning.

AB  - Generation Z grew up in a media-friendly environment, and this study aimed to examine how YouTube influences their perception of appearance. The research followed the methodological procedures of Giorgi's phenomenology and conducted in-depth interviews of 15 Korean women who were born between 1995 and 2005 and enjoyed watching fashion-related YouTube content. The results showed that Generation Z was greatly influenced by fashion YouTubers and the visual stimuli they provided. They had a positive attitude towards YouTubers, actively participated in online non-face-to-face communication and tried to look like them. Their watching of YouTube fashion content had a variety of influences with regard to their perception of looks and appearance management. Repeated exposure to YouTubers' slim bodies and appearance-related content led viewers to accept this body type as the ideal. Moreover, appearance-related information provided by YouTubers was being used as indexes of their lifestyles and consumption habits. Though YouTubers' influence was both positive and negative, Generation Z's pursuit of their own personalities made YouTube an independent fashion medium that was not affected by space or time.

AB  - A clear understanding of sexual consent is important for sexual violence prevention. To date, most research has focused on how college students understand and negotiate consent. Although adolescence is a critical period for the development of sexual attitudes, identity, and intimate relationships, the perspectives of high school-aged youth have been largely absent from the consent literature. The current study investigated adolescents' attitudes toward affirmative consent in a sample of 226 high school students (58% female; 46% White, 24% Black, 25% Hispanic) from the southeastern U.S., as well as associations between affirmative consent attitudes and gender, gender role beliefs, and sexual activity status. Additionally, we tested whether gender role beliefs were a mediator between gender and affirmative consent attitudes. Overall, adolescents reported supportive attitudes toward affirmative consent. On average, girls and adolescents with more egalitarian gender role beliefs had more positive attitudes toward affirmative consent than boys and those with less egalitarian gender role beliefs, though no differences by sexual activity status were found. Gender role beliefs mediated the relationship between gender and attitudes toward affirmative consent. The results suggest that adolescents are generally supportive of affirmative consent practices, although some important group differences emerged.

AB  - Background: The visualization of the lower cervical spine (C-spine), including the C7-T1 junction on lateral radiograph is a challenge due to the overlapping of the shoulder girdle. Therefore, the radiographers have adapted different positioning strategies to overcome this challenge. This study explores the current practice and perception of radiographers on positioning techniques of erect lateral cervical spine radiography in non-trauma adult patients.
   Methods: This prospective study was conducted with a self-administered, structured questionnaire distributed among 50 radiographers working in four selected hospitals in Sri Lanka.
   Results: The radiographers used weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing positioning techniques for the erect lateral C-spine radiography. Most of them employed the standing breath-holding technique for image acquisition with or without exertion. While 54% of the radiographers utilized two water-filled cans during the weight-bearing technique, 82% used holding arms back with the shoulders down and pulling as low as possible in the non-weight-bearing technique. In addition, 88% of the radiographers believed that the weight-bearing position could increase the visibility of the C-spine. Almost all the radiographers (100%) stated that correct positioning instruction could improve the visibility of the C-spine.
   Conclusion: Radiographers have mainly used two positioning techniques of weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing for erect lateral C-spine radiography for non-trauma adult patients. In addition, most radiographers had a positive attitude toward the weight-bearing technique in the evaluation of lateral C-spine. These results highlight the importance of conducting studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the weight-bearing technique in erect lateral C-spine radiography.

AB  - How are perfectionist employees seen by their colleagues, and to what extent do they experience integration or social disconnection at work? Combining two different quantitative approaches, we investigated the relationship between multidimensional perfectionism and indicators of social disconnection in two samples of employees from Germany. Study 1 (N = 184) measured the participants' perfectionism and presented four vignettes describing a self-oriented, other-oriented, socially prescribed, and non-perfectionist colleague. Participants rated the social skills and work competence of the described colleagues, and indicated their own willingness to work with them (interpersonal attraction). Study 2 (N = 279) measured the participants' perfectionism and the social support, social exclusion, and intergroup conflicts they experienced in their working teams. All perfectionists, especially the other-oriented perfectionist, received significantly lower ratings on social skills and attraction than the non-perfectionist colleague. However, the self-oriented and other-oriented perfectionist received the highest competence ratings. Ratings differed depending on the participants' own perfectionism. In Study 2, socially prescribed perfectionism was positively related to all indicators of social disconnection, whereas other-oriented perfectionism was related to conflicts only. Self-oriented perfectionism was unrelated to indicators of social disconnection. The results emphasize the importance of considering perfectionism in the context of teamwork and team climate.

AB  - The current study examined the impact of exposure to dangerous driving behaviors via media on the perception of driving risk and driving behaviors by assessing 1356 male and female college students between the ages of 17 and 25. It was hypothesized that (a) increased media exposure to dangerous driving behaviors would be related to positive attitudes regarding risky driving behaviors as well as engaging in such behaviors and (b) media exposures would be related to participant attitudes, which, in turn, would be related to participants driving behaviors. Results of hierarchical regression analyses confirmed that media exposure to dangerous driving behaviors impact attitudes regarding driving and driving behaviors, while controlling for participant age and biological sex, with movie exposure playing a greater role than exposure via video games. A Test of Joint Significance confirmed that media exposure to dangerous driving behaviors influence participants attitudes regarding driving, which, in turn, impact reported driving behaviors. Theoretical explanations are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Drawing on bottom-up spillover theory, this study investigates the effect of cultural involvement on residents' attitudes toward tourism development. The study further examines the underlying mechanism of this impact through spiritual wellbeing and place attachment. Data were collected via an on-site survey from local residents in two famous ancient water villages in China: Xitang and Wuzhen. Results reveal that the relationship between cultural involvement and attitudes toward tourism development were fully mediated by serial mediation through spiritual wellbeing and place attachment. This study extends understanding of the mechanism behind residents' attitude formation toward tourism development. Managerially, it offers guidance to boost residents' positive attitudes from the angle of cultural involvement.

AB  - Information systems (IS) researchers persistently examine how information and communications technology (ICT) changes attitudes and behaviors but rarely leverage the persuasion literature when doing so possibly due to this literature's well-documented complexity. Accordingly, in this study, we help researchers understand and apply persuasion theory in IS research. To do so, we develop a common frame of reference to help IS researchers to conceptualize persuasion and conceptually differentiate it from related concepts. In doing so, we also comprehensively summarize existing research and theory and provide suggestions to guide future IS research into persuasion and behavior change.

AB  - This study investigates the interactive effect of job demands and resources in influencing the development of a frontline employee's customer-oriented attitude (COA) and deep versus surface acting behaviors. Results demonstrate that job resources, such as perceived organizational support and perceived customer participation, can positively influence an employee's COA, which subsequently promotes deep over surface acting behaviors. Such positive relationships, however, are significantly and adversely affected by a job demand, perceived crowding, and a job stressor, perceived job insecurity. Specifically, contextual demands weaken the positive influence of job resources upon the development of a COA, also weakening the positive influence of a COA upon deep acting while promoting the occurrence of surface acting. From a managerial perspective, such findings highlight the importance of understanding the potentially negative influence of a stressful, demanding work environment, even upon employees who possess a very positive attitude toward helping customers.

AB  - Dehumanizing language, or language used to describe human beings as non-human entities, is increasingly prevalent in political life. This dehumanization also occurs frequently in the world of sports. Sports and politics intersected notably in 2016, when Colin Kaepernick of the NFL's San Francisco 49ers started protesting the national anthem to raise awareness about police violence against African-Americans. Kaepernick's protests generated considerable vitriol towards him and other protesters, some of which was dehumanizing. In this study, I examine how dehumanizing language used against anthem protesters of different races influences political attitudes. Using experimental data, I find that, when a Black player protesting the national anthem is dehumanized, White citizens are considerably less supportive of the anthem protests and protesters. This effect does not persist when the dehumanized player is White.

AB  - In recent years, there have been concerns in the UK regarding the uptake of particular subjects in post-compulsory education. Whilst entries for Advanced level (A-level) subjects such as media studies have experienced considerable growth, entries for A-level physics have, until recently, been declining, prompting fears of a skills crisis in future generations. This study applied an established psychological theory, the theory of planned behaviour, to explore the drivers behind students' subject choice at A-level, specifically focusing on students' intentions to study physics and media studies. Multiple regression analyses supported the predictive validity of the theory in this context, with the three predictor variables (attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control) accounting for 66% of the variance in students' intentions to study physics and 68% of the variance in students' intentions to study media studies. Furthermore, for both subjects, attitude and subjective norm were found to be significant predictors of intentions. Hence, students with higher intentions to study physics or media studies exhibited a more positive attitude towards choosing this subject and perceived greater social pressure from significant others. Analysis of the beliefs underlying students' subject choices suggested that the influence of parents was particularly important to students, as were beliefs about the positive outcomes of choosing physics or media studies in terms of student's future career and education prospects. This suggests that initiatives aimed at increasing the uptake of subjects such as physics in the future might be best targeted in these areas.

AB  - The expanding HIV risk reduction toolkit increases options for men who have sex men (MSM), but increasing options in combination with different preferences may complicate promoting risk reduction. To investigate what strategies MSM prefer, data of 3310 participants in the online survey "Men & Sexuality" (Median age = 37 years, 320 (9.7%) HIV positive) was analysed. Questions assessed attitudes towards HIV risk reduction strategies. Participants had the most positive attitudes regarding PrEP and HIV testing, while withdrawal and strategic positioning were least preferred (all p's < .001). Condoms were seen as acceptable to partners and effective but scored low on sexual pleasure. HIV-positive participants were more negative about condoms and more positive about viral load sorting than HIV-negative participants (F-(12,F-3297) = 5.09, p < .001, = .02). Findings highlight a preference for HIV risk reduction strategies (PrEP and HIV testing) that do not diminish sexual pleasure and can be applied independent of sexual partners. A serological divide was apparent: HIV-negative MSM were less negative about condoms than HIV-positive MSM, suggesting that condom promotion remains a viable strategy for HIV-negative MSM. Taken together, results indicate a need for personalized approaches to the promotion of HIV risk reduction strategies, accounting for individual preferences and strategy effectiveness.

AB  - Background: The health sector is faced with constant changes as new approaches to tackle illnesses are unveiled through research. Information, communication and technology have greatly transformed healthcare practice the world over. Nursing is continually exposed to a variety of changes. Variables including age, educational level, years worked in nursing, computer knowledge and experience have been found to influence the attitudes of nurses towards computerisation. The purpose of the study was to determine the attitudes of nurses towards the use of computers and the factors that influence these attitudes.
   Methods: This cross sectional descriptive study was conducted among staff nurses working at one public hospital (Kenyatta National Hospital, (KNH) and one private hospital (Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH). A convenience sample of 200 nurses filled the questionnaires. Data was collected using the modified Nurses' Attitudes Towards Computerisation (NATC) questionnaire.
   Results: Nurses had a favorable attitude towards computerisation. Non-users had a significantly higher attitude score compared to the users (p = 0.0274). Statistically significant associations were observed with age (p = 0.039), level of education (p = 0.025), duration of exposure to computers (p = 0.025) and attitudes towards computerisation.
   Conclusion: Generally, nurses have positive attitudes towards computerisation. This information is important for the planning and implementation of computerisation in the hospital as suggested in other studies.

One hundred and twenty-eight participants (M = 22 and F = 106), aged 18-30 years, completed an online questionnaire about their adult attachment styles and sexting behavior and attitudes. Attachment anxiety predicted sending texts that solicit sexual activity for those individuals in relationships. Attachment anxiety also predicted positive attitudes towards sexting such as accepting it as normal, that it will enhance the relationship, and that partners will expect sexting. Sexting may be a novel form for expressing attachment anxiety. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As the theoretical rationale (and funding opportunities!) for considering Eastern Europe as a distinct region diminish as we move farther away from the momentous events of 1989, the value of including East-Central European countries in comparative studies has only increased. This article outlines how comparative studies of political behavior involving East-Central European countries have evolved in the author's own research from comparative studies including Russia along with four East European countries, to more broadly based comparative studies including multiple East European countries and former Soviet Republics, to studies where behavior is analyzed in both East European countries and more established democracies, and finally to large cross-national studies focused on questions related to post-communist politics (namely, the legacy of communism on post-communist attitudes and behavior) but relying on the comparative analysis of survey data from countries around the world. In a way, the research has come full circle, from studies of East European political behavior to better understand East European political behavior, to studies including East European countries to better understand general questions of political behavior not specific to post-communist countries, to now the most extensive comparative studies that are, however, designed once again to better understand East European political attitudes and behavior.

AB  - Informed by uncertainty-identity theory, this study tested the polarizing effect of partisan-led politicization of science and ways to combat it. Using a national sample of South Koreans (N = 840), our online experiment found that when partisan elites, as opposed to scientists (or civic activists), spearheaded politicization, attitude polarization emerged via partisan motivated reasoning. Such polarizing effects of party cues did not persist when subjective certainty and self-affirmation enhanced the level of certainty partisans felt about their surroundings and themselves. These patterns proved consistent across multiple scientific issues, including climate change, genetically modified foods, and algae blooms. The implications of the findings are discussed in light of how to attenuate the polarizing effect of partisan-led politicization through the lens of social identity approaches. Given that this study provides one of the first pieces of evidence on the topic outside the Western context, the advantages of using a South Korean sample are noted.

AB  - In the context of the recent migration crisis affecting Europe, and the impact it has had in its public and political landscapes, there is an urgent need to nurture and manage the value of intercultural societies. The quality of intercultural interaction, particularly in the context of public spaces, have a fundamental influence in shaping social and political attitudes about the coexistence of different cultural groups. This paper argues for the role that intercultural place-making has in articulating a meaningful and sustainable inclusion and participation of multiple cultural identities in shaping our urban and public realms, mediating and negotiating an intercultural cohabitation and exchange that could generate social capital and cohesion. The paper proposes a multi-scalar approach to the planning and implementation of intercultural place-making processes, in a way that these may better articulate the intercultural exchange with complex urban and social settings and networks, so to enhance their insertion and role in the construction of cohesive intercultural cities.

AB  - Phubbing-ignoring another person in order to use a smartphone instead-is an increasingly common behavior that disrupts interactions and harms relationships. Using the frameworks of the theory of planned behavior and an interaction value approach, we examined the driving factors of phubbing frequency. Four preregistered predictors were tested: attitudes toward phubbing, subjective norms of phubbing, interaction value, that is, the extent of valuing a social interaction, and the perceived interaction value of the partner. After having had lunch together, a total of 128 participants in 64 dyads filled out a survey assessing the four predictors. Dyadic linear mixed model analyses confirmed that a more positive attitude toward phubbing increases phubbing, as well as being phubbed. Moreover, we disentangled screen-sharing time (i.e., using a phone together), phone use, co-present phone use (i.e., using a phone alone), and phubbing: we found that valuing the social interaction more decreased phone use, but not phubbing, and holding more accepting subjective norms on phubbing increased co-present phone use, but not phone use in general. We further found that the person that used their phone first, phubbed more. Overall, this research extends our understanding of the factors driving phubbing and may be fruitfully harnessed to reduce phubbing.

AB  - Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness associated with a heavy symptom burden and high relapse rates. Digital interventions are increasingly suggested as means to facilitate continuity of care, relapse prevention, and long-term disease management for schizophrenia spectrum disorders. In order to investigate the feasibility of a mobile and internet-based aftercare program, a 2-arm randomized controlled pilot study was conducted. The program could be used by patients for six months after inpatient treatment and included psychoeducation, an individual crisis plan, optional counseling via internet chat or phone and a supportive monitoring module. Due to the slow pace of enrollment, recruitment was stopped before the planned sample size was achieved. Reasons for the high exclusion rate during recruitment were analyzed as well as attitudes, satisfaction, and utilization of the program by study participants. The data of 25 randomized patients suggest overall positive attitudes towards the program, high user satisfaction and good adherence to the monitoring module. Overall, the results indicate that the digital program might be suitable to provide support following discharge from intensive care. In addition, the study provides insights into specific barriers to recruitment which may inform future research in the field of digital interventions for severe mental illness.

AB  - The study was conducted in Macau, a sociolinguistically diverse context with sixty-two first-year and second-year university students. Semi-structured interview was used as an instrument for data collection for this exploratory study. The students were asked questions regarding their willingness to communicate (WTC) using different varieties of English in face-to-face communication and communication in the social media contexts. The results indicate that the participants are aware of the status of English as an international language and can identify the different English varieties in Kachru's (1986) concentric circles. The participants have reported a high willingness to communicate in two standard English varieties; that is, American English and British English for face-to-face communication and social media contexts. The study has also revealed an emergence of the Chinese variety of English in that the participants hold a positive attitude towards Chinese English and are willing to use it in monolingual classrooms and in the case of out-of-class events in which the speakers share the first language and culture that Chinese English is used.

AB  - University life has changed profoundly due to social distancing measures to control the spread of COVID-19. Over the longer term, the coronavirus crisis may affect the mental health of undergraduate students who are required to cope with remote options and forgo the usual campus life. The aim of this study is thus to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on undergraduate students' mental health and daily life in order to assist policymakers improve pandemic control plans and help educators and healthcare experts provide support to affected undergraduates. Results are based on quantitative data collected via online questionnaires which were completed by 181 Greek undergraduate forestry students. The analysis indicated that the students were highly affected by the closure of universities and the transition to distance learning. Moreover, they experienced negative emotions, mostly concern and anger, during the lockdown. T-test showed that female respondents experienced strong negative emotions like fear, panic and despair to a higher degree than male students who were more optimistic about the pandemic. Surprisingly, the students did not exercise outdoors every day even though it was allowed during the 42-day quarantine. In addition, they used mostly television and scientific articles to obtain information about COVID-19. The results presented in this study offer insights into university students' experience with the pandemic and reveal their reaction to remote education. It is recommended to monitor university students' mental health frequently and to provide them with psychological counselling and practical advice on how to manage anxiety and fear. Finally, education and training on remote learning could help reduce students' anxiety over online classes and exams.

AB  - The authors' aim is to analyze the degree of openness to different religious convictions among students of Department of Music, Faculty of Arts in Nis, and also to test whether these students have an active attitude on overcoming religious prejudice. The research was initiated due to the fact that during their education, through various teaching activities (playing, singing, conducting, composition, listening to music and its analysis) students become familiar with religious, spiritual, and church music, as a constituent part of different religions. The assumption is that precisely through music as one of the most universal media of artistic communication students can establish and develop a positive attitude to religious differences. Research results show that students are aware of various religious convictions and affiliations, but they do not show enough sensitivity to respecting differences, and they do not take part in the struggle against prejudices that accompany those differences.

We then tested this concept using an experiment (N = 798) on a mock Facebook page of a news site. Results showed that if journalists employedengagement moderationand used what are called high-person-centered responses to incivility-messages that acknowledge the emotional pain or upset people may feel-it produced more positive attitudes toward the news outlet's Facebook page, online community, and handling of incivility. Our findings provide guidance to news outlets regarding what type of messages are most beneficial if community managers or journalists enactengagement moderationby responding to uncivil commenters.

AB  - Objective:
   To identify school community readiness to adopt a school-based adolescent nutrition intervention.
   Design:
   Cross-sectional study: mixed-methods design. The community readiness model was used to guide instrument development and qualitative analysis. Quantitative data are presented using descriptive statistics. Each statement was rated on a seven-point Likert scale, thereby producing scores between 1 (strongly disagree) and 7 (strongly agree).
   Setting:
   Ten of the twenty current public secondary schools in Bogor, Indonesia.
   Participants:
   Ninety teachers and ten school principals.
   Results:
   Eating behaviour problem awareness was present among all participants; awareness of efforts to improve eating habits was also present, but these efforts were perceived as having low efficacy; support from the City Education Authority and Health Authority was present, but the support type did not match the perceived needs; nutrition education had not been implemented across the entire school community due to competing priorities; existing nutrition policies did not provide concrete scenarios and clear guidelines for nutrition-friendly schools; the availability and accessibility of healthy foods at schools were considered to be key factors in improved adolescent nutrition; positive attitudes existed among respondents towards the implementation of various nutrition programmes, and the median and mode were seven in all types of school-based intervention.
   Conclusions:
   The school community readiness level regarding school-based adolescent nutrition interventions is currently in the action phase, implying that community leaders have begun organising efforts to address issues in adolescent nutrition and are aware of their consequences. Future support should be directed towards improving existing efforts and offering concrete ideas and clear policy guidelines for implementation.

AB  - Study aim: The main aim of the study was to identify the knowledge and attitudes of nurses towards pressure ulcer prevention in a major public hospital in Cyprus.
   Material and methods: A descriptive and cross-sectional study design was used to collect the data between December 2014 and February 2015, the sample consisted of n = 102 nurses employed in a major public hospital in Cyprus. Customised and standardised Pressure Ulcer Knowledge Test and an attitudes Likert questionnaire was used to investigate both parameters. Descriptive and inferential statistics, parametric (t-test), non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U) and Pearson test was applied. Statistical significance was set at p = 0.05.
   Results: The majority of the participants (44.1%) n = 45 were employed in the intensive care unit, were female (61.8%) n = 63, registered nurses (93.1%) n = 95, had more than 5 years of experience (59.4%) n = 32 and 10.8% (n = 11) had a postgraduate title. The mean value regarding the knowledge questionnaire was 16.16, IQR: 17(15-18) correct answers 77%. In the attitudes questionnaire the median value was 41.82, IQR: 43 (40-46). Knowledge and attitudes correlated positively and statistically significantly (Pearson's R = 0,223, p = 0,019).
   Conclusion: The result suggests that nurses had relatively inadequate knowledge levels and positive attitudes, attitudes and knowledges correlated statistically significantly and positively. It is proposed that through the development of educational programs and the frequent measurement of the two parameters further improvement can be achieved.

AB  - Background:The illicit use of prescription stimulants (IUPS) has emerged as a high-risk behavior of the 21st century college student. As the study of IUPS is relatively new, we aimed to understand (1) characteristics of IUPS (i.e., initiation, administration routes, drug sources, motives, experiences), and (2) theory-guided intrapersonal, interpersonal, and environmental correlates associated with use.
   Methods: Using one-stage cluster sampling, 520 students (96.3% response rate) at one Pacific Northwest University completed a paper-based, in-classroom survey on IUPS behaviors and expected correlates. Aim 1 was addressed using descriptive statistics and aim 2 was addressed via three nested logistic regression analyses guided by the Theory of Triadic Influence.
   Results: The prevalence of ever engaging in IUPS during college was 25.6%. The majority (>50.0%) of users reported initiation during college, oral use, friends as the drug source, academic motives, and experiencing desired outcomes. Intrapersonal correlates associated with use included identifying as White, lower grade point average, diagnoses of attention deficit disorder, and lower avoidance self-efficacy. Interpersonal correlates of use included off-campus residence, varsity sports participation, IUPS perceptions by socializing agents, and greater behavioral norms. Exposure to prescription drug print media, greater prescription stimulant knowledge, and positive attitudes towards prescription stimulants were environmental correlates associated with use. In all models, IUPS intentions were strongly associated with use.
   Conclusions: IUPS was prevalent on the campus under investigation and factors from the intrapersonal, interpersonal and environmental domains were associated with the behavior. Implications for prevention and future research are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In recent years, the co-occurrence of the migration crisis and terrorist attacks in European cities have created a strong link between refugees and asylum seekers and terrorism in the minds of many Europeans. This study investigates how attitudes toward refugees are associated with fear of terrorism. Using multilevel modelling on 1,500 Belgian citizens nested in 402 municipalities, results indicate that positive attitudes toward refugees are associated with lower terrorism fear. Adverse economic conditions at both the individual and municipal level are associated with greater fear of terrorism, while a large outgroup size is associated with lower fear of terrorism. Women hold greater fear than men, while commercial news consumption is associated with greater terrorism fears.

AB  - Education and intergroup contact are two of the most influential channels for reducing host society members' hostility toward immigrants, but recent studies suggest that these two channels are only able to shift their impressions. Yet, a shift in impression does not necessarily translate into endorsement of integration policies, resulting in a "principle-policy paradox" in multiracial societies. Little is known about whether this paradox holds in circumstances where racial boundaries are less salient and rigid. In this study, we examine whether such a paradox exists in urban China, where racial/ethnic hostility is negligible but the Hukou system has created institutional segregation between local residents and migrants. Using data collected from twelve middle-size cities and one metropolis, we examine urban residents' attitudes toward rural migrants from multiple domains. We find that education is positively associated with locals' positive judgments about rural migrants, with concern about social justice playing a mediating role. However, there is a lack of association between education and the endorsement of integration policy or social distance. Compared with education, social contact, in particular kinship contact, is associated with support in more substantive domains, ranging from integration policies to a closer social distance. Nevertheless, social contact does not lead to the support for the most pivotal policy change of granting Hukou. The findings indicate that both education and social contact are limited in engendering the extension of benefits to migrants across contexts, but intergroup contact is more capable of doing so in a society with a more fluid group boundary.

AB  - The traditional meetings, incentives, conferences, and exhibitions (MICE) industry has been hit hard by social distancing regulations introduced to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, with concerns about pandemic risks and personal hygiene increasing the demand for online MICE technology. With the introduction of innovative new technologies to the MICE industry, it is important to study the psychology of online MICE attendees, particularly the factors affecting their behavioral intention to adopt online MICE technology during the pandemic. This study investigates the attitudes toward attending online MICE since the start of the epidemic based on the health belief model (HBM) and innovation diffusion theory (IDT). A total of 439 valid questionnaires were collected in China and used for structural equation modeling. The results show that the perceived safety threat, the comparative advantage, trialability, and outcome expectations positively impact the attendees' attitudes. Moreover, this study finds that attitude completely mediates the impact of perceived safety threat, comparative advantages, trialability, and outcome expectation on behavioral intention to attend online MICE events. These findings theoretically enrich the understanding of online MICE technology, the HBM, and the IDT and offer managerial implications for MICE organizers and exhibitors.

AB  - Increasing diversity and the anticipation of its resulting cultural change is raising vociferous protestations among White Americans. Here, we explore moderation and mediation of its intergroup implications. Among a nationally representative sample of White Americans, Study 1 (n = 2,257) revealed that living in a region that experienced a greater (vs. lesser) increase in racial diversity in recent years was associated with more anti-immigrant attitudes, but only among those who were highly White-identified. In an experiment, Study 2 (n = 420, White Americans) revealed that collective nostalgia (i.e., longing for the ingroup's past) mediated the relation between anticipated cultural change resulting from shifting demographics and anti-immigrant attitudes, but only for those who were highly White-identified. Thus, anti-immigrant sentiment among White Americans in response to changing demographics and culture is seen primarily among those personally invested in their White racial identity, an effect partly explained by a longing for bygone days.

AB  - Genocide and mass violence originate in difficult life conditions, conflict between groups, and cultural characteristics such as a history of devaluation of a group, victimization, and overly strong respect for authority. These can join in creating uncertainty and fear, frustrating the fulfillment of basic psychological needs, and shaping destructive psychological reactions and social processes such as scapegoating and destructive ideologies. The evolution of increasing hostility and violence can follow, allowed by the passivity of internal and external bystanders. Halting genocide and mass violence is very difficult. It is more effective to focus on early prevention: responding to difficult life conditions, developing positive attitudes and constructive ideologies that humanize the other; dialogue; healing wounds and memories of past victimization; training about the roots, psychological impact, and prevention of violence in workshops and the media; and supporting development practices and democratization. Early prevention requires leadership in the United Nations, the work of NGOs, cooperating national governments, and citizen groups of active bystanders.

AB  - Two experiments tested whether nostalgia is a resource for fighting ageism. In Experiment 1, younger adults who recalled a nostalgic (vs. ordinary) encounter with an older adult showed a more positive attitude towards older adults, mediated by greater inclusion of older adults in the self (IOGS). In Experiment 2, these findings were replicated and extended with a subtle nostalgia manipulation. Younger adults identified an older, familiar adult, before writing about an encounter with this person that was characterized by either central (e.g., keepsakes and childhood) or peripheral (e.g., wishing and daydreaming) features of the construct of nostalgia (i.e., prototype). Participants who recalled a central (vs. peripheral) nostalgic encounter reported greater social connectedness, which predicted increased IOGS. In turn, increased IOGS was associated with a lower desire to avoid older adults. Several alternative explanations for the intergroup benefits of nostalgia were ruled out. The research established that nostalgia qualifies as a resource for combatting ageism.

AB  - The effects of written feedback in a computer-based assessment for learning on students' learning outcomes were investigated in an experiment at a Higher Education institute in the Netherlands. Students were randomly assigned to three groups, and were subjected to an assessment for learning with different kinds of feedback. These are immediate knowledge of correct response (KCR) + elaborated feedback (EF), delayed KCR + EF, and delayed knowledge of results (KR). A summative assessment was used as a post-test. No significant effect was found for the feedback condition on student achievement on the post-test. Results suggest that students paid more attention to immediate than to delayed feedback. Furthermore, the time spent reading feedback was positively influenced by students' attitude and motivation. Students perceived immediate KCR + EF feedback to be more useful for learning than KR. Students also had a more positive attitude towards feedback in a CBA when they received KCR + EF rather than KR only. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - As in other areas of healthcare, the quality of patient care in the field of sport science and sports medicine (SSSM) could benefit from interprofessional collaboration between the professions involved. As a prerequisite, healthcare providers in the SSSM field should be equipped with positive attitudes and perceptions toward interprofessional collaboration (IPC) and interprofessional education (IPE), however detailed investigations are lacking. This study aimed to collect and compare socio-demographic data as well as interprofessional attitudes of SSSM professionals from an international perspective. Subjects were invited via professional SSSM organizations, personal networks and social media to participate in a cross-sectional online survey. Three-hundred and twenty complete datasets of SSSM professionals from the regions USA (n = 83), Canada (n = 179) and Europe (n = 58) were evaluated. In this survey, socio-demographic data as well as attitudes toward IPC and IPE using the 4 subscales of the University of West of England interprofessional Questionnaire (UWE-IP) were collected and analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics. In the socio-demographic data, there was a diversity of participants representing different regional healthcare, sports and educational framing conditions. On average, in all regions clear positive attitudes were shown in the UWE-IP subscales communication & teamwork, interprofessional learning and interprofessional relationship, whereas in the subscale interprofessional interaction negative perceptions were observed on average across all regions. Significant effects of participants' demographic variables region, age and gender on some of the subscales were detected. Practitioners in the SSSM field have a high willingness and a beneficial preparedness for IPC and IPE, however, the framing conditions and the systems the respondents surveyed are working in do not support IPC. Interprofessional settings in learning and in workplace (e.g., theme-centred workshops, patient-centred case studies, health promotion activities) may help to improve interprofessional interactions in SSSM.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to assess implementation adherence (how well the patient's actual intake matches the prescribed dosing regimen) to non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC s) and to explore experiences with and beliefs about NOAC s in a real-world sample of long-term NOAC users.
   Methods A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in home-dwelling adults who started taking a NOAC at least 1 year prior to inclusion. Pharmacy dispensing data were used to calculate the Medication Possession Ratio (MPR). Patients were recruited in 158 community pharmacies in Flanders, Belgium. They completed a questionnaire collecting basic characteristics and exploring self-reported adherence to NOAC s (using the Medication Adherence Report Scale, MARS) and experiences with and beliefs about NOAC s (using the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire, BMQ).
   Results A total of 766 patients (mean age 76.2 +/- 8.8 years, median CHA 2DS 2-VASc score 4 (IQR=3-4)) were included. The majority (93.5%) used NOAC for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. The median MPR was 95.2% (IQR=87.8-99.7) which corresponds with half of the study population not taking their NOAC on at least 17 cumulative days per year. Almost 21% of participants reported non-adherence on the MARS (score <25), with unintentional non-adherence (forgetfulness) most frequently reported (15.4%). Although two-thirds of NOAC users indicated to experience adverse drug reactions, the BMQ demonstrated a positive attitude towards NOAC therapy, where necessity beliefs outweigh the concerns.
   Conclusions Our data indicate that long-term NOAC users have high implementation adherence and a positive attitude towards NOAC therapy. However, taking into account patients' thromboembolic risk and NOACs' short half-lives, further optimisation of NOAC use seems warranted in this population.

AB  - Background: There are more than 258 million international migrants worldwide and the majority reside in countries with ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic outbreaks. International migrants may not receive adequate and timely disease information during epidemics, increasing vulnerability to disease transmission. This is one of very limited studies focusing on international migrants' COVID-19 prevention knowledge and attitudes during the epidemic.
   Methods: A national cross-sectional online survey was conducted across 100 cities and 26 regions in China from February 17 and March 1, 2020. The sample included 1,426 international migrants representing 77 countries and 6 continents. Knowledge was defined as the number of correct responses to questions about COVID-19. Attitudes included worries, expectations, and general preparedness. Multivariable ordinal logistic regressions evaluated correlates of knowledge and attitudes including information channels and preferences, and trust in Chinese institutions and groups.
   Results: Just half of the sample, 730/1426 (51.2%) had a good level of knowledge and 656/1426 (46.0%) had a positive attitude towards the COVID-19 epidemic. Knowledge was associated with receiving information through social media (aOR: 2.0, 95%CI: 1.2-3.2), the Internet (aOR: 1.4, 95%CI: 1.2-1.8), the community (aOR: 1.5, 95%CI: 1.2-1.8), and encountering language barriers when receiving medical services (aOR: 0.8, 95%CI: 0.7-1.0). Positive attitude was associated with the level of trust in various Chinese institutions and groups.
   Conclusions: Roughly half of the sample reported inadequate knowledge and poor attitudes toward prevention and control of COVID-19. Tailored public health campaigns are needed to ensure that international migrants possess adequate knowledge to protect their health during future epidemics and disasters.

AB  - The effects of the restriction policies on human mobility and on the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission were reported. The efficiency of human mobility restriction due to the social distancing measures of cities on preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread remains unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate the mediating effects of air pollution on the association between human mobility and daily confirmed COVID-19 cases. Daily mobility data (i.e., walking, driving, and using public transport), air pollutants, and confirmed COVID-19 cases were collected in Taiwan during 1 to 30 May 2021. Associations of air pollution with 7-day-lag confirmed COVID-19 cases and with mobility were examined by linear regression models, while the mediating effects were assessed using a PROCESS analysis. We observed that an increase in air pollution was associated with an increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases (p < 0.05). We found that 1 min spent on mobility was associated with changes in air pollution levels (p < 0.05). We observed that levels of particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of < 10 mu m (PM10), PM2.5, NO2, and CO mediated associations of walking, driving, and using public transport with confirmed COVID-19 cases (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that the nationwide restrictions (social distancing measures) may reduce human mobility and activities, which was associated with a decrease in confirmed COVID-19 cases due to the mediating effects of air pollution. Reductions in human mobility and air pollution could be effective measures for controlling COVID-19 transmission.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to test the effects of two types of celebrities (Instagram celebrity vs traditional celebrity) on source trustworthiness, brand attitude, envy and social presence. The proposed theoretical model consists of the celebrity type as the independent variable, social presence as the mediator and self-discrepancy as the moderator. Design/methodology/approach A randomized two-group comparison (Instagram celebrity vs traditional celebrity) between-subjects experiment (n=104) was conducted. Findings The results indicate that consumers exposed to Instagram celebrity's brand posts perceive the source to be more trustworthy, show more positive attitude toward the endorsed brand, feel stronger social presence and feel more envious of the source than those consumers exposed to traditional celebrity's brand posts. Structural equation modeling (Mplus 8.0) and bootstrap confidence intervals indicate that social presence mediates the causal effects of celebrity type on trustworthiness, brand attitude and envy. Multiple regression analyses reveal the moderating effects of appearance-related actual-ideal self-discrepancy. Practical implications - Ultimately, managerial implications for social media marketing and Instagram influencer-based branding are provided. From the perspective of marketing planning, the findings speak to the power of influencer marketing as an effective branding strategy. Originality/value The paper discusses theoretical implications for the marketing literature on celebrity endorsements.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to determine the influence of an instructional strategy for the use of DOKEOS, Course Management System (CMS) on the attitudes of professors toward distance education. The study was carried out in the Faculty of Accounting and Administration of a Mexican Public University. The research design was non-experimental with a group of twenty-five professors who were selected through purposive sampling. A questionnaire, which was an attitude scale toward the use of an administration system of online courses, was administered to participants before and after the implementation of an instructional strategy on the use of DOKEOS. Afterwards, usage statistics was examined between weeks three and six. Data analysis included calculation frequency, median, mode and standard deviation. The significant differences between the median of the pre-tests and post-tests were analysed, and then the t-test was administered. Results showed that the instructional strategy contributed to a more positive attitude of professors toward distance education.

AB  - Globalization makes living in the world more complex. Many children live as social cyborgs attached to the digital spaces of the virtual play worlds of television, video and computer games rather than connected to their own local places. The impact of this change may well be that children lack acquaintance with their local places and may never develop the ecological literacy or the positive attitudes toward place that is so crucial to its sustainability. This paper presents an autoethnographic study of a third grade class engaged in reading picture story books that featured place-based settings in partnership with embodied learning textually and visually through art, photography, poetry, story writing and environmental journals of class field experiences along their local river valley. Combining place-based education with social constructivist pedagogy fostered places for learning for children to create a knowing that they, too, can take action for places where they live throughout their lives.

AB  - This study examines how the perceived locus of crisis cause, controllability, and adherence to social mission are associated with public attitude in the context of a social enterprise crisis and evaluates the differences between these variables under episodic and thematic frames of online articles. Using the crisis case of THINX in 2017 as a case study, a quantitative content analysis was performed on a sample of 503 comments under online articles. Hierarchical regression revealed that the locus of crisis cause and adherence to social mission were associated with public attitude, whereas controllability was not associated with public attitude when adherence to social mission was accounted for. Significant differences were found in the locus of crisis cause, controllability, adherence to social mission, and public attitude between episodic and thematic frames. This study provided a basis for the theoretical development of crisis communication in a social enterprise and the corresponding role for public relations.

AB  - Background: Adequate knowledge and awareness of cleft lip and palate (CLP) deformity may help to counter the negative beliefs and attitudes toward the condition. The objective of this study was to assess the level of awareness, knowledge and attitude of women attending antenatal clinics about CLP.
   Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study with the aid of a structured interview administered questionnaire was conducted among 200 women attending antenatal clinics in three Federal Government Teaching Hospitals in the Northern and Southwestern regions of Nigeria. The main outcome measure was the level of awareness and the mean cumulative knowledge score.
   Results: The mean age of the subjects was 28.9 +/- 5.1 years (age range: 16-42 years). Half of the women (50.5%) reported that they had seen or heard about CLP. The mean cumulative knowledge score was 6.9, with only 19.8% having adequate knowledge. Many respondents had neither read an article on CLP nor participated in any public enlightenment program, and 31.5% indicated that they would like to know more about the condition. Level of educational attainment had a statistically significant effect on the level of awareness and knowledge on CLP, as more educated respondents tend to be more aware and knowledgeable (P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: There is need for increased public enlightenment/health education to increase awareness and subsequently help develop more positive attitudes toward children with CLP. Such programs should include distribution of pamphlets on CLP at clinics, especially antenatal clinics, media campaigns on radio, TV and newspaper as well as establishment of cleft support groups by the relevant governmental and professional organizations.

AB  - A deliberative democracy calls for citizens who are well informed about a diverse range of public issues and a media system that shapes the public agenda for deliberation and consensus building. However, with the current proliferation of a high-choice media environment, citizens can engage in partisan selective exposure by only consuming news that matches their own political attitudes and dispositions. This study examines two under-researched effects of partisan selective exposure: (1) the reduction in the number of societal issues that individuals consider important (i.e., nominal agenda diversity) and (2) the reduction in the variety of issues (i.e., thematic agenda diversity). A national survey was conducted in Hong Kong, a transitional democracy with a highly partisan media environment. The results showed that although reading more newspapers is positively related to nominal agenda diversity and thematic agenda diversity, citizens who receive their news only from partisan newspapers are less likely to be interested in a range of public issues and are less able to name pressing societal issues. Moreover, both nominal and thematic diversities predicted political participation, though not political discussion. The findings provide supporting evidence that partisan selective exposure can lead to a fragmented public agenda.

AB  - This study examined consumers' emotions and needs related to dining-out experiences before and during the COVID-19 crisis. This study identifies words closely associated with the keyword "dining-out " based on big data gleaned from social media and investigates consumers' perceptions of dining-out and related issues before and after COVID-19. The research findings can be summarized as follows: In 2019, frequently appearing dining-related words were dining-out, family, famous restaurant, recommend, and dinner. In 2020, they were dining-out, family, famous restaurant, and Corona. The analysis results for the dining-out sentimental network based on 2019 data revealed discourses revolving around delicious, nice, and easily. For the 2020 data, discourses revolved around struggling, and, cautious. The analysis of consumers' dining-out demand network for 2019 data showed discourses centered around reservation, famous restaurant, meal, order, and coffee. However, for 2020 data, discourses were formed around delivery, price, order, take-out, and social distance. In short, with the outbreak of the pandemic, delivery, takeout, and social distance emerged as new search words. In addition, compared with before the COVID-19 pandemic, a weakening trend in positive emotions and an increasing trend in negative emotions were detected after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic; specifically, fear was found to be the fear emotion.</p>

AB  - Since 2000, Vladimir Putin has used various means to consolidate a non-democratic regime in Russia. While regime support comes from many factors, the literature lacks consensus on whether social media use (SNS) associates with public support for non-democratic regimes. This study analyses whether using particular SNS platforms associate with more positive or negative evaluations of the regime in Russia. The mixed findings show that Russian SNS users have very nuanced attitudes towards the regime and its actors. Further, while Facebook and Twitter users are more critical of political actors and their work in protecting democracy, other platform-specific associations are additive.

AB  - Despite positive attitudes towards augmented reality (AR) technology and the rich consumer experience that the technology offers, AR technology adoption and usage to enhance the customer experience in e -commerce is rather limited. In this research, leveraging on the technology-organization-environment (TOE) theoretical framework, we propose various factors that influence the adoption intention of AR from an organizational perspective. Analysis of organizational adoption of AR for e-commerce will bring out important factors organizations should focus on while considering the implementation of AR technologies to enhance the shopping experience of their consumers. Specifically, the study theorizes the role of technological factors (technological competence and relative advantage), organizational factors (decision-makers' knowledge, financial strength, and top management support), and environmental factors (consumer readiness and competitive pressure) in influencing an organization's adoption of AR for e-commerce. We test the proposed research model via a sample of potential adopters from Singapore, India, and the USA. Results highlight the significant roles of technology competence, relative advantage, top management support, and consumer readiness in influencing an organization' s adoption intention of AR for e-commerce. Implications for research and practice are also discussed.

AB  - The study investigated reading habit and the use of electronic media by 3-6-6 JSS students in Nsukka Local Government in Nigeria. Using questionnaire and focus-group discussion as instrument of data collection, the study showed that students have positive attitudes to both reading and electronic media but spend more time engaged with use of electronic media especially television. Their purposes of reading were primarily academic and informational, while electronic media were used for entertainment and information seeking. The study provided evidences that the use of electronic media for entertainment has reduced the time available for voluntary reading while factors such as inadequate access to pleasurable reading materials and lack of parental support also hinder reading for pleasure. The study, however, recommended that interesting books be provided and made accessible to the students. Besides, students should find ways to utilise electronic media for reading.

AB  - The current study investigated the impact of intercultural contact between domestic and international students on attitudes toward international students, and potential mediators of this relationship. A total of 247 Australian-born domestic undergraduates completed a survey of the quantity and quality of their contact with international students, levels of intergroup anxiety (IA) and intercultural communication emotions (ICE), and their attitudes toward international students. Positive quality of intercultural contact, less IA, and more positive ICE were all related to more positive attitudes toward international students. In addition, ICE mediated the relationship between positive quality of contact and attitudes, and between IA and attitudes. Quality of contact exerted both direct and indirect effects (via IA and intercultural communications emotions) on intergroup attitudes. Results highlight the importance of addressing communication barriers and the emotions associated with these when promoting positive interactions between domestic and international students. Suggestions are made for a theoretical integration of intergroup and communication-based perspectives when considering attitudes toward linguistically diverse outgroups like international students.

AB  - Family motivation as a mediating mechanism is a novel and under-researched area in the field of positive organizational scholarship. Drawing on Social Exchange Theory (SET), this study empirically validates family motivation as a mediator between family support and work engagement. The process by Hayes (2013) was used to analyze time-lagged data collected from 356 employees of the education sector. Results confirm the mediating role of family motivation in the relationship between family support and work engagement and the moderating role of calling in the relationship between family support and family motivation. This study adds to the literature of family-work enrichment accounts by validating family support as a novel antecedent for family motivation and positive attitudes. The implications of the study are discussed.

AB  - The current study contributes to the examination of third-person effects in the context of Internet pornography in China. Drawing from third-person effect theory, this study investigates what factors determine the self-others perceptual discrepancy in estimations of Internet pornography influences. Using data from a 2014 online survey (N = 533) conducted in China, study results indicated a significant difference between the perceived effects on self and others. Second, the study confirmed the theoretical linkage between perceived effects on others and respondent support for censorship of pornography. Third, study results revealed that the self-others perceptual gap was influenced by social distance between self and others, perceived feminism and perceived sexual conservatism.

AB  - Background: Schools are key settings for delivering mental illness prevention in adolescents. Data on stakeholders' attitudes and factors relevant for the implementation of Internet-based prevention programmes are scarce. Methods: Stakeholders in the school setting from Austria and Spain were consulted. Potential facilitators (e.g. teachers and school psychologists) completed an online questionnaire (N=50), policy makers (e.g. representatives of the ministry of education and health professional associations) participated in semi-structured interviews (N=9) and pupils (N=29, 14-19 years) participated in focus groups. Thematic analysis was used to identify experiences with, attitudes and needs towards Internet-based prevention programmes, underserved groups, as well as barriers and facilitators for reach, adoption, implementation and maintenance. Results: Experiences with Internet-based prevention programmes were low across all stakeholder groups. Better reach of the target groups was seen as main advantage whereas lack of personal contact, privacy concerns, risk for misuse and potential stigmatization when implemented during school hours were regarded as disadvantages. Relevant needs towards Internet-based programmes involved attributes of the development process, general requirements for safety and performance, presentation of content, media/tools and contact options of online programmes. Positive attitudes of school staff, low effort for schools and compatibility to schools' curriculum were seen as key factors for successful adoption and implementation. A sound implementation of the programme in the school routine and continued improvement could facilitate maintenance of online prevention initiatives in schools. Conclusions: Attitudes towards Internet-based mental illness prevention programmes in school settings are positive across all stakeholder groups. However, especially safety concerns have to be considered.

AB  - Introduction: In dental surgeries, most of the materials and procedures have been discovered and utilized to avoid the dental diseases especially in Cavities. Fluoride is one of the main materials, which has been a remarkable product which is when it comes to halting the Advancement of early carious lesions. This sealant has been used in protection in the form of gels, solutions, ointments etc. As compared to fluorides, the level of knowledge related to dental sealants has been found to be on the lower side as per the recent review of literatures. Methodology: This is a cross sectional study conducted among the Saudi parents using an online survey. All parents (male and female) willing to participate in this study were requested to fill up the survey. A total of 956 parents filled the survey using social media. An online questionnaire was designed using Google Forms with questions related to personal and demographic information followed by attitude related questions. Result: Comparisons were made on the basis of gender, age groups, educational level and number of children using Chi-square test. Statistically significant differences were reported among males and females when inquired the parents about reason for dental visit (p-value: 0.017), supporting addition of fluoride in toothpaste (p-value: 0.003) and satisfaction from fluoride gels (p-value: 0.025). Conclusion: According to the results and the analysis of statistic this study concludes that mothers showed better knowledge regarding the use of fluoride in different forms among their children also Parents with fewer children showed positive attitudes towards the use of fluoride and sealants among their children.

AB  - Objectives: The goal of this paper is to analyze the influence of attitude to technology, perceived benefits and perceived risks on stakeholders' attitude towards ORS. This method needs support from stakeholders so that its implementation does not cause any concern. Design/Methodology/Approach: In order to achieve the desired goal, questionnaires were built on the basis of a validated study. The questionnaires were distributed randomly on three hundred and ninety-nine adult respondents above 18 years old (scientists and the public who reside in the dengue hot-spot areas around the Klang Valley) from September 2016 to September 2017. The data that has been collected, is then analyzed using structural equation modeling with partial least squares (PLS) approach. Results: Perceived benefits was found to be the most important and strongest direct predictor of positive attitude to ORS. It also acted as mediator for the relationship between perceived risks and attitudes to technology with attitude to ORS. Perceived risks also served as a mediator for attitudes to technology. Limitations: The data collected only covers two groups of stakeholders. In fact, only three predictor factors were evaluated to determine the influence of attitudes on the ORS method as one of the control of dengue in Malaysia. Future studies may use various predictive factors in determining attitude towards other dengue control techniques. Practical implications: These findings can provide an insight into the social acceptance of ORS technology to combat dengue. Originality/Value: Authors confirm that this study and the findings are genuine and have not yet been released. The proposed structural model in this study serves as a basis for improving the decision-making process of ORS technology.

TI  - Feasibility of couple-based expanded carrier screening offered by general practitioners
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS
LA  - English
KW  - CARE
AB  - Expanded carrier screening (ECS) aims to inform couples' reproductive choice, preferably before conception. As part of an implementation study in which trained general practitioners (GPs) offered a population-based ECS couple-test, we evaluated the feasibility of the test-offer and degree of participant informed choice (IC). Trained GPs from nine practices in the northern Netherlands invited 4295 female patients aged 18-40 to take part in couple-based ECS. Inclusion criteria were having a male partner, planning for children and not being pregnant. We evaluated the feasibility of the organizational aspects, GP competence and the content of the pre-test counselling. Participant satisfaction, evaluation of pre-test counselling and degree of IC were measured using a longitudinal survey. We explored GP experiences and their views on future implementation through semistructured interviews. 130 consultations took place. All participating GPs were assessed by genetic professionals to be competent to conduct pre-test counselling. Most (63/108 (58%)) consultations took place within the planned 20 min (median 20, IQR 1828). GPs considered couples' prior knowledge level an important determinant of consultation length. 91% of patients were (very) satisfied with the GP counselling. After pre-test counselling, 231/237(97%) participants had sufficient knowledge and 206/231 (88%) had a positive attitude and proceeded with testing. Our pilot demonstrates that offering couple-based ECS through trained and motivated GPs is feasible. Future large-scale implementation requires a well-informed general public and a discussion about appropriate reimbursement for GPs and health care coverage for couples. Providing (more) test information pre-appointment may help reduce average consultation time.

AB  - Background Supporting patients' decision making about clinical trials may enhance trial participation. To date, few theory-based interventions have been tested to address this issue. The objective of the current study was aimed to evaluate the effect of a multimedia psychoeducation (MP) intervention, relative to a print education (PE) intervention, on patients' decision support needs and attitudes about clinical trials. Methods Patients with cancer who were eligible for participation in a National Cancer Institute therapeutic cancer clinical trial were recruited through the nationwide University of Rochester Cancer Center National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program from 2014 to 2016 and were randomized to the MP or PE intervention. Assessments at baseline (before intervention), postintervention, and at a 2-month follow-up visit included patients' decision support needs, attitudes regarding clinical trials, and clinical trial participation. Results In total, 418 patients with various types of cancer were recruited (ages 26-89 years). Relative to the PE intervention, the MP intervention did not significantly affect decision support needs. However, patients in the MP arm reported significantly more positive attitudes about clinical trials and were more likely to participate in a clinical trial than those in the PE arm (69% vs 62%; P = .01). Furthermore, an improvement in attitudes about clinical trials significantly mediated the effect of the intervention on participation in clinical trials. Conclusions The MP intervention was able to improve patient attitudes toward clinical trials compared with the PE intervention, and this improvement led to increased rates of participation in trials. The MP intervention could be disseminated to improve attitudes about clinical trials among patients with cancer. (C) 2018 American Cancer Society.

AB  - Scientific achievements concerning the direct relation between personality traits and positive orientation among patients with multiple sclerosis do not explain the role of potential mediators. In fact, some researchers argue that the traits-positivity association is much more complex than it seems to be. For this reason, we made an attempt to analyze the indirect relationship between the above-mentioned variables, including meaning in life as a mediator. In total, 618 patients with MS took part in the study. The NEO Five-Factor Inventory, the Positive Orientation Scale, and the Meaning in Life Questionnaire were used. The results showed that positive orientation/the presence of meaning/searching for meaning correlated positively with extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, and were negatively associated with neuroticism. Moreover, meaning in life in both its dimensions acted as a mediator in 9 of 10 models. It can be assumed that a propensity to establish interpersonal relationships (extraversion), use active imagination (openness), inspire confidence among others (agreeableness), and take responsibility (conscientiousness) can have an impact on someone's positive attitude toward oneself and the surrounding world (positive orientation) when people have meaning in life and when they are seeking it.

AB  - This study uncovered the influence of an airport's green physical environment on visitors' psychological responses, affective responses, and loyalty behaviors as well as to build a sturdy theorization that related to the psychological resilience, attitude, satisfaction, brand-self connection, and loyalty for the airport. Based on a quantitative approach, our findings provided insight that a green physical environment affected the psychological resilience considerably. Moreover, such association increased a visitor's positive attitude, satisfaction, and brand-self connection with the creation of loyalty intentions. The prominent role of attitude in building loyalty intentions was unearthed. Our finding from a metric invariance test further showed that gender moderated the magnitude of the effect of satisfaction and brand-self connection on loyalty intentions. The study variables' role of mediating effect was also recognizable. Overall, the present study demonstrated the criticality of a green built environment and its role in explicating visitor responses/behaviors in the airport context in a successful manner.

AB  - Recently, the restaurant industry has witnessed an unprecedented rise of healthy restaurant brands. However, the existing literature offers little guidance on how to effectively leverage such brands in the marketplace. To address this gap, the current research examines a novel marketing strategy (i.e., using handwritten typeface on menus) that enhances consumer responses to healthy restaurant brands. The results show that handwritten typeface creates a competitive advantage by conveying a sense of human touch, which subsequently induces the perception that love is symbolically imbued in the restaurant's offerings. The belief that "menu contains love" leads to a wide range of favorable consumer responses including positive attitudes toward the menu, enhanced perceived healthiness of the brand, and higher social media engagement. The results show that these positive effects occur only when the restaurant brand is health-focused. Moreover, the handwritten typeface effect with healthy restaurants is observed in both social and solo dining contexts. Implications for branding, visual design, and menu psychology are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to identify and categorize the perceptions of young adults before we allocate the resources to design, develop, and implement digital game-based learning in higher education institutions in Taiwan. Q-methodology was conducted for this study because it is a quantitative analysis of subjective data. Thirty young adults from a university were surveyed and asked to rank-order 30 statements about online games. Factor analysis was used to identify the number of factors and the correlation study attempts to identify the individuals who are highly correlated with one another in each specific factor. The data were processed and analyzed following the usual steps of Q-methodology by using the PQMethod software. Three operant factor types (i.e. New media resisters, Pajamasocializers, and Game value resisters) were identified. The findings of this study can help higher education institutions to be aware of the negative and positive attitudes toward online gaming.

AB  - Youth can transmit COVID-19 to adults, but few communication materials exist for engaging youth in COVID-19 prevention behaviors. We describe the process of leveraging a community-academic partnership in a rapid response initiative to engage youth in a contest (i.e., Youth-Led Creative Expression Contest to Prevent COVID-19 across Texas) to develop creative public health messaging centered on the prevention of COVID-19 transmission and infection for their peers. Core activities included developing a request for applications that solicited submission of creative expression materials promoting the use of COVID-19 prevention behaviors (mask-wearing, social distancing, handwashing, not touching the face) from Texas youth in elementary, middle, and/or high school; sending the request for applications to 48 organizations in Austin, Brownsville, Dallas, El Paso, Houston, and San Antonio in summer 2020; and recruiting a youth advisory board to score submissions and award prizes. We report on youth engagement in the COVID communication contest across Texas and use statistics (chi-square and t-tests) to characterize and compare youth participants and their creative expression artwork. The contest resulted in 3,003 website views and 34 submissions eligible for scoring. Each submission averaged >2 prevention behaviors. On average, winning submissions included a higher number of prevention behaviors than non winning submissions. The prevention behavior "not touching the face" was included more often in winning submissions than non winning submissions. Elementary school children were less likely to include a mask in their submission compared with older youth. Existing community-academic networks can engage youth in the development of geographically and age-tailored communication materials.

AB  - Since the early 2000s, the Chinese military has been engaged in the production of military- and war-themed cultural products which increasingly employ new media and new technologies. Many of these products specifically target children and youth, and many are also a result of collaborations between the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and commercial forces. This article offers a preliminary exploration of how such PLA-civilian productions attempt to package and market war and the military to contemporary Chinese children and youth. It compares these current endeavours to previous depictions of war and the military in the youth culture of the Maoist period, and reflects on what this comparison can tell us about recent changes in official as well as popular conceptualizations of childhood, youth, and violence in the People's Republic of China. The analysis demonstrates that contemporary PLA products for children and youth display positive attitudes toward the military and toward officially sanctioned military violence. However, these products also subscribe to new public sensitivities about children and their involvement in acts of brutality, thereby reflecting the changing needs and interests of the PLA and of the Chinese Communist Party in the post-Cold War, post-Tiananmen era.

AB  - Digital museums are replacing traditional museums to inspire individual growth and promote culture exchange and society enrichment. However, the benefits of using the traditional museum to inspire visitors and promote the local economy may be compromised in the digital museum. This study attempts to offer insights on digital museum adoption from user and system perspectives. We extended the technology acceptance model (TAM) by incorporating computer self-efficacy and personal innovativeness as individual variables and media richness as a system characteristic. We launched a full-scale study with 441 users of 3 weather museums in Taiwan. We had 327 valid responses, a 74% response rate, from our target population. We conducted a regression analysis to investigate the potential influence of independent variables on the adoption of digital museums. Our results showed that both user and system characteristics have a positive influence on perceived usefulness (PU). A proper consideration of these three constructs can increase a user's PU and perceived ease of use (PEOU), thereby establishing a more positive attitude regarding the use of digital museums. Academic and practical implications concerning their adoption from user and system perspectives were drawn from these findings.

AB  - This research is about the importance of the expected achievement of preservice Chinese language teachers based on their orientation, attitude, and motivation in teaching education programs. The cluster sampling and random sampling methods were implemented to select the samples from 16 Institute of Teacher Education Malaysia (IPGM). A total of 389 respondents were selected in the study and the data was analysed by using Smart PLS 3.0 software. This study applied a two-stage analysis in a reflective-formative way to analysis the multidimensional constructs on the learning situation. The findings showed a significant positive relationship of teachers' integration orientation, instrumental orientation, and attitudes towards learning situations with their Chinese language achievements. The motivation of intensity acted as a mediator factor and showed a partial positive effect in the relationship between integration orientation, instrumental orientation and attitudes towards learning situation with Chinese language achievement. It is due to relationship between motivation and positive attitude as well as the orientation of integration has shaped the integration motivation in the socio-learning model. Thus, the results of the study can be used as a reference source of multivariate relationship study between the orientation, attitudes, motivation, and achievement of future refractive-formative research.

AB  - This study employed an extended theory of planned behaviour to assess the socio-psychological factors influencing farmers' willingness to continue participating (WTCP) in collaborative activities of community-based innovation platforms (CB-IPs). Using a structured questionnaire, data were obtained from a random sample of 231 farmers who had participated in collaborative activities of the CB-IPs. Data were analyzed using partial least squares-structural equation modelling. Findings showed that although farmers' past-experience did not directly influence their WTCP in collaborative activities of CB-IPs, it was positive and significant when mediated by attitudes and perceived behavioural control (t-value = 6.840; p-value = 0.000). Therefore, it can be concluded that farmers' WTCP in collaborative activities of CB-IPs is enhanced by three socio-psychological factors: favourable past-experience, positive attitudes towards collaborative activities of CB-IPs, and farmers' perceived capacity to participate. Hence, conveners of collaborative activities of CB-IPs ought to improve farmers' attitudes through organizing beneficial activities and building their capacity to participate. This study contributed to the body of knowledge by using a behavioural perspective to examine the socio-psychological factors that influence farmers' continued participation in collaboration activities of CB-IPs.

AB  - Interpersonal sexual objectification experiences are pervasive in online communication contexts, and their influence on positive eating behaviors should not be ignored. Broad conceptualization of beauty refers to how widely women and girls define female beauty in terms of both internal and external characteristics, and body appreciation refers to loving, respecting, and holding a positive attitude toward the body. This study examined the association between online interpersonal sexual objectification (OISO) experiences and intuitive eating, as well as the mediating role of broad conceptualization of beauty and body appreciation. Participants were 1152 Chinese adolescent girls aged 11 to 15 years who completed a questionnaire survey measuring OISO experiences, broad conceptualization of beauty, body appreciation, and intuitive eating. The results showed a negative association of OISO experiences with broad conceptualization of beauty and intuitive eating. Mediation analysis using structural equation modeling showed a negative association of OISO experiences with intuitive eating through broad conceptualization of beauty and body appreciation. These results suggest that programs aiming to improve healthy eating behaviors could direct adolescent girls to criticize the appearance-focused mindset in online interaction and encourage them to focus on body functionality, such as health, creative endeavors, and communication with others.

In this paper, we investigated another potential determinant of reported strategy use, international orientation, based on the concepts of international posture [Yashima, T. (2009). International posture and the ideal L2 self in the Japanese EFL context. In Z. Dornyei & E. Ushioda (Eds.), Motivation, language identity and the L2 self (pp. 144-163). Bristol: Multilingual Matters] and ideal L2 self (Dornyei, Z. (2005). The psychology of the language learner: Individual differences in second language acquisition. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum], alongside attitudinal factors (importance and enjoyment of learning) and environmental factors (parents' EFL knowledge). Based on quantitative data from 329 Greek secondary school students, we employed confirmatory factor analysis to test whether international orientation fully or partially mediates intended learning effort as illustrated by strategy use. We concluded that international orientation partially mediates parents' EFL knowledge, as assessed by their children, and attitudes to language learning to predict motivated strategy use. We discuss pedagogical implications of our findings.

AB  - Human perceptions influence attitudes and intentions, and can predict actions. Despite the popular use of technology for English language teaching, and the association between learner factors and technology use, little is known about language learners' use of technology for personal and interpersonal learning activities, and whether there is a discrepancy between intention and actual adoption in this specific domain. The study adds to the existing literature by testing the association between university English learners' intention to use technology to achieve personal and interpersonal English learning purposes, attitude towards technology, and perceived usefulness of technology. It examined predictive paths between intended and actual technology use by university learners. With reference to 539 returned questionnaires collected from four language and education disciplines in a private university in Hong Kong, the respondents showed a positive attitude and perceptions towards the use of technology for English language learning. However, their actual adoption of technology to achieve personal or interpersonal learning purposes was not commensurate with the two key learner factors and intention. Students' discipline and level of study mediated the two learner factors, resulting in different actual English learning behaviours. Recommendations for practitioners to maximise and support technology use by students for learning are given.

AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic brought a new challenge to medical education-health-care students had fewer opportunities to interact with and treat real patients in clinical settings. Interpersonal communication skills are often developed through human interaction and communication in person, and few studies have proposed feasible digital solutions to develop learners' communication skills. Consequently, understanding how medical teachers facilitate and implement online training programmes, with feasible instruments, to enhance students' learning effectiveness when in-person training is not possible is critical. Methods By using a convenience sampling method, we recruited 26 health-care students from seven medical schools in Taiwan. Through semistructured interviews and the thematic analysis technique, we analysed the latent learning factors from the experience of implementing the technology-enhanced experiential e-learning tool 'mPath'. Results Three themes were generated: A) transferring theory into practice, B) increasing authenticity with analytical features, and C) maintaining autonomy with nondirective learning. The features accessibility, flexibility, intractability, and visualisation with the characteristics of remote accessibility and flexibility, repetition and retrospect, feedback requesting, and visualised analytical reports were considered to enhance learning outcomes. Conclusion This study indicated how online training using technology could develop the participants' person-centred communication skills and what features influenced the learning outcomes of social distancing. mPath may be a feasible online learning approach and has provided inspiration for developing health-care students' communication skills when in-person training is not possible.

AB  - Aims: Early engagement in advance care planning (ACP) is recommended in heart failure (HF) management. We investigated the preferences of patients with HF regarding ACP and end-of-life (EOL) care, including their desired timing of ACP initiation.
   Methods and results: Data were collected using a 92-item questionnaire survey, which was directly distributed to hospitalized patients by dedicated physicians and nurses in a university hospital setting. One-hundred eighty-seven patients agreed to participate (response rate: 92.6%), and 171 completed the survey [valid response rate: 84.7%; men: 67.3%; median age: 73.0 (63.0-81.0) years]. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the predictors of positive attitudes towards ACP. Most recognized ACP as important for their care (n = 127, 74.3%), 48.1% stated that ACP should be initiated after repeated HF hospitalizations in the past year, and 29.0% preferred ACP to begin during the first or second HF hospitalization. Only 21.7% of patients had previously engaged in ACP conversations during HF management. Positive attitudes towards ACP were associated with lower depressive symptoms [two-item Patient Health Questionnaire; odds ratio (OR): 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61-0.92, P-value: 0.006], marriage (OR: 2.53, 95% CI: 1.25-5.12, P-value: 0.010), and a high educational level (OR: 2.66, 95% CI: 1.28-5.56, P-value: 0.009), but not with severity of HF (represented by Seattle Heart Failure Model risk score). Regarding EOL care, while 'Saying what one wants to tell loved ones' (83.4%), 'Dying a natural death' (81.8%), and 'Being able to stay at one's favorite place' (75.6%) were the three most important factors for patients, preferences for 'Receiving sufficient treatment' (56.5%) and 'Knowing what to expect about future condition' (50.3%) were divergent.
   Conclusions: Despite patients' preferences for ACP conversations, there was a discrepancy between preference and engagement in ACP among patients hospitalized for HF. Patients' preferences regarding EOL care may differ; physicians need to consider the appropriate ACP approach to align with patients' care goals.

AB  - Objectives Paediatric pneumonia burden and mortality are highest in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC). Paediatric lung ultrasound (LUS) has emerged as a promising diagnostic tool for pneumonia in LMIC. Despite a growing evidence base for LUS use in paediatric pneumonia diagnosis, little is known about its potential for successful implementation in LMIC. Our objectives were to evaluate the feasibility, usability and acceptability of LUS in the diagnosis of paediatric pneumonia.
   Design Prospective qualitative study using semistructured interviews
   Setting Two referral hospitals in Mozambique and Pakistan
   Participants A total of 21 healthcare providers (HCPs) and 20 caregivers were enrolled.
   Results HCPs highlighted themes of limited resource availability for the feasibility of LUS implementation, including perceived high cost of equipment, maintenance demands, time constraints and limited trained staff. HCPs emphasised the importance of policymaker support and caregiver acceptance for long-term success. HCP perspectives of usability highlighted ease of use and integration into existing workflow. HCPs and caregivers had positive attitudes towards LUS with few exceptions. Both HCPs and caregivers emphasised the potential for rapid, improved diagnosis of paediatric respiratory conditions using LUS.
   Conclusions This was the first study to evaluate HCP and caregiver perspectives of paediatric LUS through qualitative analysis. Critical components impacting feasibility, usability and acceptability of LUS for paediatric pneumonia diagnosis in LMIC were identified for initial deployment. Future research should explore LUS sustainability, with a particular focus on quality control, device maintenance and functionality and adoption of the new technology within the health system. This study highlights the need to engage both users and recipients of new technology early in order to adapt future interventions to the local context for successful implementation.

AB  - Research on combining social survey responses and social media posts has shown that the willingness to share social media accounts in surveys depends on the mode of the survey and certain socio-demographics of the respondents. We add new insights to this research by demonstrating that the willingness to share their Facebook and Twitter accounts also depends on the respondents' opinions on specific topics. Furthermore, we extend previous research by actually accessing their social media accounts and checking whether survey responses and tweets are coherent. Our analyses indicate that survey respondents who are willing to share their social media accounts hold more positive attitudes toward COVID-19 measures. The same pattern holds true when comparing their sentiments to a larger Twitter collection. Our results highlight another source of sampling bias when combining survey and social media data: a bias due to specific views, which might be related to social desirability.

AB  - This study explores the relationship between technology adoption and attitudes toward gender equality in political representation by relying on diffusion theories coupled with frameworks of ideational change, social interaction, and world society. We examine whether the use of mobile phones shapes gender attitudes toward women's participation in politics by making it more widely accepted that women hold institutional roles. We do so with micro-level data from the AfroBarometer, covering 36 African countries, and a multilevel modeling approach. Our results suggest that regular use of mobile phones is associated with more positive attitudes toward women's participation in politics. The significant relationship-robust to the use of instrumental variable techniques-is observed only among women. This finding strengthens the idea that technology adoption on the part of women, by improving connectivity and expanding access to information, may be a successful lever to raise women's status and promote societal well-being, ultimately contributing to achieving Sustainable Development Goal 5, which seeks to "achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls." Concurrently, the lack of a significant relationship for men highlights an important yet often neglected issue: policies aimed at changing gender attitudes are often targeted at women, but men's attitudes can be stickier than women's, thus requiring further efforts.

AB  - This study examined whether different components of capability for suicide (i.e., fearlessness about death, pain tolerance, pain insensitivity, preparation for suicide, suicide plan, and courage), as well as painful and provocative events, nonsuicidal self-injury, depressive symptoms, and hopelessness, could distinguish between suicide attempters, suicide ideators, and non-suicidal controls. A total of 930 Chinese adolescents completed questionnaires, and a multinomial logistic regression was conducted to identify factors that could distinguish among the 3 groups. We found that higher levels of pain tolerance, more detailed suicide plans, more positive attitudes towards suicide, as well as more painful and provocative experiences and more severe depressive symptoms were positively associated with increased likelihood of the engagement in both suicide ideation and suicide attempts. Only nonsuicidal self-injury increased the likelihood of falling in the suicide attempt group as compared to the suicide ideation group. Findings of this study emphasize the role of nonsuicidal self-injury in intervening suicidality.

AB  - Background: Vaccination is a worldwide public health practice that requires high uptake levels in order to effectively reduce the incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases. The manufacturing of vaccines is a complex process, and little is known about people's feelings and opinions on that. Our study aimed at investigating perceptions and attitudes of the general population towards the vaccine production process before the availability of COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: We designed a 15-question online survey in the Italian language which was spread via Facebook and an Italian website "Vaccinarsintoscana" between January and May 2020. We performed a descriptive analysis and applied statistical tests to assess differences in the given answers according to participants' sociodemographic characteristics. Results: The collected responses (135 participants) about the perceptions on vaccine production process were largely positive: not being concerned about the vaccine production (70.3%); believing the vials did not contain harmful substances (75.6%) and considering the precautionary withdrawal of some batches as highly effective (83.7%). In contrast, a less positive perception was found for the question about the conflict of interest between manufacturing companies and the control systems (48.9%). Moreover, people's perceptions towards the vaccine components (i.e., microorganism, adjuvants and opinion on batches withdrawal) also showed a good level of confidence and trust. Conclusions: Our study highlighted a generally positive attitude towards the vaccine production process and showed people's confidence in the control systems, safety and high standards of quality of the vaccine production process.

AB  - Introduction: Among healthy adolescents, school closures and home confinement were shown to increase unhealthier eating habits and sedentary behavior. It remains unknown to which extent the pandemic has impacted the lifestyle of adolescents with chronic conditions. Thus, the aim of this study is to report on the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on eating habits and sedentary behavior among adolescents with multiple chronic conditions (n = 347) from a tertiary, referral hospital vs. healthy peers.Methods: This observational study was conducted in Sao Paulo (Brazil) between July and October 2020, period in which a set of social distancing measures to contain the pandemic.Results: The main findings of this study were that adolescents with chronic conditions and health peers showed important changes in eating habits (e.g., more often cooking and eating in front of television than before quarantine). Also, 86.8% of adolescents with chronic conditions and 91.6% of healthy adolescents reported increasing screen time during pandemic. No major differences were observed between patients and controls.Conclusions: Adolescents with chronic conditions and healthy peers exposed to pandemic showed substantial changes in lifestyle, stressing the need for specific care to mitigate poor eating habits and excessive sedentary behavior for patients and healthy adolescents.

AB  - Objective: Cutaneous body image (CBI) dissatisfaction, feelings of social exclusion and stigmatization have been associated with increased suicidality in dermatology patients. We examined the relation between CBI dissatisfaction and suicidal ideation in a non-clinical sample, and examined the possible mediating effect of interpersonal sensitivity (IS), a symptom dimension related to self-consciousness, feelings of inferiority and social exclusion.
   Methods: As part of a larger study, 312 community-based participants from London, Ontario, Canada (241 women, 71 men; mean +/- SD age: 38.4 +/- 14.9 years) rated their CBI satisfaction, measured with the Cutaneous Body Image Scale (Gupta MA et al., 2004). The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) (Derogatis Let al.,1982) was used to measure the constructs of suicidal ideation (4 suicide-related items from the BSI) and IS (Interpersonal Sensitivity subscale of BSI).
   Results: Assessing mediation using the Baron & Kenny (1986) model, CBI satisfaction had a significant negative effect on suicidal ideation [c = -0.316, t(296) = -5.73, p<0.001] and IS [a = -0.365, t(297) = -6.76, p<0.001]; when CBI satisfaction and IS were considered together, IS had a significant positive effect on suicidal ideation (b = .690, t(295) = 15.80, p<.001) while the effect of CBI satisfaction on suicidal ideation was no longer significant [c*=-.063, t(295) = -1.44, ns].
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest an inverse relationship between CBI satisfaction and suicidal ideation, which is mediated by IS. This relationship likely falls in a continuum between non-clinical and clinical situations, with suicide risk being greater when individuals experience greater CBI dissatisfaction and social alienation.

AB  - Background: Care partners are key members of patients' health care teams, yet little is known about their experiences accessing patient information via electronic portals. Objective: To better understand the characteristics and perceptions of care partners who read patients' electronic visit notes. Patient involvement: Focus groups with diverse patients from a community health center provided input into survey development. Methods: We contacted patient portal users at 3 geographically distinct sites in the US via email in 2017 for an online survey including open ended questions which we qualitatively analyzed. Results: Respondents chose whether to answer as care partners (N = 874) or patients (N = 28,782). Among care partner respondents, 44% were spouses, 43% children/other family members, and 14% friends/neighbors/other. Both care partners and patients reported that access to electronic notes was very important for promoting positive health behaviors, but care partners' perceptions of importance were consistently more positive than patients' perceptions of engagement behaviors. Open-ended comments included positive benefits such as: help with remembering the plan for care, coordinating care with other doctors, decreasing stress of care giving, improving efficiency of visits, and supporting patients from a geographical distance. They also offered suggestions for improving electronic portal and note experience for care partners such as having a separate log on for care partners; having doctors avoid judgmental language in their notes; and the ability to prompt needed medical care for patients. Discussion: Care partners value electronic access to patients' health information even more than patients. The majority of care partners were family members, whose feedback is important for improving portal design that effectively engages these care team members. Practical value: Patient care in the time of COVID-19 increasingly requires social distancing which may place additional burden on care partners supporting vulnerable patients. Access to patient notes may promote quality of care by keeping care partners informed, and care partner's input should be used to optimize portal design and electronic access to patient information.

AB  - Narratives can be used to persuade individuals to change their attitudes and behaviors, and can be especially effective is in changing attitudes toward individuals that are stigmatized or otherwise labeled as outgroup members. One feature that can influence a story's persuasive effectiveness is the story's point of view (POV). This study experimentally investigated the relative impacts of 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-person POVs on attitudes toward, and beliefs about, gay people. Results showed that participants who read the 3rd-person story had significantly more positive attitudes toward gay people than those who read the 1st-person story. In all cases, POV appeared to have no impact upon narrative transportation or identification.

AB  - While the effect of academic discipline on political attitudes has long been acknowledged, much less is known on how disciplinary background affects policy attitudes. Linder and Peters (1992) argued that attitudes to policy instruments correspond with discipline: lawyers are assumed to tend to be partial to legalistic regulatory instruments, economists to favor economic tools such as loans or taxation. Nevertheless, relevant empirical evidence is almost non-existent. The paper attempts to bridge this gap by comparing policy instruments attitudes in different academic disciplines on a sample of Czech university students (N = 8820). We inquire whether students in different academic fields (with special emphasis on economics, law, education, political science, and mass media/journalism) differ in their political and policy views. In line with previous research, students pursuing economics and law (as well as education) are found to be more right-wing oriented than students of political science and mass media. Students also differ in terms of their overall acceptance of policy instruments, with those of political science being the most accepting of all types of instruments. However, we find little support for the correspondence thesis proposed by Linder and Peters.

AB  - Mass media shape not only public, but also healthcare professionals' attitudes towards individuals with a mental illness. This study investigates how watching a movie about schizophrenia affects stigma-related attitudes of rehabilitation science students, who are likely to work with affected individuals. Participants watched an entertainment movie portrayal of schizophrenia. Stigma-related attitudes and social distance were assessed one week before watching the movie, directly afterwards, and one week later. No significant differences in stigmatization emerged between viewers and non-viewers. Enjoyment, appreciation, and general movie evaluation mediated viewers' transportation into the story on changes in stigmatization. Results are discussed with respect to media effects on stigma-related attitudes and their implications for mental health nursing practice and education.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to restrictions in our contact with others and the introduction of social distancing barriers. These rules can enhance the psychological mechanisms resulting from fear of contamination and may lead to exacerbating prejudiced attitudes towards certain social groups seen as possible carriers of infection. Fear of infection and ideas about cleanliness and dirtiness have indeed historically and culturally influenced the way we interact with other people, both on an inter-personal and inter-group level. The aim of the present research is to analyse whether the concern about COVID-19 is linked to prejudices towards other social groups and whether this relationship is mediated by individual representations of cleanliness. Results on 251 Italian citizens showed that concerns about COVID-19 are positively related to prejudicial attitudes towards immigrants and that such a relation is indeed mediated by so-called cultural representations of cleanliness. Specifically, the so-called cultural representations of hygiene-by which people and groups are categorized as being more or less civilized on the basis of their cleaning practices-was a significant mediator.

AB  - Background: Breast cancer (BC) is the commonest cancer among Saudi women. Awareness about its screening among females is a crucial issue for early detection of breast abnormalities and interference to reduce its complications. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted on a sample of 421 adult females in Alqunfudhah district. Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire to assess their knowledge and attitude towards breast cancer screening. Results: A total of 421 females responded to survey 83.4%, 63.4 % and 44.4% of them respectively knew about breast self-examinations, clinical examinations, and mammography. Most information was from media (67.9%). The commonest risk factor was family history (88.1%) while occurrence of a breast mass was the most identified warning sign (96.9%). Good knowledge was significantly higher among highly educated females (P 0.008) and whose high family income (P 0.000) whiles their positive attitude was significantly higher among younger females (P 0.003). Conclusion: Females' knowledge and attitude towards breast cancer screening were not up to expected and this indicated necessity to promote breast cancer screening by intensifying educational campaigns and increasing screening programs.

AB  - This study examines differences between key socio-demographic groups and the impact of strength of social network, political trust, and fear of COVID-19 on working from home (a key social distancing behaviour) and compulsive buying (a maladaptive behaviour) in response to COVID-19. This study used a correlational cross-sectional survey design. A sample of 411 participants in the United Kingdom (UK) completed measures of strength of social network, political trust, fear of COVID-19, length of self-isolation and compulsive buying. Results showed that older people and lower income groups are less likely to work from home in response to COVID-19; that people with a diagnosed mental health disorder exhibited less political trust, more fear of COVID-19, and more compulsive buying; and that people reporting COVID-19 symptomatology had been in self-isolation for longer and exhibited more compulsive buying than those with no COVID-19 symptomatology. The structural equation model showed that age, having a diagnosed mental health disorder, having COVID-19 symptomatology and strength of social network impacted on working from home and compulsive buying, through the mediators of political trust, fear of COVID-19 and length of self-isolation. The results demonstrate that some groups in the UK population may be vulnerable to maladaptive behaviours and poor social, psychological, and physical health outcomes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These groups may require special support to cope effectively with the effects of COVID-19.

   Objective: This study aimed to evaluate socioeconomic disparities in eHealth literacy and seeking of web-based information on COVID-19, and their associations with COVID-19 preventive behaviors.
   Methods: The COVID-19 Health Information Survey (CoVHIns), using telephonic (n=500) and web-based surveys (n=1001), was conducted among adults in Hong Kong in April 2020. The Chinese eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS; score range 8-40) was used to measure eHealth literacy. COVID-19 preventive behaviors included wearing surgical masks, wearing fabric masks, washing hands, social distancing, and adding water or bleach to the household drainage system. Adjusted beta coefficients and the slope indices of inequality for the eHEALS score by socioeconomic status, adjusted odds ratios (aORs) for seeking of web-based information on COVID-19 by socioeconomic status, and aORs for the high adherence to preventive behaviors by the eHEALS score and seeking of web-based information on COVID-19 were calculated.
   Results: The mean eHEALS score was 26.10 (SD 7.70). Age was inversely associated with the eHEALS score, but education and personal income were positively associated with the eHEALS score and seeking of web-based information on COVID-19 (for all, P for trend<.05). Participants who sought web-based information on COVID-19 showed high adherence to the practice of wearing surgical masks (aOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.15-2.13), washing hands (aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.05-1.71), social distancing (aOR 1.48, 95% CI 1.14-1.93), and adding water or bleach to the household drainage system (aOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.28-2.18). Those with the highest eHEALS score displayed high adherence to the practice of wearing surgical masks (aOR 3.84, 95% CI 1.63-9.05), washing hands (aOR 4.14, 95% CI 2.46-6.96), social distancing (aOR 2.25, 95% CI 1.39-3.65), and adding water or bleach to the household drainage system (aOR 1.94, 95% CI 1.19-3.16), compared to those with the lowest eHEALS score.
   Conclusions: Chinese adults with a higher socioeconomic status had higher eHealth literacy and sought more web-based information on COVID-19; both these factors were associated with a high adherence to the guidelines for preventive behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Purpose - During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has raised an important question of whether government efforts (GEFs), especially communication work, could prevent the outbreak of this pandemic by enhancing public trust and public compliance with the government. This research answers this question by focusing on the case of Vietnam, a low-resource country that gained some achievements during the first pandemic year 2020. In particular, this study aims to investigate the relationship between GEF, public trust and public compliance during the country's first nationwide social distancing.
   Design/methodology/approach - The structural equation modelling is used to analyse data collected from 467 respondents in Vietnam during the nationwide social distancing in 2020.
   Findings - Perceived GEF is positively associated with public compliance with the government directly and indirectly through the mediating role of public trust in government (PTG). The empirical results also reveal the effectiveness of government communication work, one among the government's great efforts, during the COVID-19 pandemic, in terms of intensity and diversity in communication and information channels.
   Practical implications - During a pandemic, the governments must enhance public compliance with public health measures to implement the anti-epidemic missions effectively. Therefore, it is important to raise public perception of GEF and PTG. The study's findings highlight that governments in developing countries should implement relevant responses and policies for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and future public health crises, especially in the context that effective vaccines are unavailable or insufficient.
   Originality/value - To the best of the authors' knowledge, this research is among the first attempts that examine the role of GEF, especially public health communication work, in raising public compliance directly and indirectly through the mediating role of public trust. The study carries some important messages for containing a public health crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - In advertising of caffeinated energy drinks, there appears to be a consistent emphasis reinforcing masculine identification. Greater tolerance of social pain in a situation of exclusion is a characteristic particularly identified with masculinity. In this study, we tested the priming effect of an energy drink on men's social pain tolerance in the situation of experiencing social exclusion in Cyberball, a virtual ball-tossing game. We recruited 93 men who were undergraduate students at a university in Taiwan to participate in an experimental study. Results showed that the men exposed to a popular caffeinated energy drink (Red Bull) tolerated being excluded from a greater number of throws in Cyberball than did those with a neutral prime or no prime. Induced conformity to masculine norms mediated the link between the energy drink prime and increased tolerance of social pain. These findings suggest that mere exposure to energy drinks may lead men to behave according to masculine norms in a seemingly unrelated domain.

AB  - Purpose: In recognition of the impact of chronic diseases on mental health and the lack of research on Asian American subgroups, the present study examined subjective perceptions of health as a potential mediator in the association between diabetes and depressive symptoms in Korean American older adults.
   Methods: Multivariate analysis with data from 672 Korean American older adults in Florida explored the mediation model of health perceptions.
   Results: The presence of diabetes was associated with negative perceptions of health and elevated symptoms of depression. The proposed mediation model was also supported: negative perceptions of health served as an intervening step between diabetes and depressive symptoms.
   Conclusions: The intervening role of health perceptions yields implications for developing health promotion interventions targeting older individuals with diabetes. Results suggest that even in the presence of chronic health conditions, mental well-being of older adults can be maintained by having optimistic beliefs and positive attitudes towards their own health.

AB  - Religious attitudes can have a strong influence on environmental beliefs and behavior, both positively and negatively. This work investigates opposing influences of religion of environmentalism through individual differences in Religious Fundamentalism and Spirituality. In two studies with U.S. samples (total N = 909), Spirituality predicted stronger belief in climate change, moralization of environmental actions, and behavioral intentions to conserve energy and reduce waste, while Religious Fundamentalism negatively predicted these same attitudes. Positive effects of Spirituality on environmental attitudes were partly mediated though trait compassion and moral foundations of harm and fairness. Negative effects of Fundamentalism were partly explained through differences in Right-Wing Authoritarianism. Together, opposing influences of Spirituality and Fundamentalism were better predictors of environmental concerns than general religiosity, and held when controlling for political attitudes. We conclude that religious environmentalism is best predicted through the combined effects of Spirituality and Fundamentalism as a function of underlying social-moral attitudes.

AB  - Consumers interpret their experiences with brands via narrative processing; thus the brand story has emerged as a major marketing construct. Transmedia storytelling occurs when the story elements are dispersed across multiple media, each making a unique contribution to the whole. As brand stories can create connections between the consumer and the brand, delivering transmedia brand stories may strengthen the bond, leading to positive attitudes, more entry points and higher purchase intent. Past research on brand stories has not addressed the types of brand stories that consumers know and desire to hear, and the media in which they prefer to find these stories. The present research answers these questions and positions the findings in the context of creating transmedia stories. Qualitative interviews revealed that consumers know and wish to hear stories about the brand's history, product reliability, philanthropy and users' personal stories. Other findings indicate that consumers with stronger brand connections prefer stories focused on the brand's experiential value and will access this through interactive media. Consumers with weaker brand attachments prefer stories about the utilitarian dimensions of the brand, told through more traditional media. Practical recommendations focus on creating consumer-brand connections through different types of stories and media.

AB  - Resilience - the ability to bounce back from hardship - is a concept that has become popular during the years of economic crisis and post-recession. Contemporary citizens are expected to be flexible, have a positive attitude and take care of themselves in a context of heightened inequality and precarity. The objective of this article is to analyze how citizens in post-recession Spain respond to media representations that prescribe these values. Eight focus groups were held with middle- and working-class men and women (a total of 62 participants) who discussed four short stories written by the researchers, which condensed the main concepts found in media narratives studied previously (including TV series, reality TV, advertisements, video games and celebrity culture). The results of our analysis show that participants tended to praise change and adaptability. The 'complacent citizen', who seeks security and refuses to adapt to the current precarious and unstable environments, emerges as a 'bad citizen', and security and stability are pathologized. There were differences between the middle- and working-class groups: while the former clearly adhered to the neoliberal discourse that sees flexibility and self-improvement as a moral obligation, the latter showed a more ambivalent response to these discourses.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to investigate the misconceptions Saudis hold regarding psychiatric disorders, people with such disorders, and psychiatric care. A cross sectional study was done in Saudi Arabia during 2019 using surveys, where 1,170 completed questionnaires were received, and data was analyzed using the chi 2 test to determine whether responses to certain questionnaire items varied with respondents' ages and genders. We selected p < 0.05 as our statistical significance threshold. We found that the prevalent misconceptions included beliefs that psychiatric care is expensive and that mental hospitals are old. The respondents' ages were not associated with the likelihood of believing that psychiatric care is expensive or that ill persons should be isolated from the public. However, we found that women were more likely than men to express definite opinions on certain statements on the questionnaire. Our findings suggest that stigmatization against persons with psychiatric disorders may not be a major factor preventing Saudis from seeking psychiatric care. Moreover, positive attitudes towards traditional methods and spiritual mediators were not as common as we had expected. We encourage future studies in Saudi Arabia about the approaches to treating psychiatric disorders and the need for psychiatric care and services awareness among the population.

AB  - This study utilized data from an ongoing randomized controlled trial to compare a culturally tailored video promoting positive attitudes toward mammography among Chinese immigrant women to a linguistically appropriate generic video and print media. Intervention development was guided by the Health Belief Model. Five hundred and ninety-two immigrant Chinese Americans from the metropolitan Washington, DC, and New York City areas completed telephone interviews before and after intervention. Changes in knowledge, Eastern views of health care (fatalism and self-care), health beliefs (perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits and barriers) and screening intentions were measured. Results showed that both videos improved screening knowledge, modified Eastern views of health care, reduced perceived barriers and increased screening intentions relative to print media (all P < 0.05). The generic video increased screening intention twice as much as the cultural video, although subgroup analysis showed the increase was only significant in women aged 50-64 years. Only Eastern views of health care were negatively associated with screening intentions after adjusting for all baseline covariates. These data suggest that a theoretically guided linguistically appropriate video that targets women from various ethnic groups is as efficacious in modifying attitudes toward mammography screening as a video that is exclusively tailored for Chinese immigrant women.

AB  - Aims: To determine whether the number of patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes has reduced during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: Numbers of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) activations, ST elevation myocardial infarctions (STEMIs) and non-ST elevation myocardial infarctions (NSTEMIs) in a large tertiary Greater London centre and a large district general hospital, both of which have on-site heart attack centres, were collected. We compared the number of PPCI activations, STEMI, NSTEMIs and all MIs prior to the COVID-19 era (January to third week of February 2020), after the start of some COVID-19 restrictions taking place (fourth week of February 2020) and after formal instruction by the United Kingdom Government that all citizens were to observe strict social distancing measures (20 March 2020). We further obtained data for the corresponding weekly figures from 2019.
   Results: The average weekly figure of all myocardial infarction in 2020, prior to the COVID-19 social distancing restrictions/awareness in the UK (beginning of January to third week of February), did not differ when compared with corresponding weeks in 2019 (23.3 +/- 5.4 in 2019 versus 21.13 +/- 3.5, p = 0.411).
   With increased media reporting and associated public awareness of the threat of COVID-19 (last week of February), there was a significant reduction in all myocardial infarction (27.1 +/- 4.7 in 2019 versus 15.9 +/- 3.6 in 2020, p < 0.001). Following official governmental instruction that mandated strict social distancing and the 'stay at home' campaign, the weekly figures of STEMI (15 +/- 3.5 in 2019 versus 10 +/- 4.4 in 2020, p = 0.013), NSTEMI (13 +/- 2.6 in 2019 versus 4.7 +/- 2.3 in 2020, p = 0.038) and all myocardial infarction (28 +/- 6.1 in 2019 versus 14.7 +/- 5.7 in 2020, p = 0.008) have remained significantly reduced.
   Conclusion: We have observed an unexpected major decline in presentations (and treatment) of the entire spectrum of acute coronary syndromes following the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and nationwide public-health measures that have promoted the importance of strict social distancing and self-quarantine.

AB  - The technological development of online product presentation modes (e.g., augmented reality, virtual reality) will greatly impact the future of e-retailing. The potential benefits of applying these new technologies for e-retailers need further investigation. Based upon the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) model, this study examines the effect of AR-based presentation modes on consumer patronage intention, with the mediating role of immersion, enjoyment, perceived product risk and attractiveness of the online store. Furthermore, it explores the moderating effect of technophilia that reflects consumers' positive attitude towards technology. A single factor between-subject experiment study was conducted with a sample of 420 university students. Results suggest that the serial indirect effects of AR presentation on patronage intention through immersion/enjoyment/perceived product risk and attractiveness of online store are conditional upon the level of technophilia. Technophilia is a critical factor that explains consumers' psychological and behavioral responses when they are using new technologies. The study provides new knowledge for e-marketing practitioners, as well as AR literature by indicating how and when new technology-based presentation works in evoking consumers' patronage intention.

AB  - Studies with contradictory results have been published on the relationship between personality and entrepreneurial intentions. This paper examines the role of personality traits and demographic factors in the formation of business start-up intention, using a moderated mediation model derived from the theory of planned behaviour. Data were collected from 324 final year MBA students using a structured survey instrument and analysed with single and multi-group structural equation modelling (SEM). Innovativeness, risk propensity and stress tolerance had small but significant indirect effects on entrepreneurial intentions; these effects were mediated by attitudes to entrepreneurship and perceived behavioural control. Need for autonomy and stress tolerance were not significant, neither was family background nor work experience. Observation of small, indirect personality effects suggests some resolution to the contradictory results observed until now; helps career counsellors and university selection panels to identify candidates with the potential to become entrepreneurs; and provides support for calls for policy makers and university administrators to develop educational environments and socio-political infrastructure that provides opportunities for students to exploit their creative and risk-taking traits and develop positive attitudes to entrepreneurship.

AB  - This study aimed at exploring South Yemeni EFL tertiary teachers' attitudes towards implementing ICTs in their English language teaching, their current uses of such ICTs in their teaching and difficulties they encounter when implementing ICTs in their teaching for the purpose of getting an overall picture of ICTs-assisted language instruction in South Yemeni context and what is required for implementing a better ICTs-assisted language instruction at the concerned universities. Data were collected through a questionnaire webbed to 81 EFL teachers (n=81) and then analyzed by SPSS. The questionnaire consists of five-Likert items and open questions. Findings revealed that EFL teachers of the concerned universities held positive attitudes towards using ICTs in their teaching of English and there were no significant differences in teachers' attitudes that can be attributed to gender, academic level or computer competence. They perceived ICTs as an effective tool in facilitating language teaching and learning, motivating students to learn and developing all language skills. However, their actual uses of such technologies in their classroom teaching were not up to the level required. A significant difference in teachers' actual uses of technology can be attributed to their computer competence as those teachers with a high computer competence were found using ICTs more than their low computer competence counterparts. The study concluded that South Yemeni teachers' lack of implementing ICTs in their EFL classes can be attributed to many factors such as lack of ICT tools in their departments, unavailability of internet and lack of computer competence and training. The study concluded with some recommendations that may help in implementing ICTs better in EFL education at the concerned universities particularly and at Yemeni universities generally.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aimed to examine the psycho-social aspects of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Pakistan. The study was conducted in Pakistan by using an online survey technique. The rationale to opt for this method was mainly based on the country's lock-down situations, social distancing and for the care of respondents.
   Design/methodology/approach - A total of 1,536 individuals participated from different parts of the country. An attitudinal scale was administered consisting of statements to measure (dis)agreement of the individuals facing the current situations of COVID-19. The ethical considerations and confidentiality of the respondents were opted by describing the purpose of research on the first page of the questionnaire.
   Findings - The study findings showed that the cost of personal protective equipment (PPE), social isolation and loss of intimacy have favourable positive effects on the psychological problems of individuals through the mediation of fake news and misinformation during COVID-19. Furthermore, the study findings were interpreted as per the effects of current situations of epidemic, i.e. COVID-19 on the psycho-social life of individuals.
   Research limitations/implications - This paper is purely limited to the quantitative approach including variables, i.e. COVID-19, risk of infection, social distancing, cost of PPE, social isolation, fake news and psychological problems.
   Practical implications - The present research will enhance the awareness and knowledge regarding psychological problems faced by the individuals during COVID-19. It will be a significant addition to the existing body of knowledge in the field of health and well-being. It will also provide guidelines to students, research scholars, policymakers and academicians to develop policies in future to improve the health of people during epidemics such as COVID-19 and similar nature of outbreak in the future.
   Originality/value - This paper focused on an important gap in the research on COVID-19 in the country in the context of COVID-19, risk of infection, social distancing, cost of PPE, social isolation, fake news and psychological problems.

AB  - Public Policy Relevance Statement The present study sheds light on how social media engagement was associated with different indicators of well-being in India during COVID-19-imposed social distancing mandates. The study also suggests that some of these outcomes may be related to social media users' dispositions, namely, social comparison orientation, sense of loneliness, and their perceived social support.
   As the people around the globe suffered physically, relationally, emotionally, and financially in response to the COVID-19 crisis and accompanying social distancing mandates, they often turned to social media to cope. This study used an online survey to understand the relationships between social media engagement, loneliness, well-being, perceived social support, and social comparison with an Indian sample (N = 364). Correlations showed significant associations between all variables of interest, with the exception of social media engagement and perceived social support. Partial correlations revealed that an association between social media engagement and loneliness disappeared when social comparison orientation was controlled for; however, an inverse relationship between social media engagement and well-being remained, even when social comparison orientation was accounted for.

AB  - COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease of 2019) is caused by SARS-CoV2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) and it was first diagnosed in December 2019 in China. As of 25th Aug 2021, there are 165 million confirmed COVID-19 positive cases and 4.4 million deaths globally. As of today, though there are approved COVID-19 vaccine candidates only 4 billion doses have been administered. Until 100% of the population is safe, no one is safe. Even though these vaccines can provide protection against getting seriously ill and dying from the disease, it does not provide 100% protection from getting infected and passing it on to others. The more the virus spreads; it has more opportunity to mutate. So, it is mandatory to follow all precautions like maintaining social distance, wearing mask, washing hands frequently irrespective of whether a person is vaccinated or not. To prevent spread of the virus, contact tracing based on social distance also becomes equally important. The work proposes a solution that can help with contact tracing/identification, knowing the infected persons recent travel history (even within the city) for few days before being assessed positive. While the person would be able to give the known contacts with whom he/she has interacted with, he/she will not be aware of who all were in proximity if he/she had been in public places. The proposed solution is to get the CCTV (Closed-Circuit Television) video clips from those public places for the specific date and time and identify the people who were in proximity-i.e., not followed the safe distance to the infected person. The approach uses YOLO V3 (You Only Look Once) which uses darknet framework for people detection. Once the infected person is located from the video frames, the distance from that person to the other people in the frame is found, to check if there is a violation of social distance guideline. If there is, then the people violating the distance are extracted and identified using Facial detection and recognition algorithms. Two different solutions for Face detection and Recognition are implemented and results compared-Dlib based models and OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) based models. The solutions were studied for two different CCTV footages and the results for Dlib based models were better than OpenCV based models for the studied videos.

AB  - Celebrity endorsement has become ubiquitous in international destination marketing, but studies have rarely assessed the differences between the effects of endorsement by a local celebrity vs. a celebrity from tourist source countries (source celebrity). To bridge the literature gap, this paper draws on meaning transfer theory and match-up hypothesis to examine the effectiveness of these two types of celebrity endorsement by exploring the underlying mechanism. By carrying out a pretest and three experiments, the eye-tracking results and lab experiments show that international destination marketing involving a source celebrity (vs. local celebrity) can significantly increase tourists' visual attention to the advertising destination scenery, positive attitudes toward the destination and intentions to visit. Furthermore, a serial mediation model of celebrity endorsement -* celebrity-tourist congruency -* tourist attitude toward celebrity -* tourist response is also identified. Finally, this paper empirically examines the moderating role of regulatory focus on the celebrity endorsement effect.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to conceptualize the sustainability of local videos development, their integration in the EFL classroom, and their impact on students' learning outcomes. The research aims as well to assess the impact of the videos on learners' English language skills achievement and individual difference factors. We recruited a random sample of 100 and 76 students learning different levels of English in our English institute through an online survey. A cross-sectional study of perceived English language skill achievement and individual difference factors such as motivation, attitude, and cultural awareness was carried out. A combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches was used for data collection and analysis. Our conceptual framework showed that the sustainability of the local video production and its integration in the EFL classroom depends on the university's funding policy, which is subjected to the positive impact of the videos on students' learning outcomes. Also, the obtained results revealed that the videos fostered learners' English language skills as well as their motivation to learn the language, positive attitudes toward its integration, and local cultural awareness. This work contributes to existing knowledge of sustainable local curriculum development by providing the first empirical evidence on the positive impact of sustainable local videos as an instructional material on students' learning outcomes.

AB  - Perspective taking techniques have been used to transport people into imaginary situations and the lives of others. Virtual Reality provides an immersive way to virtually experience the lives of stigmatized by society members. Through the support of sensorimotor contingencies, people can use natural movements to view and interact with the virtual world around them. In this study, we compared a perspective-taking immersive Virtual Reality system which supports a number of sensorimotor contingencies (SC group) with a perspective-taking desktop system of the same application but without support of any sensorimotor contingencies (NSC group), to investigate the effect of the supported sensorimotor contingencies in promoting empathy and positive attitudes toward drug users. Results demonstrate a strong correlation between closeness to the drug user and empathy in the SC group. In both groups there were a within group significant change in their reported attitudes before and after their exposure. Finally, participants in the SC condition reported significantly higher levels of Place Illusion (PI), body ownership, agency and plausibility of people. Further research is needed to investigate how sensorimotor contingencies can be exploited to the fullest to be used as an effective method to induce empathy and change attitudes toward stigmatized by society people.

AB  - Past research has shown repeatedly that people prefer donating to a single identified human victim rather than to unidentified or abstract donation targets. In the current research we show results countering the identifiable victim effect, wherein people prefer to donate to charitable organizations rather than to an identifiable victim. In a series of five studies, we manipulate temporal and social distance, examine a variety of donation targets, and measure intention to donate time or money as well as actual donations of money. We show that people are more willing to donate to a charitable organization when they are temporally or socially distant from the population in need. Willingness to donate to a specific person in need is higher when donors are temporally or socially close to the donation target. Furthermore, we demonstrate that (a) empathy mediates donations to a single victim, yet does not mediate donations to charitable organizations; (b) that donation giving to charitable organizations is unique and is not similar to donations to a group of victims. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of Society for Consumer Psychology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the importance of examining how adolescents and young adults contribute solutions to society's pressing problems, gaps in the literature leave unanswered the question of how young people become politically engaged. Research suggests that youth learn to be political by forming attachments to their communities and accessing opportunities in the settings of their everyday lives. Settings operate as mini-polities through which youth develop a sense of what it means to be a member of a collective. Meaningful opportunities to practice political skills and behaviors can be fostered in schools and communities, via social media, and through policy change. Historic events, particularly elections, can also influence political attitudes and behaviors in lasting ways. Cultural and contextual variability in experiences, access to opportunities, and reactions to historic events shape youth's political developmental pathways. Research that is developmentally and culturally informed and that uses rigorous study designs can identify more effectively what determines the formation and growth of youth political engagement.

AB  - Positionality statements, or statements acknowledging relevant background, context, and situatedness of researcher positions and identities are widely used in qualitative research. In recent years, public claims of insider status have been contested by the communities in question, often popularized in mainstream media. This article explores the complexities and factors that influence the way researchers think about their own positionality in relation to their participants, using written reflections on race and positional dynamics, as well as relevant literature. Through this article, I explore these complexities and the underlying motivations that compel me to present my location, identity, or positionality in particular ways. These reflections are valuable for provoking critical reflection about the way we interpret our own identities in relation to one another, and the reasons we may do so.

AB  - BackgroundThe covid-19 pandemic has impacted the health and well-being of millions across the globe. Strict social distancing policies and periodic lockdowns has led to an increased reliance on alternative online means of communication, including social media. Objectivesto examine (i) social media use and mental health in the general population 9 months after the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and (ii) mental health in relation to motives for and extent of social media use, while adjusting for sociodemographic variables. MethodsA cross-national online survey was conducted in Norway, UK, USA and Australia. Participants (n = 3,474) reported extent of and motives for social media use and completed the 12-item General Health Questionnaire. The data were analyzed by chi-square tests, one-way analyses of variance, and multiple linear regression analysis. ResultsPoorer mental health was associated with using social media to decrease loneliness and for entertainment motives, while better mental health was associated with using social media for personal contact and maintaining relationships. Overall increased daily time on social media was associated with poorer mental health. The social media use variables were responsible for a substantial proportion of the outcome variance explained. These findings were consistent across the four countries, with only minor variations. ConclusionsMotives for using, and time spent using, social media were associated with the participants' mental health. Guidance and recommendations for social media usage to the general public for prevention and intervention for behavioral health may be beneficial.

AB  - By triangulating analyses of content and reception with a focus on production, this article attempts to understand the dynamics of and underlying reasons for the media stigmatisation of place. The research described contributes to a body of work examining how mass media and other social forces factor in the creation of negative stereotypes that damage the reputations of the places in which the poor reside. The overarching framework of understanding, provided by Goffman's theory of stigma, is complemented by two further inter-related theoretical approaches, namely Social Exclusion and Political Economy. Combining analyses of media production (practices), media content (discourses) and audience reception (beliefs, attitudes), we analyse the representation of one of Ireland's most deprived public housing estates in the print and broadcast media. Having established the stigmatising character and impact of national and local media content via this tripartite methodology, we focus on identifying and explaining the media practices that serve to (re) produce the estate's 'spoiled identity'. Our analysis of journalists' explanations for these practices identifies the commercial realities, which progressively influence media production, as directly impacting media producers' relationships with, and depictions of, poor places. We conclude by examining debates regarding the potential for rehabilitating a spoiled identity.

AB  - Many adolescents are heavily engaged with social media and text messaging (George & Odgers, 2015; Lenhart, 2015), yet few psychologists have studied what digital communication means for adolescents' relationships and adjustment. This article proposes that psychologists should embrace the careful study of adolescents' digital communication. We discuss theoretical frameworks for understanding adolescents' involvement with social media, present less widely recognized perils of intense involvement with social media, and highlight positive features of digital communication. Coconstruction theory suggests that adolescents help to create the content of digital communication that shapes their lives, and that there may be strong continuity between adolescents' offline and online lives (Subrahmanyam, Smahel, & Greenfield, 2006). However, psychological theories and research methods could further illuminate the power and the pain of adolescents' digital communication. Psychologists need to understand more about subtle but potentially serious risks that adolescents might face: The agony of victimization by even a single episode of cyberbullying and the pain of social exclusion and comparison resulting from vast amounts of time reading large social media feeds and seeing friends doing things without you and comparing your inner emotional experience to everyone else's highly groomed depictions of their seemingly marvelous lives. If we seek to understand developmental psychopathology and to help youth at risk, psychologists need to embrace careful study of the content of adolescents' online communication, parents need to talk with their children about their own online experiences and become familiar with social media themselves, and clinicians need to address adolescents' online social lives in prevention and treatment programs.

AB  - This paper proposes the use of OSHW to successfully penetrate the Internet of Things (IoT) market by using a social platform with a new interdisciplinary perspective rather than through the use of existing technical approaches. Snowball sampling was used in this study to survey 300 people who work and have had experiences with online brand communities for open source hardware (OSHW) at Fab Lab Seoul. The findings of this study indicate that content, consumer support, user interface, and reward are among the five factors that trigger an online brand community to develop a social OSHW platform. However, this study also found that brand reputation was insignificant relative to activating a social media platform for open-source software. In addition, activating a social platform for OSHW can positively affect to the brand community's loyalty for OSHW, which means that social platform innovation for OSHW can help form the positive attitude necessary to develop and diffuse an OSHW culture in a rapidly changing ICT ecosystem. This can be an important strategy for OSHW business and can contribute to the growth of the IoT market in South Korea. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Over the past 20 years, the leaders of Israel's ultra-Orthodox (haredi) community carried out an intensive campaign against the diffusion of mobile phones in their enclave society. It included a variety of resistance strategies that escalated in parallel to the consistent increase in mobile phone penetration into the community. If at first the "cellphone danger" was contained by the successful "kosherphone," a new threat appeared in the form of the smartphone. In this article we explore the severe rabbinic sanctions directed against those who deviate from the communal norm by using a smartphone. We analyze the general "lawfare" strategy of social distancing they adopted, and offer a close reading of the specific religious-law decrees, interpreting them through the historical and legal lens of halakhah (Jewish law). This socio-legal analysis constructs the way haredi leadership understands the role of the smartphone in two contexts. One is the rapidly changing contemporary media environment; the other is the social dynamic affecting this island community, as it encounters the surrounding national and global culture through digital media. The article concludes with a preliminary analysis of the implications of the Corona pandemic on the campaign against the smartphone.

AB  - Aim: This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of security and safety workers toward the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between April and July 2020 using a self-developed structured questionnaire that was randomly distributed online among security and safety employees in government or private sectors.
   Results: Among the 712 participants, 53.9% were female and the respondents' mean age was 39.43 years. Television was chosen as the most reliable source of information by 75.0% of the participants. Most of the respondents had a sufficient knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic, as the majority of them answered the knowledge questions correctly. The significant predictors for their knowledge were their educational level, age, marital status, parenthood status, and employment sector (private or government). Our study revealed an overall 98.6% positive attitude of safety and security workers toward COVID-19. Majority of the respondents were following good and safe COVID-19 prevention practices.
   Conclusion: High level of knowledge was reflected in both the attitude and practice of the participants toward the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Recognizing the right opportunities is a key capability in the entrepreneurial process, and creative entrepreneurs' well-being at work can strengthen their inherent motivation to absorb external knowledge for desirable outcomes. Well-being at work is pleasant judgments of positive attitudes or pleasant experiences, but previous research mainly regarded well-being as an outcome variable. Therefore, this study considers the role of well-being as a mediator conceptualized in physical, psychological, and social well-being dimensions in the opportunity recognition process. Based upon the self-determination theory, this study examines how creative entrepreneurs' motivation, including creative thinking, self-efficacy, and relatedness, influences their well-being and further affects opportunity recognition. Results from a sample of 234 creative entrepreneurs in Taiwan show that well-being positively mediates the effect of relatedness on opportunity recognition capabilities and absorptive capacity. Moreover, creative thinking and self-efficacy are associated with relatedness, and further with well-being. The key findings suggest that well-being plays a critical role to stimulate motivation for further capability building. This study extends the self-determination theory by linking entrepreneurial motivation with well-being in the entrepreneurial opportunity seeking process.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to develop an instrument that measures health care professionals' (HCPs) attitudes to breastfeeding and skin-to-skin contact in relation to the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative for neonatal intensive care.
   Design: The study was part of a larger project aiming to revive the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding for both full-term and preterm infants. The study had a pre-test/post-test design using online questionnaires distributed by email before and after a training programme.
   Setting and participants: A total of 70 specialist registered nurses, registered nurses, assistant nurses and physicians working at a Swedish neonatal intensive care unit answered 55 breastfeeding attitudes questions online before the training. The Preterm Breastfeeding Attitudes Instrument (PreBAI) consists of twelve of these 55 items/questions, selected using exploratory factor analysis.
   Measurements and findings: Higher scores indicated more positive attitudes and the median total PreBAI score was 42 points (out of 48), on both the preand the post-test questionnaires, showing no significant difference. In the pre-test questionnaire, the majority of HCPs (84%) stated that they needed further breastfeeding training. They also stated that they perceived breastfeeding as very important, scoring a median of 10 (range 5-10) points on a 10-point scale. Three separate underlying dimensions were identified in the questionnaire, indicating different attitudes: Facilitating (five items), Regulating (four items), and Breastfeedingand skin-to-skin contact-friendly (three items). A positive correlation was found between how many years the HCPs had worked in neonatal care, and their PreBAI score (r(s) = 0.383, p = 0.001). Those who had previously received extra breastfeeding education scored higher on the instrument.
   Key conclusions and implications for practice: Neonatal intensive care units need to increase their efforts to support breastfeeding. An important factor for mothers when establishing breastfeeding is support from well-trained professionals with a positive attitude to breastfeeding. The PreBAI could be a useful tool for identifying attitudes among HCPs before and after attending a breastfeeding training programme.

AB  - Aim: This study measured the level of knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 prevention and examined associated factors among patients at a national tertiary general hospital in Vietnam.
   Methods: Adult patients admitted to University Medical Center during research period were recruited in a cross-sectional study, which employed a convenience sampling method with a 4-component questionnaire in order to examine the patients' consciousness towards COVID-19 spreading prevention based on four aspects: demographic characteristics (10 items), knowledge (14 items), attitudes (6 items), and practices (7 items).
   Results: The study involved 2769 respondents (18-90 years) with the mean age of 38.05 +/- 13.91 years. About two thirds of the respondents obtained diploma degree or higher (63.4%) and shared their living space with others (64.4%). The majority of patients settled in urban area (74.9%). All participants stayed informed about COVID-19, with the most commonly used channels like television (75.2%), the Internet (72.2%) and phone (69.8%). The vast majority showed sufficient knowledge (93.7%) and positive attitudes (76.3%). Just over half of participants remained good practiced of COVID-19 prevention (57.7%). On average, the factors of younger age, higher educational level, frequency and department of admission, and the number of COVID-19 informative channels were significantly associated with sufficient knowledge, positive attitudes, and good practices regarding preventive action against COVID-19 spreading. The optimistic attitude and having more undergoing chronic diseases were associated with the likelihood of well-practiced COVID-19 preventive measures (OR 3.63, 95% CI 1.54-8.55, p=0.003 and OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.78-0.98, p=0.02, respectively).
   Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrated that the likelihood of good preventive practices in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic was influenced by attitudes and several sociodemographic factors. More drastic interventions for the prevention of COVID-19 should be widely furnished and equipped in hospitals, through various routes to maximize the efficiency and adherence to prevention practices.

AB  - Victims of childhood trauma report shame and anticipation of stigma, leading to non-disclosure and avoidance of help. Stigma is potentially aggravating the mental health consequences of childhood trauma. So far there is no comprehensive study examining stigma toward adult survivors of various forms of childhood trauma, and it is unclear whether stigma interferes with reaching out to affected individuals. In a vignette study based on a representative sample of the German general population (N = 1320; 47.7% male) we randomly allocated participants to brief case vignettes pertaining to past childhood sexual/physical abuse or accidents, and adult physical abuse. Stigma was elicited by applying the Social Distance Scale, assessing respondents' attitudes/stereotypes toward the persons in the vignette and their reluctance to address the specific trauma in conversation. While one aim was to establish the prevalence of stigma toward persons with CT, we hypothesized that attitudes differ according to type of trauma. Of the respondents, 45% indicated they were unlikely to reach out to a victim of childhood sexual abuse, 38% to a victim of childhood physical abuse, 31% to someone reporting a childhood accident and 25% to someone reporting adult physical abuse. Contrary to our expectations, childhood sexual abuse did not consistently elicit more stigma than childhood physical abuse in Krukall-Wallis tests. Equally, childhood interpersonal trauma did not consistently elicit more stigma than childhood accidental trauma. Structural equation modeling revealed social distance as mediator of the relationship between negative stereotypes and reluctance to address childhood trauma in conversation. Our analyses further revealed an ambiguous role of negative stereotypes in addressing childhood trauma in conversation with trauma victims, which has yet to be examined. There is evidence for stigma associated with having survived childhood trauma, which is interfering with offering help.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 virus first emerged in late 2019 and has since spread quickly throughout China and become a global pandemic. As the situation with COVID-19 has evolved, wearing a face mask in public has grown commonplace. Using the technology acceptance model (TAM) as a foundation, this study introduces three new variables, namely, perceived risk, social pressure, and social image, to establish an extended model for investigating the factors that influence if residents wear masks. A total of 1200 questionnaires were distributed in China, from 1 February to 30 May 2020, through China's largest online platform. The results indicate the following: 1. Residents' positive attitude towards mask wearing promotes their behavioral intention to wear masks. 2. Perceived risk, social pressure, and social image have a positive impact on attitude towards mask wearing. 3. The intention to wear masks and attitude were both positively influenced by perceived usefulness. 4. The perceived usefulness is more influential in rural than urban groups, in terms of behavioral intention. This article proposes that public education on the facts related to the coronavirus, the threats posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to health, and the usefulness of face masks in preventing the transmission of COVID-19 could increase residents' intention to wear a mask.

AB  - The new media data interaction system has profound influences on the teaching efficiency of vocational education. Therefore, its effects on the teaching efficiency of vocational education were analyzed in this study. The analysis was carried out from the perspective of the satisfaction of students with the application of the new media data interaction system in their vocational education and teaching practices. According to scale statistics and the multi-grade fuzzy satisfaction calculation model, results reveal that students are relatively satisfied with the services provided by the new media data interaction system and its effects on teaching efficiency, thereby indicating that such teaching mode can lead to good teaching efficiency. These students also have relatively positive attitudes toward teaching activities based on the new media data interaction system, and this teaching mode can improve their academic performance in vocational education, hence achieving good teaching efficiency. Students of classes that use the new media data interaction system also report higher learning efficiency compared with those students in classes that do not use this system.

AB  - Many businesses across sectors are using extended reality technologies to enhance the consumer experience. In the restaurant industry, digital technologies are gaining growing interest among restaurateurs to improve customers' dining experiences and thus their overall food well-being. In this research, we conduct an exploratory analysis using a qualitative multi-method approach to examine whether augmented reality (AR) technology contributes positively or otherwise to a customer's dining experience. We do so through a case study, namely Le Petit Chef AR dining experience. Our findings suggest that AR can influence positively or negatively consumers' perceptions of their restaurant experiences according to five dimensions, namely sensory dimensions (the five senses' intensity), the affective dimension (pleasantness), and behavioral, social, and intellectual dimensions. These dimensions can improve the customer's experience and be managed by restaurateurs to enhance positive attitudes toward AR in the restaurant industry. Furthermore, the results revealed that AR plays an essential role in terms of improving the overall food well-being of consumers and thus can lead to positive post-consumption behaviors. This study also identifies the factors that allow service providers to understand the psychology behind adopting or rejecting technology innovation in the servicescape.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is growing - as can be clearly observed not only from the rising recognition of assistance tools such as Siri (Apple) but also from the newly introduced Google Voiced Translator. Yet, some crucial benchmarks still have to be supplied before it can act as a proxy for a real instructor: imagination, creativity, and spontaneity. Automated assessment containing the use of AI is one of the recent education practices. It accelerates the time for exam grading, eliminates human prejudice, and is as precise as human assessors. However, it has encountered many criticisms in education community, in our case, English as foreign language (EFL) learning community. Therefore, this phenomenological inquiry examined Turkish EFL students' and instructors' conceptions on the Versant English Test (VET), an automated test of spoken and written language functioning by means of an AI software. Using semi-structured interview questions and a focus-group discussion, the study adopted a qualitative research design in order to collect the required data. The findings show that EFL university students developed negative attitudes towards VET and that VET is not a reliable and valid test because same questions were observed to have appeared in the computer-based test. In addition, copying and pasting similar sentences produced better results, which decreased the validity and reliability of the test. Another important finding was that the test was reported to have measured only their memory skills but not their language skills. Besides, the curriculum was totally incongruent with the content of the test, which caused a severe washback in EFL learners.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the impact of learning materials developed with augmented reality (AR) technology on middle school students' achievement and attitudes towards the course, and to determine their attitudes towards AR applications. In this study, a quasi-experimental design was used in which intact classrooms at two different schools, consisting of a total of one hundred 7th grade middle school students, were randomly assigned to either the experimental or control group. The experimental group completed the "Solar System and Beyond" module of their science course using AR technology, while the control group completed the same module using traditional methods and textbooks. Students in the experimental group were found to have higher levels of achievement and more positive attitudes towards the course than those in the control group. In addition, the results revealed that the students were pleased and wanted to continue using AR applications in the future. They also showed no signs of anxiety when using AR applications. In addition, it was found that academic achievements and attitudes of the students in the experimental group showed a positive, significant and intermediate correlation.

AB  - China has recently put forth an ambitious plan to achieve carbon peak around 2030 and carbon neutrality around 2060. However, there are quite a few differences regarding the public views about China's carbon policy between the Chinese people and the people from other countries, especially concerning the doubt of foreign people about the fidelity of China's carbon policy goals. Based on Twitter data related to China's carbon policy topics from 2008 to 2020, this study shows the inter- and intra-annual trends in the count of tweets about China's carbon policy, conducts sentiment analysis, extracts top frequency words from different attitudes, and analyzes the impact of China's official Twitter accounts on the global view of China's carbon policy. Our results show: (1) the global attention to China's carbon policy gradually rises and occasionally rises suddenly due to important carbon events; (2) the proportion of Twitter users with negative sentiment about China's carbon policy has increased rapidly and has exceeded the proportion of Twitter users with positive sentiment since 2019; (3) people in developing countries hold more positive or neutral attitudes towards China's carbon policy, while developed countries hold more negative attitudes; (4) China's official Twitter accounts serve to improve the global views on China's carbon policy.

AB  - This paper analyses the factors influencing consumer-perceived risks of genetically modified (GM) food by using a structural equation model and survey data of urban residents in China. The sample is divided into the acquainted and unacquainted groups according to consumers' objective knowledge level. An integrated analytical framework is developed. The results show that consumers' positive attitude towards GM technology has a significant negative effect on consumer-perceived risks and that more information reaching consumers significantly reduces consumer-perceived risks of GM food only for the unacquainted group. Consumers' trust in government, biotechnology scientists, press media and food companies does not significantly influence consumer-perceived risks of GM food. This is likely because consumers have low trust in the abovementioned stakeholders of GM food. Consumers think that the information reaching them is limited and does not clearly show the advantages and disadvantages of GM food. Consumers' objective knowledge of GM food is also limited. The health risks of GM food are of high concern for both consumer groups. These findings imply that the commercialization of GM crops in China is dependent on providing consumers with adequate and understandable information about GM food and strict supervision measures for food safety.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the protective processes for depressed mood and anger among sexually abused adolescents. A cross-sectional anonymous self-report national survey was conducted including 9113 16-19-year-old students attending all upper secondary schools in Iceland in 2004. Correlations and multiple linear regression models were carried out to test for main, interaction and mediating effects. The results showed that parental support, positive attitudes towards school and sport participation negatively predicted depressed mood and anger (main effects). Self-esteem however, turned out to be a stronger negative predictor of depressed mood and anger for sexually abused adolescents than for non-abused adolescents (interaction effect). Finally, self-esteem mediated the effects of parental support, attitudes towards school and sport participation on depressed mood and anger. These results underscore the specific importance of self-esteem when predicting depressed mood and anger among sexually abused adolescents. They also indicate that parental support, attitudes towards school and sport participation are important predictors of these emotional problems, both directly and indirectly through their effects on self-esteem.

AB  - Advances in molecular technologies have the potential to help remedy health inequities through earlier detection and prevention; if, however, their delivery and uptake (and therefore any benefits associated with such testing) are not more carefully considered, there is a very real risk that existing inequities in access and use will be further exacerbated. We argue this risk relates to the way that information and knowledge about the technology is both acquired and shared, or not, between health practitioners and their patients.
   A healthcare system can be viewed as a complex social network comprising individuals with different worldviews, hierarchies, professional cultures and subcultures and personal beliefs, both for those giving and receiving care. When healthcare practitioners are not perceived as knowledge equals, they would experience informational prejudices, and the result is that knowledge dissemination across and between them would be impeded. The uptake and delivery of a new technology may be inequitable as a result. Patients would also experience informational prejudice when they are viewed as not being able to understand the information that is presented to them, and information may be withheld.
   Informational prejudices driven by social relations and structures have thus far been underexplored in considering (in)equitable implementation and uptake of new molecular technologies. Every healthcare interaction represents an opportunity for experiencing informational prejudice, and with it the risk of being inappropriately informed for undertaking (or offering) such screening or testing. Making knowledge acquisition and information dissemination, and experiences of informational prejudice, explicit through sociologically framed investigations would extend our understandings of (in)equity, and offer ways to affect network relationships and structures that support equity in delivery and uptake.

AB  - Objective This study aims to examine the association of quality of life (QOL) with life satisfaction, subjective norms, general health, optimism, and attitude among university students. Participants Respondents include 632 university students (M-age=21.36, SD = 2.86). Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted on university students in Torbat Heydariyeh, Iran. Several statistical models were tested, including hierarchical regression and path analysis, to examine the direct or indirect association between a set of important variables. Results According to the results of path analysis, constructs of subjective norms, general health, positive attitude, optimism, and life satisfaction were significant predictors of students' QOL. Compared with other constructs, general health status (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.548) and life satisfaction (p < 0.001, R2 = 0.253) showed the strongest association with QOL. Conclusions The results indicate that efforts to improve life satisfaction by targeting general health, subjective norms, optimism, and attitudes may provide promising ways to improve QOL.

AB  - The authors' aim is to analyze the degree of openness to different religious convictions among students of Department of Music, Faculty of Arts in Nis, and also to test whether these students have an active attitude on overcoming religious prejudice. The research was initiated due to the fact that during their education, through various teaching activities (playing, singing, conducting, composition, listening to music and its analysis) students become familiar with religious, spiritual, and church music, as a constituent part of different religions. The assumption is that precisely through music as one of the most universal media of artistic communication students can establish and develop a positive attitude to religious differences. Research results show that students are aware of various religious convictions and affiliations, but they do not show enough sensitivity to respecting differences, and they do not take part in the struggle against prejudices that accompany those differences.

AB  - Online contexts are becoming a widely available space to disseminate health information and target specific populations for health campaigns. Limited evidence for health message engagement in these contexts exists. This study draws on the elaboration likelihood model and construal-level theory to predict processing time and recall when individuals are presented with messages for or against electronic cigarette use from socially close or distant sources. Participants (N = 159) were shown messages about electronic cigarettes, designed to look like tweets, from socially close and socially distant message senders. Processing times were highest for pro-attitudinal messages while messages from socially close sources were more likely to be recalled, and furthering social distance increased the difference in processing times for pro- and counter-attitudinal messages. We demonstrate the applicability of behavioral measures in online studies, while finding that attitudes, social distance, and their interaction affect measures of message processing. These findings suggest further exploration may be needed to differentiate between processing time and counterarguing. From our findings, we offer applied practitioners guidance on how to develop messages that target audiences will spend more time considering and are more likely to remember.

AB  - The current study examined social media content from celebrity influencers during the early stages of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Given the inchoate governmental and media response to the crisis, this paper argues for the importance of celebrity influencer voices. This study utilized a constant comparative method to analyze Instagram posts from 20 celebrity influencers over a two-month period. Findings suggest celebrities demonstrated and normalized the practice of "staying home," whereby the public used social distancing to mitigate the virus spread. Celebrity influencers also demonstrated "we're all in this together" by using their platforms to call for action.

AB  - Ambient media evoke surprise with the aim of gaining the attention of consumers who are overexposed to traditional types of advertising. No study has yet considered the effects of unanticipated ambient media. To bridge this gap, the present article reports a field experiment entailing the manipulation of three types of ambient media that create different levels of surprise. The analysis combines observation data for 2,464 passersby, survey data from 305 respondents, and sales figures for 730 days. The results show that surprising ambient media draw attention, promote positive attitudes toward the ad, and stimulate word of mouth. Most importantly, ambient media increase purchase intention and sales revenue. Robustness checks ensure that the model is stable across several conditions, such as time of day or weather conditions. Follow-up studies further reveal that surprise elicits positive effects via two processes; the amplification of accompanying evaluations and the interplay of attention and incongruence resolution. The paper provides guidance for retailers wishing to design surprising ambient media that improve consumer attitudes and profitability. (C) 2013 New York University. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The coronavirus COVID-19 and the global pandemic has already had a substantial disruptive impact on society, posing major challenges to the provision of mental health services in a time of crisis, and carrying the spectre of an increased burden to mental health, both in terms of existing psychiatric disorder, and emerging psychological distress from the pandemic. In this paper we provide a framework for understanding the key challenges for psychologically informed mental health care during and beyond the pandemic. We identify three groups that can benefit from psychological approaches to mental health, and/or interventions relating to COVID-19. These are (i) healthcare workers engaged in frontline response to the pandemic and their patients; (ii) individuals who will experience the emergence of new mental health distress as a function of being diagnosed with COVID-19, or losing family and loved ones to the illness, or the psychological effects of prolonged social distancing; and (iii) individuals with existing mental health conditions who are either diagnosed with COVID-19 or whose experience of social distancing exacerbates existing vulnerabilities. Drawing on existing literature and our own experience of adapting treatments to the crisis we suggest a number of salient points to consider in identifying risks and offering support to all three groups. We also offer a number of practical and technical considerations for working psychotherapeutically with existing patients where COVID-19 restrictions have forced a move to online or technologically mediated delivery of psychological interventions.

AB  - A meta-analysis of the literature examining the outcomes related to feelings of sex guilt was conducted. The analysis demonstrates gendered differences in the experience of sex guilt and myriad attitudinal and behavioral impacts. Specifically, men report lower levels of sex guilt, r = -.227 than do women and implications of sex guilt experience are vast, including its association with engagement in less sexual activity, r = -.337, less favorable attitudes toward sex and lessened use of contraceptives, r = -.276, reduced reports of sexual arousal in response to an explicitly sexual media content, r = -.308, less positive emotional response to sexually explicit media content, r = -.367, reduced level of sexual information accuracy, r = -.324, and less positive attitudes toward sexual behavior, r = -404. Sex guilt is positively related to level of religiosity/religious behavior, r = .439. The findings suggest that sex guilt provides a consistent set of responses to sexual information and media content as well as a motivational basis for behavior. These outcomes are further explicated and discussed.

AB  - This study investigated the associations among reading strategy instruction, student motivational factors (i.e., attitudes toward reading, reading self-concept, and motivation to read), gender, and reading achievement. The analyses were conducted using the Hong Kong sample (students at Level 1, n = 3,875 and teachers at Level 2, n = 133) from the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study 2011 through multilevel structural equation modeling. The results showed that, first, the relation between the frequency of reading strategy instruction and student reading achievement was mediated by student attitudes toward reading. Second, the frequency of reading strategy instruction was significantly related to student attitudes toward reading and motivation to read and student attitudes toward reading was significantly associated with reading achievement. Finally, girls had more positive attitudes toward reading, more positive reading self-concept, higher motivation to read, and higher reading achievement than boys. These findings may shed light on how teachers should arrange their reading strategy instruction to interplay with student attitudes toward reading and motivation to read and to help improve reading achievement.

AB  - Visual sensing image technology has narrowed the distance between people and art with the rapid development of digital media, but new art forms continue to appear. Therefore, this exploration is aimed at studying the application of visual image technology based on user interface (UI) and virtual reality (VR) technology in art. This exploration is to explore the development path of digital media art. The concept of UI is briefly discussed. Based on the current means of visual sensing technology, UI, visual sensing image technology, and digital media art are successfully combined after the close relationship between digital media and art is realized. The results show that VR technology, which combines UI and visual sensing technology, has good compatibility with digital media art and can further shorten the distance between digital media art and the public. Moreover, the promotion of this application can greatly increase users' experience of VR. In addition, most people hold a more positive attitude towards this combination. It reveals that it is essential to apply UI and visual sensing image technology to digital media art.

AB  - We analysed the effect of a well designed website in terms of five indicators: purchase intention, positive attitudes, trust, satisfaction and perceived risk. These effects (measured by 21 items) were successfully combined into a single construct using Rasch's Model. The construct was then tested by building a website designed by experts for a fictitious clothes company. It was compared with four less-well-designed websites created by modifying the well designed website by removing one of the four major constructs [web security; customer service; amount and quality of information provided; and usability]. These websites were surfed by 350 consumers (in five subsamples); the experts were then asked to express their perceptions and attitudes of the sites a posteriori. The association between the five websites and the 21 items was displayed visually through a perceptual map built with DYANE software. This showed that a well designed website does not always have the best effect on all 21 items measured. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We examined brand love and brand citizenship behavior in the restaurant industry, developing a study framework in which we proposed that the high-involvement human resource (HR) practices of recognition, empowerment, competence development, fair rewards, and information sharing would play an important role in determining the brand love that enhances brand citizenship behavior. We collected data from 476 frontline employees working in restaurants in Taiwan. The findings suggest that the HR practices of recognition, empowerment, competence development, fair rewards, and information sharing were crucial predictors of brand love. We also found that brand love mediated the link between business management and brand citizenship behavior, and had positive effects on brand-helping behavior, brand consideration, and brand enthusiasm. If managers can generate employees' brand love, employees are likely to perform behaviors to assist with brand-related activities, follow brand guidelines while serving customers, have a positive attitude, and engage in behaviors contributing to values of the corporate brand.

AB  - This paper reports on an exploratory case study to help facilitate a culture of dialogue in Japan. There is an emphasis on proposing methods for polyphonic dialogue among citizens, and between citizens and experts, to effectively manage the environment. This paper argues that a culture of dialogue is essential to pluralistic participatory environmental governance. A random sampling-based citizen dialogue-involving experts and citizens-regarding radioactive waste disposal was held in Japanese cities. Three proposed methods-politeness-based facilitation dialogue, evidence-based and position-explicit presentations by experts with differing views and experts reflecting in tandem with citizens engaged in dialogue-might lead to enhanced positive attitudes toward dialogue with others holding different views, as well as better internal self-deliberation. Attitudes for dialogue were measured empirically. The current research suggests that explicit treatment of pluralistic positions and views among citizens and experts would be a key factor for quality social learning and resilience for uncertainty.

AB  - This study offers valuable and timely contributions to thee-retailing and regulatory focus literature by investigating the influence of regulatory fit in the online shopping experience context, along with the mechanism underlying the fit effect. Through experimental studies conducted across different countries, we use two different technology product websites and use chronic and situationally induced regulatory focus to illustrate that the degree of fit between an individual's regulatory focus and the type of shopping experience offered by a website has a great influence on their perception and purchase intention. We find that when facing a hedonic website, promotion-focused individuals have a stronger purchase intention and a more positive attitude towards it, and that the reverse is true for prevention-focused individuals. Moreover, our findings indicate that the regulatory fit effect on purchase intention and attitude is mediated by an individual's engagement level and varies between developed countries and emerging markets.

AB  - This paper investigates the backfiring effects of waste-prevention advertising that blames consumers for waste. Five experimental studies provide evidence that message focus (on close versus distant social actors) has an impact on message perception and, further, on waste intentions and behaviors. Providing information on transgressions incurred by close social actors makes consumers hold less negative attitudes toward waste and feel less able to implement tasks that help reduce waste; this may explain higher transgression rates. Furthermore, simple manipulations of perceived task difficulty through advertising are shown to help mitigate these negative effects and increase the effectiveness of anti-waste campaigns.

AB  - Research shows that epistemic cognition can support reasoning about the inclusion of diverse children. We argue that, to engage in such reasoning, children need the capacity to consider and evaluate competing knowledge perspectives (epistemic cognition) and to be cognitively flexible. Cognitive flexibility involves a subset of skills within the suite of self-regulation skills known as executive functions (EF). This study explored the extent to which cognitive flexibility might be related to epistemic cognition and the effectiveness of a pictorial and interview methodology to explore children's epistemic cognition. Eighty-two children participated in three EF tasks designed to assess their ability to flexibly shift from one mental set to another (cognitive flexibility). Children were also interviewed about the drawings they created to represent social exclusion/inclusion in their play settings. Results indicated that, in contrast to expectations, cognitive flexibility and epistemic cognition were not related. Challenges associated with using the pictorial and interview methodology are discussed.

AB  - With the advancement of technology, social media use increases day by day, especially among university students. This descriptive and correlational research was conducted with the aim of investigating attitudes of nursing and midwifery students towards social media in terms of certain variables. The population of the research comprised students studying at the nursing and midwifery department of a health college (N = 336), and the sample of the research constituted students who were chosen using accidental sampling from the population (n = 254). A Student Information Form and the Social Media Attitude Scale were used for data collection. It was identified that 73% of the students studied nursing and 64.2% used social media for various reasons. The averages scores for total score, social competence, need for sharing, relationship with the teachers, and social isolation dimensions of Social Media Attitude Scale were found as 72.19 +/- 10.92 (23-115), 14.17 +/- 4.87 (6-30), 27.65 +/- 6.08 (8-40), 7.50 +/- 3.20 (3-15), and 13.14 +/- 5.01 (6-30), respectively. It was observed that nursing and midwifery students had positive attitudes towards social media. Furthermore, although the personal characteristics of students do not affect their attitudes towards social media, the features of social media have a statistically significant effect on students attitudes towards social media.

AB  - This field experiment with more than 100 children at a school in the Southeast examined children's use of an iPad app as a means of improving the measurement of their food consumption. External factors related to children's food preferences and food consumption were also examined to determine how the iPad app could be further developed to help them become more aware of the foods they ate and how they could become more proactive in their health and well-being. Results indicated that the app enabled children to have more precision in recording the foods that they ate, and children expressed great appeal for the app. The foods that children reported eating via the app were compared to attitudes toward eating and nutritional knowledge; in both cases, more positive attitudes toward eating and stronger nutritional knowledge meant that a child was more likely to report eating healthy foods. Findings from this exploratory study contribute to knowledge in several areas because the findings represent the first of its kind in the discipline.

AB  - The present study explores the indirect effect of job stress on attitudes toward change through individuals' psychological attachment (organisational commitment mindsets and job embeddedness). The sample comprised N = 350 employees (black African: 67%; males: 69%; 26-40 years: 67%) who were affected by organisational change in the South African fast-moving consumer goods sector. The participants completed self-report measures on their job stress and psychological attachment experiences and their attitudes towards organisational change. The analysis applied structural equation modelling to test for the mediation effect of psychological attachment on the link between job stress and attitudes toward change. The findings suggest job stress to have a direct negative effect on job embeddedness and a positive, direct effect on attitudes toward change. Low levels of job embeddedness had a direct effect on positive attitudes toward change and mediated the link between job stress and attitudes toward change. The study contributes to organisational change theory by suggesting that experiences of job stress lower employees' job embeddedness and this lowered sense of attachment translates into change-supportive attitudes.

AB  - Background: Use of online clinical health care information has become part of the skill set required by medical teams. Nurses believe that information quality and availability affect nursing care and methods. However, nurses tend not to exploit professional medical databases for evidence-based medical information for their personal needs. This phenomenon has received little research attention.
   Objective: This study aimed to address the knowledge gap around nurses' attitudes towards searching online for medical information for their personal needs (ie, for themselves and their families) by (1) evaluating the level of exposure to medical information and the effect on attitudes towards the use of online search options, (2) assessing the effect of the choice of a primary means of searching for medical information on the attitudes towards the use of online search options, and (3) gauging the influence of sociodemographic data and health status on nurses' attitudes towards searching online for medical information.
   Methods: Nurses employed in general departments in a general hospital (34/210, 16.2%), nursing home (42/200, 21.0%), and geriatric medical center (45/180, 25.0%) in Israel were invited to complete the eHealth Impact Questionnaire (alpha=.95). Questionnaires were distributed by nurses in charge of the general hospitalization wards. The data collection period was February to March 2018. The response rate was 40.3% (121/300).
   Results: Nurses tended to search for medical information for personal needs on social media (24/121, 19.8%) and TV (eg, health programs, health news; 23/121, 19.0%). Nurses who chose social media as their primary means of receiving general information had a positive attitude about using the online environment as a source for medical information compared to nurses who found information through other means (t(119)=4.44, P<.001). Nurses exposed to medical information via social media had a positive attitude towards the use of the internet to find medical information compared to nurses who were not exposed to social media (t(119)=3.04, P=.003). The attitudes of nurses towards the utility of online medical information for personal needs increased with better participant health status (F-2,F-118=3.63, P=.03). However, the attitudes of participants with a chronic disease did not differ from those of healthy participants.
   Conclusions: Nurses in Israel are less likely to use their professional skills and knowledge to search in professional databases for evidence-based medical information for their personal needs. Instead, they prefer medical information that is easy to access and not evidence-based, such as that on social media and TV. However, these search patterns for personal use may affect their clinical role, impair quality of care, and lead to incorrect medical decisions for their patients in the health care system. Therefore, during nursing education, training for searching skills, retrieval skills, and online search techniques for evidence-based medical information is vital for evidence-based practice.

AB  - Infection rates, severity, and fatalities due to COVID-19, the pandemic mediated by SARS-CoV-2, vary greatly between countries. With few exceptions, these are lower in East and Southeast Asian and Sub-Saharan African countries compared with other regions. Epidemiological differences may reflect differences in border closures, lockdowns, and social distancing measures taken by each county, and by cultural differences, such as common use of face masks in East and Southeast Asian countries. The plasma serine protease inhibitor alpha-1 antitrypsin was suggested to protect from COVID-19 by inhibiting TMPRSS2, a cell surface serine protease essential for the SARS-CoV-2 cell entry. Here, we present evidence that population differences in alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency allele frequencies may partially explain national differences in the COVID-19 epidemiology. Our study compared reported national estimates for the major alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency alleles PiZ and PiS (SERPINA1rs28929474 and rs17580, respectively) with the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center dataset. We found a significant positive correlation (R = .54,P = 1.98e-6) between the combined frequencies of the alpha-1 antitrypsin PiZ and PiS deficiency alleles in 67 countries and their reported COVID-19 mortality rates. Our observations suggest that alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency alleles may contribute to national differences in COVID-19 infection, severity, and mortality rates. Population-wide screening for carriers of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency alleles should be considered for prioritizing individuals for stricter social distancing measures and for receiving a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine once it becomes available.

AB  - The home learning environment plays an important role for children's early competencies development. In particular, the early home literacy environment (HLE) that consists of all literacy resources and interactions in a family that support children's linguistic and literacy learning is closely associated with children's language comprehension and production. A key aspect of the HLE is shared reading that should start early in children's life and should be part of a regular routine in the family. However, parental attitudes toward (shared) reading have hardly been analyzed. In this longitudinal study, we analyzed the associations between parental attitudes toward shared reading and children's linguistic competencies and whether these associations may be mediated by the HLE. Further, we were interested in changes of parental attitudes over time and their association with child and family background characteristics. The sample consisted ofN= 133 children with an average age of about 3 years at t1. Children were tested two more times with a 6-month period in-between each assessment. Parental attitudes toward shared reading, socioeconomic status (SES), and the HLE were assessedviaparental survey. Children's sentence comprehension, productive language, and grammar were measured with a standardized test battery. Children whose parents had a more positive attitude toward shared reading not only lived in a greater quality HLE but also performed better in the linguistic tests. In a structural equation model, an indirect effect was found showing that the HLE mediated the effect of parental attitudes on children's linguistic competencies. Further, parental attitudes toward shared reading did not change significantly across t1 to t3, and a lower score in the SES scale was associated with a less positive attitude toward shared reading. Consequently, parental attitudes toward shared reading seem to be an important basis for individual differences in the quality of the HLE and also for children's linguistic competencies. As these attitudes vary in the context of different family SES backgrounds, they may be a good target for interventions to support the quality of the HLE and young children's linguistic learning.

AB  - The global pandemic of COVID-19 has been insisted by many countries in the world to implement social distancing, including Indonesia. This research measured the environmental impact before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Variables, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) of Sentinel-5P Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (Tropomi), nighttime light condition of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) and land surface temperature (LST) of Thermal InfraRed Sensor (TIRS) of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), were monitored using the cloud-based computing platform of Google Earth Engine (GEE). This study found that all monitored variables decreased during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the period before the pandemic. However, the pattern of reduction of NO2 concentration and nighttime light was not observed to be coherent with large-scale social distancing regulation enforced by the government. This study found that the reduction has begun 2 months earlier than the official regulation enforced by the government. The lower LST shown in both the time-series map and the graph demonstrated changes before and during the pandemic. The hypothesis was tested using the t-test method, and the statistical results show the significant difference between two groups of observed variables (e.g. before and during the pandemic) with the lower p-values and higher Cohen's d. Results of this study indicate that it should be feasible to monitor the environmental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic using the combination of NO2 concentration, nighttime light and LST information as a proxy.

AB  - Objective To examine rates of emerging adults' (EA) adherence to preventative health behavior recommendations during early months of the COVID-19 pandemic and to investigate demographic (i.e., gender, years of education, socioeconomic status, school enrollment status, and living situation) and exposure and impact-related correlates of adherence. Methods Participants were 273 [M (SD) age = 22 (2.1) years, 55% female, 32% from minoritized groups] EA completed an online survey of adherence to 11 preventative health behaviors recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) during summer 2020. Participants rated adherence via a visual analog scale. Participants also reported demographic information and completed the COVID-19 Exposure and Family Impact Adolescent and Young Adult Version (CEFIS-AYA). Results Median levels of adherence to preventative recommendations ranged from 66% to 100%. Highest adherence levels (Mdn > 90%) were reported for quarantining if exposed to COVID-19; covering mouth when sneezing; avoiding the elderly/those at high risk; and avoiding large gatherings. Median adherence was <80% for mask wearing; maintaining a 6-foot distance; avoiding in-person visits with romantic partners or friends; and disinfecting surfaces. Female gender was the only variable significantly associated with overall adherence, and it explained 4% of the variance. Conclusions Following guidelines related to social distancing practices may be particularly challenging for EA, possibly because of unique developmental needs of this group, and males may be at greater risk for non-adherence to CDC recommendations. Therefore, public health messaging and adherence intervention development should be designed with males and social distancing practices in mind.

AB  - Contrary to the popular notion of the pledge-breaking politician, research has revealed that governing political parties fulfill most of their pre-election pledges. This discrepancy between public perception and scientific findings could be the result of citizens' looser definition of election pledges. Thus, as citizens' assessment of pledge fulfillment (and with that their satisfaction with the governing parties) hinges on their understanding of election pledges, we examined citizens' perception of election pledges. Our experiment (N = 705) showed that citizens were more likely to perceive messages as pledges when they were articulated in binding versus less binding terms, but when they were vague as opposed to specific in terms of goals. Political attitudes also biased the understanding of election pledges, demonstrating that it is in the eye of the beholder which messages are considered to be election pledges.

AB  - There is little empirical research on the effect of working after retirement on the mental health of the older adults in China. To fill this gap in the literature, this study examines the effects of working after retirement on the mental health of the older adults using data from the China Family Panel Studies. We employed the methods of ordinary least squares, ordered logit, and propensity score matching-difference in differences (PSM-DID). Results show that working after retirement is negatively related to mental health of the older adults in China. The deterioration effect of post-retirement work mainly impacts those aged over 60 years, women, and those with lower education background, urban household registration, higher pension, and higher social status. Working after retirement is negatively related to mental health through the mediating effects of deteriorating interpersonal relationships and lower positive attitude. It is necessary to consider mental health effects and their population differences to evaluate the impact and improve the quality of policies of active aging.</p>

AB  - This qualitative study explores the views of six Cypriot primary school teachers regarding the value of educational technology, their actual use of such technology in their classrooms and factors working against its use. Participating teachers collaborated with the researcher in the design of simple web-based learning environments for a variety of learners in their classes and the use of those in a series of computer-mediated teaching sessions, in the framework of an alternative training programme based on the Whole Teacher Development approach, a conceptual framework for in-service professional development of teachers. Both before and after this, participant observations and semi-structured interviews were conducted. It was found that the use of educational technologies in these Cypriot primary schools depends on a complex framework of interwoven and dynamic factors at both teacher and school levels. The results suggest that this collaboration opportunity has the potential to develop positive attitudes and change conservative stances towards educational technology although other factors such as lack of time, a demanding curriculum and limited ready-made and suitable educational software work against its use.

AB  - Aim/Purpose This study aims to explore the relationship between motivation and students' perspectives, learning performance, and use of online course materials in flipped classrooms.
   Background The flipped classroom model is an innovative instruction method that has limited research to date exploring its impact on motivation. It remains unknown if the same motivation patterns exist in flipped classrooms as in purely face-to-face or online learning environments.
   Methodology Fifty-nine undergraduate students' expectancy beliefs (control beliefs about learning, self-efficacy) and value beliefs (task value, intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation) were measured by subscales adapted from Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. Students' final grade percentage represented their learning performance. Regression analysis was used to explore the ability of motivational characteristics to evaluate how well the five motivational subscales predicted participants' perspectives of a flipped class.
   Contribution The results of this study suggest that students have similar motivation patterns regarding their learning performance in flipped classrooms as in traditional or online classrooms. Overall, students reported positive motivational beliefs towards a flipped classroom.
   Findings Results indicated that students in a flipped classroom also show a positive correlation with motivation regarding their learning performance as in traditional or online classrooms. Self-efficacy is a significant predictor of both students' academic achievement and perceptions of the flipped classroom. Overall, students had positive attitudes towards the flipped model but indicated neutral attitudes when asked if they wished to take another class taught in a flipped format.
   Recommendations for Practitioners The findings suggested that instructors should set up pre-class activities related to credits that account for the course grade to reinforce students' effort spent on course preparation. The results of this study suggest that students' previous experiences of flipped classrooms and online learning may not always affect their motivational beliefs, learning performance, and perceptions of the course format in a flipped classroom. However, a large number of online materials may cause fatigue and make students unwilling to use all the online materials.
   Recommendations for Researchers The flipped classroom model is a valuable teaching strategy that can be applied at any educational level to maximize learning time, but continuing research is needed in the field to improve the effectiveness of this approach and facilitate learning among all students, including those with low self-efficacy beliefs or overall motivation.
   Impact on Society While the flipped learning model challenges instructors to shift emphasis from providing content to designing active learning experiences, this role remains vitally important for facilitating in-class activities, scaffolding out-of-class preparation, and effectively implementing the flipped design.
   Future Research This research did not use control experiments to eliminate other confounding variables. This study explored relationships between motivation and flipped learning but did not prove cause and effect. Whether students in a non-flipped learning classroom have a higher or lower motivation is still unknown and more empirical studies are still needed in the field for assisting instructors who want to adopt this teaching style with better practices.

AB  - Across Europe, right-wing populist parties use advertisements that depict symbolic and economic threats posed by immigrants. Yet research on the effects of such advertisements is scarce, especially when it comes to young voters. We theorise that the attitudinal effects of threatening advertisements depend on young voters' education level. In an experiment, a total of N = 162 pupils were randomly assigned to three conditions, a symbolic threat advertisement, an economic threat advertisement or a control condition. Exposure to the symbolic and economic threat advertisements led to a significant increase in negative attitudes towards immigrants. However, the economic threat advertisement was only effective for pupils with lower compared to higher educational degrees. The effects did not depend on party predisposition.

AB  - Using data from 28 European countries, this study examines factors influencing public attitude towards the use of AI/Robot. Its multilevel SEM analysis finds that several factors at the individual level including Perceived threat of job loss and Digital technology efficacy predict public Acceptance of AI/Robot. Although country-level factors such as economic development, government effectiveness and innovation do not directly influence public acceptance of AI/Robot, they do have significant effects on Perceived threat of general job loss due to AI/Robot, and Digital technology efficacy. Findings indicate that these nationally macro variables influence people's perceptions of AI and robotics technologies and their confidence in their digital skills. This research enriches the application of the Technology Acceptance Model by using predictive variables at two levels: individual and country. Furthermore, at the individual level, this study uses two variables (e.g. Perceived threat of job loss and Digital technology efficacy) that are unconventional to TAM, thus contributing to this theoretical model.

AB  - While homework is a frequent source of distress, positive attitudes of parents can help students develop positive emotions and self-efficacy regarding homework. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that parents' emotions, favored by autonomous motivation, directly and indirectly relate with students' emotions through their self-efficacy with regard to homework. Questionnaires were administered to 205 fourth- to eighth-grade students and their parents to assess both groups' positive and negative emotions, students' self-efficacy with regard to homework, and parents' autonomous motivation. The results supported the hypothesized model: parents' autonomous motivation is associated with parents' positive emotions, which is then associated with students' positive and negative emotions, both directly and through the mediation of students' self-efficacy for doing homework. The discussion focuses on theoretical and educational implications.

AB  - Partisan selectivity of news media and attitudinal polarization are linked, yet the bulk of research focuses on the role of political attitudes while neglecting religious dispositions. We consider the degree to which both network and cable news media offend viewers in terms of both politics and religion. Using data from the 2010 Baylor Religion Survey, we find that white evangelicals have higher odds than mainline Protestants of reporting taking offense from the evening news, as well as higher odds than religious non-affiliates of being offended by both types of news. The primary divide, however, was between affiliates and non-affiliates, as biblical literalism and religious exclusivism at least partially mediated differences between white evangelicals and mainliners in taking offense from the evening news. Religious service attendance at least partially mediated differences between affiliates and non-affiliates in taking offense from both types of news, but while political conservatism explained differences in being offended by the evening news, it was not a significant predictor of taking offense from cable news. We suggest that this is due to processes of media differentiation that make cable news an equal-opportunity offender.

AB  - Scientists (and science as a whole) provide evidence and advice for societal problem solving and collective decision-making. For this advice to be heard, the public must be willing to trust science, where "trust" means that one can confidently expect science to provide reliable knowledge and evidence, even if one's understanding of science is bounded. According to the sociological and psychological literature, citizens' basic attitudes toward, experiences with, and perceived trustworthiness of the trustee serve as antecedents of trust. From this, we developed a model for the public's trust in science, and we tested this model in a nationally representative survey in Switzerland (N = 1,050). The analysis reveals that trust in science was best predicted by positivistic attitudes toward science (beta = 0.33) and to a lesser extent by trustworthiness assessments of scientists (beta = 0.24). Experiences with science did not predict trust in science (beta = 0.07). These results suggest that stable basic attitudes toward science and its role in society are grounds on which trust in science can be built.

AB  - Purpose: The pandemic related to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to a decrease in communicable diseases due to social distancing and mask-wearing. How have the prevalence of otitis media (OM) and its associated procedures changed during the pandemic?Study design: Retrospective Cohort Study.Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study using the Pediatric Health Information System (R) (PHIS) database, which consists of 48 children's hospitals. Regions were defined according to PHIS rules. We compared proportion of OM to total diagnoses codes, and collected mastoiditis, and MT placements from all encounters through January 1, 2019-June 31, 2021. Results: In April 2020, there was a decrease in mean proportion of OM cases per 100 hospital visits (7 v. 2, p < 0.0001) and this was sustained through 2020 and until June 2021 (6-7 v. 2-4, p < 0.05; p < 0.05). Compared to 2020, the months of April and June 2021 showed an increase in mean proportion of OM cases (6-7 v. 3-4, p < 0.05) while May did not. This relative increase in OM cases through April-June were primarily driven by the South, the Midwest, and the Northeast in April and the South and the Midwest in June. MT procedures followed similar trends. In 2020, there was no difference in mastoiditis as a proportion of OM cases compared to 2019 however there was a statistically higher rate of mastoiditis in 2020 compared to 2021.Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic led to declines in OM and MT case volumes that have started to increase. A geographic relationship may exist, and this connection could be influenced by mask mandates and social distancing.

AB  - Canada has often been seen as immune from the powerful backlash against globalization and immigration that has driven political shifts elsewhere. This article challenges this belief, at least in part, by tracing the evolution of public attitudes toward immigration and analyzing the factors that have shaped the trajectory for over three decades. Drawing on nearly forty years of Environics Focus Canada surveys, combined with annual data on macro-economics and immigration flows, findings here suggest that Canadians' tolerance toward immigration responds to immigration flows and is heavily influenced by macro-economic conditions.

AB  - This study looks at how preservice early childhood teachers define and interpret developmentally appropriate practices (DAP), as well as DAP principles and features. Early childhood preservice teachers had relatively strong beliefs about DAP, according to the study. DAP views were stronger among preservice teachers who were further along in their teacher training program than instructors who had just started their teacher training program. Similarly, teachers who had completed more field placements had more positive attitudes toward DAP. The definitions and concepts of developmentally appropriate/inappropriate practice as defined by teachers were investigated. The findings' implications for educating teachers to apply proper practice are highlighted. The concept of Developmentally Appropriate Practice (DAP) has long been seen as important in early childhood education. Even though the NAEYC(National association for the education of young children) DAP principles have become canonical in early childhood education, there are many different interpretations of what DAP is, how to implement it, and how significant it is in connection to overall classroom practice. The variance in teacher beliefs on the importance of DAP reflects their level of understanding about DAP.

AB  - Teacher education programs play a significant role in shaping pre-service English teachers' pedagogy. The incorporation of texts with lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual/transgender, intersex, and queer/questioning (LGBTIQ+) perspectives in the curriculum is one mechanism for promoting inclusion as well as a means to address and combat homophobia and heteronormativity. Situated at an Australian university, this case study examined the beliefs and practices of pre-service teachers and teacher educators related to the inclusion of LGBTIQ+ issues and texts in secondary English classrooms. Drawing on sociocultural theories, the findings from this study indicated that pre-service teachers generally held positive attitudes towards the incorporation of LGBTIQ+ texts and representations. Notably, preparation to teach through a social justice lens developed pre-service teachers' understanding of the significance of including a diverse range of lived experiences in classrooms. However, the lack of specific inclusion of LGBTIQ+ perspectives in teacher education meant that pre-service teachers often struggled to incorporate related texts in their university assessments and professional experience placements, and they were concerned about their ability to do so in the future.

AB  - Objectives: To examine the relationship between women's pubic hair removal (PHR) and genital satisfaction and explore whether attitudes toward, and personal consumption of, pornography are associated with women's engagement in PHR. Methods: Data were collected by online survey from women (N = 152) who were then categorized into groups based on the prevalence and extent of PHR during the previous 4 weeks. Groups were compared on demographic, background, and behavioral variables. Results: Eighty-three percent of respondents reported PHR in the previous 4 weeks and 40% of respondents removed all their pubic hair. Women who were younger, White, and were more satisfied with their genitals were more likely to engage in PHR. Of these, being younger, not having a degree, reporting less positive attitudes toward erotica, and 3 reasons for PHR predicted extensive PHR over limited removal. Conclusions: Findings provide insights into the reasons for, and extent of, PHR among women and factors associated with the practice. The possible influences of partners' preferences for genital hair removal by women and partners' consumption of pornography are important areas for future research.

Design/methodology/approach Two experiments were conducted in a fitness service setting, in which employee display of happiness was manipulated (low vs high). Findings Both experiments showed that expressions of high levels of happiness produced a more positive attitude toward the service employee than expressions of low levels of happiness. Moreover, the impact of the expression of happiness on the evaluation of the employee was mediated by several variables, which suggests that the influence of depicted employees' emotional expressions can take several routes. Originality/value The present study contributes to previous research by assessing a set of potential mediators to explain why displays of happiness influence consumers, and by examining these effects in a marketing communications setting in which the customer is exposed to still images or video-based representations of the employee. The present study also focuses explicitly on happiness rather than on smiles.

AB  - The present longitudinal study examines the interaction of learner variables (gender, motivation, self-efficacy, and first language literacy) and their influence on second language learning outcomes. The study follows English learners of French from Year 5 in primary school (aged 9-10) to the first year in secondary school (Year 7; aged 11-12). Language outcomes were measured by two oral production tasks, a sentence repetition task and a photo description task, both of which were administered at three time points. Longitudinal data on learner attitudes and motivation were collected via questionnaires. Teacher assessment data for general first language literacy attainment were also provided. The results show a great deal of variation in learner attitudes and outcomes and that there is a complex relationship between first language literacy, self-efficacy, gender, and attainment. For example, in general, girls held more positive attitudes to boys and were more successful. However, the inclusion of first language ability, which explained 29-39 per cent of variation, shows that gender differences in attitudes and outcomes are likely mediated by first language literacy and prior learning experience.

AB  - The present study tests whether a self-affirmation intervention (i.e., requiring an individual to focus on a valued aspect of their self-concept, such as honesty) can increase physical activity and change theory of planned behavior (TPB) variables linked to physical activity. Eighty young people completed a longitudinal intervention study. Baseline physical activity was assessed using the Godin Leisure-Time Physical Activity Questionnaire (LTPAQ). Next, participants were randomly allocated to either a self-affirmation or a nonaffirmation condition. Participants then read information about physical activity and health, and completed measures of TPB variables. One week later, participants again completed LTPAQ and TPB items. At follow up, self-affirmed participants reported significantly more physical activity, more positive attitudes toward physical activity, and higher intentions to be physically active compared with nonaffirmed participants. Neither attitudes nor intentions mediated the effects of self-affirmation on physical activity. Self-affirmation can increase levels of physical activity and TPB variables. Self-affirmation interventions have the potential to become relatively simple methods for increasing physical activity levels.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on all societal domains, including sports. Social distancing measures and the closure of sports facilities posed especially severe challenges for grassroots sports clubs, which thrive on joint activities and member social contact. Drawing on mediatization theory, the study examines the communication challenges faced by grassroots sports clubs and the perceived potential of digital media to overcome these obstacles during and beyond the pandemic. Based on in-depth interviews with 32 club officials of German grassroots sports clubs, the study identified ongoing uncertainty about COVID-19 regulations, preserving members' sense of belonging during social distancing, and involving everyone in formal processes as the major communication challenges. While most of the interviewees valued the potential of digital media to address these challenges, they acknowledged that the benefits of digital media for individual members would depend on their skill, motivation, and concerns, as well as on the availability of digital infrastructure. For that reason, digital media were not considered a substitute for face-to-face social contact or sporting activity but were seen to extend opportunities for communication and training. More generally, these findings raise new questions about the relationship between mediatization and social cohesion.

AB  - Premised on the argument that articulating, representing, and defending local interests is one of the normative roles for the news media, this study examines what we call the primacy of local interests to the Hong Kong media and how concern with local interests relates to the politics of press freedom in the city. More specifically, on issues involving conflict of interests between the local society and its sovereign country, most Hong Kong media have demonstrated their willingness to stand by the local society even though it could mean a need to directly confront China. This study further draws on a representative journalist survey to illustrate how, in terms of Hong Kong journalists' belief system, an orientation toward local interests is tied to liberal political attitudes, beliefs in the media's adversarial role, and perceptions of media self-censorship. The analysis suggests how various kinds of attitudes and beliefs may cluster together to serve as an important force counteracting the pressure to conform to the power center. Implications of the findings and the generality of the notion of the primacy of local interests are discussed.

AB  - The first mitigation response to the Covid-19 pandemic was to limit person-to-person interaction as much as possible. This was implemented by the temporary closing of many workplaces and people were required to follow social distancing. Networks are a great way to represent interactions among people and the temporary severing of these interactions. Here, we present a network model of human-human interactions that could be mediators of disease spread. The nodes of this network are individuals and different types of edges denote family cliques, workplace interactions, interactions arising from essential needs, and social interactions. Each individual can be in one of four states: susceptible, infected, immune, and dead. The network and the disease parameters are informed by the existing literature on Covid-19. Using this model, we simulate the spread of an infectious disease in the presence of various mitigation scenarios. For example, lockdown is implemented by deleting edges that denote non-essential interactions. We validate the simulation results with the real data by matching the basic and effective reproduction numbers during different phases of the spread. We also simulate different possibilities of the slow lifting of the lockdown by varying the transmission rate as facilities are slowly opened but people follow prevention measures like wearing masks etc. We make predictions on the probability and intensity of a second wave of infection in each of these scenarios.

AB  - The development of distance learning courses for less commonly taught languages (LCTLs) often meets with instructional challenges, especially for Asian LCTLs with their distinct non-Roman characters and structures. This study documents the implementation of a fully online, elementary Japanese course at Stony Brook University. The curriculum was designed around the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages's (ACTFL) World-Readiness Standards for Learning Languages; performance-driven assessments; and task-supported, technology-enhanced principles. Asynchronous and synchronous tools were incorporated to facilitate task delivery and reduce the virtual isolation of learners. A simulated Oral Proficiency Interview (OPI) was conducted for the online students in order to compare their oral performance with that of the face-to-face (F2F) cohort in the preceding semester. Quantitative results show that online students outperformed their F2F counterparts in most of the Integrated Performance Assessment's scoring criteria, with a statistically significant difference in the criterion Communication strategies. Survey results indicate students' positive attitudes toward language gains and corroborate the qualitative results gleaned from student learning journals and survey responses: Students' sense of isolation was replaced by a sense of co-presence. We conclude that developing an online LCTL course, though challenging, is feasible and maximizes outcomes through the synergy of multimodal digital platforms, and a standards-based, task-driven curriculum design.

AB  - Importance Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine hesitancy or refusal is common among parents of adolescents. An understanding of public perceptions from the perspective of behavior change theories can facilitate effective and targeted vaccine promotion strategies. Objective To develop and validate deep learning models for understanding public perceptions of HPV vaccines from the perspective of behavior change theories using data from social media. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study, conducted from April to August 2019, included longitudinal and geographic analyses of public perceptions regarding HPV vaccines, using sampled HPV vaccine-related Twitter discussions collected from January 2014 to October 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures The prevalence of social media discussions related to the construct of health belief model (HBM) and theory of planned behavior (TPB), categorized by deep learning algorithms. Locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) revealed trends of constructs. Social media users' US state-level home location information was extracted from their profiles, and geographic analyses were performed to identify the clustering of public perceptions of the HPV vaccine. Results A total of 1431463 English-language posts from 486116 unique usernames were collected. Deep learning algorithms achieved F-1 scores ranging from 0.6805 (95% CI, 0.6516-0.7094) to 0.9421 (95% CI, 0.9380-0.9462) in mapping discussions to the constructs of behavior change theories. LOESS revealed trends in constructs; for example, prevalence of perceived barriers, a construct of HBM, deceased from its apex in July 2015 (56.2%) to its lowest prevalence in October 2018 (28.4%; difference, 27.8%; P < .001); Positive attitudes toward the HPV vaccine, a construct of TPB, increased from early 2017 (30.7%) to 41.9% at the end of the study (difference, 11.2%; P < .001), while negative attitudes decreased from 42.3% to 31.3% (difference, 11.0%; P < .001) during the same period. Interstate variations in public perceptions of the HPV vaccine were also identified; for example, the states of Ohio and Maine showed a relatively high prevalence of perceived barriers (11531 of 17106 [67.4%] and 1157 of 1684 [68.7%]) and negative attitudes (9655 of 17197 [56.1%] and 1080 of 1793 [60.2%]). Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study provided a good understanding of public perceptions on social media and evolving trends in terms of multiple dimensions. The interstate variations of public perceptions could be associated with the rise of local antivaccine sentiment. The methods described in this study represent an early contribution to using existing empirically and theoretically based frameworks that describe human decision-making in conjunction with more intelligent deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, these data demonstrate the ability to collect large-scale HPV vaccine perception and intention data that can inform public health communication and education programs designed to improve immunization rates at the community, state, or even national level.
   Question Can public perceptions of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be accessed from the perspective of behavior change theories by mining social media data with machine learning algorithms? Findings This cohort study included 1431463 English-language posts about the HPV vaccine from 486116 unique usernames from a social media platform. An increase in HPV vaccine-related discussions was found, and the results suggest temporal and geographic variations in public perceptions of the HPV vaccine. Meaning The findings of this study suggest that social media and machine learning algorithms can serve as a complementary approach to inform public health surveillance and understanding and help to design targeted educational and communication programs that increase HPV vaccine acceptance.
   This cohort study develops and validates deep learning models to understand public perceptions of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines from the perspective of behavior change theories using data from social media.

AB  - Recurrent xenophobic violence in South Africa highlights the strong undercurrent of popular opinion opposition to international immigrants. This article examines public attitudes towards the international immigrant community in South Africa and the factors influencing those attitudes. The author uses public opinion data from the 2014 South African Social Attitudes Survey (SASAS). The article will show that there is an asymmetry in the processes of opinion formation on immigrants in the country. The findings seemed to call into question the bipolarity of attitudinal measures used in public opinion studies of anti-immigrant sentiment. In addition, the author found that stereotypes about the harmful impact of international immigration were powerful drivers of public antipathy towards foreigners. Greater scrutiny of harmful stereotypes of foreign immigrants voiced by the media, politicians and national leaders is therefore needed.

AB  - Sentiment analysis of social media data is crucial to understand people's position, attitude, and opinion toward a certain event, which has many applications such as election prediction and product evaluation. Though great effort has been devoted to the single modality (image or text), less effort is paid to the joint analysis of multimodal data in social media. Most of the existing methods for multimodal sentiment analysis simply combine different data modalities, which results in dissatisfying performance on sentiment classification. In this paper, we propose a novel image-text sentiment analysis model, i.e., Deep Multimodal Attentive Fusion (DMAF), to exploit the discriminative features and the internal correlation between visual and semantic contents with a mixed fusion framework for sentiment analysis. Specifically, to automatically focus on discriminative regions and important words which are most related to the sentiment, two separate unimodal attention models are proposed to learn effective emotion classifiers for visual and textual modality respectively. Then, an intermediate fusion-based multimodal attention model is proposed to exploit the internal correlation between visual and textual features for joint sentiment classification. Finally, a late fusion scheme is applied to combine the three attention models for sentiment prediction. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both weakly labeled and manually labeled datasets. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Personality and self-rated health have been linked previously to cognitive outcome in late life. However, these associations have not been shown among the oldest old. This study examined relationships between personality, self-rated health, and cognitive function in a selected sample of Ashkenazi Jewish centenarians (n = 68, 59% female) aged 95 to 106 who lived independently in the community. Personality was measured using the Personality Outlook Profile Scale (POPS), a brief measure that was validated in this population. Self-rated health was assessed by participants' subjective rating of their present health, and Mini-Mental Status Examination was used to determine cognitive function. Results showed positive associations of the Positive Attitude Towards Life domain of the POPS and self-rated health with participants' current cognitive function. These associations remained significant even after adjusting for the effects of participants'age, gender, marital status, education, and history of medical illnesses. Further exploratory analysis using structural equations modeling showed significant associations among the three variables, but demonstrated a borderline significant level of mediating effect of personality on the relationship between self-rated health and cognition. These results reemphasized the independent roles of personality and self-rated health on centenarians' cognitive outcomes. Future studies will further elucidate the impact of personality and self-rated health on cognitive outcomes in the oldest old.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to revisit and extends the work of Rosacker and Rosacker (2012) that called for increased interdisciplinary efforts to address and solve the critical issues (critical success factors) facing technologically-enabled remote-access voting platforms. It builds upon the background platform presented there, which included an historical timeline of information and communication technologies and an e-voting literature review, and extends that work by providing a state-of-the-art update and review of the rapidly changing voter environment from societal, technological and experiential studies over the past decade. Specific focus is directed at technology-enabled, remote-access voting, while also considering the important role technological advances can play in improving voter registration/confirmation procedures. Design/methodology/approach First, a brief review of significant societal and technological changes, including the rapid evolution of the internet of things, is undertaken to frame the discussion. Second, a sample of several technology-enabled, remote-access voting experiments are reviewed and critiqued. Third, currently available technical solutions targeting technology-enabled voter registration and vote casting are offered as the next step in the process that will ultimately lead to remote-access voting becoming widely deployed across smart devices. Finally, some contemporaneous conclusions are tendered. Findings Society and technology-enabled devices have each witnessed myriad changes and advancements in the second decade of the 21st century. These have led to numerous remote-access voting experiments across the globe that have overwhelmingly proven the concept of technology-enabled, remote-access voting to be viable while also identifying/reasserting issues (critical success factors) that continue to restrain its full implementation. Importantly, none of the problems identified is fatal to the concept. Originality/value This study considers the issue of technologically-enabled, remote-access voting focussing on the impacts associated with the portfolio of recent societal and technological advancements including the many vexing concerns and issues presented by the coronavirus pandemic. Social distancing is limiting access to the traditional methods of in-person voting for both election officials and voters bringing into question the November 2020 US national election. Calls for expanded mail voting options and the requisite federal funding required to support these efforts are increasing, widespread and broadly persuasive. Wholly missing in this debate is an exhaustive consideration and discussion of technologically enhanced, remote-access voting systems and their role in filling the void.

AB  - Pundits and academics across disciplines note that the human toll brought forth by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States (U.S.) is fundamentally unequal for communities of color. Standing literature on public health posits that one of the chief predictors of racial disparity in health outcomes is a lack of institutional trust among minority communities. Furthermore, in our own county-level analysis from the U.S., we find that counties with higher percentages of Black and Hispanic residents have had vastly higher cumulative deaths from COVID-19. In light of this standing literature and our own analysis, it is critical to better understand how to mitigate or prevent these unequal outcomes for any future pandemic or public health emergency. Therefore, we assess the claim that raising institutional trust, primarily scientific trust, is key to mitigating these racial inequities. Leveraging a new, pre-pandemic measure of scientific trust, we find that trust in science, unlike trust in politicians or the media, significantly raises support for COVID-19 social distancing policies across racial lines. Our findings suggest that increasing scientific trust is essential to garnering support for public health policies that lessen the severity of the current, and potentially a future, pandemic.

AB  - Ownership is a powerful construct. Indeed, in a series of recent studies, perceived ownership has been shown to increase attentional capacity, facilitate a memorial advantage, and elicit positive attitudes. Here, we sought to determine whether self-relevance would bias reward evaluation systems within the brain. To accomplish this, we had participants complete a simple gambling task during which they could "win" or "lose" prizes for themselves or for someone else, while electroencephalographic data were recorded. Our results indicated that the amplitude of the feedback error-related negativity, a component of the event-related brain potential sensitive to reward evaluation, was diminished when participants were not gambling for themselves. Furthermore, our data suggest that the ownership cues that indicated who would win or lose a given gamble either were processed as a potential for an increase in utility (i.e., gain: self-gambles) or were processed in a nonutilitarian manner (other-gambles). Importantly, our results suggest that the medial-frontal reward system is sensitive to perceived ownership, to the extent that it may not process changes in utility when they are not directly relevant to self.

AB  - This paper introduces the notion of contact with a multicultural past as a new type of indirect intergroup contact. It presents results of a study which evaluated the effects of an educational program utilizing the proposed framework. The program aimed to facilitate the engagement of Polish students (N = 427) with historical Jewish heritage in their places of residence. The intervention proved highly successful at increasing students' knowledge of and interest in local history which both contributed independently to an increased inclusion of the outgroup (Jews) in the self and in turn to more positive attitudes towards them. The implications of using contact with a multicultural past in societies with low levels of direct intergroup contact are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: We examined the acceptability of the influenza A (H1N1) and seasonal vaccinations immediately following government manufacture approval to gauge potential product uptake in minority communities. We studied correlates of vaccine acceptance including attitudes, beliefs, perceptions, and influenza immunization experiences, and sought to identify communication approaches to increase influenza vaccine coverage in community settings.
   Methods: Adults >= 18 years participated in a cross-sectional survey from September through December 2009. Venue-based sampling was used to recruit participants of racial and ethnic minorities.
   Results: The sample (N=503) included mostly lower income (81.9%, n=412) participants and African Americans (79.3%, n=399). Respondents expressed greater acceptability of the H1N1 vaccination compared to seasonal flu immunization (t=2.86, p=0.005) although H1N1 vaccine acceptability was moderately low (38%, n=191). Factors associated with acceptance of the H1N1 vaccine included positive attitudes about immunizations [OR=0.23, CI (0.16, 0.33)], community perceptions of H1N1 [OR=2.15, CI (1.57, 2.95)], and having had a flu shot in the past 5 years [OR=2.50, CI (1.52, 4.10). The factors associated with acceptance of the seasonal flu vaccine included positive attitudes about immunization [OR=0.43, CI (0.32, 0.59)], community perceptions of H1N1 [OR=1.53, CI (1.16, 2.01)], and having had the flu shot in the past 5 years [OR=3.53, CI (2.16, 5.78)]. Participants were most likely to be influenced to take a flu shot by physicians [OR=1.94, CI (1.31, 2.86)]. Persons who obtained influenza vaccinations indicated that Facebook (chi(2)=11.7, p=0.02) and Twitter (chi(2)=18.1, p = 0.001) could be useful vaccine communication channels and that churches (chi(2)=21.5, p<0.001) and grocery stores (chi(2)=21.5, p<0.001) would be effective "flu shot stops" in their communities.
   Conclusions: In this population, positive vaccine attitudes and community perceptions, along with previous flu vaccination, were associated with H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccine acceptance. Increased immunization coverage in this community may be achieved through physician communication to dispel vaccine conspiracy beliefs and discussion about vaccine protection via social media and in other community venues.

AB  - This article introduces the 16 articles appearing in the 2009 and 2010 volumes of Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy that were submitted in response to a call for papers on "The Social Psychology of the 2008 United States Presidential Election." The papers touch a wide array of election topics, comparing the backgrounds and values of voters and nonvoters, those voting for different candidates, and those who choose which candidates they support early vs. late during the campaign. These papers, together with several others on media representations of candidates, highlight the continuing presence of race in shaping political attitudes and preferences, and also emphasize the evolution of American prejudices in the election process, from overt rejection of individuals who are racially different, to qualified political support under certain circumstances. Other papers in the collection focus on the role of gender as well as race, and also on some of the many ways in which presidential elections reflect and shape the self-concepts of American voters.

KW  - OUTCOMES
KW  - IMPACT
AB  - Study objective: During a pandemic, emergency departments (EDs) may be overwhelmed by an increase in patient visits and will foster an environment in which cross-infection can occur. We developed and tested a novel drive-through model to rapidly evaluate patients while they remain in or adjacent to their vehicles. The patient's automobile would provide a social distancing strategy to mitigate the person-to-person spread of infectious diseases.
   Methods: We conducted a full-scale exercise to test the feasibility of a drive-through influenza clinic and measure throughput times of simulated patients and carbon monoxide levels of staff. We also assessed the disposition decisions of the physicians who participated in the exercise. Charts of 38 patients with influenza-like illness who were treated in the Stanford Hospital ED during the initial H1N1 outbreak in April 2009 were used to create 38 patient scenarios for the drive-through influenza clinic.
   Results: The total median length of stay was 26 minutes. During the exercise, physicians were able to identify those patients who were admitted and discharged during the real ED visit with 100% accuracy (95% confidence interval 91% to 100%). There were no significant increases of carboxyhemoglobin in participants tested.
   Conclusion: The drive-through model is a feasible alternative to a traditional walk-in ED or clinic and is associated with rapid throughput times. It provides a social distancing strategy, using the patient's vehicle as an isolation compartment to mitigate person-to-person spread of infectious diseases. [Ann Emerg Med. 2010;55:268-273.]

AB  - Nearly three billion people worldwide burn solid fuels and kerosene in open fires and inefficient stoves to cook, light, and heat their homes. Cleaner-burning stoves reduce emissions and can have positive health, climate, and women's empowerment benefits. This article reports on the protocol and baseline data from the evaluation of four behavior change communication (BCC) campaigns carried out in lower to middle income countries aimed at promoting the sale and use of cleaner-burning stoves. Interventions implemented in Bangladesh, Kenya, and Nigeria are using a range of BCC methods including mass media, digital media, outdoor advertising, and inter-personal communication. The mixed methods evaluation comprises three large-scale surveys: one pre-BCC and two follow-ups, along with smaller scale assessments of stove uptake and patterns of use. Baseline results revealed varying levels of awareness of previous promotions and positive attitudes and beliefs about modern (i.e., relatively clean-burning) cookstoves. Differences in cookstove preferences and behaviors by gender, socio-demographics, media use, and country/region were observed that may affect outcomes. Across all three countries, cost (lack of funds) a key perceived barrier to buying a cleaner-burning stove. Future multivariate analyses will examine potential dose-response effects of BCC on cookstove uptake and patterns of use. BCC campaigns have the potential to promote modern cookstoves at scale. More research on campaign effectiveness is needed, and on how to optimize messages and channels. This evaluation builds on a limited evidence base in the field.

AB  - Two experimental studies investigated how news reports about terrorist attacks committed by unidentified perpetrators influence beliefs about the perpetrators and Muslims in general. In Study 1, a quota-based sample of 354 Germans was exposed to terror news coverage describing either non-Muslim or Muslim victims with no reference to the perpetrators of the attacks. Upon stimulus exposure, participants were asked the likelihood that the perpetrators were either Islamist extremists, far-right extremists, or lone operators. In Study 2, no information about the victims was provided, but the perpetrators were either Muslims or unidentified. In addition, we measured news consumers' Islamophobic attitudes in both studies. Results from Study 1 revealed that participants attributed perpetrator-unidentified attacks to Islamist perpetrators when the victims were non-Muslims. In contrast, terrorist attacks directed against Muslim victims were more likely to be attributed to far-right extremists. Additionally, Study 2 revealed that news consumers associated perpetrator-unidentified terrorist attacks with Islamist extremists to an equal degree as terrorist attacks that were committed by Muslim perpetrators. Attributing the attack to Islamists was in turn significantly related to Islamophobic attitudes in both studies. Implications of these findings for journalism practice and society at large are discussed.

AB  - The emergence of political neurosciencean interdisciplinary venture involving political science, psychology, and cognitive neurosciencehas piqued the interests of scholars as well as the mass public. In this chapter, we review evidence pertaining to four areas of inquiry that have generated most of the research in political neuroscience to date: (1) racial prejudice and intergroup relations; (2) the existence of partisan bias and motivated political cognition; (3) the nature of left-right differences in political orientation; and (4) the dimensional structure of political attitudes. Although these topics are well-known to political psychologists, the application of models and methods from neuroscience has renewed interest in each of them and yielded novel insights. There is reason to believe that many other areas of political psychology await similarly promising renewals and that innovative methods will continue to advance our understanding of the physiological processes involved in political cognition, evaluation, judgment, and behavior. We address limitations, criticisms, and potential pitfalls of existing workincluding the chicken-and-egg problem and propose an ambitious agenda for the next generation of research in political neuroscience.

AB  - PURPOSE:
   The major objectives of the study were to assess the knowledge, attitude & practice (KAP) towards community preparedness and response on prevention of COVID-19 among the community.
   METHOD:
   A sample survey was conducted to collect data from people admitted in a district level tertiary hospital for treatment of various health complications during COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 300 randomly selected patients and their attendants were interviewed in the hospital setting.
   RESULTS:
   The mean knowledge score was 18.73 out of 24 and the main sources of information were TV (86.5%), radio (13%), newspaper (13%), social media (13.5%), friends/relatives (14%), formal healthcare providers (6%) and religious leaders (3%). Knowledge was significantly poor among aged people, women, less educated and those on low incomes. The Majority of participants (79%) suggested wearing facemasks as effective tools to prevent COVID-19 from spreading, 56% mentioned maintaining of physical or social distance as crucial to prevent the infection. We found strong relationship between monthly total family expenses and wearing of facemasks by gender to prevent the COVID-19 (x2= 18.405; Cramer's V= .17, df = 8; sig; P= < .018). Similarly maintaining physical/social distance to prevent COVID-19 is also related to respondents' economic strata (x2= 43.741; Cramer's V= .14, df = 20; Sig; P= < .002).
   CONCLUSIONS:
   An awareness program on COVID-19 is very important to prevent the spread of the virus. Effective communication intervention with increasing treatment facilities is essential for prevention and control of COVID-19. Government and development agencies should prioritize the COVID-19 response program with regular health care services.

AB  - Parallax scrolling is a popular web technique used widely in product presentation websites, but its effect on user experience is unknown. Parallax scrolling allows the object displayed in the foreground to move faster than the object displayed in the background, so as to create a 3D effect. Dimensionality and scrolling (modality interactivity) are two major characteristics of this technique. A 2 (dimension) x 2 (modality interactivity) between-subjects (N=295) online experiment revealed that parallax scrolling influences user engagement through two routes: the cue route (perceived coolness, perceived vividness) and the action route (natural mapping, perceived ease of use). User engagement is in turn associated with positive attitudes and behavioral intentions toward the website and the product. The theoretical contribution of the study is it examined interface feature of parallax scrolling on both user perceptions and user actions using the theory of interactive media effects (TIME). The practical contribution of the study is it provides a roadmap to web developers to emphasize affective factors (i.e., vividness, coolness) rather than cognitive factors (i.e., natural mapping, perceived usefulness) when it comes to improving the user experience of the product presentation websites.

AB  - Precision mitigation of COVID-19 is in pressing need for postpandemic time with the absence of pharmaceutical interventions. In this study, the effectiveness and cost of digital contact tracing (DCT) technology-based on-campus mitigation strategy are studied through epidemic simulations using high-resolution empirical contact networks of teachers and students. Compared with traditional class, grade, and school closure strategies, the DCT-based strategy offers a practical yet much more efficient way of mitigating COVID-19 spreading in the crowded campus. Specifically, the strategy based on DCT can achieve the same level of disease control as rigid school suspensions but with significantly fewer students quarantined. We further explore the necessary conditions to ensure the effectiveness of DCT-based strategy and auxiliary strategies to enhance mitigation effectiveness and make the following recommendation: social distancing should be implemented along with DCT, the adoption rate of DCT devices should be assured, and swift virus tests should be carried out to discover asymptomatic infections and stop their subsequent transmissions. We also argue that primary schools have higher disease transmission risks than high schools and, thereby, should be alerted when considering reopenings.

AB  - Background: Flavored electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have become popular in recent years, especially among youth and young adults. To address the epidemic of e-cigarettes, New York State approved a ban on sales of most flavored vaping products other than tobacco and menthol flavors on September 17, 2019. Objective: This study aims to examine the attitude of Twitter users to the policy on flavored e-cigarettes in New York State and the impact of this policy on public perceptions of e-cigarettes. This study also compares the attitudes and topics between New York Twitter users and Twitter users from other states who were not directly affected by this policy. Methods: Tweets related to e-cigarettes and the New York State policy on flavored e-cigarettes were collected using the Twitter streaming application programming interface from June 2019 to December 2019. Tweets from New York State and those from other states that did not have a flavored e-cigarette policy were extracted. Sentiment analysis was applied to analyze the proportion of negative and positive tweets about e-cigarettes or the flavor policy. Topic modeling was applied to e-cigarette-related data sets and New York flavor policy-related data sets to identify the most frequent topics before and after the announcement of the New York State policy. Results: We found that the average number of tweets related to e-cigarettes and the New York State policy on flavored e-cigarettes increased in both New York State and other states after the flavor policy announcement. Sentiment analysis revealed that after the announcement of the New York State flavor policy, in both New York State and other states, the proportion of negative tweets on e-cigarettes increased from 34.07% (4531/13,299) to 44.58% (18,451/41,390) and from 32.48% (14,320/44,090) to 44.40% (64,262/144,734), respectively, while positive tweets decreased significantly from 39.03% (5191/13,299) to 32.86% (13,601/41,390) and from 42.78% (18,863/44,090) to 33.93% (49,105/144,734), respectively. The majority of tweets related to the New York State flavor policy were negative both before and after the announcement of this policy in both New York (87/98, 89% and 3810/4565, 83.46%, respectively) and other states (200/255, 78.4% and 12,695/15,569, 81.54%, respectively), while New York State had a higher proportion of negative tweets than other states. Topic modeling results demonstrated that teenage vaping and health problems were the most discussed topics associated with e-cigarettes. Conclusions: Public attitudes toward e-cigarettes became more negative on Twitter after New York State announced the policy on flavored e-cigarettes. Twitter users in other states that did not have such a policy on flavored e-cigarettes paid close attention to the New York State flavor policy. This study provides some valuable information about the potential impact of the flavored e-cigarettes policy in New York State on public attitudes toward flavored e-cigarettes.

AB  - The E-DEM dataset provides information on the evolution of political and affective polarisation and electoral behaviour in the aftermath of the political crisis that shook the Spanish party system starting in 2014. The dataset is formed by a four-wave online panel survey of the Spanish voting age population between late October 2018 and May 2019. The four waves coincide with key moments in Spanish political life including local, regional, national, and European elections, as well as the conviction of Catalan secessionist leaders. It also covers the six-month period of the surge of Spain's new radical right party, Vox, spanning from shortly before its first major electoral success in Spain's most populous region, Andalusia, to its consolidation in the May 2019 European elections. The sample, which reflects the general population in terms of age, gender, and geographical province, consists of 1,484 panellists who completed the four waves, while the samples for individual waves are larger, ranging from 1,659 to 2,501 respondents. The data is especially useful for researchers who wish to explore dynamics of ideological and affective polarisation, factors that explain the rise of new parties, and for those investigating the evolution of political attitudes in general.

AB  - This article discusses the effects of the televised images of the use of tear gas on people participating in the Umbrella Movement. Although the role of the Internet and social media in political mobilization has been widely discussed, the importance of television cannot be overlooked. This article argues that the widely transmitted broadcasts of live images of the police firing tear gas into the protesting crowd generated mediated instant grievances in a substantial sector of the viewing public, thus contributing to the size and scale of the Umbrella Movement. The study reported here provides evidence for this argument by analyzing the results of a survey of protesters that were on site during the early stage of the movement (N = 969). The study sought to determine whether and how the television images were related to the participants' political attitudes, reasons for participation, and views of self-mobilized actions. The findings showed that, in particular, mediated instant grievances motivated the participation of the amateur protesters in the movement.

AB  - This study examines synergy effects of entertainment and information programs on the example of a television theme night about organ donation. Participants watched either a feature film about organ donation or an unrelated entertainment program. Subsequently, all participants watched an information program about organ donation. Those who had first seen the feature film reported higher levels of issue involvement (topic interest, subjective knowledge, and information seeking), and altruistic responses (positive attitudes and behavioral intentions concerning organ donation and willingness to get a donor card). Structural equation modeling revealed that the positive effects of the feature film on issue involvement and altruistic responses varied by the extent to which participants felt moved by the feature film and by their level of cognitive elaboration about the feature film and the documentary on organ donation.

AB  - The breakout of the coronavirus disease has brought about a seismic shift in the daily lives of people worldwide. Educational institutions have been temporarily closed, and different types of lockdowns and social distancing approaches have been applied in countries around the world to delay the spread of the disease. This study investigates the determinants influencing university student intentions and use of electronic learning during the pandemic. Data were collected online from 229 respondents in different academic disciplines at various Saudi Arabian universities. The findings revealed that two factors positively affected students' behavioral intention to utilize electronic learning: trust and performance expectancy. Moreover, the findings showed the significance of facilitating conditions and behavioral intention on students' use of electronic learning during the lockdown. The study findings provide some important practical insights on how curriculum and pedagogy should be modified by adjusting learning standards and assessment tools.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, rheumatology educational programs around the world, face the daunting challenge of maintaining education for their trainees. Reduced in-person clinic exposures and social distancing requirements have significantly affected trainee education. Similar to programs around the USA, in early March 2020, our program was faced with an urgent need to pivot both our clinical and educational programs to virtual platforms. Within these limitations, we harnessed innovative educational models and restructured our curriculum to ensure adequate clinical and didactic exposure. We divided trainee's clinical rotations into four blocks, which include Inpatient consult service, Outpatient in-person and procedure clinics, Telehealth Clinics and Research/Elective week. By assigning specific rotations, we were able to ensure fellows were seeing adequate numbers of patients both through telemedicine and inperson while ensuring we complied with social distancing requirements. We further were able to ensure that trainee hands-on procedure training was not compromised. Acknowledging challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic and learner engagement in virtual environment, we designed an innovative educational portfolio. Utilizing synchronous and asynchronous learning methods, we have developed multiple complementary educational initiatives including: Rocket Rheumatology, Board Games, At the Elbow, Radiology Reading Rheum, Ultrasound Buddies, The History Rheum, and Rapid-Fire Journal Club. Virtual learning methods will become a cornerstone of medical education moving forwards. The GW Division of Rheumatology has rapidly incorporated innovative educational tools into our curriculum. Our approach will help Rheumatology training programs across the globe enhance rheumatology training.

AB  - The present study develops and empirically tests a parsimonious new multiple-item scale to measure consumers' propensities to adopt new technologies. We show that a consumer's likelihood to embrace new technologies can reliably be measured by a 14-item index that combines assessments of consumers' positive and negative attitudes towards technology. Consistent with prior work on technology readiness, we show four distinct dimensions of consumers' technology adoption propensity: two inhibiting factors, dependence and vulnerability, and two contributing factors, optimism and proficiency. We develop the index on a cross-sectional dataset of U.S. consumers then establish the validity of each of the four component scales on two dissimilar validation sets.

AB  - It is critical to prepare nurses for future practice to work in teams by engaging students in interprofessional education (IPE) that fosters positive attitudes toward teamwork. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of computer-supported IPE on students' attitudes and perceptions toward health care teamwork and team performance. A hybrid approach to IPE was used to provide students with an educational experience that combined the benefits of traditional face-to-face communication methodology with a computer-mediated platform that focused on reflection and team building. A statistically significant difference was found in students' perceptions of team performance after engaging in computer-supported IPE. No statistically significant difference in students' pretest-posttest composite attitude toward teamwork scores was noted; however, there was a positive trend toward improved scores.

AB  - On September 25, 2015, the United Nations adopted a set of goals as part of a new sustainable development agenda to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all. The most important factors to provide sutainability are sustainable production and consumption. In order for a sustainable consumption to be realized; establishment of institutional organizations that will respond to local production and consumption problems, change of consumption patterns that will lead to waste with flexible and inclusive sustainable communities by reincorporating waste generated after consumption into production are the determining factors. Consumption patterns are in a continuous cycle of change with the effect of social media and mass media. Mass media crosses all social boundaries and recreates certain perspectives, allowing information to be synthesized and spread continuously. Broadcasting programs that emphasize being a conscious consumer on television, which is one of the mass media, allows the consumption patterns to be shaped in a continuous cycle and the existing patterns to change. The aim of this study is to examine the expressions and behaviors related to food waste and sustainability on the cooking shows broadcast on Turkish televisions. In this context, three cooking shows that broadcast in 2020-2021 in Turkey are selected based on their ratings. The episodes of cooking shows consist of 2441 min in total. The episodes of the selected programs were followed in accordance with the form prepared by the researchers, and the findings on food waste and sustainability were grouped and analyzed. Based on the findings, although there are positive attitudes towards waste and sustainability in all three meal programs, there are few expressions, instructive information and information that can be transformed into practice for reducing waste and sustainability.

AB  - Driven by the proliferation of digital media, citizen science - the involvement of non-scientists in scientific research - represents one of the most important recent developments in science communication as it brings science and the public closer together. So far, however, citizen science projects have mostly attracted people that are highly educated, mostly male and already have very positive attitudes towards science. Based on nationally representative survey data (N = 1051), our study explores the potential of citizen science in Switzerland. Using regression analysis, we show that attitudes towards science are significant antecedents of respondents' interest in participating in citizen science - but that gender and education are not. In addition, latent class analysis identifies five segments, representing over one-third of the Swiss population, who are interested in citizen science and could potentially be engaged: 'Free-Timers', 'Senior Sciencephiles', 'Young Sciencephiles', 'Intrigued Adolescents' and 'Fully Employed Parents'. Additional description suggests that previously overlooked segments are best addressed online via YouTube or offline in zoos or botanical gardens. Overall, our analysis suggests that citizen science's potential is far higher than previous projects were able to realize.

AB  - Research on how families deal with setting boundaries and rules for young family members is very limited in the field of family therapy. By using content analysis methods, the six authors were able to qualitatively analyze the findings from 28 evidence-based articles from multiple journals that yielded five themes that may prove useful for educators, family therapists, researchers and parents. The five themes include: Parental Efficacy; Parenting Styles; Mediation, Monitoring and Collaboration; Adolescent Risk and Risky Behavior; and Adolescent Constructive Internet Use. Parents with positive Internet experience and parents who employed a more positive attitude toward their adolescents appeared to be more efficacious in controlling their adolescents' use of the Internet. Age and gender were important in how parents monitored the Internet usage of their daughters and sons; older adolescents were given more freedom of choice. Parents who embraced an authoritative parenting style mediated Internet use more than authoritarian or neglectful parents. Implications suggest that parents are more successful in setting boundaries when they themselves have more than basic skills, are willing to negotiate Internet use with their adolescents, and are aware of gender differences in Internet use. Therapeutic strategies for building healthy Internet use in families include: developing family values that include input from the adolescent; building parent skills and understanding of the Internet; and supporting parents in mentoring and guiding their adolescents in setting healthy boundaries that fit their maturity and gender. It is crucial that therapists help parents protect their children as they take a collaborative and positive approach to educating their children about both the risks and positive aspects of the Internet.

Clinton was friendlier, took more expansive postures, and maintained more eye contact. The candidates largely kept within social distance, except for an instance that created postdebate controversy. Whereas some of Clinton's nonverbal behavior conformed to established gendered cues, her nonverbal behavior largely transcended gender norms. Also addressed are the media's shortcomings in contextualizing debate visuals.

AB  - During the last decades the Nordic media model has been challenged by neoliberal policy and welfare retrenchment. This study asks about the extent to which the values, functions and institutions of the "media welfare state" are supported by the adult Swedish citizenry, despite political mobilization against it. Drawing on a national survey (n = 2003) this study shows that the media welfare state is generally well-supported by the population. Using exploratory statistical analysis, we identify a media welfare state of mind. While widespread in the population, this attitudinal constellation is more common in older segments of the population, in the working-class, and by those who frequently use and trust public service media. The main conclusion is that support for the media welfare state primarily can be explained by political attitudes, where left-leaning and GAL-oriented individuals are more positive than people holding right-wing and TAN-attitudes.

AB  - Providing health services through remote communications for sub-acute health issues during emergencies may help reduce the burden of the health care system and increase availability of care. This study aimed to investigate the attitudes of the public towards receiving medical services and providing medical information through remote communication in times of emergencies. During the pandemic outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), pandemic outbreak, 507 participants answered a structured online survey, rating their mean willingness to receive medical care and provide medical information, on a four-point Likert scale. Furthermore, demographic characteristics, social media use, and trust in data protection was collected. The mean willingness to receive medical services was 3.1 +/- 0.6 and the mean willingness to provide medical information was 3.0 +/- 0.7, with a strong significant correlation between the two (r= 0.76). The multiple regression model identified higher trust in data protection, level of education, and social media use as statistically significant predictors for a higher willingness to receive medical information while the first two predicted willingness to provide information. The findings suggest an overall positive attitude to receive medical care through remote communications.

AB  - Instant messaging (IM) is increasingly used for family communication amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. However, evidence remains scarce on how family e-chat groups were used and their associations with family and individual wellbeing amidst the pandemic. The numbers of family e-chat groups, functions used, and messages sent and received daily in groups were reported by 4890 adults in May 2020, and their associations with family wellbeing and personal happiness and the mediation effect of family communication quality were examined. Results showed that sending/receiving text messages was most commonly used, followed by receiving/sending photos/pictures, making voice calls, receiving/sending short videos and voice messages, and making video calls. Women and older people used more non-text functions. Higher levels of family wellbeing and personal happiness were associated with having more groups, receiving/sending photos/pictures, video calls, more IM functions used, and more IM messages received/sent daily. Forty-six point two to seventy-five point five percent of their associations with more groups and more functions used were mediated by family communication quality. People having more family e-chat groups and using more IM functions may be more resilient amidst the pandemic, while those without or with low use of family e-chat groups amidst the pandemic would need more attention and assistance in the presence of social distancing.

AB  - Although research suggests that there is no meaningful real-world connection between crime rates and undocumented immigrants, media coverage of this group almost exclusively portrays them as criminals. The present two-study investigation experimentally tests the effects of exposure to crime news depicting undocumented immigrant suspects on White viewers' social judgments. To this end, assumptions from social identity theory were applied to research and theorizing on mediated intergroup threat and compound penalties for immigrant criminality. Results from Study 1 and Study 2 indicate that when White viewers are exposed to threatening crime news featuring undocumented immigrants, out-group bias emerges in the form of harsher sentencing. In Study 1, when exposed to highly threatening coverage, attitudes toward immigration and in-group identification partially mediated and moderated this relationship, respectively.

AB  - Lack of mimicry in interpersonal interactions may thwart an individual's sense of belonging. Nonmimicked individuals are hypothesized to compensate for this by upgrading their personal relationships. In line with this hypothesis, Experiment 1 showed that nonmimicked participants enhanced their evaluation of their current romantic relationship, compared to both mimicked participants and those who had no prior interaction. Experiment 2 showed the impact of nonmimicry on a variety of close relationship evaluations using a pre- versus postmeasure design. Mediation analyses further revealed that the link between mimicry and relationship evaluations is mediated by increased belongingness needs, specifically for the nonmimicked participants. These studies show that after an interaction even with a perfect stranger, nonmimicry may frustrate one's belongingness needs and therefore lead to strengthened bonds with one's close others. Implications for (non) mimicry as a behavioral indicator of social exclusion and the presumed buffer function of close relationships are discussed.

AB  - Positive attitudes have been identified across prosocial donation domains, but have not translated into a stable donor base. One explanation for this attitude-behavior inconsistency is a failure to consider the affective and cognitive components of attitude. Studies were conducted to examine vested interest as a moderator of the attitude-behavior relationship in donation, while accounting for the multidimensional construction of attitude. Study 1 revealed a 3-factor structure (stake, salience, self-efficacy) for vested interest. Study 2 found no support for vested interest as a moderator of the attitude-behavior relationship, but revealed that self-efficacy mediated the relationship between attitudes and behaviors for organ/tissue and blood donation. Results are discussed in terms of the usefulness of this research in crafting donation campaigns.

AB  - Constructed upon Knowledge Management (KM) processes, the current study aims to investigate the interrelationship between Knowledge Sharing (KS) attitude among the faculty members and KM processes in higher education institutes (HEIs) in Pakistan along with the intervening role of subjective norms between KM processes and KS attitude. This research incorporated the theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) to conceptualize the KS behavior by using a sample frame of 302 academic and administrative staff from research-based HEIs in Quetta, Pakistan. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted on permanent faculty members from different universities of Quetta, Pakistan. The finding of the study shows a positive attitude among the researchers. The study empirically examined the interface between KM processes and KS attitude and higher education performance while providing valuable insights into the prevailing literature by investigating the mediating role of subject norms. The impact of subjective norms on KS attitude and KM process indicates the importance and basic determinant in organizational premises and improvement of skills of faculty management in HEIs. The partial mediation also reveals the importance of subjective norms in the development of faculty members' KM and KS attitude process.

AB  - The study measures the digital divide between digital/internet users and non-digital/internet users and the intersectional impact of multiple identities, i.e. gender, race and social status, on older adults in the UK. The analysis interviewed 9,246 adults aged fifty-five plus years in 2012 and 8,484 in 2014 in the English Longitudinal Study on Ageing. The digital health divide was evaluated both by CASP-19 (quality of life, QoL) and UCLA-Loneliness Scale with the intersectional effect of respondents' multiple identities and digital/internet use. The results suggested a reduction in the digital divide amongst elders in the UK. Generalised estimating equations found that, amongst regular internet users having good social status, white females attained good QoL and little loneliness (CASP-19: beta=2.921, p <0.001; Loneliness: beta=-0.631, p <0.001); and white and BME (black and minority ethnic) males both scored low on the loneliness scale (white: beta=-0.809, p < 0.001 BME: beta= -0.549, p <0.05). BME females with poor social status despite regular internet use got lower QoL and greater loneliness scores (CASP-19: beta=-3.107, p <0.05; Loneliness: beta=0.935, p <0.001), showing inequalities in their health outcomes. The intersectional perspective of cumulative disadvantages can help social workers better understand how the multiplicative effect of multiple identities socially excludes the vulnerable adults. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - The Internet and social media have profoundly changed the way the public receives and transmits news. The ability of the web to quickly disperse information both geographically and temporally allows social media to reach a much wider audience compared to traditional mass media. A powerful role is played by sharing, as millions of people routinely share news on social media platforms, influencing each other by transmitting their mood and feelings to others through emotional contagion. Thus, social media has become crucial in driving public perception and opinion. Humans have an instinctive fear of large carnivores, but such a negative attitude may be amplified by news media presentations and their diffusion on social media. Here, we investigated how reports of predator attacks on humans published in online newspapers spread on social media. By means of multi-model inference, we explored the contribution of four factors in driving the number of total shares (NTS) of news reports on social media: the graphic/sensationalistic content, the presence of images, the species, as well as the newspaper coverage. According to our results, the information delivered by social media is highly biased toward a graphic/sensationalistic view of predators. Thus, such negative coverage might lead to an unjustified and amplified fear in the public with consequent lower tolerance toward predators and decrease in the support for conservation plans. However, because social media represents a powerful communication tool, its role might be reversed to positive if used appropriately. Thus, constant engagement of scientists on social media would be needed to both disseminate more accurate information on large carnivores and stem the tide of misinformation before its widespread diffusion, a crucial step for effective predator conservation.

AB  - Three experiments tested whether verification of ingroup morality increases engagement in collective action in favor of immigrants' rights. To that end, participants were exposed to (a) verifying, (b) negatively discrepant, (c) enhancing, or (d) no feedback about the morality of their group in general (Studies 1-2) or specifically in matters of corruption (Study 3). Results show that those who received verifying feedback of their group's morality were more willing to engage in collective action than those who received negative or no feedback. These effects seemed to be mediated by increased anger over immigrants' disadvantage and positive attitudes towards them. Critically, enhancing feedback exerted similar effects as verifying feedback, although the latter yielded more stable and consistent results across the studies. These results suggest that appeals to collective ingroup morality can be effective to promote immigrants' rights, especially when members of the host society feel that others consider them as moral as they perceive themselves.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate awareness of the Eat Well Campaign (EWC) among parents and assess perceptions about its effectiveness. Design: Post-campaign evaluation study with a cross-section of parents recruited through random digit dialling. Participants completed an online survey about EWC awareness, its perceived effectiveness among parents and their meal planning practices (attitudes, behaviours and self-efficacy). Setting: A federal mass-media campaign disseminated by Health Canada (2013-2014) to promote meal planning to Canadian parents. Participants: Parents (n 964) of children aged 2-12 years from all Provinces and Territories. Results: Of respondents, 41 % (390/964) were aware of the campaign; Quebec City and rural Quebec had the highest rates of awareness, whereas Vancouver, Winnipeg and Toronto had the lowest. Awareness was greater among parents with lower income, basic education and French-speakers. Campaign intensity was significantly associated with greater odds of reporting positive attitudes towards the EWC and meal planning (P < 0 center dot 05). Campaign awareness was significantly associated with greater odds of believing that meal planning helps maintain a healthy diet (OR = 1 center dot 68, 95 % CI 1 center dot 03, 2 center dot 74) and planning meals (OR = 1 center dot 66, 95 % CI 1 center dot 03, 2 center dot 54), but not self-efficacy, in adjusted models. Conclusions: The present study is the first to evaluate an initiative that promoted meal planning with mass media. The EWC demonstrated evidence of success in terms of equitable access to a nutrition initiative by reaching lower-income and less-educated parents. Understanding behavioural factors among different segments of the population will be important to target appropriate audiences and develop tailored interventions that support healthy eating practices.

AB  - Research has found that discrepancies exist in many health-related behaviors, leading to discrepancies in health outcomes, between men and women. Among these, women tend to have more positive attitudes towards sleep and better sleep hygiene practices despite often having poorer sleep quality and insufficient sleep duration. The present study operationalized sleep hygiene as multi-faceted behaviors rather than a unitary construct. Using the PROCESS macro, we analyzed whether an interaction exists between gender and sleep attitudes to predict sleep hygiene, if sleep hygiene mediated the relationship between sleep attitudes and sleep outcomes, and if this indirect relationship is moderated by gender. Within our sample, gender moderated sleep attitudes predicting environment- and eating-related sleep hygiene behaviors. Sleep quality was indirectly predicted by sleep attitudes via pre-sleep arousal-related sleep hygiene behaviors. Additionally, gender moderated the indirect relationship between sleep attitudes and sleep quality through environment-related sleep hygiene behaviors. These findings reinforce the relevance of studying sleep attitudes in combination with demographic characteristics as predictors of sleep outcomes, and the usefulness of conceptualizing sleep hygiene as separable factors. It may help inform development of potential interventions intended to improve sleep and suggest directions for future studies.

AB  - Research question: This research examines the determinants and conditions that influence local sport fans' evaluations of satellite fans (i.e. foreign fans abroad) of their favorite team. Specifically, we consider how prototypical (versus non-prototypical) sport fan behavior of the satellite fans influences the local fans' perceptions of group entitativity and attitudes. In addition, the study takes into account the local fans' fear of losing resources as a result of the internationalization of team sports as a moderating condition in the investigated relationship. Research methods: The hypotheses are tested in two online experiments that use the first football divisions of Spain (study 1) and Germany (study 2) as the empirical setting. Results and findings: The findings indicate that prototypical (versus non-prototypical) fan behavior of satellite fans results in more positive attitudes towards them among local fans. This effect is mediated by increases in the perceived entitativity of the fan group as a whole. The results also highlight that the effects of prototypicality decrease the more the local fans perceive the internationalization of team sports to be a process that deprives them of social (e.g. identity enhancement) and economic (e.g. ticket availability) resources.

AB  - While research has indicated that perceiving alcohol-related posts on Facebook can be predictive of future alcohol consumption for college students, little research has considered the consequences of posting about alcohol on future behavior. The purpose of this study was to consider the pathways through which alcohol-related posts on Facebook may lead to increased drinking among the college students who make these posts. Incoming college freshmen (310 participants) from 2 universities were interviewed before their freshman year of college (T1) and again 1 year later (T2), and their Facebook profiles were evaluated for alcohol-related posts during the academic year. A positive attitude toward alcohol before freshman year was positively related to drinking activity before sophomore year. This relationship was mediated by alcohol-related Facebook posts during the academic year and the percentage of friends reported to be drinkers before sophomore year. Theoretically, this is evidence of identity shift online, as well as a Facebook-induced friend shift. These findings highlight the role that Facebook may play in both identity development and friendship cultivation for college freshmen, and offer insight into future collegiate drinking prevention and intervention initiatives.

AB  - Diversity awareness has enormous benefits, and universities in the United States increasingly require students to complete diversity-related courses. Prior research has demonstrated that students' initial attitudes toward these courses affect their subsequent engagement, as well as the quality of their learning experience; however, very little research has examined how these initial attitudes are formed. We conducted an experiment to examine this issue in the context of a women's and gender studies course in psychology. Participants read one of two identical course descriptions that varied only the course title (i.e., Psychology of Gender versus Psychology of Women) and instructor gender. Participants perceived a women-titled course to be narrowly focused compared to an identical gender-titled course and were more interested in taking the gender-titled course. Instructor gender had no effects on any of the variables. Additionally, female participants had more positive attitudes toward the course than male participants, regardless of title. Exploratory mediation analyses indicated that the main effects of course title and participant gender were mediated by perceptions of course content. Implications for improving student experiences and interest in diversity-related courses are discussed.

AB  - Aggression research often relies upon convenient samples with unknown generalizability to populations of interest, potentially threatening external validity. This article details the measurement properties of the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire Short Form (BPAQ-SF) and its subscales in two nationally representative U.S. samples (N = 924) and a concurrent study with U.S. college students (N = 384). The results provide useful benchmarks for generalizing BPAQ-SF results from convenient samples to U. S. adults, including distributions, reliability, and factor structure. The results also confirm basic relationships between trait aggression and key social and demographic variables such as sex, age, and socioeconomic status while establishing convergent validity with violent political attitudes. Results from the national studies closely align with those from the student sample, providing reasonable support for generalizing trait aggression elements to U.S. adults.

AB  - In March 2020, telemedicine and HIV self-testing were adopted by Brazilian Public Health services to minimize disruptions in pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) access and delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand the acceptability of PrEP teleconsultation and HIV self-testing, we conducted a web-based study during social distancing period (April-May, 2020) among men who have sex with men and transgender/non-binary individuals using social media. Out of the 2375 HIV negative respondents, 680 reported PrEP use and were included in this analysis. Median age was 33 years (IQR: 28-40), 98% cisgender men, 56% white, 74% high education, and 68% middle/high income. Willingness to use HIVST was 79% and 32% received an HIV self-testing during social distancing period. The majority reported preference for PrEP/HIV self-testing home delivery instead of collecting at the service. PrEP teleconsultation was experienced by 21% and most reported feeling satisfied with the procedures. High acceptability of PrEP teleconsultation was reported by 70%. In ordinal logistic model, having higher education was associated with high aceptability of PrEP teleconsultation (aOR:1.62; 95%CI: 1.07-2.45). Our results point out that PrEP teleconsultation and PrEP/HIV self-testing home delivery could be implemented by PrEP services in Brazil to avoid PrEP shortage during the COVID-19 pandemic and thereafter as an option to increase retention and adherence.

AB  - Exergames are now often implemented among older adults for health purposes. This study aimed to investigate whether playing Kinect and Wii exergames has effects on older adults' physical fitness and psychological perceptions towards exergames. A total of 23 older participants aged above 60 years were recruited and randomly assigned into two groups, in which they played either Kinect or Wii Bowling exergames for three sessions in one week. Physiological and psychological measures were collected including heart rate, blood pressure, shoulder flexibility, as well as perceived benefits and intentions for future use. Findings indicated that exergames are equivalent to light-intensity exercises, and hence pose no or minimal risk to older adults. Older adults had a positive attitude towards exergames and have a strong willingness to engage in exergaming on a regular basis. Although no significant platform difference was identified, observation and qualitative findings suggested that Wii might provide a more intense physical activity than Kinect, while Kinect might obtain a higher perception among older adults than Wii. The study has several practical implications for both health professionals and exergame designers targeting the ageing population.

AB  - Goal self-concordance reflects self-generated personal goals aligning with people's interests and core values in one's implicit personality as organic components, which is measured by the "perceived locus of causality" PLOC. Pursuing and achieving self-concordant goals both predict diversified outcomes in need-satisfaction, mental and physical well-being, positive attitude and behavior, etc. Based on expounding and sorting out the concept and measurement about goal self-concordance, the author analyzes the differences among a series of goal self-concordance theories. This paper focuses on the latest research trends and summarizes five influencing aspects of goal self-concordance: mental health, cognition, emotion, personal will, and behavioral outcomes. The mediating effects are discussed concerning antecedents and influence effects, the influence effects are shown in three aspects including the characteristics of individual, target, and environment. While the antecedent effects are respectively reflected in self-insight, personality, empowerment, and self-supported environment, content, and context of the goal itself. Finally, the author proposes several potential research interests from a broader perspective based on the current literature.

AB  - This study aimed to use path analysis to determine the association between perceived parental attitudes toward restricting junk food (JF)/sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) intake and JF/SSB consumption among Chinese adolescents, and whether JF/SSB availability in the home environment and autonomous motivation of adolescents mediated the association. A cross-sectional survey was conducted using questionnaires adapted from the Family Life, Activity, Sun, Health, and Eating (FLASHE) Study to collect data on 3819 participants with an average age of 14.7 years (SD = 1.7). Spearman correlations and path analysis were performed. It was found that perceived parental attitudes were not directly associated with adolescents' JF/SSB consumption frequency, but indirectly related to them through JF/SSB availability in the home environment and autonomous motivation of adolescents. When parents held a less positive attitude toward JF/SSB consumption and kept less JFs/SSBs at home, youth displayed more autonomous motivation for restricting JF/SSB intake and consumed fewer JFs/SSBs.</p>

AB  - Introduction: Many young adults demonstrate insufficient rates of physical activity (PA) to yield health benefits. The study tested the effectiveness of a text messaging intervention targeting key psychological determinants and PA.
   Methods: Participants received either attitude messages, goal priority messages, a combination of these, or generic PA information (control). After confirming that groups were matched at baseline, a 2 (attitude: yes vs. no) by 2 (goal priority: yes vs. no) by 2 (time: immediately post-intervention, four weeks post-intervention) randomized control trial tested main and interactive effects.
   Results: Results showed participants that received attitude messages had significantly more positive attitudes, intentions and rates of PA. Mediational analyses showed the influence of attitude messages on PA to be fully mediated through the serial path via attitude and intention. There were no other main or interactive effects.
   Conclusion: The study provides support for using attitudinal messages delivered via text messaging to influence key psychological determinants and PA.

AB  - The ownership of smartphones has become usual, research showing associations between smartphone usage, addiction, and the users' individual characteristics. Our first objective is to examine the short form of Smartphone Addiction Scale. We also aimed to examine the relationships between smartphone addiction and the use of various smartphone applications. The findings show that the Smartphone Addiction Scale has good psychometric qualities. The number of hours spent using the smartphone, its general use, the positive attitudes towards it and the anxiety without technology mediate the relation between personality traits and the risk for addiction. Neuroticism, openness and conscientiousness predict the risk for smartphone addiction negatively. Although the present research is conducted in a new cultural context, the findings confirm several privious studies. The usefulness of technology cannot be challenged, but we believe it is necessary to pay more attention to the young people in lower educational cycles to prevent the excessive use of smartphones.

AB  - Guided by the theory of reasoned action, this study built a model to examine the ways in which mental health literacy (MHL), personal stigma, self-stigma, and social support collectively influence attitudes toward mental health help-seeking. A sample of 211 participants (age range 22-64; 67.62% females) from a cross-sectional survey that examined MHL of local public housing staffs in Texas were included in a structural equation modeling analysis. MHL directly influenced attitudes. Personal and self-stigma did not mediate the relationship between MHL and attitudes. Yet, self-stigma was significantly associated with attitudes. Social support positively predicted attitudes. Findings suggest the need for improving MHL and strengthening social support to promote positive attitudes toward mental health help-seeking. Mental health education to those who are at risk for mental illness and to families who are likely to influence help-seeking attitudes of those with mental illness could be useful.

AB  - To date, researchers have frequently investigated students' attitudes toward courses supported by problem-based learning. There are several studies with different results in the literature. It is necessary to combine and interpret the findings of these studies through a meta-analysis method. This method aims to combine different results of similar and independent studies through statistical techniques. Research findings of 47 studies that meet the criteria for meta-analysis are included in the meta-analysis of the study to determine the effects of problem-based learning on students' attitudes as compared to traditional teaching. Also, some mediator variables are as follows: the status of a study, application time, education levels, scientific field of application, and sample size. As a result of the analysis, it has been found that problem-based learning has a low positive effect on students' attitudes. It means that problem-based learning is effective in helping students gain a positive attitude toward courses.

   This work supplies a theoretical approach to evaluate public attitude towards university campuses and to detect the relationship with host-city variables using data about facial expression scores on social network services at the national scale.
   Abstract Public attitudes towards local university matters for the resource investment to sustainable science and technology. The application of machine learning techniques enables the evaluation of resource investments more precisely even at the national scale. In this study, a total number of 4327 selfies were collected from the social network services (SNS) platform of Sina Micro-Blog for check-in records of 92 211-Project university campuses from 82 cities of 31 Provinces across mainland China. Photos were analyzed by the FireFACE(TM)-V1.0 software to obtain scores of happy and sad facial expressions and a positive response index (PRI) was calculated (happy-sad). One-way analysis of variance indicated that both happy and PRI scores were highest in Shandong University and lowest in Harbin Engineering University. The national distribution of positive expression scores was highest in Changchun, Jinan, and Guangzhou cities. The maximum likelihood estimates from general linear regression indicated that the city-variable of the number of regular institutions of higher learning had the positive contribution to the happy score. The number of internet accesses and area of residential housing contributed to the negative expression scores. Therefore, people tend to show positive expression at campuses in cities with more education infrastructures but fewer residences and internet users. The geospatial analysis of facial expression data can be one approach to supply theoretical evidence for the resource arrangement of sustainable science and technology from universities.

AB  - Lublin is a city located in the eastern part of Poland, which is an important place of cultural heritage, being the venue where the Polish-Lithuanian Union was signed 450 years ago in 2019. This article presents "Architectural Jewels of Lublin," a computerized serious board game for two players. The aim of the game is to collect points for recognizing models of the city's historic architectural objects and their correct position on the board. They represent the landmarks of the historic Old Town quarter. Another point of the game is to answer questions about the cultural heritage of Lublin. 3D models of historic buildings were initially designed manually and then 3D printed in FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) technology. The correct location of the object on the board is identified by sensors working in the RFID (Radio-Frequency IDentification) technology supported by two microcontrollers of an Arduino platform, which were connected to the software managing the whole game shown on a tablet monitor. The game is used both to promote Lublin at numerous cyclical cultural and science popularization events, and during conferences and seminars organized for circles representing cultural heritage from Poland and abroad. It is aimed at presenting a way to integrate many different contemporary digital technologies that can serve education in the area of cultural heritage. The game, in contrast to popular games using VR and AR technologies, combines in an interesting way physical and digital space using modern computer technologies. The research carried out on the participants of the game has shown its high effectiveness in raising the historical awareness of its participants, as well as the players' positive attitude toward the game.

AB  - Judging others' personalities is an essential skill in successful social living, as personality is a key driver behind people's interactions, behaviors, and emotions. Although accurate personality judgments stem from social-cognitive skills, developments in machine learning show that computer models can also make valid judgments. This study compares the accuracy of human and computer-based personality judgments, using a sample of 86,220 volunteers who completed a 100-item personality questionnaire. We show that (i) computer predictions based on a generic digital footprint (Facebook Likes) are more accurate (r = 0.56) than those made by the participants' Facebook friends using a personality questionnaire (r = 0.49); (ii) computer models show higher inter-judge agreement; and (iii) computer personality judgments have higher external validity when predicting life outcomes such as substance use, political attitudes, and physical health; for some outcomes, they even outperform the self-rated personality scores. Computers outpacing humans in personality judgment presents significant opportunities and challenges in the areas of psychological assessment, marketing, and privacy.

KW  - moral anxiety
KW  - youth
KW  - social exclusion
KW  - memory
AB  - A substantial body of research suggests that incipient moral anxiety is growing in relation to excluded youth, and is manifestly cross-national in nature. While these anxieties are often assumed to be most evident in recent times, historians of childhood and youth persistently remind us of the long history of anxiety recorded in the public record about disadvantaged urban youth [e.g. Gleason. 2013. Small Matters: Canadian Children in Sickness and Health, 1900-1940. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press]. However, the degree and nature of local differentiation in the forms of moral anxiety being generated have yet to be systematically researched in relation to youth exclusion in diverse city spaces. There is also limited research on how senior members living in the same city spaces, many of whom were excluded as young people, remember and re-represent - through individual and collective memory - what it was like to be young in the past [Cubbit. 2007. History and Memory. Manchester: Manchester University Press]. Drawing on cross national studies and diverse sources, including oral history accounts, media representations, and interviews with young people, this article explores the perspectives of low-income young people living at the fringe of two different urban centres and who identified as having experienced varying degrees of educational and/or social exclusion. We argue that such multi-layered analyses challenge the binaries often invoked about inclusion, exclusion and marginalised youth, particularly concerning questions about history, memory, and the bordering and classification practices of individuals [see Balibar. 2009a. We, the People of Europe?: Reflections on Transnational Citizenship. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press; Rumford. 2011. Citizens and Borderwork in Contemporary Europe. London: Routledge]. More specifically, the article analyses representations of exclusion, in the present and past, in reference to what Balibar, We, the People of Europe?: Reflections on Transnational Citizenship, has termed 'borderwork'. Overall, we argue that narratives of risk, forms of border anxiety [Newman. 2006. "Borders and Bordering: Towards an Interdisciplinary Dialogue." European Journal of Social Theory 9 (2): 171-186] and the consequent moralising claims made about economically disadvantaged youth are crucial in understanding how youth exclusion is represented and remembered, and made and remade across time and place.

AB  - The successful implementation of pediatric audiology services depends on parental engagement and support. It is essential to analyze the gaps in knowledge level and attitude of the parents in United Arab Emirates (UAE), towards pediatric hearing loss and pediatric audiology services. The present study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitude of parents in Sharjah, UAE.A cross-sectional survey was administered to 295 parents in a tertiary care hospital setting. The self-reported questionnaire consisted of 26 items. 34.2% of the parents ascertaining good knowledge and 65.8% reported poor knowledge regarding the various factors related to the childhood hearing loss. Further, 86.2% of parents reported positive attitudes regarding accessing pediatric audiology services. A significant association was found between age groups, educational status, and knowledge levels. The study highlights the poor knowledge demonstrated by parents in the UAE regarding hearing loss and its associated risk factors. Findings outline the critical need in the region to enhance parental awareness. More health promotion activities and community outreach campaigns are necessary to increase the uptake of pediatric audiology services in the region.

AB  - Mate poaching, where an individual attempts to attract a pair-bonded individual, is a risky mating tactic. Yet, it is surprisingly common. Although many studies have investigated individual differences in mate poaching, few have examined potentially relevant ecological factors, such as mate availability. In this study, 254 unmated North American adults were primed with either perceived mate scarcity or abundance, and subsequently completed measures of fear of being single, intrasexual competitiveness, and attitudes toward mate poaching. Results from a sequential mediation model revealed that men and women primed with mate scarcity held a more positive attitude toward mate poaching relative to those primed with mate abundance, and that this link was mediated by an induced fear of being single and intrasexual competitiveness. Our results suggest that mate poaching is a facultative adaptation of human mating psychology driven by intrasexual competitiveness that is activated in response to environments of low mate availability. It highlights the need for researchers to consider ecological cues when studying individual variation in mate poaching behavior.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of using Google Classroom on the reading and writing performance of diploma students with English as a Foreign Language (EFL) in Jordan. It aimed to investigate the attitudes of students toward using Google Classroom as an innovative online platform. A total of 26 EFL Syrian diploma students participated in this study; the participants sat in one intact group. The researchers employed a quasi-experimental design and one-group pretest-posttest design based on the quantitative data. The data were collected through a reading and writing test and a questionnaire. According to the results of the study, Google Classroom improved the reading and writing performance of Syrian students. Students showed positive attitudes toward using Google Classroom in terms of its ease of use, usefulness, and accessibility. Future studies should analyze the effectiveness of Google Classroom with respect to other contexts. This study affirmed the liability of utilizing Google Classroom in wider contexts.

AB  - Although the negative economic impacts of COVID-19 are undiscovered, the tourism industry is recognized as one of the most vulnerable sectors. Considering tourism's contribution to Malaysia's GDP, this study aims to examine vendors' attitudes and perceptions towards international tourists in night markets after the emergence of COVID-19 and the impacts of propagation power of COVID-19 on vendors' perceptions in Malaysia. As large numbers of informal workers lost 60% of their income worldwide due to the pandemic, a lack of research is observed on vendors' attitudes after the pandemic, especially in Southeast Asia. The study model was derived on the basis of the revised social exchange theory (SET). A questionnaire survey was conducted among local vendors in Malaysia using a multistage probability sampling method. Findings revealed that place attachment has a significant effect on positive perception but not negative perception towards international tourists' receptiveness. Results indicate that positive perceptions towards international tourists significantly and positively mediate the relationship among place attachment, economic gain, and involvement with tourist receptiveness. Moreover, the research concluded that vendors still have positive attitudes towards international tourists' receptiveness due to economic gain and their place attachment and involvement levels during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify how pre-service teachers' self-efficacy beliefs for technology integration (SETI) can be improved during the coursework intervention, and which of the course factors (instructional media development skills, knowledge on technology, and lesson planning practice) has the highest impact on the SETI. This research also attempted to explore a more inclusive path of the direct and indirect influences between SETI and other non-course variables (computer use, teachers' attitude towards computers (TAC), changes in TAC). A total of 136 undergraduate students at a teacher education university in Korea participated in the study. Our data analyses illustrated significant increase of prospective teachers' SETI after their completion of education technology course resulting mostly from lesson planning practice. The hierarchical multiple regression revealed that the pre-service teachers with higher positive attitudes toward computers and greater ability for lesson planning showed higher increase in their levels of SETI. The path analysis indicated that these two factors influenced the SETI directly, rather than indirectly. Lesson planning practice did not affect pre-service teachers' attitudinal growth. Implications on effectiveness of the lesson planning and attitudinal factors on SETI, and suggestions for teacher education course design are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The recent rise of political extremity and radicalization has presented unique challenges to contemporary politics, governance, and social cohesion in many societies in the world. In this study, we propose an imagined audience approach to understand how social media's expanded expression capabilities are related to users' political extremity and reduced network interaction. We demonstrate the usefulness of our imagined audience framework using a multi-country survey data set. Results from the United States, South Korea, and Japan reveal that expressive use of social media is associated with more extreme political attitudes and heightened intolerance, but the effect is contingent on whom the expresser has in mind as their audience. In particular, expressing one's political self has a depolarizing effect for those expecting low audience reinforcement. We test the boundary conditions of our model in a more restricted information environment with a Chinese sample. We conclude by discussing the significance of our imagined audience approach and its relevance to today's technology-mediated self-presentation.

AB  - This study assesses Jordanian community pharmacists' readiness and willingness to deliver vaccination services in their practice sites. Between February and April 2021, a self-administered online questionnaire was distributed via social media, WhatsApp messages, and personal communication. The questionnaire targeted practicing community pharmacies. Descriptive and inferential data analysis was carried out. A total of 403 community pharmacists participated in the study. Almost 146 (36%) community pharmacists reported vaccinating patients in their practice sites. However, readiness assessment revealed that only 54 (13.4%) pharmacists received the required training and qualifications. Moreover, 33 (8.2%) study participants worked in adequately equipped and designed community pharmacies. Overall, surveyed participants held positive attitudes toward their involvement in vaccination services: 260 (64.5%) pharmacists were willing to vaccinate patients, and 227 (65.0%) out of unready, unqualified, participants were willing to get needed training and qualifications. According to study participants, regulatory and professional bodies (Ministry of Health, Jordan Pharmacists Association) are influential in supporting pharmacist-vaccinators. Among the investigated factors, organizational structure and employment status were significantly associated with pharmacists' readiness to deliver vaccination. This study revealed that further work is needed to increase pharmacists' and pharmacies' readiness to deliver vaccination services and that regulators should follow a more active approach in highlighting the importance of training and the impact of training in patients' safety and satisfaction.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effect of bio-banding on indicators of talent identification in academy soccer players. Seventy-two 11 to 14-year-old soccer players were bio-banded using percentage of estimated adult stature attainment (week 1), maturity-offset (week 2) or a mixed-maturity method (week 3). Players contested five maturity (mis)matched small-sided games with physical and psychological determinants measured. Data were analysed using a series of Bayesian hierarchical models, fitted with different response distributions and different random and fixed effect structures. Few between-maturity differences existed for physical measures. Pre-peak height velocity (PHV) and post-PHV players differed in PlayerLoad(TM) (anterior-posterior and medial-lateral) having effect sizes above our criterion value. Estimated adult stature attainment explained more of the variance in eight of the physical variables and showed the greatest individual differences between maturity groups across all psychological variables. Pre-PHV and post-PHV players differed in positive attitude, confidence, competitiveness, total psychological score (effect sizes = 0.43-0.69), and session rating of perceived exertion. The maturity-offset method outperformed the estimated adult stature attainment method in all psychological variables. Maturity-matched bio-banding had limited effect on physical variables across all players while enhancing a number of psychological variables considered key for talent identification in pre-PHV players.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to evaluate how the relationship between employees' workspace satisfaction and their respective perceptions of workspace support to labour productivity interacts with two emotional experiences as follows: workspace attachment and job stress.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Web-based surveys conducted before and after a company's short-distance relocation. Study 1 concerned 66 employees and was conducted a few weeks before the relocation. Study 2 concerned 84 employees and was conducted six months after the relocation. Ordinary least squares regression, moderation and mediation analysis were performed.
   Findings
   After the relocation, the employees experienced greater job stress, less workspace satisfaction, and they felt less attached to their workspaces. However, the evaluations of workspace support to labour productivity did not change. Contrary to expectations, employees' workspace satisfaction is not related to their evaluation of this workspace as supporting labour productivity. Instead, this relationship is moderated by job stress. The hypothesis that workspace attachment mediates the relationship between workspace satisfaction and respective evaluation of this workspace as supporting labour productivity was not verified.
   Practical implications
   Corporate real estate managers and any manager leading short-distance relocation projects should consider incorporating change management in the projects to maintain employees' positive attitudes and emotional bonds with their workspace.
   Originality/value
   This research improves the knowledge of how employees perceive the workspace as supporting their work duties.

AB  - A healthy diet prevents type 2 diabetes but is often difficult to adhere to. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate whether eating competence is associated with diet or risk factors and prevalence of type 2 diabetes in individuals screened for type 2 diabetes risk. Eating competence is an indicator of food acceptance, positive attitudes, internal regulation and contextual skills related to food and eating. In total, 3147 Finnish adults aged 18-74 at an increased risk for type 2 diabetes identified via online risk screening participated in the baseline examinations of the Stop Diabetes (StopDia) study. The participants filled out the digital questionnaire on food intake, physical activity and sleep, and the Satter Eating Competence Inventory 2.0(TM) (ecSI 2.0(TM)). In addition, anthropometric and laboratory measurements were performed at primary healthcare centres. Eating competent individuals (37%, classified by ecSI 2.0(TM)) had a better quality of diet (p < 0.05 for all). Additionally, eating competence was associated with a lower prevalence of previously undiagnosed type 2 diabetes, abdominal obesity, metabolic syndrome and hypertriglyceridaemia, and with better insulin sensitivity (p < 0.05 for all). However, these associations, except for metabolic syndrome, were at least partly mediated by body mass index. Eating competence is associated with a healthy diet and could, thus, in the long term, support the prevention of type 2 diabetes.

AB  - The current experimental study (N = 546) compares the effect of exposure to a television news story with a positive and negative tone on anti-immigrant attitudes and carry-over effects to uninvolved immigrant groups. Results reveal that exposure to a "negatively" valenced news story about North African immigrants increased negative attitudes toward that same group. Importantly, however, we find carryover effects of exposure to a "positively" valenced news story about North African immigrants to attitudes toward uninvolved immigrant groups. Together, these findings show that the effect of exposure to television news tone has more ramifications than previously thought, and that the impact of exposure to a positive or negative news story differs for direct effects vis-a-vis carry-over effects.

AB  - Direct potable water recycling (DPR) is increasingly recognized as an important strategy in the face of water shortage. DPR often is challenged by a lack of public support and in some cases has been overturned by public opposition alone. Severe drought in Texas in recent years has resulted in several cities in that state considering and passing DPR policies for the first time in the United States. We present three case studies-two from cities that passed and implemented DPR policies and one that considered and ultimately tabled a DPR plan. We use multiple data sources including public surveys and policy maker interviews, newspaper articles, and city meeting minutes to examine the discourse on these policies in public, media, and political spheres. Importantly, we explore the connection between regulatory, structural, environmental, political, and communication factors in each case as they intersect with public attitudes, including expressions of disgust and perceived risk which have featured in experimental research on perceptions of water recycling. By exploring these factors holistically, we are able to examine some of the ways these public attitudinal factors interact in real-world contexts with implications for future policy making and studies of local decision-making under uncertainty.

AB  - With the popularity of virtual reality (VR) devices, advertisers are starting to seek the potential advertising tactics and effects in VR. This study investigates the influence of introducing 3D animated agents on video ad effectiveness in a VR context (i.e., brand/product attitude, brand/product recall, purchase intention, and ad-skipping behavior). Findings from a between-subjects experiment in Study 1 confirmed that when 2D video ads are played in a VR environment, the presence of 3D animated agents will make the audiences enjoy the ad-viewing experience more and promote the audiences' positive attitudes toward the brand and the product and their purchase intention indirectly. In Study 2, employing a large industry dataset of VR users, we found that the presence of 3D animated agents can also decrease the ad-skipping rate while the 2D ads are playing. This study provides empirical support for the use of animated agents as an effective adversiting tactic in a VR context. How these findings link to previous research and their practical implications are discussed as future directions.

AB  - Background: There is a documented need to build capacity for theory- and evidence-informed knowledge translation (KT) and patient engagement (PE) practice in health research. Dissemination of foundational content online coupled with social media promotion may build capacity by increasing awareness, knowledge, and positive attitudes.
   Objective: This retrospective study sought to (1) describe exposure and engagement of the KnowledgeNudge KT and PE dissemination strategy (online blog and Twitter profile) over 2 years and (2) identify and compare characteristics of individual posts with the most and least exposure and reach.
   Methods: Exposure was assessed by blog site views per month and Twitter profile impressions per month. Engagement was assessed by Twitter profile interactions per month. Descriptive statistics were calculated for 6-month blocks and compared using one-way analysis of variance or Student t test. Individual post exposure was assessed by average post views per week. Individual post reach was assessed by average post reads per week. High- and low-profile blog posts with the highest and lowest 10th percentile for exposure and reach were identified.
   Results: A total of 99 posts and 755 tweets were published during the study period. There was a significant increase in exposure (P=.004) and reach (P<.001) during the final 6 months. Seven high-profile and 6 low-profile posts were identified. High-profile posts had a significantly greater average word count than low-profile posts (P=.003). There were no other significant differences between posts.
   Conclusions: The increases in KnowledgeNudge exposure and engagement offer preliminary evidence in support of this dissemination strategy for the practice of KT and PE. Variation in individual post exposure and reach warrants further exploration to tailor content to user needs. Future work will include a prospective evaluation strategy to explore the effect of KnowledgeNudge on awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and behavior.

AB  - We examined the effect of different persuasion interventions in social media (central route vs. peripheral route vs. no persuasion) on attitude toward elite sport policies. We conducted 2 experimental studies with a college student sample (Study I) and a sample drawn from the general public (nonstudent sample, Study II). Results indicated that in the student sample, attitude of the peripheral-route-persuasion group toward elite sport policies was significantly more positive than that of either the no-persuasion group or the central-route-persuasion group. However, results from the nonstudent sample suggested that both the central-route-persuasion and peripheral-route-persuasion groups had more positive attitude toward elite sport policies than did the no-persuasion group. Involvement did not moderate the persuasion-attitude relationship in either the student or nonstudent sample. The findings from this research indicate that a more concise way of communication (peripheral route) is more effective for persuading college students. Government agents may adopt the findings from this research to customize persuasion interventions to influence their target audience effectively.

AB  - When and how will personal financial (aka "pocketbook") concerns drive citizens' political decisions? Scholars remain puzzled by the mismatch between the expectation that pocketbook voting should occur and the reality that, according to most findings, it usually does not. Using original survey data collected immediately after Iceland's second "Icesave" referendum (2011), I first report the results of an embedded experiment that successfully evokes greater pocketbook concern. Next, I analyze the determinants of retrospective pocketbook evaluations, showing that priming effects are conditioned by political sophistication such that high sophisticates are among the most likely to report negative economic assessments. I then turn to the consequences of these egocentric views for government approval. Mediation analysis confirms a significant indirect effect, suggesting that subjective pocketbook evaluations exert a strong influence on political attitudes that has been hidden in prior work. Results illuminate the contextual, cognitive, and causal circumstances under which pocketbook effects transpire and suggest new ways in which self-interest might matter for attitudes toward international political economy issues.

AB  - Texas has experienced levels of seismicity comparable to areas of California in recent years, and seismologists suggest that the increased activity in Texas is likely the result of human activities associated with oil and gas extraction. However, the general public is largely unaware of induced seismicity and related risks. To better understand this lack of awareness and how it might be addressed, we sought guidance from Kahlor's (2010) planned risk information seeking model to explore the social-psychological factors that are likely to influence Texan's intentions to seek information about the potential risks posed by earthquakes. We test the model using data collected from residents in five Texas communities that have varied experiences with seismicity. The data supports the model: the variance in intentions to seek information about earthquake risks were largely explained by positive attitudes towards seeking such information, perceived control over the ability to seek such information, perceived social pressure related to seeking such information, perceived earthquake risks, risk-related emotion (e.g., worry) and a perceived need for more information about earthquake risks. The study highlights the applicability of this risk information-seeking model to the context of seismic risk, and suggests ways in which scientists and communicators might engage the public more effectively with the topic.

AB  - Paediatric ward nurses' action intentions and attitudes towards quit smoking interventions and their knowledge on second-hand smoke
   This survey study investigated the paediatric ward nurses for their action intentions and attitudes towards quit smoking-related interventions (QSRI), and knowledge related to effects of children's exposure to second-hand smoke (SHS) (n = 267). Results indicate that less than 2% of the nurses smoked, and a majority had a positive attitude towards QSRI. A majority also indicated that they would only assess children's parents' smoking status depending on the child's diagnosis on admission. The total mean scores for two knowledge items are relatively lower than the others. More than half of the participants (66%) indicated 'no' to 'documenting smoking status'. Differences in responses of the participants across the hospitals were statistically significant, chi 2 (2, n = 267) = 11.190, P < 0.05. About half of the participants did not know of any existing quit smoking clinics. The variation in the nurses' action intention towards various QSRI may be attributed to their busy workload and varying perceptions towards QSRI as a nursing priority. Results indicate the needs for knowledge related to impacts of children's exposure to SHS to be integrated into the basic nursing curriculum, support and affirmation from ward managers in the clinical settings to promote the initiatives to integrate QSRI in paediatric nursing settings.

AB  - Using an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, the study investigated high school students' affordances for social media, their attitudes and beliefs about these new technologies, and related obstacles and issues. The affordance findings indicate that students depend on social media in their daily lives for leisure and social connections. Educational uses by teachers for classroom teaching and learning are sporadic, while uses by students on their own for learning purposes seem to be abundant but also incidental and informal. Quantitative results suggest that in general, students show positive attitudes and beliefs about social media use in education. Exploratory factor analysis revealed three components that explained a total of 65.4% of the variance: (a) benefits of social media use, (b) disadvantages of social media use, and (c) current social media use in education. Three issues emerged from the interview data: Conceptual understanding of social media for learning; close-minded, acquired uses versus open-minded, innate uses of social media; and changed concepts of learning. The study results suggest that for social media to be used as effective learning tools and to adjust students' prior affordances with these tools, complicated efforts in designing, scaffolding, and interacting with students during the process are necessary.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the relationship between employees' knowledge and organisational performance. Design/methodology/approach Using a structural equation model, feedback received from 237 blue-collar workers from multinational high-tech manufacturing enterprises in Italy was studied to understand, from a dynamic capabilities perspective, the role of soft skills in the career success of production workers. Findings The results of the analysis indicate a positive relationship between workers' commitment to develop their soft skills and their career success, as well as a positive relationship between an organisation's approach to both knowledge exploration and knowledge exploitation and the prospects for career success of blue-collar workers. Research limitations/implications - The research has both theoretical and practical implications, as any efforts by researchers and practitioners to find effective ways to motivate the workforce will be likely to lead to a positive attitude towards learning and, ultimately, to improved business performance. Originality/value The originality of the paper is the focus on the personality and interpersonal attributes of workforce - blue-collar workers - and how they can affect business performance in highly innovative contexts.

AB  - Introduction
   The benefits of antibiotics are under threat by self-medication, which culminated in economic burdening of developing countries, treatment failures, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria and an increased probability of exposure and infection of the general population by antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains.
   Objectives
   This study aimed to evaluate the knowledge and attitude of medical students in Sudan towards the use of antibiotics, the prevalence of self-medication with antibiotics among medical students in Sudan and to identify risk factors which promote self-medication with antibiotics.
   Materials and methods
   This was a cross-sectional, descriptive and institution-based study, between November 2020 and May 2021. 1,110 medical students were selected by multistage cluster sampling. Logistic regression was used to identify risk factors of self-medication with antibiotics among the study participants.
   Results
   The median knowledge score was 7 out of a maximum of 10 (IQR: 5-8). A moderately positive attitude was observed among the participants (Median: 7/10; IQR: 6-8). Knowledge and attitude scores were significantly associated with academic year and monthly allowance (p < 0.05). 675 (60.8%) self-medicated with antibiotics within the previous 12 months, mostly from community pharmacies (321/675; 47.5%). Antibiotics were most commonly used to treat respiratory tract infections (38.1%) and cough (30.4%). Chi-square analysis demonstrated that self-medication with antibiotics was significantly associated with gender, year of study and monthly income.
   Conclusions
   Undergraduate medical students had moderate knowledge and attitude towards antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance, and an alarmingly high prevalence of self-medication with antibiotics. This highlights the urgent need for tighter legislation regarding the sales of antibiotics in community pharmacies by the state and federal health ministries.

AB  - This paper contributes to the reworking of the traditional concepts and methods of Science and Technology Studies that is necessary in order to analyse the development and use of social media and other emerging information infrastructures (IIs). Through long-term studies of the development of two contrasting IIs, the paper examines the prosumer-management strategies by which vendors manage their relationships with their diverse users. Despite the sharp differences between our cases - an online-game with social network features and traditional enterprise systems - we find striking homologies in the ways vendors manage the tensions underpinning the design and development of mass-market products. Thus their knowledge infrastructures - the set of tools and instruments through which vendors maintain an adequate understanding of their multiple users - change in the face of competing exigencies. Market expansion may favour 'efficient' quantitative user assessment methods and the construction of abstract user categories for designing new generic solutions and services around market segments. However where a product extends into new and unfamiliar user markets the growing social distance between developer and user may call for 'richer' direct ways of knowing the user. We note the emergence of collective fora, which can provide a space for independent action and innovation by users. However, these were managed communities. Certain user relations functions were pushed out to the community or third-party organizations and at other times pulled back in-house - for example, to increase vendor direct control. This picture is far removed from the visions of seamless integration of producers and users encouraged by notions such as prosumer.

AB  - This study investigates the key antecedents of user satisfaction of untact lecture systems during COVID-19. The theoretical framework identifies the role of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, benefits, and privacy concerns in generating user satisfaction. The research model was validated by analyzing data collected from university students through partial least squares (PLS). The results indicate that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and benefits significantly affect user satisfaction. However, privacy concerns are not significantly related to user satisfaction. System quality influences both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Affective risk perception significantly impacts perceived usefulness while it has no significant impact on benefits. A social distancing attitude is significantly associated with benefits. The findings would provide useful guidelines for the desirable education under pandemics.

AB  - There are claims that the societal appetite for 'child exploitation material' is increasing. Yet, Australia's policy response does not include initiatives to dissuade potential offenders from deliberately viewing child exploitation material for the first time (onset). To critically examine this issue, this paper draws on Situational Crime Prevention theory. It argues that (a) many first-time child exploitation material viewers fit the Situational Crime Prevention construct of the Opportunistic Offender and (b) suggests that current policy overlooks the kinds of non-instrumental factors that increase the risk of onset for this group, including doubts about the criminality and harmfulness of viewing child exploitation material. The paper then empirically examines social attitudes to child exploitation material viewing by presenting the findings of a survey of 504 Australian internet users. Results indicate that a sizeable minority of the participants were: unaware that it is a crime to view certain types of child exploitation material in Australia; and held doubts about the harmfulness of viewing child exploitation material. These findings are used to reflect on how the presence of these non-instrumental factors among ordinary internet users may affect the offending readiness of the Opportunistic Offender. Policy implications are then briefly discussed.

AB  - Recently, there has been significant expansion in the range of gambling activities supported by digital technology. The convergence of gambling and digital media is of particular concern with respect to the immense potential for earlier age of gambling involvement, and development of positive attitudes and/or behavioral intentions toward gambling. This study examined the prevalence of adolescent involvement in a range of digital and social media gambling activities, and the association between exposure to, and involvement in, simulated gambling and monetary gambling and indicators of pathological gambling risk. A total of 1287 adolescents aged 12-17 years were recruited from seven secondary schools in Adelaide, South Australia. The results indicated that a significant proportion of young people engage in a range of simulated gambling activities via internet gambling sites, social media, smartphone applications, and video-games. A logistic regression analysis showed that adolescents with a history of engagement in simulated gambling activities appear to be at greater risk of endorsing indicators of pathological gambling. These findings highlight the need for further research on the potential risks of early exposure to simulated gambling activities, as well as greater consideration of the need for regulation and monitoring of gambling activity via digital technologies.

AB  - In the complex interaction between science and the public already at the end of the 19th century, Oton Kucera has seen the important role of philosophy, which counts on the advancement of the natural sciences that has begun with the new understanding of natural processes and phenomena. There is no doubt that the media are the most effective in bringing science closer to the broader publics. Therefore, in this short presentation I will compare the results of the recent Public Understanding of Science (PUS) surveys dealing with the knowledge about, the expectations from and the attitudes towards science. I will discuss the possible influence of the media with regard to the content and will present some of the models of science communication, as well as the types and characteristics of audiences for science in the lay public. Many important studies have shown that the correlation between knowledge and positive attitudes exists only to a certain point and that the beliefs have an important role in the creation of attitudes and in the decision-making process about sensitive issues or risk. After the analysis of few case studies, my conclusion will be that philosophy can help to improve the science-media-public relationship in its weakest points.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the impact of Dutch COVID-19 restrictions on sexual behavior and HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) acquisition among men who have sex with men (MSM) participating in the Amsterdam Cohort Studies (ACS) on HIV in Amsterdam. Methods: ACS participants complete a questionnaire on sexual behavior and are tested for HIV/STI biannually. They may also be tested at the STI clinic in-between study visits. On May 29, 2020, ACS participants were invited to complete an online questionnaire on health, COVID-19 risk perceptions, and sexual behavior. Determinants of reporting casual sex partners (CSP) during COVID-19 restrictions were examined using logistic regression. Results: Of 683 MSM, 353 (52%; median age, 47 years; interquartile range, 38-53 years) completed the questionnaire. Since COVID-19, 73% reported a reduction in the number of CSP. CSP during COVID-19 restrictions were reported by 133 MSM (38%) and, in multivariable analysis, was associated with not having a college/university degree, being single, lower perceived importance of avoiding COVID-19, number of CSP before COVID-19, and current preexposure prophylaxis use (P < 0.05 for all). During COVID-19 restrictions, no HIV infections were diagnosed, and the STI positivity rate was 8%. Conclusion: Since COVID-19, the number of CSP decreased among MSM, and there may have been a temporary reduction in HIV/STI transmission. Some MSM were not fully compliant to social distancing regulations and reported CSP, which was related to prior sexual behavior and low perceived importance of avoiding COVID-19. For these men, it is important to maintain accessible HIV/STI-related testing and care during times of lockdown.

AB  - Although previous research has shown that deliberative discussions have consequences for intergroup attitudes, very little is known about this impact during the formative adolescent years. In addition, the mechanism explaining the mechanism through which discussions affect intergroup attitudes is not clear. This 3-wave study of Swedish adolescents (N = 892, 51.1% girls, M-ageT1 = 13.41, nested in 35 classrooms) examined the role of teacher-initiated political discussions in the classroom for the development of youth attitudes toward immigrants. The results of multilevel analysis showed that adolescents who perceived political discussions to be less frequent increased in anti-immigrant attitudes compared to youth with more frequent discussions. Similarly, classrooms with less deliberative atmosphere were more negative toward immigrants than classrooms with a higher frequency of discussions, and this effect remained two years after the students moved to new schools. Mediation analysis revealed that general political interest (but not news consumption) explained the effects of classroom discussions on attitudes: Youth who perceived that their teachers frequently initiate political discussions developed higher general political interest and, in turn, lower anti-immigrant attitudes than youth with less frequent discussions. The findings show an important role of classroom political discussions for the formation of intergroup attitudes in adolescence. The findings suggest that frequent discussions reduce the risk of prejudice development by stimulating youth general political interest.

AB  - Background: Psychosocial problems in cancer patients are often unrecognized and untreated due to the low awareness of the existence of these problems or pressures of time. The awareness of the need to identify psychosocial problems in cancer patients is growing and has affected the development of screening instruments. This study explored the usefulness and feasibility of using a screening instrument (SIPP: Screening Inventory of Psychosocial Problems) to identify psychosocial problems in cancer patients receiving curative radiotherapy treatment (RT).
   Methods: The study was conducted in a radiation oncology department in the Netherlands. Several methods were used to document the usefulness and feasibility of the SIPP. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires completed by seven radiotherapists and 268 cancer patients.
   Results: Regarding the screening procedure 33 patients were offered to consult a psychosocial care provider (e.g. social worker, psychologist) during the first consultation with their radiotherapist. Of these patients, 31 patients suffered from at least sub-clinical symptoms and two patients hardly suffered from any symptoms. Patients' acceptance rate 63.6% (21/33) was high. Patients were positive about the content of the SIPP (mean scores vary from 8.00 to 8.88, out of a range between 0 and 10) and about the importance of discussing items of the SIPP with their radiotherapist (mean score = 7.42). Radiotherapists' perspectives about the contribution of the SIPP to discuss the different psychosocial problems were mixed (mean scores varied from 3.17 to 4.67). Patients were more positive about discussing items of the SIPP if the radiotherapists had positive attitudes towards screening and discussing psychosocial problems.
   Conclusions: The screening procedure appeared to be feasible in a radiotherapy department. In general, patients' perspectives were at least moderate. Radiotherapists considered the usefulness and feasibility of the SIPP generally to be lower, but their evaluations were mixed. A positive attitude to using screening instruments like the SIPP needs to be encouraged among radiotherapists, as this may not only improve the usefulness of a screening instrument, but also patients' satisfaction with care.

AB  - The 1918 influenza pandemic was characterized by multiple epidemic waves. We investigated reactive social distancing, a form of behavioral response where individuals avoid potentially infectious contacts in response to available information on an ongoing epidemic or pandemic. We modelled its effects on the three influenza waves in the United Kingdom. In previous studies, human behavioral response was modelled by a Power function of the proportion of recent influenza mortality in a population, and by a Hill function, which is a function of the number of recent influenza mortality. Using a simple epidemic model with a Power function and one common set of parameters, we provided a good model fit for the observed multiple epidemic waves in London boroughs, Birmingham and Liverpool. We further applied the model parameters from these three cities to all 334 administrative units in England and Wales and including the population sizes of individual administrative units. We computed the Pearson's correlation between the observed and simulated for each administrative unit. We found a median correlation of 0.636, indicating that our model predictions are performing reasonably well. Our modelling approach is an improvement from previous studies where separate models are fitted to each city. With the reduced number of model parameters used, we achieved computational efficiency gain without over-fitting the model. We also showed the importance of reactive behavioral distancing as a potential non-pharmaceutical intervention during an influenza pandemic. Our work has both scientific and public health significance.

AB  - Why do people have anti-immigrant attitudes? We proposed that individuals' need for cognitive closure-an epistemic motivation associated with an aversion to change in established environments-is predictive of a dislike of immigrants through increased binding to powerful groups. In four studies, collected in both Italy (Study 1) and the United States (Studies 2-4), we found that there were effects of need for cognitive closure on anti-immigrant attitudes, as well as indirect effects through binding. These results were significant controlling for participants' political orientation (Studies 2-4), when either dispositional measure (Studies 1-3) or an experimental induction (Study 4) of need for cognitive closure was used, and when both general attitudes toward immigrants (Studies 1, 2, 4) and attitudes toward immigrants' economic impact (Studies 3 and 4) were assessed.

AB  - Nowadays, RFID technology is widely being used in libraries across the world. This study is in line with global literature pertaining to the implementation of RFID technology in libraries and intends to explore and examine the perceptions of employees from two libraries in Qatar. Data was collected from both staff and managers using two separate surveys. The perceptions of both sets of employees were analyzed and compared to highlight the differences in benefits, drawbacks, and issues concerning the implementation of RFID in contrast to barcode. 'Shelf management of resources,' 'perceived RFID contributions,' and 'workplace efficiency' were the top 3 rated dimensions pertaining to the use of RFID. Additionally, 'increased customer satisfaction' was rated the highest among the reasons as to why RFID is adopted in libraries and the fact that all negative decision determinants were moderately perceived when compared to the positive ones indicates the overall positive attitude of managers in these libraries towards RFID technology. Further conclusions and future work are proposed at the end of the study.

AB  - Background: Serious games for health have been gaining in popularity among scholars and practitioners. However, there remain a few questions to be addressed.
   Objective: This study tests the effects of a serious game and fear appeals on smoking-related outcomes. More specifically, this research aims to understand how serious games function as a more effective vehicle for a health campaign than a traditional medium, such as a print-based pamphlet. Further, while serious games utilize a variety of persuasive strategies in the game's content, it is not clear whether fear appeals, which are widely used persuasive-message strategies for health, can be an effective strategy in serious games. Thus, we are testing the effect of fear appeals in a serious game.
   Methods: We created a computer game and a print brochure to educate participants about the risks of smoking. More specifically, a flash-based single-player game was developed in which players were asked to avoid cigarettes in the gameplay context. We also developed an online brochure based on existing smoking-related brochures at a university health center; antismoking messages on the computer game and in the brochure were comparable. Then, an experiment using a 2 (media type: game vs. print) x 2 (fearful image: fear vs. no-fear) between-subjects design was conducted. The study recruitment was announced to undergraduate students enrolled in a large, public Midwestern university in the United States. After a screening test, a total of 72 smokers, who reported smoking in the past 30 days, participated in the experiment.
   Results: Overall, gameplay, when compared to print-based pamphlets, had greater impacts on attitudes toward smoking and the intention to quit smoking. Further, the game's persuasive effects were especially pronounced when messages contained fear appeals. When fearful images were presented, participants in the game condition reported significantly more negative attitudes toward social smoking than those in the print condition [F(1,67)=7.28; P=.009; eta(2)(p)=0.10]. However, in the no-fear condition, there was no significant difference between the conditions [F(1,67)=0.25; P=.620]. Similarly, the intention to quit smoking [F(1,67)=4.64; P=.035; eta(2)(p)=0.07] and susceptibility [F(1,67)=6.92; P=.011; eta(2)(p)=0.09] were also significantly different between the conditions, but only when fear appeals were used.
   Conclusions: This study extends fear appeal research by investigating the effects of different media types. It offers empirical evidence that a serious game can be an effective vehicle for fear appeals.

AB  - In comforting or distressing circumstances, individuals tend to have various perceptions of themselves. It seems that religious comfort and religious distress correlate differently with people's self-esteem. Since the relationship between religiosity and self-esteem is not only direct but can be mediated by other factors that are recognized as buffers against adverse situations, our main goal was to verify whether dispositional gratitude may have an indirect effect on the association between both variables. The research involved data from 254 participants aged 18 to 25 (M = 21.24; SD = 2.09) and included 192 women (76%) and 62 men (24%). To measure the title variables, we used: the Religious Comfort and Strain Scale (RCSS), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES), and the Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ-6). The results showed that people who consider religion as a source of comfort express positive attitudes toward the self and recognize others' kindness, as well. In contrast, people who consider religiosity as a cause of fear, stress, and internal strain tend to display a lower subjective sense of personal worth and lower appreciation of the positivity around them. Moreover, gratitude had a mediatory effect on the relationships between religious comfort/negative emotions toward God and self-esteem.

AB  - This article discusses flaws of Indonesia's criminal procedural laws through an analysis of the Jessica Wongso case. After a televised trial in 2016, Wongso was convicted of murdering her friend Salihin, by putting cyanide in her coffee at a Jakarta cafe, and sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. The conviction was upheld on appeal in late 2018. The police obtained very limited evidence against Wongso, leaving prosecutors unable to determine the cause of Salihin's death, much less to prove convincingly that Wongso was the perpetrator. By contrast, the defense mustered significant exculpatory evidence. But the judges, at first instance and on appeal, took an uncritical view of the prosecution evidence and ignored the defense case. Throughout the investigation and trial, Wongso was not accorded the presumption of innocence, partly because of Indonesia's flawed or absent formal legal infrastructure for arrests, detentions, searches, and disclosure of prosecution evidence to the defense. It is also because highly prejudicial press coverage before and during trials is not prohibited and because judges lack professionalism. All this suggests a strong need for reform-not only to Indonesia's criminal procedure law, but also to the way it is applied in practice.

AB  - Background: The proportion of overweight and obese youths is high. The present study aimed to investigate the development of self-image and its components during a one-year follow-up among non-referred adolescents with excess and normal weight. Furthermore, we separately analyzed the data for girls and boys.
   Methods: Altogether 86 8th grades (41 girls and 45 boys) with a relative weight of 26% or more above the median and 91 controls (43 girls and 48 boys) with normal weight participated the follow-up. The Offer Self-Image Questionnaire, Revised (OSIQ-R) was used to assess self-image at baseline and on follow-up. In the OSIQ-R, a low total raw score implies positive adjustment, while a high raw score implies poor adjustment and a negative self-image. The study design was doubly correlated (pairs and time), and a linear mixed model was used in the statistical analysis.
   Results: In OSIQ-R total scores, a comparative improvement was observed in girls with normal weight. Among these girls, significant change scores compared to zero were seen in impulse control, social functioning, vocational attitudes, self-confidence, self-reliance, body image, sexuality, and ethical values. In girls with excess weight, none of the change scores compared to zero were statistically significant. When the girls with normal and excess weight were compared, the difference in change scores was largest in sexuality and vocational attitudes. Change scores compared to zero were significant in sexuality and idealism for boys with excess weight, and in impulse control, mental health, self-reliance, and sexuality for normal weight boys. When the boys with excess and normal weight were compared, no statistically significant differences emerged in change scores.
   Conclusion: In mid-adolescent girls, the influence of overweight and obesity on the development of self-image is substantial. Weight management programs directed at overweight adolescent girls should include psychological interventions aiming to diminish self-image distress, especially that associated with feelings, attitudes, and behavior towards the opposite sex, as well as future career plans.

AB  - Via the internet, people can easily access high quantities of (information on) intangible services (e.g., dining out services, movie theater visits), often at low(er) prices. Therefore, purchasing these services online likely stimulates consumers to make extra trips for on-site consumption, thus posing a possible challenge for transportation systems. Meanwhile, attitudes toward online purchases may vary by the built environment. People in non-urban areas (compared to those in urban areas) may benefit more from online purchases due to lower accessibility to physical purchase opportunities. Therefore, they may have more positive attitudes toward online purchases and thus purchase more online. In this study, we analyze the effects of the built environment on online purchases considering the potential mediating effects of attitudes - in order to clarify whether implementing built environment interventions is effective to cope with this transportation challenge. Using data acquired from 717 interviews in Beijing, China in 2015, a Structural Equation Modeling analysis indicates that higher employment density, lower accessibility to metro stations, and lower street density have direct and positive effects on online buying of intangible services. Additionally, higher accessibility to shopping centers has an indirect and adverse effect on online buying behavior through attitudes toward online buying. Therefore, implementing built environment interventions might be valid to moderate travel demands resulting from online purchases of intangible services.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the role of universities in promoting sustainability and sustainable development goals among Indian students as future entrepreneurs, supporting the mission of sustainability. Using PLS-SEM (n = 422), we checked the influence of three constructs related to the university's role, i.e., campus sustainability, environmental sustainability, and education on sustainability at the university, on attitudes towards sustainability among students, on one hand, and on the intention to start entrepreneurship for sustainability, on the other hand. We also looked into the impact of attitude towards sustainability-related entrepreneurship on the intention to start entrepreneurship for sustainability, as well as into the mediating role of attitude on the relationship between the three mentioned constructs and sustainability entrepreneurial intentions. Results suggest that campus sustainability and education on sustainability positively influence the attitude towards sustainability of the students. Additionally, campus sustainability and environmental sustainability influence students to start entrepreneurship for sustainability. Further, a positive attitude towards sustainability-related entrepreneurship impacts the sustainability entrepreneurial intentions. Attitude towards sustainability mediates the relationship of campus sustainability and environmental sustainability with the sustainability entrepreneurial intentions. The study will be helpful for the universities, students, researchers, and curriculum developers to understand the role of educational institutes and its policies towards sustainability in shaping the intentions towards sustainable entrepreneurship.

AB  - Waste sorting is an important aspect of environmental protection, which is now being enforced on a large scale in China. More broadly, it is beneficial to improve the implementation strategies for waste sorting policy and programmes. This study analyses the psychology of consumers that influences the mechanisms of consumer waste sorting and the governmental policies influencing consumers' attitudes and behaviours. About 295 validated participants were collected from four regions of China. Regression analysis was used to examine the relationship among consumers' internal motivation, government's external publicity and consumer behaviour, and the Hayes' PROCESS macro was used to test mediating effect and moderating effect. The results show that consumers' internal motivation and government's external publicity have a positive effect on consumer behaviour. Consumer attitude played a complete mediating role between consumers' internal motivation and consumer behaviour. Between the government's external publicity and consumer behaviour, consumer attitude played a complementary mediating role. Consumers with self-transcendence values, positive motivation of waste sorting and the government's external publicity had a greater positive impact on their attitudes than consumers with self-enhancement values. The greater the material benefits and psychic income consumers received from waste sorting, the more it promoted a positive attitude to consumer behaviour. The article puts forward some management suggestions to improve the government's implementation of its waste sorting policy.

AB  - Adolescents usually show a significant reduction in their inner motivation in their careers. Following selfdetermination theory, the traditional environment meets young people?s three basic psychological needs when they mature their needs, namely autonomy, ability, and relevance. It is assumed that it is not enough. Existing systems are difficult-have a process to identify and computational analysis of psychology course scores. The proposed studies are inconsistent and dissatisfied with the online learning experience, combining a Neural Network analysis course level with a satisfying Android-based mobile phone system, or calculating a latent trait model of mental course scores. Course learning, organization, and evaluation: The findings identified three basic, satisfying components. The purpose of Neural Network is to verify and prepare the relationship between process satisfaction and professional identity and trust this relationship?s mediating effect. It shows the strongest relationship of satisfaction, teaching psychological process variables, especially quality and expertise. Based on psychological variables, services, facilities, images, and research activities, Android smart systems are also important. Individual user characteristics, such as outcomes and attitudes, are related to psychological user satisfaction. Neural Network promote user matching of suitable thinking style psychology learning, psychological development course education quality and style, be accurate, and develop positive attitudes such as self-efficacy. For learning assistance, help learners will improve their satisfaction, including Android?s intelligent system.

AB  - Substantial insecurity about the future of eLearning and particularly about the future impact of digitalization on the educational sector prevails at present. Those, who were enthusiastic at the beginning are now more sceptical about the future development of teaching with digital media, others maintain their positive attitude and are looking for ways to promote and implement their use in universities. Numerous institutions have published or are publishing forecasts and time frames about the relevance of the upcoming innovations. Less discussed are the economic implications that digitization may have on the universitie's stakeholders and their decision making In the field of online and distance education a descriptive approach of the costs and benefits has been so far predominant Instead we will raise some points to initiate a discussion about the economics of digital educational resources and the possible reactions of and impact on teachers, students and institutions. We will also point out some of the long-term effects that digitalization of education might have on a global level.
   Concluding that digitization followed a continuous development pulsed especially by universities of distance education and that phenomena such as MOOCs are not as "disruptive" as some claim Instead, national policies, economic sustainability and the impact of digitization on different stakeholders will determine the future form of the "Digital University" in case such a university exists.

AB  - This survey study was carried out to identify the adoption, discontinuance and non adoption of sprinkler irrigation systems among farmers who were trained to apply those in Ardabil Province of Iran. Farmers were divided into 3 groups as: adopters, abandoners after adoption and non-adopters. A sample of 160 farmers, including 20 adopters, 80 abandoners and 60 non-adopters were randomly selected. Results show that no significant differences among three studied groups exist regarding access to agricultural research and extension service centers. Adopters had lower farming experiences however, were more educated, having larger farm sizes including irrigated and rainfed lands, with more fragments and less distances among them. They were more informed about irrigation methods specially, sprinkler systems than the other two groups. Such awareness enabled them to solve problems occurred after installation of equipments in their farms. On the other hand, weakness of awareness had affected abandoners` decisions to reject the technology. Nevertheless, all of the respondents showed positive attitude towards optimum use of irrigation water. Significant relationships exist among contact with agricultural experts and extension agents as well as training programs of radio, TV and adoption behaviors. Meanwhile, differences among groups regarding ability to read written materials on irrigation were statistically significant. Overall, farmer's reasons for adopting and non-adopting of sprinkler systems were classified.

KW  - QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY
AB  - Objectives: To define the knowledge, perception, attitude, educational needs, and barriers in practicing Evidence Based Medicine (EBM) among physicians in Abha city, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional study using a self-administered validated questionnaire distributed to 290 physicians between 1st July to 30th July 2008. This study took place in the Family and Community Medicine Department, King Khalid University, College of Medicine, Abha, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
   Results: Completed questionnaires were received from 210 (72.4%) of 290 physicians. Most physicians had a positive attitude towards EBM (median score=8/10). Half of them support the shift from daily based practice to evidence based decision. They showed acceptable level of knowledge on the terminologies used in EBM and critical appraisal. The consultants and specialists had a better knowledge toward EBM compared with residents. The main barriers facing the respondents in practicing EBM as indicated by the physicians were lack of resources and time.
   Conclusion: The physicians showed acceptable level of knowledge on EBM. There was a gap between their knowledge and practice. This gap could be attributed to what was addressed by the physicians, namely, inadequacy of time and unavailability of access to internet in their working place. The better knowledge of the trained than the untrained physicians could draw the attention towards the importance of training courses relevant to EBM.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore participants' attitudes and receptivity to a #CondomEmoji campaign insofar as investigating whether attitudes and receptivity were important predictors for brand impression and intention to buy.
   Design/methodology/approach This study involved 206 research participants who live in Jakarta and Surabaya and who answered online questionnaires to measure attitudes, receptivity to #CondomEmoji advertising, brand impression and intention to buy condoms. Questionnaires were circulated on several social media platforms and instant messaging apps. The participants were asked to watch the #CondomEmoji advertising video before proceeding to fill out the questionnaires.
   Findings Research findings suggested that participants mostly held negative attitudes and receptivity to the campaign. Non-sexually active participants were more likely to perceive the advertising as offensive. Attitudes and receptivity were good predictors for brand impression, yet attitude was not significantly attributed to intention to buy condoms. The result was stronger in sexually active participants.
   Research limitations/implications Non-sexually active young people need to be more informed about healthy sexual behavior so that they would not feel embarrassed to discuss and ask about sexual behavior. A socially acceptable condom-use advertising campaign needs to be conducted to lessen the resistance of conservative audiences.
   Originality/value This paper offers an insight into how conservative audiences may respond to social-media-based campaign of safer sex.

AB  - According to the residential self-selection hypothesis in transportation planning, individual characteristics centering on sociodemographics and attitudes have been conceptualized as antecedent confounders in the built environment-travel behavior relationship (and subsequently, the built environment as a mediator). In medical science, socio-ecological models have been used to designate the individual characteristics and built environment to mutually function as moderators. However, whether individual characteristics (built environment) assume the role of the antecedent (mediator), moderator, or control, has received scant scholarly attention. Using a structural equation model based on the total travel time data of Seoul, this study finds that, by mode of travel, sociodemographics work as moderators for automobile travel and attitudes as antecedents for nonmotorized travel. The sociodemographics/attitudes and built environment are likely to be significant only if their counterpart is also significant. Demographically, the compact built environment tends to reduce automobile travel only for older residents and those who live in larger households. Moreover, travelers with positive attitudes toward daily facilities may self-select into compact neighborhoods and subsequently increase nonmotorized travel.

AB  - This paper examines the process that leads to resilience to negative information and purchase intentions in a digital environment. A conceptual framework is proposed and tested using a sample of retail banking customers and an application of the structural equation models. The results suggest that consumer behavior in digital settings is more influenced by brand personality than by online brand experience. If a brand can develop and sustain an attractive brand personality, then consumers tend to have a positive attitude toward the brand and discuss the brand positively on social media networks. This behavior will lead to higher resilience to negative information and increased purchase intentions. Although online brand experience does not influence the level of electronic word-of-mouth, it directly affects brand attitude and indirectly influences both resilience to negative information and purchase intentions.

Based on data from a community program, this study examined how the pandemic influenced community services for homebound older adults and whether those services could be delivered via internet-based information and communications technology. Using mixed methods, we collected quantitative data from client profiles and service documents and qualitative data from phone interviews with program staff members and clients. The quantitative results show that during the pandemic, more services were provided for the physical well-being of homebound older adults than for their psychological and home environment needs. Service duration during the pandemic was significantly longer than prior to the pandemic. The qualitative data indicate that the pandemic has influenced inputs, activities and outcomes of the program. The program staff members and clients expressed concerns about delivering services online. Based on the findings, we provide suggestions for future practice and policy.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyse nostalgia sport tourism in football fans of Persian Gulf Pro League. The sample of the study consisted of 210 football fans of Persian Gulf Pro League. The participants were selected through stratified random sampling. The Nostalgia Scale for Sport Tourism by Cho (2014) was used to collect the data. Confirmatory factor analysis of structural equations was used to analyse the hypotheses of the study. It was found that nostalgia has an effect on the behavioural intentions and attitude of football fans and that attitude has not a mediating role in the relationship between nostalgia and behavioural intentions of football fans. The nostalgia of the spectators is related to several factors, such as the sport environment and the experiences that the fans live together when they go to sport events. In conclusion, those football fans of Persian Gulf Pro League who have a positive attitude toward the football games may have better behavioural tendencies and, in the future, this can create nostalgic emotions.

KW  - HOOKING
AB  - Guided by the integrated model of behavioral prediction, this study explored the attitudinal, normative, and perceived control beliefs that predict college student hookup intentions and behavior. We first conducted elicitation research with six focus groups of undergraduate students to identify salient beliefs to inform questionnaire development, and then we collected and analyzed questionnaire data from 268 undergraduate students to explore the direct and indirect determinants that drive hookup behaviors. We compared proposed models that tested separate paths from determinants to intention and behavior to theoretical models that treated intention as a mediator of the determinant-behavior relationship. The results indicate that in both the proposed and theoretical models, direct and indirect attitudes were the strongest predictors of intentions and behavior. Positive attitude beliefs were consistently and significantly correlated with both intention and behavior, while only select normative and control beliefs were so correlated. Finally, although the data fit both the proposed and theoretical models, the proposed models provided a more accurate fit. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of our results, and we offer directions for future research.

AB  - Professional support of families that are under temporary protection, with the goal of reunification, is necessary for helping families re-establish their family dynamics. Without this support, the conditions that contributed to child abuse and neglect will likely persist. In this context, the attitude of professionals towards positive parenting and child participation is a decisive factor. The quantitative study presented here contributes knowledge regarding these 2 variables. The study was conducted with 106 professionals who work in the child protection system. The results show a high degree of consensus among professionals regarding the following practices: (a) incorporating positive parenting into family reunification processes; (b) training the biological parents in parenting skills; and (c) promoting the active participation of children in foster care and reunification. Regarding the latter point, the study found that older and more experienced professionals are more open and inclined to promote participation in family reunification processes. The practical implications of the results invite us to review attitudinal competencies training for professionals working in child protection services, focusing on encouraging a positive attitude towards the parental competencies of the biological family and the active participation of children in foster care and reunification. These professionals' attitudes are a key factor in mediating the process of family reunification.

AB  - Drawing on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this field study (N = 282) investigates the impact of two focal personality traits, extraversion and conscientiousness, on employees' attitudes and intentions to actively participate in their local union. Consistent with the TPB, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and attitudes toward participation each explained unique variance in union participation intentions. Furthermore, results revealed that extraversion was positively related, and conscientiousness was negatively related to participation intentions, with attitudes toward participation mediating these effects. A significant interaction between extraversion and conscientiousness was also observed, such that introverted workers higher in conscientiousness were less inclined to express positive attitudes toward union participation. Overall, these results provide support for the utility of the TPB in predicting union participation intentions and highlight the vital role that personality traits may play in determining union participation attitudes and intentions.

AB  - Two recent electoral resultsDonald Trump's election as U.S. president and the UK's Brexit votehave reignited debate on the psychological factors underlying voting behavior. Both campaigns promoted themes of fear, lost pride, and loss aversion, which are relevant to the personality dimension of neuroticism, a construct previously not associated with voting behavior. To that end, we investigate whether regional prevalence of neurotic personality traits (neuroticism, anxiety, and depression) predicted voting behavior in the United States (N = 3,167,041) and the United Kingdom (N = 417,217), comparing these effects with previous models, which have emphasized the roles of openness and conscientiousness. Neurotic traits positively predicted share of Brexit and Trump votes, and Trump gains from Romney. Many of these effects persisted in additional robustness tests controlling for regional industrial heritage, political attitude, and socioeconomic features, particularly in the United States. The sleeper effect of neurotic traits may profoundly impact the geopolitical landscape.

AB  - (1) Background: Children under 5 years of age are the most vulnerable to malaria infection, and they suffer serious complications. Sierra Leone is one of the countries with the highest malaria burden in the world. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) toward malaria control and prevention among caregivers of children under 5 in the Western Area of Sierra Leone. (2) Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among caregivers of children under-5 visiting the out-patient department of six selected hospitals/community health centers. Data were collected via questionnaire interviews with 350 caregivers. (3) Results: A total of 97.1% of the respondents were women and the majority of them were young mothers; 46.3% of respondents were unemployed; and 27.1% received no education. Only 1.4% accessed malaria related information from the internet/social media. This KAPs survey indicated that a misconception of the cause, transmission, and clinical symptoms of malaria; unawareness of its lethality and its severity; and inappropriate prevention and treatment behaviors, such as self-medicating, were still in existence among some caregivers. However, a positive correlation in knowledge-attitudes (r(s) = 0.13, p < 0.05) and in attitudes-practices (r(s) = 0.45, p < 0.001) was revealed. The caregivers, being mothers and having at least a secondary education, demonstrated positive attitudes and practices. Meanwhile, more urban caregivers (79.8%) followed a complete malaria treatment course of artemisinin-based combination therapies than the rural (63.3%), but in view of insecticide treated net use, more rural caregivers presented positive attitudes (85.3%) and practices (70.1%) than the urban (69.9%, 52.0%). (4) Conclusions: For better protection of children under-5 against lethal malaria, it is essential to provide better guidance at the community level for their caregivers, especially young mothers, in order to reduce some misconceptions and inappropriate behaviors. An increase in education and employment opportunities for women, establishment of an accessible community-based malaria counselling service, and construction of an effective communication channel are also needed.

AB  - Background: The use of herbal medicine is increasing globally, particularly in developing countries including Ethiopia, yet little is known regarding its effect and safety during pregnancy Pregnant women prefer herbal medicine due to easy accessibility, traditional and cultural beliefs, and comparatively low cost. This study aimed to assess women's knowledge and attitude towards the effects of herbal medicine usage during pregnancy and associated factors among women who gave birth in the last twelve months in Dega Damot district.
   Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1st to February 30th, 2021. A total of 872 women were selected using a stratified cluster sampling technique. Data were collected by face-to-face interviews using a structured, pretested, and interviewer-administered questionnaire. Data were entered into EPI data version 4.6 and exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Multivariable logistic regression was done and a p-value of <= 0.05 was used to declare the level of significance.
   Results: Women's knowledge and positive attitude towards the effects of herbal medicine usage during pregnancy was 49.1% (95% CI: 46-52) and 57.3% (95% CI: 54-61), respectively. Access to media, had antenatal care visit, being urban dweller, history of herbal medicine usage, and a short distance to reach the nearby health facility were significantly associated with women's knowledge about effects of herbal medicine usage. Besides, being primiparous and short traveling time to reach the nearby health facility was significantly associated with women's attitude towards the effects of herbal medicine usage during pregnancy.
   Conclusion: Women's knowledge and positive attitude towards the effects of herbal medicine usage during pregnancy was low. It is important to design strategies to improve the accessibilities of maternal health services, and expand access to media will have a great role in improving women's knowledge and attitude towards herbal medicine usage during pregnancy.

AB  - The components and determinants of HIV/AIDS stigma and prejudice were investigated in an online-questionnaire study. The results show that the components of the attitude toward people with HIV/AIDS consist of social distance, demands for political measures, negative stereotypes, and attribution of responsibility to people living with HIV/AIDS. Besides antigay attitudes and false beliefs about ways of infection, the HIV/AIDS attitude is connected to and depends on social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA). Structural equation modeling indicated that antigay attitudes and false beliefs function as mediator variables for SDO and RWA. Implications of the results are discussed.

AB  - This paper concerns an empirical investigation into public attitudes towards work-related fatality cases, where organizational offenders cause the death of workers or members of the public. This issue is particularly relevant following the introduction of the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 into UK law. Here, as elsewhere, the use of criminal law against companies reflects governmental concerns over public confidence in the law's ability to regulate risk. The empirical findings demonstrate that high levels of public concern over these cases do not translate into punitive attitudes. Such cases are viewed rationally and constructively, and lead to instrumental rather than purely expressive enforcement preferences.

AB  - This paper analyzes signs and written messages aimed at regulating people's behavior in public spaces. Based on a collection of more than 700 verbal and pictographic signs, the paper focuses on how the formulation of the directives reflect and construct the authors' deontic authority, how they account for the social legitimacy of the directive and how they seek to evoke the addressee's goodwill and cooperativeness. The analysis shows that the author's entitlement to perform the directive may be grounded in references to institutional authority, or that it may be manifested in the linguistic or pictographic expression itself, such as use of imperative mode, exclamation marks, or threats of sanctions. Entitlement may also be established by providing accounts for the legitimacy of the directive. These take the form of reference to rules and norms or information about benefits of the requested action to the recipients or third parties. Finally, the analysis shows how signs may seek to evoke positive attitudes in the addressee by creating affiliation or by using humor and poetic devices. By comparing with previous research on directives in conversation, the paper identifies request practices that are specific to this form of written communication. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Social anxiety is marked by viewing social interactions as competitive, hypervigilance to signs of social threat, and avoidance of interactions that may result in social rejection. Therefore, social anxiety should relate to: (1) greater hostile feelings toward others, (2) heightened perceptions of hostility in others, and (3) relatively low levels of violence and aggression. To date, however, little is known about these relationships. In four independent non-clinical samples (total N = 2643), we examined relationships between social anxiety, hostility, and aggression using a range of measures that included both self-report and behavioral assessments. In Study 1, social anxiety correlated positively with feeling hostile toward others. In Study 2, social anxiety correlated positively with hostile perceptions of others. In Study 3, social anxiety was related to less positive attitudes toward behaving violently toward one's relationship partner. In Study 4, social anxiety was related to less aggressive behavior, as indicated by less intense and prolonged noise blasts delivered to a fictitious opponent. Taken together, these four studies paint a picture of socially anxious people as bracing for the worst by feeling and perceiving hostility in the social environment, but behaving the best by refraining from aggression and violence.

AB  - Cisgender, heterosexual men's adherence to gender norms and prejudice against sexual minorities increases after observing sexuality-based gender norm violations of others (i.e., non-normative sexual attractions). No research to date has investigated whether similar effects occur after experiencing sexuality-based gender norm violations of the self. This study investigated the effects of one such norm violation-attraction to transgender women-on adherence to gender roles and attitudes toward gay men. Photographs of female models were shown to cisgender, heterosexual men (N = 135, M age +/- S.D. = 28.12 +/- 8.81) who rated their attractiveness. Half the participants were informed (accurately) that the models were transgender women (transgender condition). Other participants were not offered this information, leaving them to assume the models were cisgender. All participants then reported their support for traditional gender norms and attitudes toward gay men. As expected, participants in the transgender condition reported less positive attitudes toward gay men, an effect mediated by increased support for traditional gender norms, and only present when the participants had rated the women as highly attractive. These results suggest a strategy to compensate for gender norm violations to reestablish men's masculinity.

AB  - This article examines the dynamics of representation between cultural and economic forms of gender inequality on Nigerian female blogs. Through a thematic analysis of 253 comments retrieved from five female-authored blogs, I draw on prominent cases of gender inequality in Nigeria, such as 'President Muhammadu Buhari's position on his wife' and the 'rejection of the Gender and Equal Opportunities Bill'. The analysis showed that blog discussions among females in Nigeria suggest extensive intolerance to cultural change, especially in comparison to the more positive attitude towards redistribution. To tackle this complexity, I argue that gender equality advocacy in Nigeria should commence mainly from a redistributive standpoint. This needs to be accompanied by the ulterior aim of achieving recognition. Overall, the study contests the idea that identity politics is threatening to replace the issue of redistribution on the global political agenda by highlighting the primacy of redistributive politics in blog discourse. It enriches media studies and gender research by providing rare insight into the practical connections between cultural and economic politics of gender inequality in an online discursive context.

AB  - A broad literature indicates that pathogen, sexual, and moral disgust sensitivity relate to, among other things, political attitudes, moral condemnation, and symptoms of psychopathology. Consequently, disgust sensitivity has been widely assessed across subfields of psychology. Yet, no work has examined whether self-reports in disgust sensitivity reflect systematic trait variation that is detectable by others, and the extent to which such variation is distinct from broader personality. Here, we present the first study to examine self-other agreement in pathogen, sexual, and moral disgust sensitivity. Romantic partners (n(1) = 290), friends (n(2) = 212), and acquaintances (n(3) = 140) rated each other on these three domains of disgust sensitivity and on HEXACO personality. Correlations between dyad partners' self and other ratings were calculated to estimate the magnitude of self-other agreement. We found self-other agreement in all domains of disgust sensitivity (rs of .46, .66, and .36 for pathogen, sexual, and moral disgust sensitivity, respectively), with this agreement weakly to moderately inferred from personality perceptions (percentages mediated by HEXACO were 15%, 7%, and 33% for pathogen, sexual, and moral disgust sensitivity, respectively). These results suggest that pathogen, sexual, and moral disgust sensitivity reflect systematic trait variation that is detectable by others and distinct from broader personality traits.

AB  - Can ostensibly nonpolitical television programming affect policy opinions? In this article, I use a laboratory experiment to test whether the gender norms portrayed on two primetime sitcoms can alter political attitudes on gender issues, specifically access to abortion, and contraception. Though the shows in the experiment did not explicitly discuss any policy, I find that sitcoms can influence policy opinions, particularly when the show conveys a "boys will be boys" mentality toward sexual behavior. This finding has important implications for public opinion scholars because it suggests that there may not be such a thing as apolitical programming, and pop culture may have a profound, overlooked effect on public opinion.

AB  - Creating a joyful workplace is not the same as dealing with issues of stress, fatigue, burn-out, and resilience. It requires a proactive approach to augment feelings of worth, appreciation, and well-being in the members of the team. The sense that one is pursuing worthwhile, valuable activities requires a wholesale commitment to the mission, vision and values of the organization. These tenets are often created through an organic consensus of collegial workmates and then put to action by a leadership team. Reassessing the goals and virtues of the organization at appropriate intervals leads to ongoing loyalty and commitment to the team and a positive attitude. Well-being is addressed through the creation of a bright and cheerful physical and psychosocial workplace that offers programs that encourage mindfulness, humor, playfulness, and fitful lifestyle choices. The sense that one's work is appreciated and valued stems from an attitude of gratitude on behalf of all levels of the organization including management and peers where such encouragement flourishes. Those expressions of appreciation may be in the form of celebrations in the workplace and/or compensation and benefits that appropriately value the contributions of the employee. The organization's executive team should be dedicated to crafting an environment that leads to delighted, healthy employees.

AB  - Paratransit modes are familiar modes of transportation in Sylhet city and across Bangladesh. Field investigation marked the existence of motorized, non-motorized and battery driven paratransit modes across city. Though non-motorized vehicles such as rickshaws and easy bike were found in every survey location but people preferred motorized transportation. Young age range people mostly used this media as transportation. Students and service holders were most predominant type of users found from the survey. User satisfaction was used for measuring important characteristics of paratransit modes and the results indicated that about 70% people fall somewhere between satisfied to somewhat satisfied. A Multinomial and an Ordered Logit model were utilized to analyze passenger satisfaction and both of them agreed that female passengers were dissatisfied regarding present paratransit systems. Fitness and cleanliness were considered as influential features of the existing modes. Lack of flexible movement of paratransit modes especially motorized ones around city roads was the main driving force of making the mode unreliable to users. People showed positive attitude towards overall service, safety and security of paratransit vehicles operating in Sylhet city. The fare structure made this transport system popular, but operational shortcomings such as congestion make the prospect of existing modes questionable.

AB  - Based on survey research, elite interviews, and an analysis of media treatment, this article explores the place of oil and gas in Russia's national narrative and self-identity. Objectively, Russia's economic development, political stability, and ability to project power abroad rest on its oil and gas resources. Subjectively, however, Russians are somewhat reluctant to accept that oil and gas dependency is part of their national identity. This is particularly true of the elites who play a crucial role in defining the dominant national narrative. Ordinary Russians generally have quite positive attitudes about the role of Gazprom and Russia's emergence as an "energy superpower" - while at the same time being wary of becoming a "raw materials appendage" of the outside world. One of the unexpected findings to emerge from the survey data is the strong regional differences on the question of whether Russia should be proud of its reliance on energy. Gazprom is popular in the Central Federal District, but less so as one moves east. The article concludes with an analysis of the factors constraining the role of energy in Russia's national narrative: the prominent history of military victories and territorial expansion; a strong commitment to modernization through science and industry; and concerns over corruption, environmental degradation, and foreign exploitation.

AB  - Background: Social anxiety is assumed to be related to cultural norms across countries. Heinrichs et al. [2006: Behav Res Ther 44:1187-1197] compared individualistic and collectivistic countries and found higher social anxiety and more positive attitudes toward socially avoidant behaviors in collectivistic rather than in individualistic countries. However, the authors failed to include Latin American countries in the collectivistic group. Methods: To provide support for these earlier results within an extended sample of collectivistic countries, 478 undergraduate students from individualistic countries were compared with 388 undergraduate students from collectivistic countries (including East Asian and Latin American) via self-report of social anxiety and social vignettes assessing social norms. Results: As expected, the results of Heinrichs et al. [2006: Behav Res Ther 44:1187-1197] were replicated for the individualistic and Asian countries, but not for Latin American countries. Latin American countries displayed the lowest social anxiety levels, whereas the collectivistic East Asian group displayed the highest. Conclusions: These findings indicate that while culture-mediated social norms affect social anxiety and might help to shed light on the etiology of social anxiety disorder, the dimension of individualism-collectivism may not fully capture the relevant norms.

   This review addresses current knowledge about long-term quality of life (QOL) in survivors of gynecological cancer.
   Recent findings
   Survivors of gynecological cancer have generally good long-term QOL, equivalent to healthy controls; however, specific deficits are more prevalent than in women without cancer. Ovarian cancer survivors have good QOL, with few physical symptoms. Psychological distress and sexual impairments exist. No differences in QOL occur between survivors of early and advanced stage disease, Cervical cancer survivors treated with radiotherapy reported more QOL impairments than survivors treated with other approaches. There were no differences on sexuality and sexual function among survival time periods. In general, cervical cancer survivors seem to have a positive attitude towards sexuality. Self-esteem is an important psychological variable in the study of long-term QOL.
   Summary
   When considering specific diseases, ovarian and cervical cancers were the most researched. Endometrial cancer was underreported in recent literature. Studies addressing vulvar and vaginal cancers are lacking. Physical, psychosocial and sexuality were the most investigated QOL domains. Advances are observed in current research; however, more rigorous and larger studies are required to further understand long-term QOL. Available findings are crucial to develop interventions to support those at risk for QOL impairments.

AB  - The travel bubble program presented an appealing strategy for reopening international travel safely. However, a full vaccination regime is the foremost prerequisite of the program. Therefore, vaccination and the travel bubble are inextricably linked. This study investigated the roles of perceived vaccine efficacy, attitude towards the COVID-19 vaccine, and attitude toward the travel bubble on travel bubble intention. More importantly, the study also examined the mediating role of hope and fear among unvaccinated Korean adults between 20 and 29 years old. A total of 535 samples were collected to test the proposed conceptual model using structural equation modeling. In general, the results supported the proposed hypotheses. Notably, the intention to travel to a bubble destination was explained by 57% of the variance. Furthermore, hope mediated the relationship between vaccine attitude and travel bubble intention. Whereas fear mediated the relationship between perceived vaccine efficacy and intention. Hence, the findings suggest doubts around the vaccine efficacy and that a positive attitude towards the vaccine also install hope among the research samples.

AB  - In this study, the effects of students' attitude towards English, foreign language anxiety, exposure to English, school type (i.e. state or private), parents' English proficiency and education level on the students' English achievement in TEOG exam are investigated. To achieve this goal, a multiple indicators and multiple causes (MIMIC) model has been developed, and tested based on Stephen Krashen's language acquisition theory and the literature. According to the research results, attitudes towards English, school type, amount of English exposure, parents' education level and English proficiency have meaningful and positive effects on English proficiency, while language anxiety has a meaningful but negative effect on it. Moreover, it was found that the effects of parents' education level and English proficiency and the students' attitudes towards English on English proficiency are mediated by exposure to English. Therefore, Krashen's second language acquisition theory stating that those who have positive attitudes towards English will seek more comprehensible input and so will be more exposed to English and consequently will acquire English more is validated.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - While recent research has started to pay more attention to the role of contact strategies on promoting intergroup harmony between Turkish and Kurdish communities, the effectiveness of a novel form of indirect contact strategy, E-contact-where participants engage in a cooperative and structured online interaction with an individual from the outgroup-has not yet been tested. Across two studies (N-Study 1 = 110, N-Study 2 = 176), we investigated the effects of E-contact among Turks on promoting positive attitudes and behavioral tendencies toward Kurds, testing outgroup trust and intergroup anxiety as mediators and incorporating a distinction between lower and higher self-disclosure conditions. As expected, E-contact led to more positive outgroup attitudes, as well as greater approach tendencies and decreased avoidance tendencies through increased outgroup trust (Studies 1 and 2) and reduced intergroup anxiety (Study 2). Study 2 also found that E-contact produced lower perceived interethnic conflict through increased outgroup trust. While both lower and higher personal disclosure conditions provided similar effects in the two studies, E-contact with heightened self-disclosure was especially effective at promoting more positive outgroup attitudes and reducing avoidance tendencies. Findings highlight potential benefits of using E-contact as a prejudice-reduction strategy in conflict settings.

AB  - The current study examined media portrayals of immigrants and refugees and participants attitudes regarding immigrants, immigration policy, and Islamophobia using an experimental design. Participants included 284 male and female college students who were primed with negative, positive, or no media portrayals of immigrants and refugees prior to completing questionnaires related to their views regarding immigrants, immigration policy, and Islamophobia. It was hypothesized that there would be differences in participants attitudes based on experimental condition, with participants exposed to negative portrayals reporting more negative attitudes compared to the other experimental conditions. Factors related to participant susceptibility to media portrayals were also examined and were hypothesized to include participant age, race, biological sex, social class, and political and religious affiliation. Significant differences were found based on experimental condition for viewing immigration as an economic, physical, social cohesion, and modernity threat as well as physical benefits of immigration, intolerant attitudes toward immigrants, and affective-behavioral and cognitive Islamophobia. Participants who were primed with negative media portrayals reported more negative attitudes. In addition, biological sex, race, social class, and political and religious affiliation were found to relate to participant susceptibility to media portrayals of immigration and refugees. Implications for future research are discussed.

AB  - A growing group of Chinese students is returning to China following graduation, especially young returnees. This group is seen as one of the most innovative sectors of Chinese society. Based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and three kinds of capital theories, this study explores entrepreneurial intention (EI) and its influencing factors among Newly Returned Chinese International Students (NRCIS). A survey of 211 NRCIS showed a low level of EI and little knowledge of supporting policies about entrepreneurship. Influencing factors included culture harmony as culture capital, overseas social networks as social capital, and foreign entrepreneurship education and foreign language proficiency as human capital. Attitude mediated the effects of foreign language proficiency, culture harmony, and foreign entrepreneurship education on EI. Perceived behavior control mediated the effect of foreign language proficiency, Chinese language proficiency, culture harmony, foreign entrepreneurship education, domestic entrepreneurship education, and overseas social networks on EI, and subjective norms have no significant mediating effect in any mediation path. Based on these findings, policymakers could pay attention to examining whether the current policies are working and accessible for NRCIS, and domestic entrepreneurship education could keep cultivating students' cross-cultural communication and understanding abilities, and society and education sectors could encourage positive cognition of entrepreneurship and guide students to form a positive attitude toward entrepreneurship and enhance their confidence.

AB  - Objective: The purposes of this study were to investigate the influence of social norms on intentions to intervene in dating violence situations and, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior, to examine whether these effects were mediated by attitudes, perceived behavioral control/self-efficacy, and subjective social norms. Method: College student participants were exposed to independent manipulations of descriptive norms (i.e., whether helping victims of dating violence is common) and injunctive norms (i.e., whether helping victims of dating violence is approved of) and then completed measures of attitudes toward helping, perceived behavioral control/self-efficacy regarding helping. subjective social norms regarding helping. and intentions to help. Results: Elevating descriptive norms caused greater helping intentions, and this effect was mediated by more positive attitudes. perceived behavioral control/efficacy, and subjective norms regarding helping. Conclusions: These results represent the first causal evidence suggesting that descriptive social norms motivate people to help victims of dating violence. Furthermore, results suggest that they do so by causing people to evaluate helping behaviors more positively, believe that similar others help, and feel more confident in their ability to help. These findings suggest that the Theory of Planned Behavior is a useful framework for understanding social influence in the context of dating violence. and that dating violence interventions may benefit from manipulating descriptive social norms.

AB  - The introduction of renewable energy sources fosters the transformation to an energy system with distributed generation. This alters the relation between consumers and power generation sites, as generation and consumption spatially converge. It allows for new configurations within the energy sector and provides opportunities for marketing regional energy. We empirically investigate consumer preferences for electricity generation in proximity to end-users, focusing on the proximity of generation and providers, and present representative data for Germany. In a discrete choice experiment, a sample of 780 consumer households and 173 adopters of a renewable energy system (prosumers) chose from a range of different electricity tariffs. We estimate the willingness to pay for the following attributes: shares of regional generation, power providers, and electricity mixes. We find evidence in favor of regional production, but in spite of positive attitudes towards local generation from renewable sources, willingness to pay is not responsive to higher shares of regional generation. In addition, a preference for regional providers exists. The results show that renewable energy mixes are preferred, particularly a solar and hydro mix. Adopters state slightly more distinct preferences as compared to consumer households. Thus, we find there is potential for business models offering regionally generated electricity.

AB  - Background: As future professionals, nursing students are expected to exhibit online professionalism and to be responsible users of social media. However, the rapid sharing of information on social media exposes nursing students to the risk and danger of spreading unprofessional behaviors like breaches of privacy and confidentiality.
   Objective: This study looked into the nursing students' perceptions and attitude toward responsible use of social media.
   Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional research design was utilized and participated by 298 nursing students in a College of Nursing in Hoilo City, Philippines. The Responsible Use of Social Media Attitude Scale (RUSMAS) created by the researchers was used to collect the data.
   Results: Findings indicated that nursing students widely use social media and that nursing students had good perceptions and had positive attitude toward responsible use of social media. A significant difference was found in the attitude of nursing students when grouped according to year level.
   Conclusion: Social media continue to gain interest among nursing students and using it responsibly must be continuously upheld. Academic nursing institutions should develop approaches promoting social media literacy in nursing education.

AB  - This study of responses to the TV series Monk, about a detective with obsessive-compulsive disorder, examines perceptions and behaviors related to mental illness. A total of 172 respondents completed an online survey. A parasocial bond with Monk was associated with lower stereotypes of mental illness and less social distance. Predictors and outcomes of perceived influence of the series on self and others were also examined. Perceived (positive) influence of the series on others' attitudes was predicted by respondents' favorable evaluation of the series's depiction of mental illness, as well as greater perceived exposure to and favorable evaluations among family and friends. Perceived influence on others also was associated with greater willingness to disclose mental health treatment, but only among people without personal or family experience with mental illness. In contrast, perceived influence of the series on self was predicted only by respondents' own evaluations of the series, and was related to willingness to seek mental health treatment-but only among those who had personally dealt with mental illness.

AB  - Background: The restrictions taken to control the rapid spread of COVID-19 resulted in a sudden, unprecedented change in people's lifestyle, leading to negative consequences on general health. This study aimed to estimate the impact of such changes on migraine severity during 2020 March-May lockdown. Methods: Patients affected by migraine with or without aura, diagnosed by expert physicians, completed a detailed interview comprehensive of: assessment of migraine characteristics; measure of physical activity (PA) levels; measure of the intake frequency of main Italian foods; the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) questionnaire investigating sleep disorders. Results: We included 261 patients with a mean age of 44.5 +/- 12.3 years. During social distancing, 72 patients (28%) reported a headache worsening, 86 (33%) an improvement, and 103 (39%) a stable headache frequency. A significant decrease of the PA levels during COVID-19 quarantine in the whole study sample was observed (median total metabolic equivalent task (METs) decreased from 1170 to 510; p < 0.001). Additionally, a significant difference was reported on median ISI scores (from 7 to 8; p < 0.001), which were increased in patients who presented a stable or worsening headache. Conclusions: Our study confirmed that the restrictions taken during the pandemic have affected the practice of PA levels and sleep quality in migraine. Hence, PA and sleep quality should be assessed to find strategies for an improvement in quality of life.

AB  - Meaningfulness of work has been heralded as one of the most important drivers of individual and organizational outcomes. However, the extent to which this critical psychological state manifests itself in the workplace and contributes to positive job performance is not yet fully understood. In this article, we draw from broaden-and-build theory to suggest that meaningfulness enhances employees' promotive voice behaviors, which in turn are positively related to job performance ratings by their leaders. We also suggest that leader-member relationships strengthen this mediational process. An analysis of survey data of 249 employees with matched lagged performance appraisal data supported our hypotheses. This study is important because it demonstrates that meaningfulness is not only associated with positive attitudinal responses and individual well-being, but also holds value for organizations in that it fosters desirable workplace behaviors such as job performance.

KW  - KNOWLEDGE
AB  - Background. Cervical cancer is a major public health problem in many developing countries. Despite the value of screening to prevent morbidity and mortality from cervical cancer, little available literature shows early detection and treatment to be limited in Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to determine the magnitude of and identify factors associated with women's intention to screen for cervical cancer using the theory of planned behavior. Methods. A community-based cross-sectional study design supplemented with a qualitative approach was employed. Using multistage sampling, a total of 821 women were used in the study. An interviewer-administered survey questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data, whereas purposively selected 12 female health care providers were included in in-depth interviews. Descriptive statistics and simple and multiple binary logistic regression analysis were used to determine the magnitude of women's intention, identify associated factors, and explore barriers for intention to cervical cancer screening among Debre Berhan women, Ethiopia. The statistical association was determined at a P value of less than 0.05. Moreover, thematic analysis was used to search the hindrances of women's intention to screen for cervical cancer. Results. The median age of women who participated in this study was 39 years with IQR of 35 to 42 years. Three hundred sixty-one (361, 45.3%) of women had an intention to screen for cervical cancer within three months from the date of the interview. Positive attitude towards cervical cancer screening (AOR=6.164; 95% CI: 4.048, 9.387), positive subjective norm (AOR=2.001; 95% CI: 1.342, 2.982), and higher perceived behavioral control (AOR=7.105; 95% CI: 4.671, 10.807) were predictors of the women's intention to screen for cervical cancer. The qualitative finding revealed that women did not like to be screened for cervical cancer because they thought that procedure pinch the cervix and it may result in perforating the uterus that would expose them for infertility. In addition, the qualitative findings supported quantitative results, where the constructs of the theory of planned behavior play an essential role in the betterment of women's intention. Conclusion. This study showed that women's intention to screen for cervical cancer was low. Positive attitudes towards cervical cancer screening (CCS), subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control were predictors of women's intention to screen for cervical cancer. Thus, efforts should be exerted to improve the attitude of women involving influential people, which could improve women's intention for cervical cancer screening. Moreover, behavioral change communication focusing on the constructs of the theory of planned behavior is crucial.

AB  - Drawing on empirical research in London, this article explores how young Korean, Japanese and Chinese women make sense of transnational lives and the media, and paradoxical consequences for identities. It argues that the tendency to celebrate transnational mobility is often separated from mundane reality and obscures actual conditions and experiences of social exclusion. It further argues that the ethnic media arise at the heart of the paradox of transnational experience, as electronic mediation intensified by the Internet provides a necessary condition for the possibility of diasporic nationalism. Diasporic nationalism emerges as reactionary ethno-nationalism within global knowledge diasporas of people who appear to be bilingual cross-cultural negotiators moving regularly between different cultures and participating in exchanges across national borders. Diasporic nationalism becomes particularly potent and perhaps more salient through transnational flows and movement, nationalizing both transnational spaces and the Internet's simultaneously dis-embedding and re-embedding capacities in forming a partial yet unending connection with home.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic is traumatic and causes a substantial psychological burden on the general public. The aim of the present study is to examine the severity and prevalence of peritraumatic distress among the citizens of Seoul, which conducted preemptive and aggressive social distancing policy before the central government during the early stage of COVID-19. Furthermore, this study aims to explore the associated risk factors for peritraumatic distress, including risk perception, fear, and COVID-19-related experiences. We conducted an online survey to 813 participants at the end of the first wave of COVID-19 in South Korea. Peritraumatic distress inventory (PDI) was used to measure the level of pandemic-related distress. One-third of participants were at risk for the development of clinically elevated peritraumatic distress. The perception of risk, fear of COVID-19, and stigma were significantly associated with elevated levels of distress. Individuals who had poor health, or who spent more than 1 h per day using the media, also expressed a higher level of distress. Moreover, the level of disruption of daily life and financial difficulties due to the COVID-19 pandemic is significantly associated with a higher level of peritraumatic distress. The results of this study highlight the urgent need to develop evidence-based and tailored public mental health interventions, along with various measures to help recovery to daily life.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic affected every country. Countries where people wore a mask, maintained social distance, and frequently washed their hands were more likely to contain the pandemic. In this article, we investigate how Hofstede's cultural dimensions influenced the success that countries had containing this pandemic. We find that countries with higher uncertainty avoidance and indulgence had significantly higher rates of COVID-19 cases. However, there is no evidence that masculinity-femininity, power distance, long-term orientation, or individualism significantly affected people's response to the pandemic.

AB  - A feature in contemporary labour markets has been the growth of non-standard work. This has to be set within a context of evolving new organisational forms and the ways that large organisations control these forms. Based on a qualitative study of freelance work in television, we have witnessed considerable vertical-disintegration of the industry and a substantial growth of freelance working. Control over the network is maintained by employing former large broadcaster staff, and in turn their own preferred freelancers. This has significant implications for the nature of freelance work. While work is characterised as more insecure, generally the degree varies. This is based, in part, on occupation but also on access to social capital. Freelancers also reported a positive attitude to work, but more negative findings on working hours, work intensification and on related benefits.

AB  - Britain's unexpected vote to leave the European Union (Brexit) in June 2016 has proved divisive and damaging both within the United Kingdom and internationally. Across two correlational studies, the current research proposed a model to explain the Brexit vote, with attitudes to immigration and willingness to disagree (WD) as direct predictors of the referendum result, and internal (IMS) and external (EMS) motivation to respond without prejudice as indirect predictors. Study 1 (N = 353) and Study 2 (N = 363) both showed good fit with the model and, respectively, explained 48% and 46% of the referendum result. More positive attitudes to immigration predicted a vote to remain. Higher IMS and lower EMS predicted a vote to remain, fully mediated by attitudes to immigration. In Study 1, lower WD also predicted a vote to remain, both directly and indirectly via attitudes to immigration, although this was not replicated in Study 2. These results are discussed both in relation to the Brexit result, and the implications for motivation to respond without prejudice, WD, and political correctness more generally.

AB  - In the rural areas of Fukushima, many residents participate in a culture of satoyama usage, and this cultural practice should be respected when conducting radiation protection. We conducted a case study by performing interview survey and text analysis of former evacuees in a rural part of a former evacuation area in Fukushima, to evaluate their attitude towards personal usage of forest or satoyama after radiocaesium contamination and long evacuation following the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear accident in 2011. The evacuation order in the study area was lifted in 2017, and our interview survey was conducted in 2019. We found that the resumption to the use of satoyama after their return varied among residents in this particular area. Most returnees in the area were highly knowledgeable about radiation in the environment, but we could not conclude that it helped them make decisions regarding whether to resume satoyama usage. Residents resuming personal use of satoyama after their return were those who had a close relationship with satoyama before the accident, such as the use of forest products for commercial purpose. These past experiences may have led them to have positive attitudes towards the resumption of satoyama usage after their return. Finally, we identified the required approaches towards resuming satoyama usage based on the interviewees' different attitudes.

AB  - Effects of sponsorship disclosures on Instagram and other social media have been experimentally tested in advertising research, but effects of impartiality claims are relatively unknown. In this study, we built on two previous experiments that tested effects of claiming non-sponsorship or "honest opinions." In addition to testing these in conjunction, we examine the potential for order effects of claims, and differences between celebrities and influencers. How do impartiality claims about brand-focused social media posts influence persuasion knowledge, credibility, intentions to engage with the message, attitudes, and purchase intentions? This manuscript reports findings from 287 women students in the U.S. who participated in a within-subjects experiment. We observed that posts claiming non-sponsorship were perceived as less likely to be advertisements or have selling intention. These non-sponsorship claims also enhanced trustworthiness. Honesty claims enhanced expertise. Honesty and non-sponsorship worked together to boost trustworthiness, expertise, attitudes, and purchase intentions, yet messages with no claims at all yielded the most positive attitudes and intentions. This illustrates that impartiality claims work better together than in isolation. Impartiality claims performed similarly for influencers and celebrities. Presenting impartiality claims at the beginning of a post aided ad recognition but reduced intentions to share or follow a source.

AB  - Background: In developing countries like Pakistan, it is essential for health care professionals to have comprehensive knowledge regarding cervical cancer. Methods: A cross-sectional self-administered paper-based questionnaire was administered to patients from 2016 to 2018. This study included 200 females who attended the gynecological OPD of Lady Willingdon Hospital Lahore, Punjab. We evaluated cervical cancer knowledge, screening, prevention, and acceptance towards the vaccination. Data entry and analysis were performed using SPSS version 20. Results: The perception and knowledge related to cervical cancer (28%), screening (3%), prevention (3%), and vaccination (1%) among the females were poor, but a positive attitude was observed towards cervical cancer screening, vaccination, and awareness programs. An extreme lack of knowledge was observed regarding the risk factors associated with cervical cancer and the availability of the cervical cancer vaccine (99%). A significant association (p > 0.005) was noted among the level of education and awareness of cervical cancer, its mode of transmission, and screening tests. Conclusion: The knowledge and perception of cervical cancer and its vaccine among the females of Punjab, Pakistan were inadequate. Efforts should be made to prevent and control cervical cancer in Pakistan by establishing proper strategies, such as health education programs through health care providers and media support.

AB  - The effect of the mass media on entrepreneurial intention has received little attention thus far. In addressing this gap, this study explores the influence on entrepreneurial intention of perceived social legitimacy of famous entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship in the media as well as perceived entrepreneurial skills learned through the media. Drawing on the theory of planned behavior, this influence is tested among 320 Spanish participants both directly and indirectly through the three components posited by this theory (i.e., attitudes toward entrepreneurship, subjective norms, and entrepreneurial self-efficacy). The results of partial least squares structural modeling revealed that positive attitudes and entrepreneurial self-efficacy mediated the social legitimacy - entrepreneurial intention and skills - entrepreneurial intention relationships, although subjective norms were not significant. Thus, while previous empirical evidence has indicated a direct link between these variables and entrepreneurial intention, the study of social legitimacy and perceived entrepreneurial skills may benefit from considering this robust theoretical framework. This study also offers practical implications. Television programs and other formats can be useful in entrepreneurship education as pedagogical materials. Additionally, when these programs are broadcast to the general public, it is advisable to test how they influence attitudes, subjective norms, and self-efficacy.

AB  - The present study sought to evaluate whether social priming modulates neural responses to ostracism, such that making arbitrary interpersonal decisions increases the experience of social exclusion more than making arbitrary physical decisions. This exploratory event-related potential (ERP) study utilized the Lunchroom task, in which adults (N = 28) first selected one of two options that included either interpersonal or physical descriptors. Participants then received ostracism outcome feedback within a lunchroom scenario in which they were either excluded (e.g. sitting alone) or included (e.g. surrounded by others). While the N2 component was sensitive to priming decision condition, only the P3 component discriminated between ostracism decisions. Further inspection of the neural sources indicated that the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and superior temporal gyrus were more engaged for exclusion than inclusion conditions during both N2 and P3 temporal windows. Evaluation of temporal source dynamics suggest that the effects of ostracism are predominant between 250-500 ms and were larger following interpersonal than physical decisions. These results suggest that being ostracized evokes a larger neural response that is modulated following priming of the social brain.

AB  - In a fragmented digital media environment where news is increasingly encountered passively in social media feeds and via automated mobile alerts, active avoidance of news, rather than deliberate consumption, takes on outsized importance in shaping what it means to be an informed citizen. This article systematically evaluates the factors that predict news avoidance behaviors, considering both individual- and country-level explanations. Using a large-scale quantitative, comparative approach, we examine more than 67,000 survey respondents across 35 countries worldwide and find consistent evidence for how factors including demographics, political attitudes, and news genre preferences shape avoidance consistently across information environments. But we also show how country-level contextual factors, what we call "cultures of news consumption," influence behaviors beyond that which is explained by respondent-level differences. Specifically, levels of press freedom and political freedom and stability are shown to negatively predict rates of news avoidance. These findings suggest that many people's news use practices depend not only on personal characteristics and preferences but quite sensibly on the news available to them, which they may have good reason to view as deficient or untrustworthy, as well as culturally specific norms around its value and utility.

   We aimed to assess how Turkish Radiation Oncology departments responded to the COVID-19 out-break and to what extent adapted their routine practice per recent guidelines and recommendations.
   METHODS
   In late March 2020, a national survey was designed for Turkish radiation oncologists who were actively practicing and members of the Turkish Society for Radiation Oncology (TSRO). The survey created with an online survey program (www.SurveyMonkey.com), including 28 focused items. It was sent to all members of the TSRO on April 4th 2020.
   RESULTS
   Of responders, 17% noted to already complete these arrangements even before the first case announced. All of the responders declared that their team members, including the secretaries, nurses, and radiation therapists in the clinic, worked with appropriate protective equipment. While one-third of the centers (35%) stated to implement a weekly shift, the other 1/3 (29%) chose to use daily shifts for social distancing and decreasing staff contact. Sixty-two percent of all responders indicated that multidisciplinary tumor boards discontinued, and the remaining 38% stated to continue with online video conferencing programs (65%) or meeting in large rooms with a limited number of attendees social distancing (35%).
   CONCLUSION
   Our survey revealed the importance of early precautions, communication by other Radiation Oncology Departments, following published guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the importance of using web-based applications for multidisciplinary tumor boards.

AB  - The current research investigated the effect of model's race on attitude toward the ad employing stringent methodology to achieve a high degree of internal validity. In an attempt to test the possibility of dual attitudes, we compared participants' reactions with advertising model's race by using both time-unconstrained and time-constrained measures. As a result, both African and Caucasian Americans reported similar attitudes toward ads with either African or Caucasian American models under a time-unconstrained condition. Under a time-constrained condition, Caucasian American participants did not report differences in their attitudes toward models of different races. Moreover, African American participants reported more positive attitudes toward the ad with Caucasian American models than with African American models. A similar pattern of reporting attitudes under a time-constrained condition was found when examining reaction times. The implications and contributions are discussed.

AB  - In contrast to many other countries, robot-assisted (RA) pediatric surgery is not yet very common in Germany. Although the first pediatric RA intervention was published in 2001, RA pediatric surgery is still perceived as a "new technology". As a consequence, little is known about parents' perception of this operation method. In this study, we analyzed parents' intention to let their child undergo RA and laparoscopic (LA) surgery. Two subsamples (online and at the University Medical Center Goettingen) received a questionnaire addressing attitude towards RA and LA pediatric surgery with the help of a case example. Results showed that parents had a higher intention to consent to LA surgery. Perceiving more benefits, assuming a positive attitude of the social environment, and feeling less anxiety increased intention. A mediation analysis indicated that the type of surgery affected intentions through assumed attitude of the social environment. Exploratory analyses showed that the perception of risks and anxiety reduced intention for only RA surgery. These findings should be considered in preoperational discussions with parents. Anxiety and perceived risks should especially be addressed in order to encounter hesitancy.

AB  - Reading is a significant and mass phenomenon, but the scientific research of various aspects of reading culture, such as the attitude of students towards required reading assignments, is scarce. Research on assigned reading in Croatia is mainly requested by media outlets for the purpose of publishing sensational titles. The results provided to media outlets by research agencies are of questionable scientific and methodological validity. The aim of this paper is to analyse how students and teachers perceive the attitude of students towards fulfilling the requirements pertaining to reading assignments with the purpose of devising efficient reading strategies. The research was conducted on the sample of 451 final year students in five high schools in Zagreb and 102 teachers of those final year students in the 2017-2018 school year. The results of the research indicate that there is a statistically significant difference between students and teachers in the perception of students' attitude towards assigned reading, where teachers believe to a greater extent than students that students in their school have a positive attitude towards reading assignments.

AB  - Battleground state polls are a prominent part of U.S. election news coverage. In this experimental study (N = 863), we tested how polling results impact how partisans evaluate the news stories through which the polls are reported. Consistent with the hostile media perception, partisans tended to see articles as biased against their candidate, and perceived bias was amplified when their candidate trailed in the poll. Additionally, we found that a majority of news consumers believed the article would encourage their political copartisans in battleground states to vote, but would not impact the voting behavior of their political opponents.

AB  - This study analyzes the predictors of media use for information about science and research by drawing on the theory of planned behavior and audience orientations. It uses data from a representative survey in Switzerland. We find that both audience orientations and motivations explained the use of media to access science information. People with positive attitudes toward science were more likely to use all kinds of media to access information about science. Positive evaluations of mass media coverage predicted print media and website, television and radio use positively but social media use negatively. Thus, social media could be a way to reach people who do not appreciate the coverage of the traditional mass media as much as others but who are still positive toward science. However, people who use social media may possess lesser knowledge to assess to what extent such science information is trustworthy and correct.

AB  - The Arab ethnic community in Israel is characterized by low social economic status and is at risk due to the typically crowded households. Understanding parents' level of awareness is important to avoid new outbreaks. Objectives: This study seeks to identify predicting factors associated with perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, and barriers to COVID-19 vaccination. Materials and Methods: A survey was conducted through social media, using snowball sampling via social networks. Additionally, t-tests, Chi-square tests, and Z tests were used to evaluate differences between independent proportions. Pearson correlations were calculated for the study variables. Multiple logistic regression examined the extent to which the background variables were related to the intention to vaccinate the child. Results: A total of 2843 Arab parents participated in the study. Older parents, higher socioeconomic status, higher trust in the authorities, vaccinated parents, and low psychological and physical barriers were positively correlated with willingness to vaccinate children. Pandemic fatigue was associated with less positive attitudes and reduced perceived effectiveness toward vaccination. Conclusion: Addressing minorities' poor standards of living and physical and psychological barriers posed by the authorities to minorities' access to vaccination may increase compliance with COVID-19 vaccination and protect the health of the entire population.

AB  - Interprofessional education (IPE) has been adopted in many educational systems to prepare students in the health professions for team-based practice, but its implementation is still limited in many countries. In preparation for the introduction of IPE within Kuwait University Health Sciences Center, a cross-sectional survey was conducted to explore the attitudes of faculty members (academic staff/academic support staff) toward collaborative practice and IPE, their training needs, and perceived barriers to implementing IPE. Two hundred and ten individuals completed the survey (60% response rate). Respondents expressed positive attitudes toward interprofessional healthcare teams, IPE, and interprofessional learning in the academic setting (median [IQR] overall attitude for each scale was 4.0 [1.0] on a scale of 5). Overall attitudes were significantly more positive among assistant professors, females, and faculty members with <= 10 years of experience (p < .05). Most respondents (91.9%) indicated willingness to be trained to implement IPE, with small-group learning as the preferred teaching method (85.7%). A longitudinal curriculum was less popular than discrete IPE experiences. The top reported barriers to implementing IPE were leadership challenges (86.6%), curriculum challenges (82.4%), teaching challenges (81.4%), and resistance to change (80.5%). These findings have implications for developing strategies to engage faculty in effective IPE initiatives internationally.

The target group of the research consists of preparatory class students of a school of foreign languages in a state university in Turkey. The research was carried out with mixed method research. The quantitative paradigm-based section of this study was designed with a single-group pre-test and post-test model. In this model, three different scales were applied to the participants. The participants used the SOS Table mobile game developed by the researchers for 8 weeks. After the applications, semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven participants. The quantitative data of the study were analyzed with paired sampled t-Test and the qualitative data were subjected to thematic content analysis. The results of the study indicated that the mobile application named SOS Table increased both the mobile learning tools acceptance of the participants and motivation in English, and mediated the positive attitude development for mobile learning in English. The qualitative data obtained also supported these findings.

AB  - Successful interprofessional (IP) collaboration has great potential to improve healthcare delivery. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the attitudes towards IP collaboration in young health professionals who had not been exposed to IP learning activities. About one year after graduation from their vocational training, 387 graduates from various healthcare professions [Nurses (nursing and pediatric nursing), Therapists (physical therapy, speech and language therapy), Diagnostic professionals (biomedical science and radiography)], were invited to participate in an online survey. In total, data from 129 graduates were considered for data analyses. The University of Western England Interprofessional Questionnaire was administered to self-assess graduates individual attitude towards IP collaboration and learning using four scales. All health professional groups showed an overall positive attitude in communication and teamwork as well as in IP relationships and expressed a neutral attitude in IP learning and IP interactions. There were no significant differences in the overall scores between the health professional groups. In total, the three health professional groups showed similar attitudes towards IP collaboration and learning, despite their different scope of work. Results may help to design IP learning activities and this may contribute to better communication with and to know more about each other.

AB  - The paper compares selected passages from Cicero and Aristotle whose common theme is the foundation of social and political relations. A specific concern for self-awareness and self-love can be traced in the strategies of both authors. Aristotle's inquiry demonstrates how social and political ties are rooted in basic family relationships, especially in the positive attitude towards what is "one's own". Showing how the relationship with the other is constituted through the relationship with one's own, Aristotle demonstrates the basic structural elements of the genesis of a political community based on civic friendship. Cicero presents the concept of self-love as a mediator for establishing mutual bonds within a political community. While Aristotle focuses primarily on the differentiation of the political space established by unique relationships within the family, Cicero is more concerned with the extension of family ties beyond the immediate family to larger communities. In his perspective, the attachment to self and kin is transformed into justice towards fellow citizens and from there, to love of all humanity. Unity with the rest of the human race is the most obvious innovation contained in the extension of civic friendship within the pi omicron lambda iota sigma to goodwill towards all the people within the mundus communis.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the effects of lower limb positioning and shoe conditions on stability levels of selected single leg ballet poses performed in demi-pointe position. Fourteen female non-professional ballet dancers (mean age of 18.4 +/- 2.8 years and mean body mass index of 21.5 +/- 2.8 kg/m(2)) who had practiced ballet for at least seven years, without any musculoskeletal impairment volunteered to participate in this study. A capacitive pressure platform allowed for the assessment of center of pressure variables related to the execution of three single leg ballet poses in demi pointe position: attitude devant, attitude derriere, and attitude a la second. Peak pressures, contact areas, COP oscillation areas, anterior-posterior and media-lateral COP oscillations and velocities were compared between two shoe conditions (barefoot versus slippers) and among the different poses. Barefoot performances produced more stable poses with significantly higher plantar contact areas, smaller COP oscillation areas and smaller anterior-posterior COP oscillations. COP oscillation areas, anterior-posterior COP oscillations and media-lateral COP velocities indicated that attitude a la second is the least challenging and attitude derriere the most challenging pose.

TI  - COVID-19 Vaccine Behaviour among People Attending a Tertiary Care Center, Punjab, India

KW  - Social vaccine
AB  - Introduction: Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) appropriate behaviour and vaccination are two critical defenses in the fight against this pandemic. As these need to be followed religiously, this preventive behaviour should be thoroughly investigated.
   Aim: To examine the COVID-19 vaccine behaviour amongst people attending tertiary care centre at Patiala, Punjab, India.
   Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 200 individuals attending the Outpatient Department of Government Medical College at Patiala, Punjab, India, from 15th July to 22nd July 2021. Individuals were administered socio-demographic questionnaire, General Health Questionnaire-12-Hindi version (GHQ-12), and COVID-19 vaccine related and COVID-19 appropriate behavior related questionnaire. Actual observation by the clinician regarding proper use of face masks, hand hygiene and social distancing was done and objectively scored on 0-10 for each item with a scale interval of 2. Analysis was conducted using IBM Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0.
   Results: Only 40% individuals were vaccinated. After eligibility, there was a mean delay of 4.20 +/- 3.51 weeks (median: 4 weeks) and 13.40 +/- 3.33 weeks (median: 12 weeks) in the vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. Out of 120, 86 unvaccinated participants planned to get vaccinated in future.
   Significantly lower scores were obtained for actually observed COVID-19 appropriate behaviour (proper mask usage, hand hygiene and social distancing) as noted by the clinician vs the scores as reported by the participants.
   Conclusion: There were few takers for the COVID-19 vaccine, even weeks after eligibility. The COVID-19 appropriate behaviour was largely not being followed properly and the false sense of following the same complicated issues further. With multiple waves of the pandemic one after the other, and booster doses of vaccination, there is still an urgent need to sensitise the population at the grass root level regarding the COVID-19 vaccine behaviour to fight this pandemic.

AB  - In recent years, European media and public discourse have been increasingly categorising newcomers using terminology like 'immigrants' and 'refugees'. The aim of this practice is to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate newcomers in the wake of the 2015 'refugee crisis' in Europe. Drawing on data from an online survey in Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Sweden (n = 6000) in September and October of 2017, this article investigates how the use of these categories relates to public opinion on 'immigrants' and 'refugees'. Findings show that people hold more positive attitudes towards 'refugees' than towards 'immigrants', a process which is likely driven by media framing. Attitude discrepancies within 'immigrant' and 'refugee' categories are also investigated, as categorical fetishism causes further differentiation of attitudes within these groups. Public opinion differences within 'immigrants' and 'refugees' are found along three cleavages: ethnicity, the economic situation of the origin country, and region of origin. Newcomers with the same ethnicity (vs. a different ethnicity), from 'rich' countries (vs. 'poor' countries), and from European countries (vs. non-European countries) are preferred in both categories. With these findings, this article reveals important aspects of the influence of migrant categorizations on public opinion towards vulnerable groups of newcomers.

AB  - This study explored the mediating and moderating processes through which social exclusion or ignorance causes employee behavioural outcomes in a workplace. Based on the conservation of resources (COR) theory, the study investigated the effect of perceived workplace ostracism on turnover intention as mediated by job stress and moderated by job autonomy among a sample of 144 employees from the consumer services sector in Malaysia. The results suggest that employees' perceived workplace ostracism leads to job stress, which in turn leads to negative behavioural outcomes such as turnover intention. Job autonomy was also found to have moderated the mediated relationship, whereby the relationship was stronger with low levels of job autonomy.

AB  - Most research on incivility in American politics focuses on its effects on citizens' political attitudes and behaviors, in spite of remarkably little data on the extent to which political discourse is actually uncivil. Those studies that do examine content focus on negative campaign advertisements, overlooking more egregious forms of political incivility that penetrate the broader media landscape. In this study, we attempt to conceptualize and measure more dramatic types of political incivility, which we term "outrage." Outrage discourse involves efforts to provoke a visceral response from the audience, usually in the form of anger, fear, or moral righteousness through the use of overgeneralizations, sensationalism, misleading or patently inaccurate information, ad hominem attacks, and partial truths about opponents. Scrutinizing 10 weeks of data from political blogs, talk radio, and cable news analysis programs, we demonstrate that outrage discourse is extensive, takes many different forms ( we examine 13 different types), and spans media formats. We also show that while outrage tactics are largely the same for liberal and conservative media, conservative media use significantly more outrage speech than liberal media. It is our hope that introducing more concrete information about the actual content of political media will render existing research on potential effects more meaningful.

AB  - The increasing visibility of prominent political leaders in news media is well documented in political science literature. The main concern that has been raised in this connection is that the complexity of political processes is being reduced to achievements and standpoints of individual politicians, and the importance of rational opinion building is discounted. The results of the current study provide the first empirical evidence to account for the misgivings about emotional effects of personalized political information on media audiences. Using data from an online experiment, this study shows that news coverage regarding behaviors and personal characteristics of a foreign leader influences (a) evaluations of personal characteristics typical of his or her nation's citizens and (b) emotional perceptions of that leader's country (sentiment and respect). This effect is shown to reflect a psychological phenomenon whereby people project their emotions and perceptions regarding a leader's personal characteristics onto his or her country and people.

AB  - Personality traits are considered efficient predictors of off-line political participation. However, the effects of personality traits on online political engagement have been largely understudied. The main goal of this cross-sectional research (N = 1,134, sample of young adults) was to investigate the relationships between personality traits, as measured by the Big Five Inventory, and online political engagement. As dependent variables, we took three dimensions of online political engagement: e-targeted, e-expressive, and e-news. A latent variables structural equation model showed that personality traits directly and indirectly predict modes of online political engagement via the mediation of political attitudes and the proneness to use Internet. On the whole, we found that people open to experience and extraverts take part in online political actions, whereas agreeable and conscientious people tend to avoid them. The findings provide insights on the differences between traditional form (i.e., off-line) and the new online modes of political engagement by showing that, to some extent, the latter appeal to different personality profiles. In sum, online engagement seems to be marked by a personality divide.

AB  - Authoritarian responses to rising violent crime rates have become a serious problem in Central America. Inspired by theories of agenda setting and media framing, this article examines the influence of news media coverage of crime on attitudes toward crime control. Using an original survey experiment, it tests the relationship between crime news, fear of crime, trust in government institutions, and support for authoritarian crime control measures in Guatemala. It finds that crime news influences support for authoritarian crime control via its effect on lowering citizen trust in government institutions. Exposure to crime news also affects self-reported victimization rates and levels of support for a presidential candidate promoting iron fist policies. These findings not only give insight into the relationship between crime news and political attitudes but also have implications for the rule of law and the politics of crime in new or fragile democracies.

AB  - Social connectedness derived from Facebook is associated with positive outcomes such as better psychological health wellbeing. Yet to date, little is known about the construct of Facebook social connectedness. The aim of this study was to draw on existing studies of Facebook use to investigate what might predict social connectedness stemming from Facebook use. Participants (N = 326, age range 18-78 years) provided demographic information and completed measures of Facebook use, attitudes towards Facebook, personality, and Facebook social connectedness. It was hypothesised that younger age, positive attitudes, extraversion and openness to experience would predict Facebook social connectedness. Interestingly, with only age and attitude in the model, being older and having more favourable attitudes to Facebook predicted social connectedness derived from Facebook, with age acting as a suppressor variable. With the addition of personality in the final model, favourable attitudes to Facebook, extraversion, and openness to experience predicted Facebook social connectedness. In contrast to predictions, emotional stability also contributed significantly to the model. Findings are discussed in terms of implications for the social connectedness of older adults, and the role of emotional stability in the generation of social capital and in the "social enhancement" hypothesis.

AB  - Research shows that news media around the world carry negative representations of ethnic minorities which incite violence, hatred or lead to more marginalisation and social exclusion [Bhatia, M., Poynting, S., & Tufail, W. (2018). Media, crime and racism. Springer; Elias, A., Mansouri, F., & Paradies, Y. (2021). Media, public discourse and racism. In A. Elias, F. Mansouri, & Y. Paradies (Eds.), Racism in Australia today (pp. 211-240). Palgrave Macmillan]. It is also the case that overt racism has become less tolerated in society and, therefore, racist discourses now tend to take more subtle forms, often disguised as reasonable concerns about threats to national culture, economic burdens or disruptions of social order [Bonilla-Silva, E. (2006). Racism without racists: Color-blind racism and the persistence of racial inequality in the United States. Rowman & Littlefield]. This is very much the case regarding the Roma. Yet, less research has been carried out on the way that the affordances of television - juxtaposition of images, captions, sound and voice-overs, editing, and resequencing - may have very specific ways to conceal racism. In this paper, using Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis, we examine the representation of the Roma in a Romanian television news report, in the case of a highly mundane story - a failure to pay electricity bills. We show how television news with its affordances can camouflage racism, and distract from the extreme poverty and social exclusion that Romani people experience in contemporary Europe.

AB  - Background: Despite advancements in understanding the impact of personal satisfaction on health, ambiguity persists regarding the concept of personal satisfaction.
   Purpose: To elucidate the meaning of personal satisfaction.
   Method: Walker and Avant's approach of concept analysis was used to guide the analysis. Databases were searched using the words "satisfaction" and "personal satisfaction." A literature search was conducted in the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Scopus, and PsycINFO databases to locate articles on personal satisfaction. The "quick search" option available on the website of the Saudi Digital Library was utilized to find articles that pertain to nonhealth-related, fields.
   Findings: Three defining attributes (the fulfillment of personal needs or wants, a positive affect, and a positive attitude) and three antecedents (personal needs or wants, the cognitive ability to judge or evaluate needs, and the freedom to decide how personal needs should be fulfilled) were identified. The study found that satisfaction improved health, quality of life, and productivity.
   Conclusion: The theoretical definition provides a connotative meaning, and is the first step toward concept validation and instrument development. The Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale are examples of empirical definitions for personal satisfaction with life and self, respectively.

AB  - Plain English Summary As an entrepreneur (during the COVID-19 pandemic), start looking for support in online communities-they are more than just knowledge repositories! While access to support is severely hampered by social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic, entrepreneurs can still access support in online communities. Yet, depending on how entrepreneurs approach them, communities offer more than just simple advice: depending on how entrepreneurs frame their posts and interact with the community, they can manage what support they receive from online communities. (1) Online communities can help resolve problems and collect critical resources in times of crisis, such as digital marketing tools to compensate client loss. (2) Online communities can support entrepreneurs to waterproof ideas in early venture stages through feasibility checks so that entrepreneurs can better evaluate opportunities. (3) Online communities can help understand and reflect on new emerging topics, such as work from home. (4) Online communities can provide tailor-made plans for entrepreneurs by engaging in frequent interaction with support seekers. Taken together, online communities can assist entrepreneurs in their actions which are especially important in times of great uncertainty.
   COVID-19 has caused significant and unforeseen problems for entrepreneurs. While entrepreneurs would normally seek social support to help deal with these issues, due to social distancing, physical networks are often not available. Consequently, entrepreneurs must turn to alternative support sources, such as online communities, raising the question of how support is created in such spaces. Drawing on an affordance perspective, we investigate how entrepreneurs interact with online communities and base our qualitative analysis on conversation data (76,365 posts) from an online community of entrepreneurs on Reddit during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings draw out four affordances that online communities offer to entrepreneurs (resolving problems, reframing problems, reflecting on situations, refocusing thinking and efforts), resulting in a framework of entrepreneurial support creation in online communities. Thus, our study contributes to debates around (1) entrepreneurs' support during COVID-19 and (2) digital affordances in the entrepreneurship context.

AB  - Background: After the global epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), lifestyle changes to curb the spread of COVID-19 (e.g., wearing a mask, hand washing, and social distancing) have also affected the outbreak of other infectious diseases. However, few studies have been conducted on whether the incidence of gastrointestinal infections has changed over the past year with COVID-19. In this study, we examined how the incidence of gastrointestinal infections has changed since COVID-19 outbreak through open data. Methods: We summarized the data on the several viruses and bacteria that cause gastrointestinal infections from the open data of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency for 3 years from March 2018 to February 2021 (from Spring 2018 to Winter 2020). Moreover, we confirmed three most common legal gastrointestinal infectious pathogens from March 2016. Results: From March 2020, when the COVID-19 epidemic was in full swing and social distancing and personal hygiene management were heavily emphasized, the incidence of infection from each virus was drastically decreased. The reduction rates compared to the averages of the last 2 years were as follows: total viruses 31.9%, norovirus 40.2%, group A rotavirus 31.8%, enteric adenovirus 13.4%, astrovirus 7.0%, and sapovirus 12.2%. Among bacterial pathogens, the infection rates of Campylobacier and Clostridium perfringens did not decrease but rather increased in some periods when compared to the average of the last two years. The incidence of nontyphoidal Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, or enteropathogenic Escherichia coli somewhat decreased but not significantly compared to the previous two years. Conclusion: The incidence of infection from gastrointestinal viruses, which are mainly caused by the fecal-to-oral route and require direct contact among people, was significantly reduced, whereas the incidence of bacterial pathogens, which have food-mediated transmission as the main cause of infection, did not decrease significantly.

AB  - The marine environment has plunged into crisis with the growth of human activities. The enhancement of responsible environmental behavior (REB) requires policy and education to cultivate social awareness and actions to sustain marine resources. Several studies revealed that the intention serves as an effective predictor of actual behaviors. Furthermore, researchers generally acknowledge that attitudes and perceived behavioral control are potential factors toward behavior intention. However, some research has found that a positive attitude toward the environment does not translate into responsible environmental behavior. Additionally, the model of behavior in the marine context, especially the relationships between attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and the intention of responsible environmental behavior, are still not clear. Students' attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and intentions toward responsible marine environmental behavior (M-REB) were evaluated via questionnaires. The data from a total of 79 undergraduate students were analyzed. The results suggest that perceived behavioral control is the mediator between attitudes and intentions toward M-REB. This finding reveals the potential benefits of reconsidering the importance of perceived behavioral control in promoting M-REB and provides empirical evidence for future policy-makers in society and education.

AB  - Introduction We evaluated sequelae of disease and therapy in adolescents with chronic endocrinopathies using a medical and psychological workup to record health-related quality of life (HRQoL), near final height (NFH) and body compositions during the transition period from paediatric to adult care. Methods Near final height, weight, body mass index (BMI), grip strength (GS), hip and waist circumference (HC; WC), skin folds (SF) and HRQoL T-scores by KIDSCREEN and DISABKIDS were assessed in 134 patients (70 females and 64 males) from May 2010 to March 2016 diagnosed with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH; n = 22), multiple pituitary hormone deficiency (MPHD; n = 17), growth hormone deficiency (GHD; n = 37), Turner syndrome (TS; n = 27), SGA-short stature (SGA; n = 20) and Klinefelter syndrome (KS; n = 11). Results Median HRQoL T-scores for KIDSCREEN (50.6-56.5) and DISABKIDS (52.7-58.9) ranged within references with considerable variations but without significant deficit in any diagnosis. Median-corrected height SDS (CoH-SDS: NFH-SDS-TH [target height]-SDS) was >-1, except in KS (SDS + 1.3) and in TS (SDS - 1.9;P < .0001) without correlations with HRQoL. Median BMI was below 25 kg/m(2)in all patients except MPHD (26.5 kg/m(2); SDS 1.5;P = .006). BMI correlated negatively in CAH females with self-perception (r(s) = -.64,P = .0338), physical well-being (r(s) = -.8;P = .0086), social exclusionr(s) = -.65;P = .031) and emotions (r(s) = -.7;P = .0169). Conclusion Health-related quality of life and body compositions were similar to those of healthy adolescents. Lower scores in HRQoL dimensions as self-perception, physical well-being, social exclusion and emotions were detected and correlated negatively with BMI. Treatment strategies and psychological support should consider HRQoL and adapted in specific treatment guidelines.

TI  - Relationships Between Initial COVID-19 Risk Perceptions and Protective Health Behaviors: A National Survey
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
LA  - English
KW  - SARS
AB  - Introduction: Perceptions of health risks inform decisions about protective behaviors, but COVID-19 was an unfamiliar risk as it began to spread across the U.S. In the initial stage of the epidemic, authors examined perceived risks for COVID-19 infection and infection fatality and whether these risk perceptions were associated with protective behaviors. They also examined whether findings differed between later versus earlier responders.
   Methods: Between March 10 and March 31, 2020, a cross-sectional online survey was conducted with a nationally representative U.S. sample (n=6,684). Half responded before March 13, 2020 (versus later). Participants assessed their risks of COVID-19 infection and infection fatality (0%-100%) which were transformed into quartiles (1-4). They reported their implementation of protective behaviors like handwashing and social distancing (yes/no). Analyses were conducted in April.May 2020.
   Results: Median perceived risk was 10.00% for COVID-19 infection and 5.00% for infection fatality, but respondents showed large disagreement. An increase of 1 quartile in perceived infection risk was associated with being 1.45 times (95% CI=1.33, 1.58) more likely to report handwashing, with perceived infection fatality risk showing no significant association. When predicting social distancing behaviors such as avoiding crowds, both quartile-based risk perceptions were significant (OR=1.24, 95% CI=1.17, 1.30 for infection and OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.13, 1.26 for infection fatality). Perceived COVID-19 infection risk, protective behaviors, and their relationship increased among later (versus earlier) responders.
   Conclusions: Despite disagreements about the risks, people perceiving greater risks were more likely to implement protective behaviors-especially later (versus earlier) in March 2020. These findings have implications for risk communication. (C) 2020 American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The adoption of nonpharmaceutical interventions and their surveillance are critical for detecting and stopping possible transmission routes of COVID-19. A study of the effects of these interventions can help shape public health decisions. The efficacy of nonpharmaceutical interventions can be affected by public behaviors in events, such as protests. We examined mask use and mask fit in the United States, from social media images, especially during the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests, representing the first large-scale public gatherings in the pandemic. Objective: This study assessed the use and fit of face masks and social distancing in the United States and events of large physical gatherings through public social media images from 6 cities and BLM protests. Methods: We collected and analyzed 2.04 million public social media images from New York City, Dallas, Seattle, New Orleans, Boston, and Minneapolis between February 1, 2020, and May 31, 2020. We evaluated correlations between online mask usage trends and COVID-19 cases. We looked for significant changes in mask use patterns and group posting around important policy decisions. For BLM protests, we analyzed 195,452 posts from New York and Minneapolis from May 25, 2020, to July 15, 2020. We looked at differences in adopting the preventive measures in the BLM protests through the mask fit score. Results: The average percentage of group pictures dropped from 8.05% to 4.65% after the lockdown week. New York City, Dallas, Seattle, New Orleans, Boston, and Minneapolis observed increases of 5.0%, 7.4%, 7.4%, 6.5%, 5.6%, and 7.1%, respectively, in mask use between February 2020 and May 2020. Boston and Minneapolis observed significant increases of 3.0% and 7.4%, respectively, in mask use after the mask mandates. Differences of 6.2% and 8.3% were found in group pictures between BLM posts and non-BLM posts for New York City and Minneapolis, respectively. In contrast, the differences in the percentage of masked faces in group pictures between BLM and non-BLM posts were 29.0% and 20.1% for New York City and Minneapolis, respectively. Across protests, 35% of individuals wore a mask with a fit score greater than 80%. Conclusions: The study found a significant drop in group posting when the stay-at-home laws were applied and a significant increase in mask use for 2 of 3 cities where masks were mandated. Although a positive trend toward mask use and social distancing was observed, a high percentage of posts showed disregard for the guidelines. BLM-related posts captured the lack of seriousness to safety measures, with a high percentage of group pictures and low mask fit scores. Thus, the methodology provides a directional indication of how government policies can be indirectly monitored through social media.

AB  - Highly automated driving (HAD) is expected to improve future road transport, especially for older adults, provided that it is trusted and accepted by drivers. Research on Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) suggests that system experience can enhance drivers' trust and acceptance. To evaluate the transferability of this result to HAD, we examined the development of drivers' trust and acceptance regarding this technology at different stages of system experience in a driving simulator as well as on a test track. Age effects were additionally addressed by comparing the results of 20 younger (25-45 years) and 20 older (65-85 years) drivers in the driving simulator study. Trust and acceptance were assessed before the initial system experience as well as after the first and second automated drive. Both age groups showed slightly positive a priori trust and acceptance ratings, which significantly increased after the initial experience and remained stable afterwards. Older drivers reported a more positive attitude towards using HAD despite their lower self-assessed self-efficacy and environmental conditions facilitating HAD-usage (e.g. technical support) compared to younger drivers. In the subsequent test track study, trust and acceptance of the younger driver group were assessed before and after experiencing HAD in a test vehicle. Neither trust nor acceptance decreased despite the absence of further system experiences between both studies and the increased realism on the test track. These results underline the importance of the initial system experience for HAD-trust and -acceptance and emphasize the significance of automotive technologies for the preservation of older drivers' mobility.

AB  - Cuba implemented policies mandating social distancing on March 11, 2020, which were still in place at the time of this study. During such periods of isolation, people with psychoactive substance-related disorders and other addictions may be tempted to reduce tension, stress, uncertainty and possible distress by increasing the use of substances or practices they have abused. This can mean relapses and setbacks for patients undergoing treatment. A multidisciplinary team of health professionals specializing in addiction at the Center for Academic Development in Drug Addiction, in Havana, Cuba, cares for people with these disorders and followed their evolution during the initial period of COVID-19 social isolation.
   With the aim of characterizing strategies employed by patients undergoing treatment for substance abuse and addictions, we conducted a qualitative study from April 2020 through May 2020, using a convenience sample of 37 patients (all students) who had been progressing towards recovery from addictive behaviors when face-to-face encounters were suspended due to COVID-19 restrictions. Contact was maintained through information and communication technologies. The research used telepsychology and focused on understanding patient life experiences. Patients were interviewed using a semi-structured survey, which was then transcribed and coded thematically using a grounded-theory approach.
   We found that patients' ability to cope successfully with challenges presented by COVID-19 were influenced by: 1) the individual's own methods for maintaining self-control (commitment to studies, projects, and work with therapists) that aided them in their goals concerning abstinence; 2) difficulties faced in addressing specific events and situations (doubts, uncertainties, disagreements, isolation and time use); 3) perpetuation and revivification of myths related to substances and addictive activities (exacerbation of supposed benefits of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, overuse of social networks); and 4) tendencies toward irrationality and lack of emotional control (fear, sadness, anger, constant worry and self-imposed demands).
   Our findings suggest that despite the potential negative psychological impact of preventive social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual coping mechanisms developed by these patients, aiming at improved self-control, allowed most to avoid setbacks that could have affected their recovery. Nevertheless, patients faced challenges to their recovery that were compounded by difficulties in specific situations, myths related to substances and addictive activities, and tendencies toward irrationality or lack of emotional control.

AB  - Consumer well-being often depends on compliance with service setting rules and product/service use guidelines. This issue came to the forefront during the COVID-19 pandemic. Here, we propose and test a compliance model in the context of COVID-19 social distancing guidelines. Although COVID mitigation is politicized, we fully mediate the impact of political ideology with three constructs: (1) consumer perception that freedom is restricted, (2) complacency, and (3) perceived ethicality. We suggest specific tools that help bypass the political polarization that has occurred in the pandemic. The model can be applied to other areas in which compliance is key to consumer well-being, such as enforcing age-related restrictions on purchases and safety-related behaviors.

AB  - This study examines the motivations for why politically interested Internet users in the United States access political blogs and attempts to discover which factors predict motivations for using political blogs. Political surveillance/guidance motives appeared as the strongest motivation for using political blogs, followed by expression/affiliation, convenience/information seeking, and entertainment. Hierarchical regression analysis reveals that blog users with higher levels of political involvement and strength of party affiliation are attracted to political blogs to freely express their political opinion and communicate with other like-minded people, which may indicate the potential of Weblogs as an interactive political discursive space. Based on the findings, this study presents implications and suggestions for future research. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: evaluate how the crack user is portrayed by the media. Method: qualitative study, using fourth generation evaluation. The data were collected in interviews and field observations in a mental health network service of the Porto Alegre-RS metropolitan area. The participants were 10 users, 11 family members, 08 health service professionals and 07 managers. Results: the findings revealed that media relates the crack user profile to violence, crime and disease, which does not correspond to the reality experienced in the health service. This image disregards the different ways of using the drug and the different productions of life of these individuals, increasing social exclusion and stigma. Final considerations: The challenge is to build shared, integrated, clear and honest information.

AB  - Background: With global aging, robots are considered a promising solution for handling the shortage of aged care and companionships. However, these technologies would serve little purpose if their intended users do not accept them. While the socioemotional selectivity theory predicts that older adults would accept robots that offer emotionally meaningful relationships, selective optimization with compensation model predicts that older adults would accept robots that compensate for their functional losses. Objective: The present study aims to understand older adults' expectations for robots and to compare older adults' acceptance ratings for 2 existing robots: one of them is a more human-like and more service-oriented robot and the other one is a more animal-like and more companion-oriented robot. Methods: A mixed methods study was conducted with 33 healthy, community-dwelling Taiwanese older adults (age range: 59-82 years). Participants first completed a semi-structured interview regarding their ideal robot. After receiving information about the 2 existing robots, they then completed the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology questionnaires to report their pre-implementation acceptance of the 2 robots. Results: Interviews were transcribed for conventional content analysis with satisfactory inter-rater reliability. From the interview data, a collection of older adults' ideal robot characteristics emerged with highlights of humanlike qualities. From the questionnaire data, respondents showed a higher level of acceptance toward the more service-oriented robot than the more companion-oriented robot in terms of attitude, perceived adaptiveness, and perceived usefulness. From the mixed methods analyses, the finding that older adults had a higher level of positive attitude towards the more service-oriented robot than the more companion-oriented robot was predicted by higher expectation or preference for robots with more service-related functions. Conclusion: This study identified older adults' preference toward more functional and humanlike robots. Our findings provide practical suggestions for future robot designs that target the older population.

AB  - Although research studies on dynamic assessment (DA) yielded promising results to the field of language teaching, scant research attention has been paid to examining the effectiveness of group dynamic assessment (G-DA) in relation to vocabulary development. To this effect, the present mixed-methods study was designed to inspect the potential of concurrent G-DA in enlarging receptive and productive vocabulary size of 56 Iranian intermediate EFL learners. The study used two modalities: the control group, which was taught the selected lexical items through traditional procedures such as using word lists; and the experimental group, which was offered group-based supportive prompts for doing vocabulary exercises within the G-DA framework. The results of a series of independent-samples t-tests indicated the significant effect of G-DA in enhancing receptive and productive vocabulary size of EFL learners. The qualitative data underscored the role of group mediation in increasing learners' motivation to increase vocabulary uptake within the G-DA framework and maintaining their positive attitude toward G-DA.

AB  - Store managers commonly use window signs to decorate their stores and, more importantly, to communicate store-related information to their customers. This research investigates the role window signs play in influencing consumers' attitudes and store patronage intentions. Empirical evidence from two studies (data from a real-life store environment and from an experimental setting) indicates that window signs generate positive inferences to consumers about the store image and the store promotion value, which ultimately influence consumers' patronage intentions. Furthermore, this study proposes and tests a model suggesting that window signs represent a diagnostic cue from which consumers infer a sense of place identity. The results show that place identity partially mediates the relationship between consumers' attitude toward window signs and consumers' store patronage intentions. Moreover, this study includes the store manager's perspective and finds evidence that retail managers have positive attitudes toward window signs, which encourage them to rely on this promotional tool to announce store promotions. Implications of the findings for the role of window signs are discussed.

AB  - Video abstracts (VAs) are a motion picture equivalent of written abstracts. With greater use of social media platforms for post publication promotions of research articles, VAs have gained increasing popularity among researchers in recent years. Widespread lockdowns and social distancing protocols in the pandemic period furthered the use of VAs as a tool for efficient learning. Moreover, these may be the preferred medium for communicating certain types of information, such as diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, qualitative research, perspectives, and techniques. In this article, the authors discuss the role of VAs in the advancement of academic research, plausible designs, freeware for making videos, and specific considerations for crafting good VAs.

AB  - Background:
   Social determinants of health (SDOH) may limit the practice of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) risk mitigation guidelines with health implications for individuals with underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD). Population-based evidence of the association between SDOH and practicing such mitigation strategies in adults with CVD is lacking. We used the National Opinion Research Center's COVID-19 Household Impact Survey conducted between April and June 2020 to evaluate sociodemographic disparities in adherence to COVID-19 risk mitigation measures in a sample of respondents with underlying CVD representing 18 geographic areas of the United States.
   Methods:
   CVD status was ascertained by self-reported history of receiving heart disease, heart attack, or stroke diagnosis. We built de novo, a cumulative index of SDOH burden using education, insurance, economic stability, 30-day food security, urbanicity, neighborhood quality, and integration. We described the practice of measures under the broad strategies of personal protection (mask, hand hygiene, and physical distancing), social distancing (avoiding crowds, restaurants, social activities, and high-risk contact), and work flexibility (work from home, canceling/postponing work). We reported prevalence ratios and 95% CIs for the association between SDOH burden (quartiles of cumulative indices) and practicing these measures adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbidity, and interview wave.
   Results:
   Two thousand thirty-six of 25 269 (7.0%) adults, representing 8.69 million in 18 geographic areas of the United States, reported underlying CVD. Compared with the least SDOH burden, fewer individuals with the greatest SDOH burden practiced all personal protection (75.6% versus 89.0%) and social distancing measures (41.9% versus 58.9%) and had any flexible work schedule (26.2% versus 41.4%). These associations remained statistically significant after full adjustment: personal protection (prevalence ratio, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.73-0.96]; P=0.009), social distancing (prevalence ratio, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.51-0.94]; P=0.018), and work flexibility (prevalence ratio, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.36-0.79]; P=0.002).
   Conclusions:
   SDOH burden is associated with lower COVID-19 risk mitigation practices in the CVD population. Identifying and prioritizing individuals whose medical vulnerability is compounded by social adversity may optimize emerging preventive efforts, including vaccination guidelines.

AB  - Purpose Due to recent developments of indoor location-tracking technologies, brick-and-mortar retailers are now able to add location-based marketing capabilities to their existing retail apps, providing retailers with new opportunities to interact with customers inside of their stores. The aim of this study is to identify factors influencing the customers' adoption intention of location-based retail apps for stationary retailing. Design/methodology/approach Based on the technology acceptance model, a conceptual model was developed. A Web-based survey was conducted in Germany with a final sample of 501 cases. Structural equation modelling was performed to test the hypotheses. Findings The results confirmed the positive relationship between attitude and the customers' intention to use location-based retail apps. Perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment promote a positive attitude toward location-based retail apps, while privacy concerns and fear of spam hinder the formation of a favorable attitude. Subjective norms have a positive effect on customers' usage intention. Practical implications The results help retailers who want to establish location-based retail apps at the point of sale (e.g. in the context of omni-channel strategies). Originality/value As previous research about location-based apps has mainly used empirical data from either Chinese or American samples, less is known about the perception of European customers. Research indicates that existing findings might not be transferable to European countries due to differences in values, social norms or regulations. Also, the failure of Shopkick in Germany illustrates the need for more research. Based on this, using a German sample to answer the research question, this study aims to provide a European perspective on location-based retail apps, and thereby extend existing research.

AB  - Objectives: The conditions under which adolescents should have access to birth control has been debated by U.S. policy makers and health officials for some time. Given the variability and fluidity of law and policy in this area and the high stakes described by advocates for and against access, identifying predictors of electorate opinion is important. Methods: This study utilized national panel data gathered in 2008 (T1) and 2010 (T2) to examine associations between U.S. adults' pornography consumption and attitudes toward adolescents' access to birth control. Results: Consistent with a social learning perspective on media, pornography consumption at T1 was associated with more positive attitudes toward adolescents' access to birth control at T2, even after accounting for T1 birth control attitudes and multiple potential third-variables. Consistent with Wright's (2011) acquisition, activation, application model (3AM) of media sexual socialization, this association was stronger for more morally individualistic adults. Contrary to a selective exposure perspective on media, birth control attitudes at T1 did not predict pornography consumption at T2. Conclusions: These findings have implications for the prediction of birth control attitudes specifically and the socializing influence of pornography more generally.

AB  - This study explores whether and how individuals evoke moral considerations when discussing their political beliefs. By analyzing open-ended responses in the 2012 American National Election Study using a previously validated dictionary, I find systematic ideological differences in moral reasoning, even when respondents are not explicitly asked about morality. The study proceeds to show that the reliance on moral considerations in attitude expression is amplified by the moral content of individual media environments.

AB  - Objective: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with no therapy, and pharmacists being a part of the health care system have a vital role in the management of COVID-19. The purpose of this study is to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices of community pharmacists (CPs) regarding COVID-19. Method: An online survey was conducted among 393 CPs in 2 provinces of Pakistan during the lockdown period. A validated questionnaire (Cronbach's alpha, 0.745) was used for data collection. All statistical analyses were analyzed by using SPSS, version 21 (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). Results: Among 393 participants, 71.5% (n = 281) had good knowledge, 44% (n = 175) had a positive attitude, and 57.3% (n = 225) had good practices regarding COVID-19. Social media (45.29%, n = 178) were reported as the main source to seek information of COVID-19. Good knowledge, age >= 26 years, and a PhD degree level were the substantial determinants (P = < 0.05) of a good attitude. Similarly, a CP with experience of > 5 years, a PhD degree, good knowledge, and a good attitude has higher odds of having good practices as compared with reference categories (P = < 0.05). Conclusion: In short, a majority of the CPs had good knowledge but had a poor attitude and practice toward the management of COVID-19. Standard-structured educational and counseling programs for CPs regarding COVID-19 are needed for effective management.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the effect of calculative, affective and normative commitment on bank employee-customer rapport and customer satisfaction. The mediating effect of rapport between each of the three types of commitment and customer satisfaction is also examined.
   Design/methodology/approach - Structural equation modelling by Partial Least Square method is used for analysing the data on 212 bank customers in Bangladesh.
   Findings - Results indicate that affective and normative commitment of customers has strong influence in developing rapport, whereas the impact of customers' calculative commitment on rapport was found to be non-significant. The study also found that rapport has a complementary mediation effect between the three types of commitment and customer satisfaction.
   Practical implications - While providing training to front line employees, bank management should make them aware that not all customers may have the same level of positive attitude or cooperation for the rapport-building procedure. Employees should understand that different customers will respond differently to their efforts for building rapport due to their pre-existing commitment levels towards banks. Bank management should acknowledge that customers' current level of commitment may be further strengthened or weakened by successful or unsuccessful rapport building with banks' employees and thereby re-evaluate their satisfaction level with the bank.
   Originality/value - The study contributes to the relationship literature by exploring the mediating role of rapport between commitment and customer satisfaction, and by considering the influence of normative commitment on customer-employee rapport in financial services.

AB  - This study examines the Twitter network discussing the inclusion of Laurel Hubbard, the first out trans woman Olympian, during the 2020 Tokyo Games. By analyzing the Twitter reactions, top opinion leaders, and the modularity of the network, this study uncovers that (a) the majority of the top 10 most-liked tweets and the top influential social actors hold a negative attitude toward Laurel Hubbard's participation in the women's category; (b) compared to traditional news agencies, social media influencers and newly launched digital media agencies play a more important role in facilitating the flow of information in this network; and (c) the observed Twitter network is highly clustered, indicating that individuals tend to interact with people more frequently within their segregated subgroup, whereas information diffusion across clusters is more restricted. This research contributes to the understanding of how Twitter users perceive the inclusion of trans athletes at international sporting events by empirically exploring the Twitter network of Laurel Hubbard, the first out trans female athlete in Olympic history.

AB  - This study reports on the development of a professional spoken register among learners of German as they participate in four synchronous Web conferences with German-speaking professionals. The researchers investigated the effect of interaction with expert German speakers combined with an instructional intervention focusing on pragmatic competence on the development of learners' ability to communicate in a second language (L2) professional register. The data reveal a positive effect on the strategic use of modal verbs for expressing polite requests as well as a moderate effect on learners' use of the subjunctive mood to establish social distance. These results add further support for the use of intercultural online exchanges mediated by data-driven instruction in the foreign language classroom and highlight the utility of a microgenetic approach to analyzing spoken data.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the mediating effects of self-stigma and depression on the public stigma and nurses' attitudes toward psychiatric help. A cross-sectional study with 184 nurses at one general hospital in South Korea was conducted employing a self-administered survey, using the Attitudes toward Seeking Psychological Help Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory-II Scale, and the modified Depression Stigma Scale. A multiple-mediation analysis procedure was applied to analyze the data. Each indirect effect of self-stigma (B = -0.0974, bootLLCI, bootULCI: -0.1742, -0.0436) and depression (B = -0.0471, bootLLCI, bootULCI: -0.1014, -0.0060) is statistically significant in the relationship between public stigma and attitudes toward psychiatric help. The individualized intervention for enhancing positive attitude or motivation for seeking help at the personal level of the nurse and depression tests-including regular physical health check-ups-is necessary.

AB  - Guided by the theory of planned behavior and the science communication learning goals model, we conducted a survey to identify science communication training needs of university scientists (n = 266) at a large US land-grant university. Results indicate that most respondents believed scientists and media relations offices were most responsible for communicating science to the public but only somewhat responsible for their learning of science communication or its outcomes. In addition, respondents who had higher levels of interest and enjoyment in science communication perceived their content knowledge to be higher and reflected on science communication concepts and processes better than respondents with lower levels of interest and enjoyment. We also found that scientists who participated in science communication training during the past three years enjoyed science communication more and were more likely to contribute than scientists who did not participate. Results suggest that communication training should focus on increasing scientists' positive attitudes toward public engagement and motivating scientists to feel responsible for public engagement. Trainers should encourage scientists to share their communication experiences with colleagues, expose them to science communication resources, and help them recognize their individual role in the science communication process..

AB  - Research on the influence of social networks on political behavior has led to findings showing an apparent trade-off between positive attitudes toward the outparty and political engagement. The prevalent sentiments have been that partisan bonding or ties with fellow partisans hurts evaluations of the outparty but helps political engagement. Partisan bridging or ties with opposite partisans, on the other hand, improves evaluations of the outparty but hurts engagement. I argue that this trade-off is essentially an illusion driven by a mistaken assumption that bonding and bridging are two opposite ends of the same continuum. Analyzing two original national surveys of the American public, I show that bonding and bridging are independent constructs with different consequences. Consistent with previous studies, I find that bonding hurts and bridging helps outparty attitudes. Both bonding and bridging, however, are positively related to political engagement. I also show that network disagreement partially mediates the effects of partisan bonding, but not the effects of partisan bridging. This suggests that the efforts to encourage voters to build relationships with politically different others can be done without having to worry that they will lead to decreased engagement.

AB  - Purpose This project developed and evaluated the efficacy of a game decision aid among pregnant women about prenatal screening in a randomized controlled study.
   Study Design Participants were recruited from an obstetric clinic of an academic urban medical center and randomized ( n =73) to one of two study groups: the control group ( n =39) that used a brochure or the intervention group ( n =34) that also used a game decision aid.
   Result Participants who played the game had higher knowledge scores ( m =21.41, standard deviation [SD]=1.74) than participants in the control group ( m =19.59; SD=3.31), p =0.004. The median time of game playing was 6:43 minutes (range: 2:17-16:44). The groups were similar in frequency of completing screening after the study, control=6 (15%) versus intervention=11 (32%), p =0.087. However, the more interaction with the game resulted in more positive attitudes toward screening.
   Conclusion The addition of a game decision aid was effective in educating pregnant women about prenatal screening. As other genetic testing decisions continue to increase within clinical care, game-based decision tools may be a constructive method of informed decision-making.

AB  - Although individuals scoring high on Neuroticism tend to avoid taking action when faced with challenges, Neuroticism is also characterized by impulsivity. To explore cognitive biases related to this costly behavior pattern, we tested whether individuals who rated themselves as higher in Neuroticism would evaluate the general concepts of action and inaction as, respectively, more negative and positive. We further investigated whether anxiety and depression would mediate and individualism-collectivism would moderate these relations in a large international sample. Participants (N=3,827 college students; 69% female) from 19 countries completed surveys measuring Neuroticism, attitudes toward action and inaction, depression, anxiety, and individualism-collectivism. Hierarchical linear models tested the above predictions. Neuroticism negatively correlated with attitudes toward action and positively correlated with attitudes toward inaction. Furthermore, anxiety was primarily responsible for emotionally unstable individuals' less positive attitudes toward action, and individuals who endorsed more collectivistic than individualistic beliefs showed a stronger negative association between Neuroticism and attitudes toward action. Researchers and practitioners interested in understanding and remediating the negative consequences of Neuroticism should pay greater attention to attitudes toward action and inaction, particularly focusing on their links with anxiety and individualism-collectivism.

AB  - Islamophobia is a severe issue in Germany and other Western societies. To advance our understanding and contribute to possible solutions, the present two-wave field study investigated the role of TV consumption in the emergence and maintenance of Islamophobia in a weighted sample of non-Muslim Germans (N = 97; aged 14-33 years). Past research has indicated a negative bias in Islam-related news coverage, which is especially extreme on German private TV channels. The present study investigated the relationship between TV consumption and Islamophobia using Slater's theory of reinforcing spirals of media selectivity and effects (Slater, 2007, Communication Theory, 17, 281-303). It sought to investigate the validity of and to refine Slater's theory. Thus, TV consumption was differentiated between quantity and quality (divided between preference for public channels ARD/ZDF and private channels RTL/Sat.1). We hypothesized (a) a significant cross-sectional relationship of quantity and quality of TV consumption (preference for public/private channels) to the Islamophobia level, and (b) a mutual reinforcement of quantity/quality of TV consumption and Islamophobia over time. Results of step-wise linear regressions showed significant relations of private channel preference to levels of Islamophobia (cross-sectional) and a mutually reinforcing spiral process between the private channel preference and Islamophobia over time. The results emphasize (a) the importance of a specification of the construct of media use central to Slater's theory and (b) the need for an improvement of the Islam-related news coverage to decrease Islamophobia in Germany.

AB  - Until 2017, Germany was an exception to the success of radical right parties in postwar Europe. We provide new evidence for the transformation of the Alternative for Germany (AfD) to a radical right party drawing upon social media data. Further, we demonstrate that the AfD's electorate now matches the radical right template of other countries and that its trajectory mirrors the ideological shift of the party. Using data from the 2013 to 2017 series of German Longitudinal Elections Study (GLES) tracking polls, we employ multilevel modelling to test our argument on support for the AID. We find the AfD's support now resembles the image of European radical right voters. Specifically, general right-wing views and negative attitudes towards immigration have become the main motivation to vote for the AM. This, together with the increased salience of immigration and the AfD's new ideological profile, explains the party's rise.

AB  - The use of social networking sites, such as Facebook, provides ample opportunities for the pursuit of interpersonal connection but may also bring to mind one's social isolation. The present research examined the effects of interpersonal neglect (i.e., low number of responding Facebook friends) on the satisfaction of fundamental human needs. Two studies revealed that receiving few responses from one's Facebook friends threatens the needs for belonging, self-esteem, control, and meaningful existence. These effects were observable over and above the impact of general social connection to others (i.e., total number of Facebook friends) and tone of responses.

AB  - This research work investigates the usage of Open Educational Resources (OER) and Print Educational Materials by the students of Federal College of Education Katsina, Nigeria. Using descriptive survey, 358 students were sampled as respondents. The research find out that while print section still remain relevant, an alarming negative attitudes by the students toward print educational materials have been found. Factors including students' learning needs and interest, infrastructural decay, outdated books stocks, under equipped nature of the print sections and the unfriendly attitudes of the librarians toward clients are responsible this attitudes. However, OER enjoy an overwhelming patronage of students. The unrestricted nature of open educational resources coupled with its ease of access, freeness, proximity, relevance and IT infrastructural advancements are what make it an educational hotcake of the time. Better funding of education, inculcation of reading culture in younger generation, massive development of print materials into open educational resources and in-service training of library staff has been recommended.

AB  - Guided by the anxiety/uncertainty management theory, two studies were conducted among domestic students (majority; Study 1) and international students (minority; Study 2) in China. The main goals were to determine across the two samples: (a) whether intergroup anxiety and uncertainty can mediate the relationships of both offline contact (OFF-CON: direct face-to-face contact) and online contact (ON-CON: online contact through social networking sites) with perceived communication effectiveness; (b) whether OFF-CON can moderate the relationships of ON-CON with anxiety, uncertainty, and effectiveness. Results from the two studies showed that OFF-CON had indirect relationships with effectiveness via uncertainty and that OFF-CON acted as a moderator that modified the relationship between ON-CON and effectiveness. The key difference between the two studies was that Study 1 revealed anxiety as a negative predictor of effectiveness, while Study 2 revealed non-significance between the two constructs.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between message variables and affective reactions with parents' attitudes after seeing a physical activity mass media public service announcement (PSA). It was hypothesized that there would be a positive relationship between message variables (i.e., personal relevance, novelty of information, and feelings toward sponsoring organization) and parents' attitudes toward their child/children's physical activity after viewing the PSA. Furthermore, we explored whether discrete affective reactions were related to attitudes, beyond the effect of message variables. A secondary data analysis was conducted with parental responses to an online campaign evaluation survey (n=267). Hierarchical regression analyses showed an overall positive relationship between all three message variables and attitudes. Furthermore, two discrete affective reactions were positively related to attitudes. Parents who endorsed feeling motivated or guilty after viewing the advertisement had more positive attitudes toward their children's physical activity levels. This study represents an ecologically valid assessment of how message variables and affective reactions are related to attitudes within the context of a physical activity mass media campaign. The results provide guidance for the effective design of mass media physical activity campaigns.

AB  - Older adults were at particular risk for loneliness during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this instance, the use of computers for communication (i.e. computer-mediated communication, CMC) may help to enhance older people's social interactions and relationships. In the present study, 113 community-dwelling users of CMC, aged 65 years and over, were surveyed in order to better understand the effects of CMC in addition to the individual characteristics contributing to patterns of online communication. An opportunity to examine the impact of the pandemic on CMC behaviours presented approximately 12 months after the initial study with 70 participants resurveyed. High levels of social functioning, in addition to good physical and psychological health, were reported by this group of digitally active users. A positive association between high CMC use and social functioning was noted, even after controlling for differences in personality, frequency of face-to-face communication, health, gender, and relationship status. Interestingly, the pandemic saw a reduction in weekly CMC use, although CMC-based behaviours remained unchanged. The present findings highlight the important role that technology has in facilitating and maintaining supports and, potentially, reducing social isolation by helping older adults stay in touch with family and friends.

AB  - Voting resulted in pioneering knowledge about the political attitudes and behaviors of ordinary people, as well as of methods for study of political process. Paul Lazarsfeld and his team found that voters were not the rational decision makers of economic theory, but neither were they puppets manipulated in mass society. Voters are social beings as influenced by their social milieu and peers as they are with regard to other social and cultural preferences and behaviors. The 1948 election in U.S. politics was fought on longstanding and stable socioeconomic cleavages. Multiculturalism, identity politics, and racial justice were not on the political agenda. Lazarsfeld was mindful that ideological issues might lead to antidemocratic tendencies, as in 1930s Europe. Since the 1950s there have been major changes in the political media and in political culture. This forum article explores the extent to which Lazarsfeld's findings about the electoral process are applicable in the present time.

KW  - INFORMATION
KW  - ACCEPTANCE
AB  - Since augmented reality (AR) has been increasingly applied in education recently, the investigation of students' learning experiences with AR could be helpful for educators to implement AR learning. With a quantitative survey using three questionnaires, this study explored the relationships among 153 students' perceived cognitive load, motivation, and attitudes of perceived control, perceived usefulness, behaviour of learning, and behaviour of AR learning, when they engaged in an AR book reading activity. The results indicated that, in general, the students perceived less cognitive load, stronger motivation, and more positive attitudes towards the experiences when reading an AR book. However, dissimilar to past studies, the perceptions of low level cognitive load cannot be guaranteed to lead to positive intentions to learn. Interestingly, motivation mediated the relationships between the students' perceived cognitive load and behavioural intention to learn. Only when the students' perceptions of motivational factors such as attention or confidence were significant did the perceived usefulness and cognitive load play a role in their behavioural intentions to take part in future AR learning. The findings of this study may provide insights for future AR-related studies to explore the role of cognitive load in learning performance with consideration of motivational factors.

AB  - Two studies were conducted to examine user perceptions of content effects and behavior on social media. Study 1 employed interviews with Millennials and Baby-Boomers (N = 17) and found that some behaviors on Facebook were seen as undesirable (e.g., excessively posting photos of food), Users held third-person perceptions (TPP) such that they believed that they personally posted content on Facebook less frequently than others did, especially pertaining to undesirable content. A follow-up online survey in Study 2 (N = 140) showed empirical support for the distinction between desirable and undesirable behaviors on Facebook in user perceptions. TPP was found for all undesirable behaviors, but first-person perception (FPP) emerged for some desirable behaviors on Facebook. Results also indicated users' TPP in the perceived effects of content including news, advertisements, and brand communications on Facebook, with social distance moderating TPP's magnitude (i.e., TPP increases as the distance of the comparison group from self increases). Overall, the two studies suggest that there exists a robust self-other discrepancy in the perceived effects of media content and the frequency of behavior on social media. These findings contribute to the understanding of TPP and FPP, especially with regard to judgment of social media impact and behavior.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this research was to explore the perceived value of clinical clerkships in the radiology curriculum as well as the impact of radiology clerkship on students' beliefs about the profession of radiology as a whole and as a career.
   Methods: This study is a sequel to a previous survey in which student perceptions about radiology curriculum components were investigated. The present study focuses on a further analysis of a subsection in this study, based on 14 statements about radiology clerkship and two statements about radiology as a career.
   Results: Perceived usefulness of the aspects of radiology clerkship as "radiology examination", "skills development" and "diagnosis focus" were awarded the highest scores. The predict value of the subscale "radiology examination" on the level of performance was very high (adjusted R-2 = 0.19, p < .001).
   Conclusion: Students expressed highly favorable evaluation of clerkship as a learning environment to learn to order and to interpret imaging studies as well as an unique possibility to attend various radiological examinations and to access to specific radiology software systems, as well as to get a better view on radiology and to improve image interpretation skills. This positive attitude towards clerkship is closely tied to students' beliefs about the profession of radiology as a whole. These aspects of dedicated radiology clerkship are crucial for effective and high-quality education as well as for the choice of radiology as a career. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Introduction: Student wellbeing is a key component of pharmacy programmes, with most events occurring in-person through co-curricular or extra-curricular activities. With the shift to online classes due to COVID-19, many wellness events were cancelled due to social distancing limitations. However, promotion of wellbeing was considered to be of utmost importance during this time due to rising levels of stress and social isolation among students. Description: The school's Instagram and Facebook accounts were managed by a group of the university's faculty for six weeks. Each week, different daily wellness themes were shared and participation by followers encouraged through quizzes, polls, or reposts. The Instagram stories and posting platforms were used routinely with select posts also shared via Facebook. A new hashtag was created and promoted to encourage additional posting and community building. Video stories were also shared of faculty expressing their mental/physical health challenges and subsequent coping mechanisms during COVID-19. Results: During the last six weeks of virtual learning, 280 stories and 23 posts were shared via Instagram. Shared stories included promotion of: cardiovascular exercise, weight training, yoga, music, media, gratitude, recognition, positive thinking, coping and games. Overall, 20 different faculty and staff were involved in sharing video stories to promote wellbeing. Of the 13 posts also shared to Facebook, a total of 10,429 people were reached. Conclusion: School social media platforms can be used to regularly connect virtually during times of crises. Promoting wellness activities can help engage students and faculty/staff to ensure they are focusing on their own wellbeing. With social distance regulations for the foreseeable future, pharmacy programs should consider using social media as a wellbeing tool for both student and faculty/staff engagement

AB  - Visual communication, especially films, can be an effective way to teach complex topics. The use of films in business schools, however, has been limited even though demand for such content is increasing. This article takes a focused look at how educators can take advantage of films to teach diversity in business. Despite the importance of diversity in business and marketing education, there is not enough written materials such as case studies to teach it. Even when they do exist, written content may not be adequate in communicating the issues involved in diversity because of difficulties related to representing a given diversity group only using text. This article discusses how films can help overcome the limitations of text-only representation of a specific diversity group-intellectually disabled workers. The empirical study shows that film can be more effective than text in eliciting consumer responses such as emotions and a positive attitude to an identified disabled personality as well as to the employer brand. This article also provides practical steps that educators can take in gradually integrating visual materials such as film to their traditional method and contents of instruction when teaching diversity in business.

AB  - During the 1994 Rwandan genocide, rape was widely used as a strategic weapon against Tutsi women. More than 20 years later, many of these women are still suffering devastating psychological, social, and physical effects of these experiences and remain in need of effective interventions that address their complex trauma. This article develops the theory of genocide rape trauma management as a conceptual framework for promoting the holistic health and recovery of female genocide rape survivors. A qualitative study using grounded theory explored the lived experiences of genocide rape survivors and led to the development of this model. The need for a contextually appropriate model is highlighted, with historical and current data regarding the Rwandan context and the experiences of genocide rape survivors. The research details the complex dynamics of emotional, physical, existential, and psychosocial sequelae related to genocide rape trauma, and how these interact with both local community and broader political attitudes toward survivors, as well as the serious interrelated economic challenges and limitations in current public health and welfare services. The research demonstrates the necessary elements of a holistic approach encompassing a synergistic combination of skilled psychological care, self-help strategies, collaborative support groups, community education, social reintegration, advocacy, accessible medical care, and economic empowerment. These interacting elements form the basis of the theory of genocide rape trauma management, offering an encompassing integrated framework that can be adapted to, and evaluated in, other similar contexts.

AB  - Purpose: Considerable research has examined public attitudes toward the police. Yet, little is known about the effects of direct and vicarious police stops upon youths' attitudes and perceptions of police. The purpose of the current study is to analyze the relationship between direct and vicarious police stops and urban youths' attitudes of and perceptions toward police officers.
   Methods: Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Survey (FFCWS), linear and ordered logistic regressions were used to examine the relationship between police stops and urban youths' perceptions of and attitudes toward police officers.
   Results: Findings indicate that direct and vicarious police stops are associated with lower levels of respect and confidence in the police. We also found that direct and vicarious police stops have a positive relationship with perceptions of procedural justice. However, the positive effect of police stops on procedural justice is mitigated by the level of police intrusiveness during such stops.
   Conclusions: While our findings on respect and confidence suggest that direct and vicarious police stops are catalysts of negative attitude formation, we also show that direct and vicarious stops play an important role in curbing negative sentiments of police injustice.

AB  - The Web 2.0 has significantly changed how consumers plan for and book trips. For example, online content showing climate-induced, unfavorable conditions at a destination might influence overall attitudes toward that destination. Two experimental studies confirm that when consumers learn of unfavorable conditions in a destination (e.g., snow deficiency) through online content, they develop more realistic travel expectations and ultimately more positive attitudes toward the destination, compared with when they review online content that ignores the unfavorable conditions. In addition, user-generated content influences the mediating effect of realistic expectations on the relationship between climate-induced, unfavorable conditions at a destination and attitudes toward the destination, whereas DMO-generated content does not. Implications underline the importance of realistic destination marketing communication strategies. The study contributes to the understanding of consumer response to realistic social media content in tourism.

AB  - Attitudes towards immigration are among the core predictors of attitudes toward the European Union. However, even though most citizens learn about immigration through the media, we lack a comprehensive account of how media coverage of immigration influences support for the European Union. In this study, we use a combination of European Social Survey and Media Claims data to investigate the effects of the visibility and valence of immigration and refugee media coverage on political trust in the European Union in 18 countries between 2012 and 2016. Our results show that media coverage of immigration and refugees influences trust in the European Union; however, the effects depend on citizens' ideological leaning and content characteristics. Furthermore, we find that the impact of immigration attitudes on trust in the European Union becomes more important over the course of the refugee crisis.

AB  - Rationale: Individuals living in Scotland's most deprived communities experience a higher burden of morbidity and early mortality than those living in more affluent areas. Experiences of poverty-based stigma may be one psychosocial mechanism through which socioeconomic position influences health, although there is little available data on this issue from a Scottish perspective.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to identify which aspects of poverty stigma are particularly salient to individuals with lived experience of poverty, and may therefore contribute to health inequalities.
   Methods: Five focus groups were conducted with 39 individuals with experience of living on low incomes in Scotland in order to explore their experiences and perceptions of poverty stigma.
   Results: Five main themes were identified, reflecting aspects of poverty stigma operating at various structural, public and individual levels: media representations of poverty; negative encounters with social security systems; perceived public attitudes regarding poverty in Scotland; lowered self-esteem and intemalisation of negative attitudes, and; emotional responses to stigma.
   Conclusion: These dimensions of stigma potentially influence public health and health inequalities in Scotland, although future research will be necessary to quantify these and estimate their relationships with health outcomes.

AB  - Prejudice towards Muslim people in Western countries is common and increasing. This paper describes an educational intervention aimed at increasing positive attitudes and actions to support Muslim Australians. University students participated in a 12-week educational programme that drew on prejudice reduction principles and a pedagogical approach that emphasised active discussion. Results (N = 94) showed an increase in positivity towards Muslim people, increased intention to take bystander action to confront prejudice, and social identification (as a supporter of positive relations between Muslim and non-Muslim Australians). Boosts in positivity towards Muslim people and intention to confront prejudice were mediated by increases in social identity, although changes in social identification only explained increased commitment to confront prejudice in a low risk scenario. Results suggest that educational interventions such as these can foster new, inclusive identities that provide a basis for action to support Muslim people.

While putting the film into the socio-historical context of the newly milled German Republic, the study aims to highlight the characters' struggle and constant shift between their Turkish and German identity. Through the narrative and textual analysis of Brothers and Sisters, the paper reveals the visual forms of social exclusion and concludes that in Arslan's film, the characters hear with no social identity but various stages of identification, which keep them in an in-between, insecure position.

AB  - Health care social workers' attitudes towards evidence-based practice (EBP) are an indispensable precursor of implementing EBP. Using a subset including 405 health care social workers from the first nationally representative survey of social workers in China, this study empirically assesses how transformational leadership (TFL) promotes health care social workers' attitudes towards EBP. The results show that organisational learning capacity (OLC) and professional competence (PC) fully mediate the positive relationship between TFL and EBP attitudes. Furthermore, TFL, OLC and PC explain 56% of the variance in health care social workers' attitudes towards EBP. This result supports the perspective that both organisational factors and individual factors may facilitate social workers' positive attitudes towards EBP, but organisational factors are more important. Therefore, to adopt, use and sustain EBP in health care social work, learning and innovation in the organisation should be increased. Furthermore, it is important to help social workers improve their PC.

AB  - This study aims to explain the positions regarding change in language of instruction in Russian-medium schools. The empirical basis for this article is a representative survey conducted in 2009 among pupils (n=1026) and teachers (n=548) in Estonia. The results indicate that in the case of teachers' language proficiency, individual resources (citizenship, Estonian-language media) dominate over regional (ethnic composition) ones. Regarding pupils' language proficiency, apart from individual factors (gender, Estonian-language media), school-level activities are essential (language immersion, teachers' in-service training). While pupils' positive attitudes towards education change are characterized by individual and school cultural resources, teachers' attitudes are more autonomous and express general societal affiliation. The article suggests that the cultural translation ability of the relevant individuals and in the public turns out to have critical relevance in the context of implementing integration policy and in the communication of changes in education.

AB  - Restorative justice was reborn in the 1970s with a promise to provide a better sense and experience of justice, especially for those who are let down the most by the criminal justice system. And yet, despite well-evidenced disproportionality and race inequality issues within criminal justice institutions, restorative justice research and practice within the context of race are almost nonexistent. This article aims to unravel this paradox while looking at the scant extant literature to explore the alternative and more personalized restorative justice vision of the other and cultural differences. An expansive conceptual model that is aligned with the integrative nature of restorative justice is then posited for further pilots and research. The article warns that if restorative justice continues to ignore the challenges raised within a race equality context, the power structures inherent within our current structural framework of criminal justice will lead to its demise.

AB  - Engaging communities at risk of social exclusion poses a big challenge for science communicators. We schematize a framework for projects using science & art to promote social inclusion, composed of 3 phases - design, plan and collaboration; implementation; and evaluation. We present a case study that aimed to engage with a community of migrant senior women, mostly illiterate. Our findings suggest high engagement was achieved by building trust, involving emotions, choosing a relatable topic and following participatory practices. Inclusive activities occurred on the short-term, but for medium-term impact, community insiders need to be regarded as a second audience.

AB  - Self-stigma has been identified as a crucial factor affecting reluctance to seek psychological help and known to be associated with depressive symptoms. However, no research to date has been conducted examining the relationship between depressive symptoms and self-stigma among university students in South Korea. The current study examined the influence of depressive symptoms on self-stigma and the mediating effect of social support (family and friends) on the relationship between depressive symptoms and self-stigma among university students. A total of 240 students at 4 universities in South Korea completed in-class surveys in Spring, 2016. The survey included self-report measures of depressive symptoms, social support, and self-stigma of help-seeking, as well as socio-demographic measures. Results indicated that depressive symptoms contributed significant variance to self-stigma of help-seeking; the relation was positive. The findings from 3-step regression analysis revealed that friends support partially mediate the relationship between depressive symptoms and self-stigma. With the transition to university, the importance of friends support becomes more influential and critical to help-seeking behaviors among university students than family support. Intervention strategies targeting shaping positive attitudes and norms toward mental illness and receiving mental health services among university students for promoting help-seeking behaviors were suggested.

AB  - Background: The current studies aim to show that descriptive social norms influence vegetable intake and to investigate three potentially underlying processes (self-identification, attitude, and self-efficacy). Methods: In two studies, descriptive social norms regarding vegetable intake were manipulated (majority vs. minority norm). Study 1 investigated both the relation between baseline vegetable intake and self-identification, attitude, and self-efficacy, as well as the effect of the norm manipulation on vegetable intake over a one-week period. Study 2 investigated potential mediation of the effect of the manipulation on vegetable intake intentions through self-identification, attitude, and self-efficacy. Results: Study 1 showed that the proposed mediators were related to a baseline measure of vegetable intake. Moreover, in participants identifying strongly with the norm referent group, majority norms led to higher vegetable consumption than minority norms. Study 2 showed that the direct effect of the social norm manipulation on vegetable intake intentions was partly mediated by self-identification, attitude, and self-efficacy. Conclusions: These studies shed first light on processes underlying the effect of descriptive social norms on health behavior. A norm describing the behavior of a salient social group leads people to identify more with, have more positive attitudes toward, and feel more self-efficacious regarding that behavior.

AB  - Purpose: Proctored surgical instruction has traditionally been taught through in-person interactions in either the operating room or an improvised wet lab. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, live in-person instruction was not feasible owing to social distancing protocols, so a virtual wet lab (VWL) was proposed and implemented. The purpose of this article is to describe our experience with a VWL as a Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) skills-transfer course. This is the first time that a VWL environment has been described for the instruction of ophthalmic surgery. Methods: Thirteen participant surgeons took part in VWLs designed for DMEK skills transfer in September and October 2020. A smartphone camera adapter and a video conference software platform were the unique media for the VWL. After a didactic session, participants were divided into breakout rooms where their surgical scope view was broadcast live, allowing instructors to virtually proctor their participants in real time. Participants were surveyed to assess their satisfaction with the course. Results: All (100%) participants successfully injected and unfolded their DMEK grafts. Ten of the 13 participants completed the survey. Respondents rated the experience highly favorably. Conclusions: With the use of readily available technology, VWLs can be successfully implemented in lieu of in-person skills-transfer courses. Further development catering to the needs of the participant might allow VWLs to serve as a viable option of surgical education, currently limited by geographical and social distancing boundaries.

AB  - During adolescence, the Internet is mainly used for purposes of socialization. Non-verbal elements limit online communication, thus leading to widespread use of emotional resources. It would be preferable if virtual interaction did not reduce the quality of person-to-person contacts, particularly thanks to the adoption of netiquette (respectful treatment of others online). Phubbing, the tendency to check one's mobile phone during a face-to-face conversation, has become a widespread practice that causes anxiety and can lead to social exclusion. Educating on this behavior could be related with emotional content and with netiquette. This study's objectives are to analyze the extent to which the use of netiquette and online emotional content are associated with and can predict phubbing, taking gender differences into account. 935 adolescents (ages 12-17, 55,1% female) from 13 schools in the region of Aragon (Spain) responded to our questionnaire. Results are revealing: the level of online emotional content increases the level of phubbing; online emotional expression is the most influential risk factor in both genders; netiquette protects girls to a greater degree. We discuss the educational challenges posed by guaranteeing the responsible use of social networks.

AB  - The structure of a social network plays a crucial role for dynamic analysis, which is invisible in most scenes. In this paper, we present a model for reconstructing the social network by taking into account the public opinion diffusion dynamic model for specific agenda. First, the initial polarity attitude of users
   i for the agenda,
   o i, is set in the range
   [ - 1 , 1 ], where negative and positive attitudes are set as
   -1 and 1, respectively, while 0 means that user
   i's attitude is uncertain. Second, we present an optimization model for detecting the relationship among each pair of users based on the generated public observable information. The experimental results for four synthetic networks and three real-world social networks show that the reconstruction accuracy depends on the uncertainty of the initial attitudes greatly. This work is helpful for revealing the structure of social networks in terms of public information.

AB  - Background: Contraceptive compliance has become a major health concern around the globe, particularly in rural parts of Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess contraceptive compliance among rural women of the reproductive age group in the Awi zone, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 2341sampled rural women's reproductive age group from Jan to April 30; 2021G.C. Multistage random sampling was employed. A multilevel logistic regression model was used to identify the predictors of contraceptive compliance, which allows us to account for the random component. Intra-cluster correlation coefficient (ICC) statistics were also computed to measure the variation between clusters. Results: Results showed that prevalence of contraceptive compliance in the selected districts of Awi zone was 17.1%. At individual level, women's aged 35-49 (AOR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.28, 0.90), married women's (AOR = 8.81, 95% CI 4.62, 16.66), had 1 to 2 living children (AOR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.06, 1.40), women's work status hard (AOR = 5.80, 95% CI 2.85, 11.82) and moderate (AOR = 4.71, 95% CI 2.39, 9.28), long-acting (AOR = 1.84, 95% CI1.28, 2.64) and positive attitude (AOR = 2.71, 95% CI1.16, 6.33) and at hierarchical level (group level), mass media exposure (AOR = 1.78, 95% CI 1.32, 2.41) and enforcement exposure (AOR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.19, 2.65) were significant factors of contraceptive compliance. Moreover, results for the intra-class correlation coefficient show that variation exists between clusters. Conclusion: Individual-level (women's age, married women's, number of living children, women's work status, type of contraceptive method and attitude) and community-level (mass media exposure and enforcement exposure) were found to be significant factors associated with compliance in Awi zone.

AB  - Purpose The aim of this study is to determine the effects of brand components (CBBE, brand fit, brand image, brand reputation, brand familiarity) on consumers brand portfolio attitude via perceived risk (for two main portfolio strategies). Design/methodology/approach The study used a structured questionnaire to collect primary data from 636 consumers who made purchases from companies using house of brand (318) and branded house strategy (318). By conducting reliability and validity analysis, the model of this study was tested with confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis methods, using structural equation modeling. Findings According to the results of the path analysis, the effects of CBBE and brand reputation on brand attitude were confirmed for both house of brand and branded house strategy. Moreover, the full and partial mediating effect of perceived risk was proven in the relationships. Research limitations/implications One of the limitations of the study is determining a portfolio of brands for each strategy and collecting data for these brands. In addition, since the number of consumers using brand portfolios could not be reached in the study, data could be collected using the purposeful convenience sampling method. For this reason, it is thought that research conducted with the data obtained through systematic sampling methods can yield more reliable results. Practical implications Managers of companies with a brand portfolio should work on a main strategy that enhances CBBE and brand reputation regardless of the strategy they use. After these two variables, the variable that portfolio managers need to address is brand fit. Originality/value It will offer different perspectives in terms of understanding which portfolio strategy is needed, and which predecessors and outputs can be produced. Also, the findings of the research will produce important results to reduce the perceived risks of consumers and increase their positive attitudes toward brand portfolios.

AB  - Objective: This experiment aims to investigate the influence of narrative information varying in the degree of perceived similarity and source credibility in supplemented testimonials on the acceptance of digital mental health services (digi-MHSs).</p>
   <br></p>
   Methods: In fall 2020, n=231 university students were randomly assigned to an active control group (aCG, n=55, "information only") or one of three intervention groups (IGs) receiving information plus different testimonials being presented either by nonacademic staff (IG1, n=60), university students (IG2, n=58) or experts (IG3, n=58). We assessed mediation effects of similarity and credibility on acceptance in terms of attitudes and usage intentions.</p>
   <br></p>
   Results: Exposure to testimonials was associated with higher usage intentions (d=0.50) and more positive attitudes toward digi-MHSs (d=0.32) compared to mere information (aCG). Regarding source-related effects, one-way ANOVA showed group differences in intentions ( ? p 2 =0.13) that were significantly higher after exposure to testimonials targeted at students than in the other groups after adjusting for baseline intentions ( ? p 2 =0.24). Concerning underlying mechanisms, there were full mediation effects of similarity (IG1 versus IG2) on attitudes [95%CI (0.030, 0.441)] and intentions to use digi-MHSs [95%CI (0.100, 0.528)] and of credibility on attitudes [IG2 versus IG3; 95%CI (-0.217, -0.004)], all favoring students' testimonials.</p>
   <br></p>
   Conclusion: Overall, this study indicates that the acceptance of digi-MHSs can be substantially increased by providing a simple, context-sensitive information intervention, including testimonials by university students. Since we identified mediating effects of credibility on cognitive attitudes and similarity on affect-driven intentions, a future trial could vary these features using narrative versus statistic information on digi-MHSs.</p>

AB  - Several studies (e.g., Haz 2005) have found German to be easier to -understand for Dutch listeners than Dutch for German listeners. This asymmetry has been attributed to the fact that German is an obligatory subject in Dutch secondary school and that many Dutch people watch German television. In contrast, it is much less common for German children to learn Dutch at school and for German people to watch Dutch television. It cannot be excluded, however, that in addition to the extralinguistic factor of language contact, linguistic factors also play a role in the asymmetric intelligibility between German and Dutch. The present study aimed at gaining insight into the phonetic-phonological factors playing a role in Dutch-German intelligibility at the word level for speakers of the respective languages in a first confrontation (i.e., assuming no prior language contact).
   We presented highly frequent Dutch and German cognate nouns, recorded by a perfect bilingual speaker, to Dutch and German children between 9 and 12 years in a word translation task. The German and Dutch children were comparable in that they did not know the other language or a related dialect and expressed equally positive attitudes towards the other language, its speakers and the country. It was thus ensured that language contact and language attitude could not play a role in the present study.
   Our results revealed that the Dutch subjects were significantly better at under-standing the German cognates (50.2% correct translations) than the German subjects were at understanding the Dutch cognates (41.9%). Since the relevant extra-linguistic factors had been excluded, the asymmetry must have a linguistic basis. A thorough analysis of the 16 cognate pairs with an asymmetry larger than 20% showed that (combinations of) neighbors (lexical competitors), phonetic detail and asymmetric perceptions of corresponding sounds play a major role in the explanation of the asymmetry.

AB  - Online learning environments facilitate improved student learning by offering IT tools to enhance student productivity- and creativity-in-learning. COVID-19 impacted social-distancing measures forced an abrupt switch to online learning in most universities, putting immense pressure on the students to creatively adapt to new ways of online learning. Despite the purported positives of online learning, in the COVID-19 scenario, students reported mixed outcomes. While some students could adapt to the 'new normal', others struggled to adjust to the transformed IT-enabled learning scenario. Grounding our work in IT mindfulness literature, we posit that an ITenabled learning environment may have differential impact on students' productivity- and creativity-in-learning, depending on the extent of their IT mindfulness. Besides leveraging the mindfulness-to-meaning theory, we hypothesize the mediating role of techno eustress in the relationship between student IT mindfulness and learning effectiveness. We test the theorized model through data collected via a two-wave survey in a university student population exclusively using IT-enabled learning environments during the pandemic lockdown period. Results indicate that IT mindfulness has significant positive relationships with both productivity- and creativityin- learning. Moreover, these relationships are mediated by the students' techno eustress perceptions. Theoretical and practical implications arising from our study are also discussed.

AB  - Background: An ear infection is a common health problem in children. Parents' awareness about otitis media (OM) among children, varies across the world. We aimed to explore parents' knowledge, attitude, and practices toward OM among their children. Methods: A quantitative cross-sectional study was done from May 1, 2020 to June 30, 2020, in Qassim, Saudi Arabia. Results: This study comprised 703 participants; Mothers comprised the majority (77.1%), 43.2% of the participants were aged between 31 and 40 years of age, and 73% of them had Bachelor's degrees or diplomas. More than half of the participants had suboptimal knowledge of OM. Although the result showed that 56% of them had positive attitudes, 86.6% did not view vaccination as a prevention measure of acute OM (AOM). Besides, 81.8% of parents were willing to follow the watchful waiting approach, in case their child had OM. Conclusion: Most of the parents in the Qassim region have inadequate knowledge regarding OM among children. Based on our result findings, we recommend further education programs to enhance the knowledge regarding OM and AOM, among the Qassim population, Saudi Arabia including family members of patients and the healthcare workers.

AB  - This paper examines the impacts of smartphone application usage on mobility choice dimensions, such as individuals' visits to new places, individuals' trips planned in groups, their participation at social gatherings, and vehicle kilometers traveled. It uses data from the Smartphone Use and Travel Choice Survey 2015, which was conducted exclusively on smartphone users of Halifax, Canada. A latent class random parameter logit (LCRPL) modeling technique is applied in this study that provides a better understanding of the effects of smartphone application usage on mobility choices. The model results offer behavioral insights regarding the influence of individuals' attitudes, travel characteristics, built environment and accessibility measures on the relationship between smartphone application usage and mobility choices. For instance, living in the higher mixed land-use areas, individuals are less likely to increase their vehicle kilometers traveled due to smartphone application usage, especially if they are tech savvy. Such individuals tend to increase their participation in social gatherings. One of the unique features of this study is that it explores the effects of individuals' smartphone application usage on mobility choices in terms of their attitudes. The study reveals that in case of people with positive attitude towards sustainable travel, smartphone application usage tends to decrease vehicle kilometers traveled, new place visits and planned group trips, however, increase participation in social gatherings. Results of this study provide critical behavioral insights that could be useful for transportation planners and policy makers to develop flexible policy interventions.

AB  - Julian Ochorowicz (1850-1917) belonged to the first generation of psychologists who regarded this discipline as a scientific, positive endeavor. At the same time, he was a representative of psychic sciences, following a strictly positivist attitude to researching psychic phenomena. This article discusses the key event of his career, experiments with the famous medium Eusapia Palladino, in Warsaw, between late 1893 and early 1894. Ochorowicz's seances with Palladino attracted wide local and international attention and improved his standing as an internationally leading psychic researcher. In Warsaw, however, these experiments were fiercely controversial and, as a result, Ochorowicz was discredited and left the city. As I argue, this dissociation of credibilities was the outcome of a changing media landscape in the late nineteenth century. While Ochorowicz's strategy of boundary-work and asserting his credibility aimed at scholarly media, it proved fatal when facing intensive, daily coverage in the popular press.

AB  - We examined in two empirical studies how situational and personal aspects of uncertainty influence laypeople's understanding of the uncertainty of scientific information, with focus on the detection of tentativeness and perception of scientific credibility. In the first study (N = 48), we investigated the impact of a perceived conflict due to contradicting information as a situational, text-inherent aspect of uncertainty. The aim of the second study (N = 61) was to explore the role of general self-efficacy as an intra-personal uncertainty factor. In Study 1, participants read one of two versions of an introductory text in a between-group design. This text provided them with an overview about the neurosurgical procedure of deep brain stimulation (DBS). The text expressed a positive attitude toward DBS in one experimental condition or focused on the negative aspects of this method in the other condition. Then participants in both conditions read the same text that dealt with a study about DBS as experimental treatment in a small sample of patients with major depression. Perceived conflict between the two texts was found to increase the perception of tentativeness and to decrease the perception of scientific credibility, implicating that text inherent aspects have significant effects on critical appraisal. The results of Study 2 demonstrated that participants with higher general self-efficacy detected the tentativeness to a lesser degree and assumed a higher level of scientific credibility, indicating a more na ve understanding of scientific information. This appears to be contradictory to large parts of previous findings that showed positive effects of high self-efficacy on learning. Both studies showed that perceived tentativeness and perceived scientific credibility of medical information contradicted each other. We conclude that there is a need for supporting laypeople in understanding the uncertainty of scientific information and that scientific writers should consider how to present scientific results when compiling pertinent texts.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many governments to impose social distancing measures upon its citizens, including in the Netherlands. Motivating adolescents to adhere to measures such as social distancing can be challenging, since adolescents are relatively more affected by them, while experiencing virtually no personal health benefit. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic seems to impact the social environment of adolescents in schools, as some media sources have reported bullying and stigmatisation of students with an Asian appearance. This study aims to explore the experiences of adolescents regarding their Health-Protective Behaviour (HPB), as well as the prevalence and expression of stigma towards ethnic minorities within the context of the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. We performed a cross-sectional mixed-methods study, including two independent online questionnaires. An adapted version of the "HPB" questionnaire (n = 528) and the "Measure of Disease-Related Stigma (MDRS)" questionnaire (n = 380), were administered to Dutch adolescents of 10-16 years old, attending primary or secondary school. Furthermore, 15 interviews were held with eight male and seven female adolescents. All data collection took place between March 17 and April 20, 2020. Results show that adolescents perceive COVID-19 as a threat to other peoples' health, rather than their own, and report adherence to public health measures in the interest of older and more vulnerable members of their community. We found no convincing evidence for widespread misinformation or stigmatising of certain ethnic groups among adolescents related to COVID-19 during this study. Participants acknowledged such behaviour happened in the early stages of the pandemic, before this study was initiated. Adolescents are a vital group for public health researchers to engage with during a pandemic, even when reaching them can be challenging.

AB  - Background During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, many countries have instituted population-wide measures for social distancing. The requirement of patients on dialysis for regular treatment in settings typically not conducive to social distancing may increase their vulnerability to COVID-19.
   Methods Over a 6-week period, we recorded new COVID-19 infections and outcomes for all adult patients receiving dialysis in a large dialysis center. Rapidly introduced control measures included a two-stage routine screening process at dialysis entry (temperature and symptom check, with possible cases segregated within the unit and tested for SARS-CoV-2), isolated dialysis in a separate unit for patients with infection, and universal precautions that included masks for dialysis nursing staff.
   Results Of 1530 patients (median age 66 years; 58.2% men) receiving dialysis, 300 (19.6%) developed COVID-19 infection, creating a large demand for isolated outpatient dialysis and inpatient beds. An analysis that included 1219 patients attending satellite dialysis clinics found that older age was a risk factor for infection. COVID-19 infection was substantially more likely to occur among patients on in-center dialysis compared with those dialyzing at home. We observed clustering in specific units and on specific shifts, with possible implications for aspects of service design, and high rates of nursing staff illness. A predictive epidemic model estimated a reproduction number of 2.2; cumulative cases deviated favorably from the model from the fourth week, suggesting that the implemented measures controlled transmission.
   Conclusions The COVID-19 epidemic affected a large proportion of patients at this dialysis center, creating service pressures exacerbated by nursing staff illness. Details of the control strategy and characteristics of this epidemic may be useful for dialysis providers and other institutions providing patient care.

AB  - Background: Public health institutions are making a great effort to develop patient-targeted online services in an attempt to enhance their effectiveness and reduce expenses. However, if patients do not use those services regularly, public health institutions will have wasted their limited resources. Hence, patients' electronic loyalty (e-loyalty) is essential for the success of online health care services.
   Purposes: In this research, an extended Technology Acceptance Model was developed to test e-loyalty intent toward online health care services offered by public health institutions.
   Methodology: Data from a survey of 256 users of online health care services provided by the public sanitary system of a region in Spain were analyzed. The research model was tested by using the structural equation modeling approach.
   Findings: The results obtained suggest that the core constructs of the Technology Acceptance Model (perceived usefulness, ease of use, and attitude) significantly affected users' behavioral intentions (i.e., e-loyalty intent), with perceived usefulness being the most decisive antecedent of affective variables (i.e., attitude and satisfaction). This study also reveals a general support for patient satisfaction as a determinant of e-loyalty intent in online health care services.
   Implications: Policy makers should focus on striving to get the highest positive attitude in users by enhancing easiness of use and, mainly, perceived usefulness. Because through satisfaction of patients, public hospitals will enlarge their patient e-loyalty intent, health care providers must always work at obtaining satisfied users and to encourage them to continue using the online services.

AB  - Typically, residents play a role in developing strategies and innovations in tourism. However, few studies have sought to understand the role of Islamic religiosity on the perceived socio-cultural impacts of sustainable tourism development in Pakistan. Previous studies focusing on socio-cultural impacts as perceived by local communities have applied various techniques to explain the relationships between selected variables. Circumstantially, the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique has gained little attention for measuring the religiosity factors affecting the perceived socio-cultural impacts of sustainable tourism. This investigation aims to address such limitations in this area of scientific knowledge by applying Smart PLS-SEM, developing an empirical approach, and implementing Smart-PLS software V-3.2.8. The proposed tourism model predicts the effects of the religiosity level on the perceived socio-cultural impacts of sustainable tourism development. In this study, we examine the relationships among religious commitments, religious practice, and religious belief and the socio-cultural effects of sustainable tourism. Our research identifies influential factors through an extensive literature review on communities' religiosity and the socio-cultural impacts of developing sustainable tourism. We examine and analyze data based on 508 residents' responses. The findings reveal an R-2 value of 0.841, suggesting three exogenous latent constructs, which collectively elucidate 84.10% of the variance in the perceived socio-cultural impact of sustainable tourism. The findings reveal that religious respondents with a higher religiosity level have a positive attitude towards developing sustainable tourism. These findings are helpful to understand the dynamics of communities' perceptions, behaviors, quality of life, cultural aspects, and religiosity factors affecting sustainable tourism in Pakistan. This study is novel in the context of Pakistani cultural and social norms, and this study's implications may provide further direction for researching and developing sustainable tourism in the northern regions of Pakistan.

AB  - The present study aimed to: (a) investigate the relationship between attitudes toward same-sex parenting and sexism both in heterosexuals and sexual minorities; (b) verify whether sexism predicted negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting via the mediating role of sexual stigma (sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and internalized sexual stigma [ISS] in lesbians and gay men [LG]). An Italian sample of 477 participants (65.6% heterosexual people and 34.4% LG people) was used to verify three hypotheses: (a) heterosexual men showed higher levels of sexism than heterosexual women and LG people; (b) heterosexual men reported more negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting than those of heterosexual women and LG people; and (c) sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and ISS in LG people mediated the relationship between sexism and attitudes toward same-sex parenting. Overall, men and heterosexual people showed stronger sexist tendencies and more negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting. Moreover, sexism affected attitudes toward same-sex parenting via sexual prejudice in heterosexual people and ISS in LG people. These results suggest that negative attitudes toward same-sex parenting reflect sociocultural inequalities based on the traditional gender belief system and points to the necessity of social policies to reduce prejudice toward sexual minority groups.

AB  - While alternative media have long been playing important roles in the politics of protests and resistance in many countries, the Internet has led to the emergence of online alternative media and arguably expanded the reach of such outlets. This article focuses on the audience of Internet alternative media. It examines the factors associated with usage and whether and how usage relates to political participation. Analysis of survey data (N = 1,018) in Hong Kong shows that, not surprisingly, Internet alternative media usage was driven by preexisting political attitudes and critical views toward the mainstream media. But social media usage could also drive alternative media usage even among people who did not hold congruent preexisting attitudes. Meanwhile, alternative media usage leads to protest participation and support for unconventional protest tactics. The study thus provides empirical evidence regarding how Internet alternative media can facilitate the formation of an active online counterpublic and the role of social media in potentially enlarging the counterpublic.

AB  - Purpose - Ex-prisoners often face significant challenges in their efforts to find meaningful and stable work, undermining their chances of successful reintegration back into the community. These problems are likely to be compounded for those who have an intellectual disability (ID), given evidence that the disabled generally experience high levels of discrimination when applying for and maintaining jobs. The purpose of this paper is to determine whether members of the public hold different attitudes and expectations towards the employment of ex-offenders who have an ID and a history of criminal offending.
   Design/methodology/approach - Samples of 642 participants, recruited via social media, were presented with vignettes, and then completed a short survey designed to measure their attitudes and expectations towards the employment of ex-offenders.
   Findings - Whilst the presence of a mild ID did not significantly affect community attitudes towards ex-offender employment, it did change expectations about employment outcomes.
   Research limitations/implications - It appears that ex-offenders are perceived as a homogenous group of people, despite actual and substantial differences existing within this population.
   Practical implications - There is a need to actively educate the community about differences between subgroups of ex-offenders in relation to the employment needs of those with an ID.
   Social implications - The social inclusion of ex-offenders with an ID lies at the heart of any effective and progressive criminal justice policy.
   Originality/value - This is one of the only studies that has examined public attitudes towards this group.

AB  - Political discourses about Muslim immigration in the media and on social networking sites (SNSs) are highly contentious and have the potential to further polarize societal segments, which may ultimately harm democratic processes. Especially on SNSs, politicians and citizens can circumvent journalistic filters often resulting in blatant and emotionally charged content. Using a two-wave panel design (N = 559), we investigated how positive and negative portrayals of Muslims in traditional media outlets and on SNSs influence anti-Muslim immigration attitudes among people who either agree or disagree with the encountered information. Our findings indicate that exposure to negative portrayals further reinforces anti-Muslim immigration attitudes among those who agree with the encountered information. In contrast, for those who disagree with the negative information, a backfire effect emerges, showing that anti-Muslim attitudes even decrease. This effect occurs for both SNSs and traditional media. Positive information about Muslims did not result in attitude polarization.

AB  - The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and hippocampus (HIPP) are two key brain regions associated with pain and pain-related affective processing. However, whether and how pelvic pain alters the neural activity and connectivity of the ACC and HIPP under baseline and during social pain, and the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms, remain unclear. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) combined with electrophysiology and biochemistry, we show that pelvic pain, particularly, primary dysmenorrhea (PDM), causes an increase in the functional connectivity between ACC and HIPP in resting-state fMRI, and a smaller reduction in connectivity during social exclusion in PDM females with periovulatory phase. Similarly, model rats demonstrate significantly increased ACC-HIPP synchronization in the gamma band, associating with reduced modulation by ACC-theta on HIPP-gamma and increased levels of receptor proteins and excitation. This study brings together human fMRI and animal research and enables improved therapeutic strategies for ameliorating pain and pain-related affective processing.

AB  - English language vocabulary is not static and unchangeable, especially because it is constantly enriched as the world changes. All this is reflected in audiovisual media, which people around the world can access easily via the cinema, TV or the internet. Since authors like Hopkins (2013), Israel (2013), Kabooha (2016), Kusnierek (2016), Li and Brand (2009), Peters et al. (2016), Rodgers (2013) and Shing and Yin (2014) have found that audiovisual media can contribute to second language acquisition, the aim of this research is to establish if and to what extent they influence the acquisition of vocabulary of English as a foreign language among high school students in Serbia. In order to obtain the data, we examined the frequency and manner of use of audiovisual media in a questionnaire and collected the data on vocabulary knowledge in a test. The research was conducted in a grammar school and the informants were 99 second and fourth-grade students. The data were coded and statistically processed in SPSS 20.0. It was established that those students who spent more time using audiovisual media had a positive attitude towards them and achieved better results on the vocabulary test.

AB  - Green consumer behaviour has received increasing attention in recent years, but research offers only limited explanations for the links between consumers' positive attitudes and their behaviour. Drawing from the consumer psychology literature and the theory of cognitive dissonance, we start by the anticipated guilt and highlight the role of perceived consumer effectiveness in the relationship between anticipated guilt and green consumer intention. Based on the hypotheses, we propose a conceptual model of anticipated guilt-green consumer intention link under different green involvement. We test our arguments with the survey data of 435 questionnaires and a structural equation model via Amos software. The results show that consumers' anticipated guilt is positively associated with their perceived effectiveness, and increases green consumption intention through the mediating mechanism of perceived consumer effectiveness. Green involvement negatively moderates the relationship between anticipated guilt and green consumption intention.

AB  - Background: Although usage and acceptance are important factors for a successful implementation of clinical decision support systems for medication, most studies only concentrate on their design and outcome. Our objective was to comparatively investigate a set of traditional medication safety measures such as medication safety training for physicians, paper-based posters and checklists concerning potential medication problems versus the additional benefit of a computer-assisted medication check. We concentrated on usage, acceptance and suitability of such interventions in a busy emergency department (ED) of a 749 bed acute tertiary care hospital.
   Methods: A retrospective, qualitative evaluation study was conducted using a field observation and a questionnaire-based survey. Six physicians were observed while treating 20 patient cases; the questionnaire, based on the Technology Acceptance Model 2 (TAM2), has been answered by nine ED physicians.
   Results: During field observations, we did not observe direct use of any of the implemented interventions for medication safety (paper-based and electronic). Questionnaire results indicated that the electronic medication safety check was the most frequently used intervention, followed by checklist and posters. However, despite their positive attitude, physicians most often stated that they use the interventions in only up to ten percent for subjectively "critical" orders. Main reasons behind the low usage were deficits in ease-of-use and fit to the workflow. The intention to use the interventions was rather high after overcoming these barriers.
   Conclusions: Methodologically, the study contributes to Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) research in an ED setting and confirms TAM2 as a helpful diagnostic tool in identifying barriers for a successful implementation of medication safety interventions. In our case, identified barriers explaining the low utilization of the implemented medication safety interventions - despite their positive reception - include deficits in accessibility, briefing for the physicians about the interventions, ease-of-use and compatibility to the working environment.

AB  - Due to the positive effects of resilience on different dimensions of health, the aim of this study was to propose and examine a model for a deeper understanding of the predictive factors of resilience. In this hypothetical model, self-esteem was suggested as the mediator of the relationship between spiritual health and resilience. This correlational design's statistical sample consisted of 240 university students who were chosen via multilevel cluster sampling from different faculties of Iran University of Medical Sciences in 2018. For data collecting, the Spiritual Health Questionnaire, Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory, and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale were utilized, and for data analysis, the Pearson correlation method and structural equation modeling were calculated using SPSS 18 and LISREL 8.5 software. According to the results of the current study, self-esteem played a partially mediating role in the relation between spiritual health and resilience. The fitness indices demonstrated satisfying fitness of the model. Since spiritual and religious beliefs are important topics in the lives of the people of Iran, it is possible to strengthen the field of self-esteem and resilience through education on spirituality and increase their positive attitudes toward life.

AB  - This research offers one of the first analyses of the US public's views about synthetic biology, based on nationally representative survey data. We provide in-depth, multiyear descriptive results of public attitudes toward this issue and compare them with individuals' attitudes toward other issues. Our data indicate that the public does not generally feel informed about synthetic biology or believe it is personally important. However, Americans express more reservations about the moral downside of synthetic biology than about other issues. Multivariate analysis reveals that values and predispositions-particularly religiosity, deference to scientific authority and trust in scientists-are linked to support for synthetic biology. We also see evidence indicating that deference to scientific authority reduces the potential for religiosity and distrust in scientists to polarize public attitudes about synthetic biology. We conclude by describing the implications of our findings for the development of synthetic biology research and upstream public engagement.

AB  - Mammography can be painful and unpleasant, but effective interventions to improve the experience remain scarce. As a first step towards more effective interventions, we aimed to achieve a thorough, contemporary understanding of thoughts, feelings and behaviours which affect and arise from mammography experiences. Research and professional experience suggest that the interaction between client and practitioner may be paramount in determining the quality of a client's experience. Therefore, this study aimed to capture the perspectives of clients and mammography staff from UK breast screening programmes. Thematic analysis of semi-structured qualitative in-depth interviews with 22 clients and 18 staff revealed that clients had positive attitudes to breast screening and mostly low knowledge about potential harms. Staff data indicated that some women attend for breast screening under pressure from others. Pain and coping with it were prominent themes, with wide variations in pain experiences. Clients recognised differences in mammographers' abilities to put them at ease. Staff difficulties included empowering clients within the confines of a taxing technique, and maintaining compassionate care when under strain. Future intervention development should focus on the information and support needs of women prior to the appointment and on effectively training and supporting mammographers to deal with challenging encounters.

AB  - Scottish independence has been a topic of considerable political debate for some time, with the 2014 referendum concerning whether Scotland should remain a part of the United Kingdom testament to this fact. Numerous economic and political factors have been noted as determinants of the referendum vote. However, the role of psychological factors as a predictor of the desire for independence has not been well explored despite much work demonstrating the importance of specific traits and values on a range of socio-political attitudes. In the current study, using a sample of Scottish adults (n = 271), we sought to examine how two core constructs capturing moral sentiment - binding (reflecting concern for group cohesion and norms) and individualizing (reflecting concern over individual rights) - predicted the desire for independence during the build-up to the referendum. Results indicated that lower binding and higher individualizing predicted a desire for independence, with evidence for mediation via Scottish identification. These findings are consistent with the notion that the Scottish independence movement can be viewed as a broadly left-wing phenomenon. More generally, these results provide novel evidence in a charged political debate that moral sentiments concerning how individual and group life should be structured play a significant role in explaining individual differences in political sentiment.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the knowledge, attitudes, and practices concerning antibiotic prescriptions to children with URTIs among pediatricians and to identify barriers to appropriate antibiotic prescription among pediatricians. Methods: An online-based survey was conducted among pediatricians in Shaanxi province, western China, with a population of 38.35 million and an area of 205,600 square kilometers. Results: A total of 472 pediatricians completed this survey, with the response rate of 26.0%. The theoretical knowledge about antibiotics was excellent, with a median score of 8(0-8). However, 30.1% of the respondents still believed that antibiotics are anti-inflammatory drugs. The pediatricians' age, education level, and monthly income and whether had ever received training had significant associations with their knowledge level. The attitude scores were 41.1 +/- 3.6, with a ranged of 29-52 points (total score of 55), indicating that most respondents had positive attitudes toward antibiotics. However, 22.7% of the respondents still preferred to use antibiotics for URTIs. It was found that uncertain diagnosis, parent requirements and insufficient time were barriers to appropriate antibiotic prescription. The indiscriminate prescription of antibiotics to children with URTIs was prevalent among pediatricians. Conclusion: Effective integrated interventions should be developed to promote the prudent use of antibiotics among pediatricians.

AB  - Sharing economy (SE) platforms are increasingly providing an effective means of connecting providers and users of secondhand goods. While media seem to emphasize that the trend of selling/buying secondhand has been growing due to the consolidation and development of peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing platforms, a comprehensive identification of the antecedents of buying secondhand on SE platforms is virtually missing. This study addresses this gap by (a) identifying different sets of motivations and attitudes leading consumers to adopt SE platforms for secondhand buying and (b) testing a model on a sample of UK consumers in the context of P2P sharing platforms for secondhand clothing. This study reveals that there are three major antecedents of consumers' attitude towards buying secondhand clothes on P2P-SE platforms: perceived sustainability, economic motivations, and taking a distance from the consumption system. Perceived sustainability and economic motivations influence positively attitude toward buying secondhand, as well as motivations in the form of distance from the consumption system. Attitude toward buying secondhand is positively influenced also by distance from the system and, in turn, has a strong positive influence on behavioral intention to buy secondhand clothes. Moreover, past experience of buying secondhand online has a positive moderating effect on the relationship between perceived sustainability and distance from the consumption system.

AB  - The adoption and integration of digital technology in organizations are crucial not only for communication, administration and management, but also a meaningful asset to support learning and teaching as well as organizational change. However, existing models of educational technology adoption and integration predominantly focus on school settings as well as on individual factors explaining the assimilation processes. Therefore, this research intents to fill the gap of a holistic model of technology adoption in educational organizations through developing a theoretically grounded maturity model. In a case study, the maturity model of technology adoption was implemented in an European educational organization. The study included N = 222 employees in two waves of data collection. Findings indicate a positive attitude towards IT and digital media within the respective organization. Overall, the educational organization was classified as digitally pragmatist. It is suggested that maturity model development should be highly transparent, following a clear methodology. Model evaluation and validation should be carried out before transfer and generalization can take place. Factors mediating digital maturity and organizational performance on individual (i.e., motives, attitudes) and on organizational level (i.e., organizational culture) should be taken into consideration. For successful technology adoption processes, organizational and human resource development ought to go hand in hand, supported by a sound communication strategy.

AB  - Community, media and government concerns have emerged about promoting sports betting during televised sports broadcasts, which now contain betting operators' logos, signage, websites, commentary and betting odds. Despite large television audiences being exposed, limited research has examined how these promotions shape gambling behaviour, particularly amongst problem gamblers. Underpinned by the Theory of Reasoned Action, this study explored whether exposure and attitude to gambling promotions during televised sport predict sports betting intention and whether this relationship varies with problem gambling severity. Surveys were conducted with 1,000 adults in Queensland, Australia. Strongest predictors of greater intended frequency of sports betting were higher problem gambling severity, previous sports betting participation, more frequent exposure to the promotions, and more positive attitudes towards them. Results suggest that the audience most likely to be stimulated by these promotions are problem gamblers because they have greatest exposure and a favourable disposition to them, and report they have maintained or worsened their problem sports betting behaviours. Policy and public health interventions may be needed to counter these pervasive media messages.

AB  - To determine the relevance of consumers' self-construal in social media contexts, this study investigates its effects on social media success metrics, such as sharing behaviour, as well as its influence on the relationship between social media success and other drivers, such as endorsers' emotion displays or the communication source (user vs. company). Along with an in-depth review of consumers' self-construal, this article reports on two quantitative panel studies, which reveal that eight items are best suited to represent consumers' self-construal, using correlated dimensions of interdependent and independent self-construal. The main study affirms the relevance of consumers' self-construal and offers detailed insights. Consumers with a strong interdependent self-construal express more positive attitudes toward social media posts, and a smiling endorser positively influences attitudes toward the post, sharing behaviour, word of mouth, and purchase intention. In combination, a strong interdependent self-construal and smiling endorser produce even stronger effects for attitudes toward the post, purchase intention, and word of mouth. User-generated content outperforms company-generated content, independent of self-construal types. These findings have important implications for social media communication management and personality research.

AB  - Integrating mobile technology in schools has become a growing trend in recent years. Studies suggest that the use of tablets has potential contributions for learning. The current study explored the use of tablets for learning among 427 high school students, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative methods. The purpose was to assess students' perceptions toward the effectiveness of using tablets in learning and to examine a model in which perceived engagement mediates the effects of content usage types, and technological and social aspects on perceived learning. The findings indicate that overall, students reported moderate levels of positive attitudes toward tablet use in learning. In addition, it was found that the more students consumed information via tablets, perceived tablet software as easy to use, and communicated with other students through tablets, the higher their engagement was, which in turn led to more positive perceptions of learning. Moreover, a qualitative content analysis indicated that students perceived the technological aspects as the main advantage, and barrier, of using tablets for learning. The implications of the results, as well as the role of perceived engagement in enhancing learning outcomes, are discussed in the context of tablet use in learning.

AB  - Recently, second language (L2) instruction has benefitted from the development of instructional technology such as synchronous computer-mediated communication (SCMC). The present study was conducted to investigate learner perception of the effectiveness of SCMC interactions for L2 learning and building intercultural competence. Students (n = 55) from three different universities in Korea, Japan, and Taiwan participated in a joint online class for one semester. The purpose of the class was to facilitate students' development of linguistic and intercultural competence by interacting with peers from different cultures online. This study set out to examine the relation between learner perception and interactional features during group discussions. A range of data collection instruments were employed, including a questionnaire to track change in learner perception over time, interviews, and transcripts of interactions during each chat session. Results from linear mixed effect models suggest that among various interactional features, the following two variables were found to be significant predictors of positive attitudes towards SCMC: the amount of students' attention to language and cultural issues during online discussion. Findings are discussed in light of developing effective SCMC-based language courses.

AB  - Purpose This research aims to develop and test a model of digital health communication media (DHCM) use for healthy food information - DHCM usage - during the Covid-19 pandemic. More specifically, this research investigated the simultaneous effects of perceived threat of Covid-19, e-health literacy, attitude toward DHCM usage, knowledge toward DHCM usage, facilitating conditions and information quality on the DHCM usage. Design/methodology/approach The empirical data were collected through a survey. The respondents of the survey are 192 DHCM users who lived in Tangerang Regency. Structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis was performed. Findings The DHCM usage during the Covid-19 pandemic is significantly affected by the attitude towards the DHCM usage and the facilitating conditions. However, the DHCM usage during the Covid-19 pandemic is not significantly affected by the perceived threat of Covid-19, e-health literacy, information quality and knowledge of the DHCM usage. Research limitations/implications This research was conducted only in Tangerang Regency and employed a purposive sampling technique. Future research should be conducted in other contexts to examine the stability of the research findings. Practical implications In order to improve DHCM usage for healthy food information, it is important for building a positive attitude towards DHCM usage and ensuring the availability of the facilitating conditions. Originality/value This paper is the first that develops and tests a model of DHCM usage for healthy food information during the Covid-19 pandemic.

AB  - This paper examines how marginalized youth in Morocco use YouTube to contest hegemonic discourses of state power and institutional practices of social exclusion. The paper analyses a user-generated, YouTube web-series, Tales of Bouzebal, as a performance of marginality and a social critique of state bureaucracies and institutions in the context of post-Arab Spring Morocco. Using a combined method of textual and discourse analyses, the paper argues that the new media practices of producing and consuming user-generated video are best understood as practices of cultural citizenship that contribute to social change through the production of counter-discursive political subjectivities among youth in MENA. The paper posits that the concept of citizenship needs to be expanded to account for citizen participatory media practices that contest the conditions of marginality and inequality sustained by normative definitions of citizenship.

AB  - In light of the prolonged period of social distancing and highly mediated communication patterns during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study sought to understand how pandemic-related fear affects social connectedness. Drawing from the Internet-enhanced self-disclosure and fear-eliciting affiliation hypotheses, survey findings from a stratified sample collected among Hong Kong university students (N = 310) revealed that pandemic-related fear positively influences social connectedness not only through self-disclosure but also through the combination of information seeking and self-disclosure. Social interaction, however, does not mediate the relationship between fear and social connectedness on its own. Overall, we argue that fear motivated people to seek information, self-disclose, and articulate connectedness with society. During this process, social media provided an essential ground and self-disclosure proved a viable tool. This study demonstrated that negative emotions aroused in crisis situations might result in constructive behaviors, which is contingent on how people react to mitigate the negative consequences.

AB  - The current loss of biodiversity has found its way into the media. Especially the loss of bees as pollinators has recently received much attention aiming to increase public awareness about the consequence of pollinator loss and strategies for protection. However, pollinating insects like bees often prompt considerable anxiety. Negative emotions such as fear and disgust often lead to lack of support for conservation and appropriate initiatives for protection. Our study monitored perceptions of bees in the contexts of conservation and danger bees possibly represent by applying a semantic differential using contrasting adjectives under the heading "I think bees are... ". Additionally, open questions were applied to examine individual perceptions of danger and conservation of bees. Respondents were students from primary school, secondary school and university. We compared these novices (n = 499) to experts (beekeepers, n = 153). An exploratory factor analysis of the semantic differential responses yielded three major oblique factors: Interest, Danger and Conservation & Usefulness. The inter-correlations of these factors were significant. Although all subgroups showed an overall high willingness to protect bees, the perception of danger scored medium. The individual experience of bee stings was the most prevalent reason for expressing fear. Educational programs focusing on pollinator conservation may reduce the perceived danger through removing misinformation, and supporting interest in the species. Based on the overall positive attitude toward bees, we suggest introducing bees (e.g., Apis mellifera) as a flagship species for pollinator conservation.

AB  - Nature conservation has a higher probability of being successful when it is backed by public support. This is influenced by knowledge and values, many of which may derive from school curricula, experiments and activities. We implemented a study in a Portuguese Junior High School aiming to evaluate: (1) which factors influence how people subscribe reasons for conserving nature; (2) the criteria used to identify conservation priority species; and, (3) the proposed recovery measures for priority species. A survey of 91 students in a suburban area revealed that nature conservation was regarded as being more important than tourism or industry, but less than values related to public health. Students who have close contacts with wildlife and whose parents have higher education levels exhibited positive attitudes towards nature conservation, which seems to derive from exposure to information related to nature, in their home environment. The criteria chosen to identify conservation priority species and to select appropriate conservation measures indicate that they are likely to be influenced by the media. These results emphasise that the relationship between parental education levels and access to information is an important factor in shaping urban students' attitudes towards nature conservation.

AB  - This article aims to understand the attitudes, mediating and monitoring behaviors of parents related to the digital games played by their children. For this qualitative research, 30 parents answered 14 open-ended questions. Data analyzed descriptively. The data were analyzed with respect to the research questions and the analysis showed that the findings could be grouped into three themes: attitudes, monitoring, and mediating. The findings of the study demonstrated that parents thought that educational games developed their children mentally, developed their critical thinking skills, enabled them to follow up on how to benefit of those games, and developed their imagination. The research findings revealed that parents limited the time that their children spent with digital games; tried to be careful with regard to their children's choices of digital games; and had positive attitudes toward educational games, but not others. The results implicated that parents need to raise their digital parenting approach. It should be noted that digital parenting does not mean parents to play more digital games. Instead of that it provides them to teach their children the risks and gains that may face in digital games.

AB  - Many people are fascinated by celebrities and like to follow them and leave positive comments online about the luxurious lives they lead. There are doubts and concerns, however, about whether celebrity posts regarding personal experiences and advice generate positive responses when their audience is in a situation of chronic stress, such as during a pandemic. On the basis of a field study of real celebrity COV1D-19 Instagram posts, this study tested a model for exploring the rote of both contextual (i.e., references to luxury in celebrity posts) and individual (i.e., upward social comparison orientation [SCO] and attitudes toward the celebrity) factors in explaining how audiences respond emotionally and behaviorally (i.e., commenting) to celebrity posts during a stressful period. The results indicated that the audience's emotional and behavioral responses were more negative toward posts with more cues of luxury. SCO seems to moderate these effects, indicating that upward SCO based on these cues can motivate and support to a certain level, but switches to negative effects once the focus on luxury becomes too strong. The results regarding attitudes toward the celebrities behind the messages confirmed the powerful role of this variable during chronic stress, establishing a link between more positive attitudes and more positive emotional responses (amusement and inspiration). These results offer some first exploratory insights into the role of celebrity representations during a global period of stress, which could lay the basis for future experimental research on this topic.

AB  - The current study investigates how public attitudes and perceptions about the COVID-19 pandemic evolve over time and influence self-reported health behaviors (e. g., social distancing). Specific attention was paid to respondents' exposure to different news media channels (public vs. commercial). We used data from a two-wave panel study with a 3-week interval (W1 at the start and W2 at the peak of the pandemic) and a large sample of the adult population in Flanders, Belgium (n = 870). The results of mixed ANOVAs indicate that besides a time-effect there was also a significant effect of the different types of news media exposure and respondents' support for protective health measures and behaviors. Whereas, perceived vulnerability to disease, feelings of loneliness, and solidarity were mostly determined by respondents' overall frequency of media exposure, support of governmental measures and self-reported health behaviors were mostly determined by the type of news media exposure. Respondents with a predominantly public/quality news media diet had the highest scores on these variables. A stepwise linear regression analysis with individual's change scores demonstrated that (self-)protective behavior was positively determined by respondents' age, solidarity, and the belief that the measures are necessary, but negatively determined by one's cumulative exposure to commercial/tabloid news media. This longitudinal study provides a new perspective on the role of news media in times of a public health crisis. It offers support for (A) the "double bind hypothesis" (i.e., while news media consumption encourages (self-)isolation, it fosters feelings of loneliness); and (B) the "dual effects hypothesis" (i.e., exposure to commercial/tabloid news media generates different outcomes than exposure to public/quality news media). Affective responses and socio-psychological perceptions are influenced by overall news media exposure, whereas support for the government and its handling of the crisis are mainly determined by one's selection of media channels, whereby audiences of public news media evaluate these outcomes more positively than the audiences of commercial news media channels.

AB  - Two survey studies, one with a college sample (Study 1, n = 245) and one with a national U.S. adult sample (Study 2, n = 590) examined how media messages can influence attitudes toward Black people in the U.S. A novel contribution is the role of Bounded Generalized Reciprocity, or the belief that members of an outgroup are likely to return a favor (positive), or enact retribution for a wrong (negative) as a factor in the relationship between television use and attitudes. Study 1 (college student sample) found support for a relationship between lifetime television exposure and negative attitudes, mediated by negative reciprocity beliefs. Study 2 (U.S. adult sample) found support for an ambivalence effect, where lifetime television exposure was associated with increases in both positive and negative reciprocity beliefs. This indicates that reciprocity beliefs can be cultivated similarly to other kinds of beliefs (e.g., crime frequency, mean world), and that these beliefs have downstream relationships with racial attitudes. The direction in which they are influenced by television use remains an open question, and likely depends on TV content patterns over time.

AB  - Background: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly important in modern dentistry, we aimed to assess patients' perspectives on AI in dentistry specifically for radiographic caries detection and the impact of AI-based diagnosis on patients' trust. Methods: Validated questionnaires with Likert-scale batteries (1: "strongly disagree" to 5: "strongly agree") were used to query participants' experiences with dental radiographs and their knowledge/attitudes towards AI as well as to assess how AI-based communication of a diagnosis impacted their trust, belief, and understanding. Analyses of variance and ordinal logistic regression (OLR) were used (p < 0.05). Results: Patients were convinced that "AI is useful" (mean Likert +/- standard deviation 4.2 +/- 0.8) and did not fear AI in general (2.2 +/- 1.0) nor in dentistry (1.6 +/- 0.8). Age, education, and employment status were significantly associated with patients' attitudes towards AI for dental diagnostics. When shown a radiograph with a caries lesion highlighted by an arrow, patients recognized the lesion significantly less often than when using AI-generated coloured overlays highlighting the lesion (p < 0.0005). AI-based communication did not significantly affect patients' trust in dentists' diagnosis (p = 0.44; OLR). Conclusions: Patients showed a positive attitude towards AI in dentistry. AI-supported diagnostics may assist communicating radiographic findings by increasing patients' ability to recognize caries lesions on dental radiographs.

AB  - COVID-19 has changed how universities operate. The changes are in all spheres and caused by demands of social distancing rules predominantly mediated by various digital technologies. Applying Bauman's (1993) ethics of technology on newly initiated assessment practices, this article raises ethical concerns of relying on solutions solely manufactured by technology companies without professors' and students' input, various considerations of privacy, and overall ethical concerns that the use of any new technology raises. The article concludes by beseeching all stakeholders to collaborate to construct the tools for tomorrow that meet pedagogical needs without compromising Bauman's ethical concerns.

AB  - Purpose Public relations practitioners worldwide are attempting to enhance the overall organization-stakeholder relationships by applying strategic communication techniques and skills to corporate social responsibility (CSR) management and communications. In this light, drawing on the prosocial motivation literature, this paper aims to investigate consumers' implicit and explicit motivations for prosocial behavior, and how these two motivations interact to affect consumers' willingness to contribute to CSR activities. Second, through the lens of sensemaking theory, this study evaluates the influence of successful prosocial behavior engagement on consumers' perceptions of both self and companies' prosocial identities, CSR authenticity and company evaluations. Design/methodology/approach This study adopts a dictator game experiment with 2 x 2 factorial design to gauge consumers' prosocial behavioral response toward companies' CSR communication with implicit and explicit motivations and to examine its effect on company evaluation. Findings In all, the results of this study suggest that implicit motivation, i.e. self-affirmation intervention, in CSR communication will cause consumers to donate more money to CSR programs; whereas explicit motivation does not exert an effect on consumers' prosocial behavior. In addition, such donation will trigger consumers' prosocial sensemaking process and lead to strong identification with the company, positive attitudes and behavioral intentions toward the company. Originality/value This study aims to build a consumer- and social cause-oriented CSR communication model, which maximizes the impact of CSR investments on consumer relationship building, business bottom line and social causes.

TI  - Community knowledge, attitude, and perceived stigma of leprosy amongst community members living in Dhanusha and Parsa districts of Southern Central Nepal
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA  - English
AB  - Background Though Nepal declared leprosy elimination in 2010, its burden is constantly rising in Terai communities for the past 2 years with 3000 new leprosy cases being diagnosed annually. Community's perception is important for prevention and control of leprosy and enhancing quality of life of leprosy patients. Poor knowledge, unfavorable attitude and stigma create a hindrance to leprosy control. The main objective of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitude and stigma of leprosy amongst the community members living in Dhanusha and Parsa districts of Southern Central Nepal.
   Methods A total of 423 individuals were interviewed using a structured questionnaire in Dhanusha and Parsa districts. Data was analyzed using both descriptive (frequency, percentage, median) and statistical inferences (Chi-square test, Kruskal Wallis H test, Mann Whitney U test, binary logistic regression) using SPSSvs20.
   Results All respondents had heard about leprosy. Source of information on leprosy was mainly found to be health workers/hospitals (33.1%). Only 62.6% reported bacteria being its cause followed by other myths such as bad blood/curse/heredity/bad deeds (36%). Only 43.8% responded that leprosy is transmitted by prolonged close contact with leprosy patients and 25.7% reported religious rituals as the treatment. Only 42.1% had good knowledge and 40.9% had favorable attitude. Good knowledge of leprosy was highly associated with favorable attitude towards leprosy (P<0.001). The outcome variables- knowledge, attitude and EMIC score were found to have highly significant association with age, sex, ethnicity, religion, education and occupation of the respondents (P<0.001). Having knowledge on leprosy transmission was positively associated with favorable attitude towards leprosy (P<0.001).
   Conclusions Strategizing the awareness programmes according to socio-demographic characteristics for enhancing the knowledge regarding leprosy cause, symptoms, transmission, prevention and treatment, can foster the positive community attitude towards leprosy affected persons. Enhancing positive attitude towards leprosy affected persons can reduce the community stigma, thus may increase their participation in the community. Positive attitude may further increase their early health seeking behaviour including their quality of life.
   Author summary Though Nepal declared leprosy to be no more a public health problem in 2010, its burden is constantly rising in Terai communities for the past 2 years with 3000 new leprosy cases being identified annually. With the fact that community's knowledge and perception is important for prevention and control of leprosy this study aimed at assessing the community knowledge, attitude and stigma of leprosy amongst the community members living in Dhanusha and Parsa districts of Southern Central Nepal. The study was conducted in the communities of Dhanusha and Parsa by interviewing 423 individuals using structured questionnaire. All study respondents had heard about leprosy with main source of information to be health workers/hospital. A good proportion had myths such as bad blood/curse/heredity/bad deeds as the cause of leprosy and reported religious rituals as its treatment. Although more than half had good knowledge, only 2/5(th) had favorable attitude. The attitude was found to be influenced by knowledge. Also, knowledge, attitude and stigma score were found to be influenced by age, sex, ethnicity, religion, education and occupation. Strategizing the awareness programmes according to socio-demographic characteristics for enhancing the knowledge regarding leprosy cause, symptoms, transmission, prevention and treatment, could change the attitude to make it more favorable and thereby would help in reducing leprosy burden and enhancing the quality of life of leprosy patients.

AB  - Over the last few years, online donations have dramatically increased, and digital devices have become new channels for raising donations, replacing traditional paper forms. To better understand the effectiveness of these new digital channels, we investigate whether different device types influence donation outcomes. Overall, the results of three experimental studies consistently show a negative effect of mobile devices on willingness to donate (WTD) and donation amounts. For charitable donations, donors on a mobile (vs. non-mobile) device display less positive moods, which then lowers their WTD, resulting in lower donation amounts, suggesting a negative serial-mediation effect. Moreover, the moderated serial-mediation analysis reveals that the negative serial-mediation effect becomes stronger in a socially-distant (vs. socially-close) situation; however, for non-charitable donations (political fundraising), the mediating role of moods is attenuated while WTD still mediates the device-type effect on donation amounts. This study is the first to introduce device type as a digital medium that influences online donation outcomes and offers novel findings that the adverse effects vary not only by donors' device type but also by social distance from their donation target. These findings help both business and non-profit organizations better understand online donors' device usage to improve their fundraising outcomes.

AB  - Emerging research demonstrates that structural social capital facilitates the resource acquisition of entrepreneurs residing in multiply deprived areas. However, their usage of relational and cognitive social capital that translates to accessible resources is not well understood. We contribute to knowledge and comprehensively examine effects of structural, relational and cognitive social capital taken together on the resource acquisition of entrepreneurs residing in multiply deprived areas. Results from a national survey of entrepreneurs residing in multiply deprived areas across England show that large networks, bonding ties, trust, reciprocity, obligations and expectations, and shared language and codes facilitate their resource acquisition. Also, we demonstrate that they are reluctant or unable to bridge social distance and adopt narrative storytelling. Furthermore, the results indicate that entrepreneurs residing in multiply deprived areas in the most deprived regions suffer from less resource acquisition.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of English proficiency (low vs. high) and material presentation mode (single channel vs. dual channel) on English listening comprehension, cognitive load and learning attitude in a ubiquitous learning environment. An experimental learning activity was implemented using PDA as a learning tool to facilitate learning. A quasi-experimental design was employed with university students participating in the experiment. The results revealed that (a) high English proficiency learners had significantly better English listening comprehension and lower intrinsic and extraneous load than low English proficiency learners; (b) both high and low English proficiency learners learning with dual channel had significantly better English listening comprehension and held more positive attitude toward the ubiquitous learning environment than learners learning with single channel; (c) for learners learning with single channel, low English proficiency learners had significantly higher extraneous load than high English proficiency learners; and (d) for low English proficiency learners, learners who learned with dual channel possessed significantly lower extraneous load than learners who learned with single channel. The suggestions for educators and instructional designers were also discussed in the present study. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study focuses on the investigation into the mineral water products industry and the impact of consumers' awareness of an ISO-certified product on perceived quality, brand image, brand attitude, brand preference, and purchase intention. The structural equation modelling method was applied to establish the research framework and verify the proposed hypotheses. The research found that consumers' awareness of an ISO-certified product has a positive influence on perceived quality but not on brand image; however, perceived quality has a positive influence on brand image. Further, brand image has a positive influence on brand attitude, brand attitude has a positive effect on brand preference, and brand preference has a positive effect on purchase intention. Therefore, consumers' perceptions of quality, brand image, brand preference, and brand attitude all function as mediator variables for ISO certification on purchase intention. The research established a straight cause-and-effect relationship model, and it was concluded that ISO certification was a key marketing factor that could enhance a product's perceived quality and further influence brand image as well as a consumer's positive attitude, brand preference, and purchase intention.

AB  - This research involved a descriptive study with the goal of examining the attitudes of 145 Turkish nursing students studying toward ageism and the factors affecting ageism views. A Student Description Form and the Ageism Attitude Scale (AAS) were the data collection instruments used in this study. Statistical evaluation of the data included percentage, median and Kruskal Wallis Test and Mann-Whitney U-test. The average age of student participants was 20.10 +/- 3.52; further 37.9% of these students were 1st year nursing students, 25.5% of were 2nd year, 11.7% were 3rd year, and 24.8% were 4th year students. Of the students in this study 63.4% had completed coursework in elderly health as part of undergraduate study. Average scores on the AAS students were 84.01 +/- 7.61 points. Most female students who completed classes related to elderly health, either lived with or planned to live with at least one elderly parent after starting a family or already experienced having an elderly relative in their home. These students tended to have positive attitudes toward aging. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The implementation of electronic health records (EHRs) is a major transformation in health care organizations. This study uses adaptive structuration theory to build and test an organizational change appropriation model. We tested this model in a health care organization that had recently implemented an EHR system. We find that social interaction with coworkers has a negative direct effect on employees' change attitudes, perceived change success, and perceived change communication quality. While these findings suggest that interacting with coworkers can actually increase negative perceptions of EHR implementation, the direction of these relationships is inverted when change appropriation is included in the model as a mediating variable. As health care workers adapt this particular technology system to meet their needs, they perceive the EHR implementation more positively and have more positive attitudes toward the change. Implications and future directions are also discussed.

AB  - The present study contributes to the study of self-control among adolescents by testing how self-control is affected by societal vulnerability and violent values and by investigating how (in) variant this relationship is for boys and girls. The Belgian International Self-Report Delinquency Study (ISRD-2) data were used to assess to what extent positive attitudes toward violence can be seen as mediators in the relationship between societal vulnerability and self-control. The findings suggest that violent values mediate the relationship between societal vulnerability and self-control. Despite results indicating higher self-control among females, when conducting the analyses separately by gender, we found that the relationship between societal vulnerability and self-control was very similar for boys and girls. It is concluded that societally vulnerable boys and girls are equally affected by the intermediate mechanism of violent values.

AB  - This study investigates university students' perceptions of using Facebook for English language learning (ELL) based on gender and ethnicities. A survey was used for data collection, in which all 622 participants reported to having at least one Facebook account which they frequently accessed multiple times a day. The findings show that the students possessed positive attitudes, motivation, and self-confidence in using Facebook to learn English language. They reported to have acquired new English words and sentence structures from their engagement with Facebook. In terms of gender and ethnicities, it is the female students, and the Indian respondents who illustrated highly positive perceptions of English language acquisition, motivation, attitudes, and self-confidence, when engaging with Facebook. The awareness of these differences and strengths between gender and among ethnicities, may assist the creation of more suitable learning strategies especially with the integration of Facebook and other social media.

AB  - We conducted two studies to examine the relationship between social anxiety (n = 134) and social anxiety disorder (SAD; n = 126), social exclusion, and empathic accuracy. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control or an exclusion condition and then observed four videos of targets discussing high school experiences in which they were socially excluded. Participants' ratings of targets' emotions while discussing those experiences were compared with targets' self-ratings. Results of both studies indicated that individuals with social anxiety and SAD displayed greater empathic accuracy than control subjects and that exclusion did not affect that relationship. State measures of participants' emotional and cognitive reactions to targets mediated the association between SAD and accuracy. When asked to provide advice to targets, SAD participants provided fewer responses overall and fewer suggestions that promoted relationship repair. Thus, they were less able to translate their empathic responses for social pain into prosocial action.

AB  - Social psychologists are increasingly interested in the temporal dimensions of social life and in identity continuity in particular. Focusing on ethnicity and national identity we discuss the implications of perceived group continuity and collective self-continuity, and their interplay, for group dynamics. Using the social identity perspective and theories of identity motivation, we show, first, that the need for collective self-continuity forms a unique motivational basis for group identification. Second, we demonstrate that people are more likely to derive a sense of collective self-continuity from groups that are seen as relatively stable and immutable over time (i.e., essentialist in-groups). Third, we find that existential threats to group identity strengthen a sense of collective self-continuity, which, in turn, increases in-group defence mechanisms in the form of negative attitudes towards immigrant out-groups and towards social developments that potentially undermine in-group continuity. Fourth, we discuss empirical findings that indicate that group-based nostalgia for the nation is an identity management strategy in response to in-group continuity threats and that nostalgia leads to immigrant out-group exclusion.

AB  - Background: Previous studies usually refer to a greater repertoire of sexual behav-iors and a higher level of erotophilia in men than in women. The main goal of this work is to relate sex, gender roles and sexual attitudes to sexual behavior. Method: 411 un-dergraduate students (218 women and 193 men) at theof University of Oviedo (Spain) completed the following instruments: the Bem Sex Roles Inventory to operationalize the variable gender, the Sexual Inventory which reflects sexual behaviors, and the Sexual Opinion Survey about sexual attitudes. Results: 27% of the sample was typified as an-drogynous. There are were no differences in attitudes, either by sex (p=.50) or by gen-der (p=.77). Sexual behaviors depended on the degree of erotophilia (p=.000). Conclusions: the results suggest that, although regarding sex, the fact that women's erotophilic attitudes have increased their erotophilic attitudes, although they refer to more conventional sexual behaviors than mens's attitudes. With regard to gender, a tendency towards androgyny is observed, androgynous women and men report positive attitudes towards sexuality. Gender could act as a mediator of sexual behavior through the attitudinal component.

AB  - Based on the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study 2007 study and a follow-up national survey, data for 3,901 Taiwanese grade 8 students were analyzed using structural equation modeling to confirm a social-relation-based affection-driven model (SRAM). SRAM hypothesized relationships among students' perceived social relationships in science class and affective and cognitive learning outcomes to be examined. Furthermore, the path coefficients of SRAM for high- and low-achieving subgroups were compared. Given the 2-stage stratified clustering design for sampling, jackknife replications were conducted to estimate the sampling errors for all coefficients in SRAM. Results suggested that both perceived teacher-student relationships (PTSR) and perceived peer relationships (PPR) exert significant positive effects on students' self-confidence in learning science (SCS) and on their positive attitude toward science (PATS). These affective learning outcomes (SCS and PATS) were found to play a significant role in mediating the perceived social relationships (PTSR and PPR) and science achievement. Further results regarding the differences in SRAM model fit between high- and low-achieving students are discussed, as are the educational and methodological implications of this study.

AB  - To explore the relationship between Internet use and social tolerance in Japan, I draw on the contact hypothesis, which argues of the positive effects of exposure to diverse others on intergroup tolerance. Logistic regression results of the 2003 Japanese General Social Survey data show that Internet use is positively associated with both attitudinal and behavioral tolerance toward foreigners: Internet users are more likely to support an increase in foreigners in their community and to befriend them. Critics of the contact hypothesis question its ability to parse out selection bias: i.e. tolerance leads to contact and not vice versa. That Internet use remains significant after controlling for both a propensity for tolerance and offline contact with a foreigner suggests a strong relationship between online activity and social tolerance. However, data limitations preclude the ability to determine the causal direction between Internet use and tolerance. Thus, these findings should be interpreted as suggestive rather than definitive.

AB  - In 1966, the government-sponsored Plan Organization commissioned the first Tehran Master Plan (TMP), setting the stage for the Iranian capital's extensive transformation and its spatial and social re-structuring. In the process, Abdolaziz Farmanfarmaian, an Iranian architect, collaborated with Victor Gruen Associates of the United States to implement lessons from Gruen's urban model, the 'Cellular Metropolis of Tomorrow', in a reorganization of the socio-spatial structure of Tehran. After a three-year study of the city's socio-economic and physical organization, the planners proposed decentralization of the congested old city centre and the development of new 'modern' centres of activity along a rapid transit line extending westward. This article engages with ongoing discourses on inclusive cities and reflects upon the segregating effects of boundary-edges to argue that the planners' emphasis on locating urban facilities in the centre of communities led them to ignore emerging dead edges between socially divided neighbourhoods, ultimately hindering social interactions. The allocation of these edges to urban infrastructure, highways, urban voids, and large green spaces isolated and insulated each community from the larger urban area. Through the analysis of the TMP's reports, this article reveals how the modernist planners mediated the creation of socio-physical boundaries, segmented the city, and increased social exclusivity.

AB  - Legal changes in the 1990s resulted in greater pluralism in African media, particularly FM radio. Theorists have long argued that media freedoms are necessary for democratic development, but effects on individual-level orientations and behaviors have not been fully explored. Specifically, there has been limited work on the effects of radio exposure on political participation in Africa, and individuals' self-selection of the media they consume complicates the measurement of causal effects. However, the fact that access to FM radio signals is largely exogenously determined provides a possible identification strategy. Here, data on station technicalities and local topography are used to predict FM propagation in Uganda soon after the implementation of media liberalization. Analyses of results from an Afrobarometer survey demonstrate that radio exposure is significantly associated with higher self-reported political participation. With regard to mechanisms, there is no evidence that exposure is associated with significantly greater efficacy, interest in politics, attitudinal extremism, or perceptions about distributional politics or violence, but those who listened to the radio with greater frequency were more knowledgeable about politics.

AB  - Research on the effectiveness of destination logos is sparse. The present study introduces the idea of physimorphic (nature resembling) logos and explores its effectiveness on the tourist vis a vis non-physimorphic or typographic logos. The study hypotheses are developed based on the theories of Cue Utilization, Processing Fluency and Cognitive styles. Three controlled experiments are conducted in sequence with a combined sample size of 514 respondents. Major findings indicate that a physimorphic logo may be more effective than a typographic logo in generating a positive attitude and visit intentions towards a destination, more so for an unfamiliar destination than a familiar one. The results also establish the mediating effect of processing fluency and moderating effect of cognitive styles. The study contributes to the body of tourism literature by introducing and exploring the concept of 'physimorphism'. The practical implications of the study encourage the use of physimorphic logos for destination branding.

AB  - This paper examines bilingual children's use of language inside and out of the minority language classroom. A total of 145 children between 8 and 11 years of age, attending 16 bilingual Welsh-English primary schools in North Wales, responded to questionnaires (supplemented by classroom observations) requesting information about their language backgrounds, their use of language at school (inside and out of the classroom) and in the wider community, their self-ratings about their linguistic competence in Welsh and in English and their attitudes towards Welsh and English and towards bilingualism per se. Whilst the results, in general, demonstrated a positive attitude towards bilingualism, there was a clear trend towards favouring the use of English outside the classroom. This pattern was mediated by language experiences and perceived language abilities within the individual. The implications of the findings for language policy and planning in education and in minority situations are discussed.

AB  - Road transportation constitutes a key sector in developed countries, as an essential catalyst for economic and social activities. Nevertheless, it is relevant to emphasize the negative impacts of this activity identified in Economics as negative externalities. At the European Union, road transportation is the main cause of the air pollution impact on the population. Thus, this study explores the factors that influence the willingness to pay (WTP) on behalf of the citizens to reduce air pollution generated by road transport. In doing so, we propose two fundamental theoretical frameworks to explain individual behavior towards the environment actions: the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and the Value-Belief-Norm (VBN) models. A questionnaire survey with 1,612 residents was used to collect data in 65 localities located in the Spanish Pyrenees and performing a statistical analysis with the resulting data relied on application of Structural Equation Models (SEM). Moreover, the survey results highlight the importance of psychological aspects as predictors of pro-environmental behaviors. Our empirical results provide a novel contribution about how governments and educational policies can enhance the positive attitude towards environmental actions, unifying the struggle in favor of environmental protection from early childhood.

Series fans completed an online survey. A stronger parasocial relationship to Monk was associated with lower OCD stereotypes and less desired social distance from people with OCD. Perceived influence of Monk on respondents' own and others' attitudes toward OCD was related to behavioral and psychological outcomes, including willingness to seek and disclose mental health treatment and perceived self-esteem benefits. Different patterns were observed based on experience with mental illness and with OCD specifically.

AB  - This article examines the role of empathy for outgroup helping, collective action and political activism among youth in Northern Ireland, a setting of protracted conflict. Integrating the Empathy-Attitudes-Action model with the Developmental Peacebuilding Model, a two-wave study was conducted to assess youth's behavioural intentions and actual behaviours toward refugees. Across two waves (N = 383, 52 % male, 48 % female; 14-16 years old), empathy at Time 1 predicted more positive attitudes toward ethnic minorities at Time 2, which in turn was positively related to four outcomes aiming to foster prosocial change for refugees: helping behaviour and realistic helping at the interpersonal level, collective action intentions at the structural level, and signing a petition aiming for cultural change. That is, outgroup attitudes mediated the link from empathy to three types of prosocial action toward refugees. The findings suggest that youth not only volunteer to help an individual outgroup member, but also support broader structural and cultural change that will benefit those they may never meet. Implications for recognising and supporting the constructive agency of youth toward disadvantaged groups in conflict settings are discussed.

AB  - Over the past 30 years, the economy of China has sustained rapid growth. However, the extensive development pattern severely deteriorates the ecological environment, which has been recognized as adverse effects on citizens' physical and mental health. Simultaneously, the political trust in China has been in decline after staying at a high level for a long time. In this paper, we state that, in addition to health issues, environmental pollution can also lead to important political consequences. Using statistics on the occurrence of environmental pollution disasters and a nationally representative survey database in China, we find that environmental pollution disasters can negatively affect citizens' trust of the government. This relationship persists after a series of endogenous tests and robustness checks. Path analysis indicates that this relationship can be partially mediated by the increase in citizens' environmental awareness. The cross-sectional analyses on individual characteristics demonstrate that the negative effect of environmental pollution disasters on political trust is less pronounced for female citizens and citizens who are communist party members. Finally, we report that the government's positive attitudes and activities in resolving environmental pollution problems can partially offset the negative effect of environmental pollution disasters on political trust.

This article provides an overview of early-stage reactions by individuals and organizations affiliated with Buddhism, Shinto, New Religions, and other religious traditions in Japan. It features interviews with Japanese clergy and lay followers who contended with social distancing and more dire consequences of COVID-19, and it contextualizes their responses within media coverage, sectarian sources, and historical research. As it highlights trends in religious reactions to the coronavirus, such as a divide between policies enacted by "new" and "traditional" groups, the article discusses reasons for contrasting responses and points to dilemmas that will face Japan's religious organizations after the pandemic subsides.(1)

AB  - Introduction: Recent Cochrane review has recommended sealants in preventing occlusal caries in children and adolescents but its use in clinical practice is still underutilized all over the world. Aim: The aim was to assess knowledge, opinion, values, and practice among dental practitioners in Bangalore city. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with a convenience sampling of 312 general dental practitioners (GDP) in Bangalore city. The data was collected using an anonymous, self-reporting 5-point Likert-scaled questionnaire by Martin et al., and analyzed using SPSS version 21 and ANOVA and t-test was utilized for analyzing the results P < 0.05 was regarded as significant. Results: Effectiveness of fissure sealants is supported by strong scientific evidence and also as a restorative material, 76% of the GDP agreed and 86.9% thought that it is difficult to justify the cost of sealants to parents. 62.2% valued that fissure sealants are used less than they should have been. Most of them had a positive attitude toward sealant application. Conclusion: Dental practitioners knowledge of pit and fissure sealant is high and attitude is also positive but when comes to practice it has been underutilized.

AB  - In this study, we present results from an extensive survey of US-based microbiologists (adults) to explore these scientists' perceptions and behaviors related to communicating their research. Specifically, we explored the frequency with which microbiologists engage in public communication, how they evaluate their public communication experiences, and the factors associated with their willingness to engage in face-to-face and online public communication in the future. Data from a multi-wave online survey suggest that microbiologists (N = 903) are somewhat frequent communicators who derive great value from their outreach efforts. The results further suggest that social and psychological drivers of future intentions to engage with the public are consistent with the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Specifically, microbiologists with more positive attitudes toward engagement were more willing to partake in direct and online communication activities. Similarly, microbiologists who believe they possess communication skills are more willing than their less efficacious colleagues to do either type of outreach. Our results also indicate that more-senior and more-active researchers are more willing to participate in direct and online engagement. Implications for communication training are discussed.

AB  - Background and objectives: Prior studies have shown that people display signs of increased social approach motivation and affiliative behaviour in response to social exclusion. This response is considered an adaptive strategy that serves to repair damage to social networks and increase access to mood-enhancing social rewards. However, heightened trait social anxiety (SA) has been linked to decreased approach motivation and responsiveness to social rewards. In the current preliminary experimental study, we tested whether trait SA inhibits the expected increase in social approach following the pain of exclusion. We then tested whether diminished social approach is associated with reduced positive affect.
   Methods: Participants played a game of Cyberball and were randomly assigned to receive significantly fewer passes (exclusion condition) or an equal number of passes (control condition) as other players. Subsequently, participants were given the opportunity to engage in an online social interaction activity with avatars they believed were other participants.
   Results: Analyses revealed that the exclusion condition led to greater social pain than the control condition. Across conditions, greater social pain was associated with higher levels of approach motivation in anticipation of the social interaction activity, but only for individuals with lower levels of trait SA. Finally, when controlling for levels of trait SA, social pain was associated with positive affect following the social interaction activity, but only for individuals with higher levels of approach motivation.
   Limitations: Participants consisted predominantly of female undergraduates, limiting generalizability of these data. As well, hypotheses were supported for the measure of approach motivation but not the measure of approach behaviour. Finally, this study was not powered to enable moderated mediation analyses, which would have provided the most direct test of the hypothesized model.
   Conclusions: Heightened approach motivation in the face of social pain may facilitate increased positive affect. However, higher levels of trait SA dampen approach motivation. Future well-powered studies should use moderated mediation analyses to test the hypothesized model more parsimoniously.

AB  - Digital contact tracing (DCT) has become an efficient method for authorities to curb COVID-19. However, the current public opinion studies on the adoption of DCT primarily focus on Western countries and rarely explore citizen attitudes in Asian contexts where DCT is often mandatory. Moreover, the existing literature extensively explores how privacy concern negates the adoption of DCT without illuminating the solutions to such barriers. To unveil the mechanisms of DCT adoption, this study explores how Singaporeans' privacy concern, political trust, and technology literacy can influence their attitudes toward TraceTogether (a local DCT program). An analysis of survey data suggests that privacy concern is positively associated with negative attitudes toward DCT. Those with high levels of political distrust also hold negative attitudes toward DCT. Political distrust is also found to positively mediate the relationship between privacy concerns and negative attitudes toward DCT. Finally, moderated mediation findings suggest that the indirect effects of privacy concern on negative attitudes toward DCT via political distrust increase with an increase in technological literacy. Simply put, the indirect effects are stronger for those with higher-tech literacy. We discuss the tension between privacy concerns and public health during the pandemic and propose policy suggestions.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the prosocial behavioural tendencies of Greek young adults and to examine the relationship between prosocial behavioural tendencies and individualism-collectivism. Four hundred and eighty four (N = 484) undergraduates completed the Prosocial Tendencies Measure and the Auckland's Individualism Collectivism Scale. Altruism and compliant were the most preferable prosocial types followed by dire and emotional, while public was the least preferable type. Females and social sciences students were found to hold more positive attitudes towards prosocial behaviour. Also, females were oriented towards collectivism, while males and science and technology students were oriented towards individualism. Correlation analyses indicated a constant positive relationship between altruism, emotional, compliant and anonymous types and collectivism, whereas individualism was positively correlated only with the public type. Multiple regression analysis revealed that gender, age, religiosity, field of studies and collectivism, but not individualism, are strongly related to the dependent variables indicating prosocial behavioural tendencies.

AB  - Previous research has shown that African Americans (AA) report higher pain intensity and pain interference than other racial/ethnic groups as well as greater levels of other risk factors related to worse pain outcomes, including PTSD symptoms, pain catastrophizing, and sleep disturbance. Within a Conservation of Resources theory framework, we tested the hypothesis that socioeconomic status (SES) factors (i.e., income, education, employment, perception of income meeting basic needs) largely account for these racial/ethnic differences. Participants were 435 women [AA, 59.1%; Hispanic/Latina (HL), 25.3%; Non-Hispanic/White (NHW), 15.6%] who presented to an Emergency Department (ED) with an acute pain-related complaint. Data were extracted from psychosocial questionnaires completed at the participants' baseline interview. Structural equation modeling was used to examine whether racial/ethnic differences in pain intensity and pain interference were mediated by PTSD symptoms, pain catastrophizing, sleep quality, and sleep duration, and whether these mediation pathways were, in turn, accounted for by SES factors. Results indicated that SES factors accounted for the mediation relationships linking AA race to pain intensity via PTSD symptoms and the mediation relationships linking AA race to pain interference via PTSD symptoms, pain catastrophizing, and sleep quality. Results suggested that observed racial/ethnic differences in AA women's pain intensity, pain interference, and common risk factors for elevated pain may be largely due to racial/ethnic differences in SES. These findings highlight the role of social inequality in persistent health disparities facing inner-city, AA women.

TI  - Short-Term Communication Effects or Longstanding Dispositions? The Public's Response to the Financial Crisis of 2008
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLITICS
LA  - English
KW  - DELIBERATION
AB  - Economic interests and party identification are two key, long-standing factors that shape people's attitudes on government policy. Recent research has increasingly focused on how short-term communication effects (e.g., issue framing, media priming) also influence public opinion. Rather than posit that political attitudes reflect one source of considerations more than another, we argue that the two interact in a significant and theoretically predictable manner. To explore this claim, we examine the American public's attitudes towards the government's response to the financial crisis of 2008. We designed three survey experiments conducted on a large national sample, in which we examine the influence of (1) group-serving biases, (2) goal framing, and (3) threshold sensitivity. We find that economic standing and partisanship moderate the impact of communication effects as a function of their content. Our results demonstrate how people's sensitivity to peripheral presentational features interacts with more fundamental dispositions in shaping attitudes on complex policy issues.

AB  - Political and public health leaders promoting COVID-19 vaccination should identify the most relevant criteria driving the vaccination decision. Social media is increasingly used as a source of vaccination data and as a powerful communication tool to increase vaccination. In December 2020, we performed a cross-sectional social media-based survey addressing personal sentiments toward COVID-19 vaccination in the USA. Our primary research objective is to identify socio-demographic characteristics and the reasons for the 1644 survey participants' attitudes regarding vaccination. We present clear evidence that, contrary to the prevailing public perceptions, young audiences using social media have mostly a positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination (81.5%). These younger individuals want to protect their families and their relatives (96.7%); they see vaccination as an act of civic responsibility (91.9%) and express strong confidence in their healthcare providers (87.7%). Another critical factor is the younger population's fear of personal COVID-19 infection (88.2%); moreover, the greater the number of children the participants have, the greater is their intent to get the COVID-19 vaccine. These results enable a practical public-messaging pathway to reinforce vaccination campaigns addressing the younger population.

AB  - Objectives: To favour the dissemination and the implementation of the WIXX multimedia communication campaign, the aim of this study was to examine practitioners' beliefs towards the integration of the WIXX campaign activities into daily practice.
   Study design: An exploratory qualitative study.
   Methods: Overall, 58 community-based practitioners completed an online questionnaire based on the theory of planned behaviour guidelines pertaining to perceived advantages/disadvantages and perceived barriers/facilitators to ward the campaign. A content analysis was performed by two independent coders to extract modal beliefs. Results were validated by a third coder.
   Results: Local partners had a positive attitude to ward the WIXX campaign, but significant barriers remained and needed to be addressed to ensure full implementation of this campaign (e.g. lack of time or resources, additional workload, complexity of the registration process and so forth). Beliefs were fragmented and diversified, indicating that they were highly context dependent.
   Conclusions: To conclude, some remaining challenges regarding the full implementation of the WIXX communication campaign were identified, suggesting that additional efforts might be needed to ensure the full adoption of the campaign by local practitioners.

AB  - Multimedia technologies offer powerful tools to increase capacity of health workers to deliver standardized, effective, and engaging antiretroviral medication adherence counseling. Masivukeni-is an innovative multimedia-based, computer-driven, lay counselor-delivered intervention designed to help people living with HIV in resource-limited settings achieve optimal adherence. This pilot study examined medication adherence and key psychosocial outcomes among 55 non-adherent South African HIV? patients, on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least 6 months, who were randomized to receive either Masivukeni or standard of care (SOC) counseling for ART non-adherence. At baseline, there were no significant differences between the SOC and Masivukeni groups on any outcome variables. At post-intervention (approximately 5-6 weeks after baseline), -clinic-based pill count adherence data available for 20 participants (10 per intervention arm) showed a 10 % improvement for-participants and a decrease of 8 % for SOC participants. Masivukeni participants reported significantly more positive attitudes towards disclosure and medication social support, less social rejection, and better clinic-patient relationships than did SOC participants. Masivukeni shows promise to promote optimal adherence and provides preliminary evidence that multimedia, computer-based technology can help lay counselors offer better adherence counseling than standard approaches.

AB  - Corporal punishment (CP) is associated with harmful outcomes to child development. Favorable attitudes toward CP are a major predictor of CP use. Thus, identifying and changing factors influencing such attitudes help to prevent CP. Although research has confirmed the effect of childhood experiences of CP on attitudes toward CP, few studies have examined mechanisms underpinning this association. To fill this gap, this study investigated the role of perceived efficacy of alternative discipline strategies in mediating the association between childhood experiences of CP and attitudes toward CP among low-income Black, Hispanic, and White parents. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with 230 parents (M-age = 31; Black = 62, Hispanic = 62; White = 106). Structural equation modeling results revealed that more positive childhood experiences of CP were associated with lower perceived efficacy of alternative discipline strategies. In turn, lower perceived efficacy of alternative discipline strategies was associated with more favorable attitudes toward CP. Mediation analysis performed by the bootstrapping methods confirmed the mediating effect of perceived efficacy of alternative discipline strategies. When race was considered, this mediation pathway was held for Hispanic and White parent groups. These results suggested that future research should pay more attention to the role of perceived efficacy of alternative discipline strategies. Additionally, public education campaigns should consider incorporating efficacy messages to effectively reduce positive attitudes toward CP among low-income parents.

AB  - As with environment and sustainable development, there has been a rapid rise in the worldwide consumption of organic foods over the last years, as well as the quickly growing potential of organic markets in China, and their direct influence on consumer health awareness and social opinion. This study provides insights into Chinese consumers' attitudes toward organic foods and evaluates purchase intention's impact as a mediator in the relationship between external and internal factors on purchase intention. This empirical study is based on an online questionnaire using a sample of 1421 Chinese consumers. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used as the main practical approach for data analysis, and six hypotheses were examined. The results show that a more positive attitude on the part of consumers toward organic foods will further reinforce their purchasing intentions, whereas, there was no significant impact of marketing price and communication on consumers' attitudes toward organic foods. Furthermore, the results show that intention was a full or a whole mediator among the three exogenous constructs of environment awareness, health consciousness, and subjective norms. Based on the findings, marketing communication strategies should concentrate on offering more value to consumers regarding the features of nutritional value. Long-term environment friendliness, health benefits, and social status symbols should be assumed to enhance consumers' purchase intention in the organic foods industry.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 forced the implementation of restrictive measures in Spain, such as lockdown, home confinement, social distancing, and isolation. It is necessary to study whether limited access to basic services and decreased family and social support could have deleterious effects on cognition, quality of life, and mental health in vulnerable older people.
   Objective: This study aims to explore the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia as the main outcome and the quality of life, perceived health status, and depression as secondary outcomes and to analyze the association of living alone and a change in living arrangements with those outcomes and other variables related with the use of technology and health services. Likewise, this study aims to analyze the association of high and low technophilia with those variables, to explore the access and use of health care and social support services, and, finally, to explore the informative-, cognitive-, entertainment-, and socialization-related uses of information and communications technologies (ICTs) during the COVID-19 outbreak.
   Methods: This cohort study was conducted in Malaga (Spain). In total, 151 participants with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, from the SMART4MD (n=75, 49.7%) and TV-AssistDem (n=76, 50.3%) randomized clinical trials, were interviewed by telephone between May 11 and June 26, 2020. All participants had undergone 1-3 assessments (in 6-month intervals) on cognition, quality of life, and mood prior to the COVID-19 breakout.
   Results: The outbreak did not significantly impact the cognition, quality of life, and mood of our study population when making comparisons with baseline assessments prior to the outbreak. Perceived stress was reported as moderate during the outbreak. After correction for multiple comparisons, living alone, a change in living arrangements, and technophilia were not associated with negative mental health outcomes. However, being alone was nominally associated with self-perceived fear and depression, and higher technophilia with better quality of life, less boredom, perceived stress and depression, and also less calmness. Overall, health care and social support service access and utilization were high. The most used ICTs during the COVID-19 outbreak were the television for informative, cognitive, and entertainment-related uses and the smartphone for socialization.
   Conclusions: Our findings show that the first months of the outbreak did not significantly impact the cognition, quality of life, perceived health status, and depression of our study population when making comparisons with baseline assessments prior to the outbreak. Living alone and low technophilia require further research to establish whether they are risk factors of mental health problems during lockdowns in vulnerable populations. Moreover, although ICTs have proven to be useful for informative-, cognitive-, entertainment-, and socialization-related uses during the pandemic, more evidence is needed to support these interventions.

AB  - Learning languages independently can be more accessible in today's online environment. Polyglots, who are speakers of more than three languages, take advantage of this online learning environment to learn even more languages in Indonesia. Using transcendental phenomenology, the researchers interviewed these adult learners on their lived experience with online platforms for learning languages not traditionally spoken or used in daily life in Indonesia. Researchers found that the polyglots reported learning many foreign languages through interactive resources, receptive resources, social media, and authentic resources. Importantly, they held positive attitudes towards online learning platforms and their experiences left them with feelings of helpfulness, enjoyability, even bravery. In many cases, these polyglots often used freely available online resources to learn their foreign languages successfully. Implications include the idea that their language learner experience coupled with online opportunities can lead to successful language learning experiences.

AB  - Achieving the goal of carbon neutrality and carbon peak as scheduled puts forward new demands for the green transition of low-carbon lifestyle in Chinese society. In-depth practice of green consumption (GC) behavior can effectively promote the supply-side and consumption-side emission reduction work, but the phenomenon of "high awareness, low practice" is widespread in GC. The causes of consumers' low practice of GC need to be analyzed from the perspective of time and space from the actual media data. Furthermore, this process assists policymakers and stakeholders to understand the general attitude of the public towards GC, clarifying the propagation path of public emotions and the source of negative emotions. Based on the data from Sina Weibo, this paper applied text mining, a hybrid model of convolu-tional neural network and long and short-term memory neural network to analyze the public's attention, sentiment tendency and hot topics on GC. The results show that the vast majority of the Chinese public has a positive attitude toward GC; women and economically developed regions are more concerned about GC; the drivers of positive public sentiment toward GC include environmental awareness education, air pollution prevention and control, and online shopping; high green product prices, excessive time costs, chaotic sharing economy and one-size-fits-all solutions lead to negative public sentiment toward GC. By providing public sentiment analysis of GC, this research would assist decision-makers to understand the dissemination mechanism of public will in social media and clarify targeted solutions, which is of great significance for policy formulation and improvement.(c) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - Background and Purpose: While there are many studies regarding the adoption of Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID), only a few of them deal with RFID subcutaneous microchip (RFID-SM) usage by individuals. After the first in vivo tests conducted on volunteers from 1998 to 2000, the use of RFID-SM in healthcare remains limited. This study examines the likelihood of adopting RFID-SM in healthcare from the end user's point of view.
   Design/Methodology/Approach: The aim of this paper is to develop and evaluate the model for analysing the acceptance of RFID-SM adoption. An extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for RFID-SM adoption is proposed and empirically tested in a cross-sectional study. Online survey was conducted using a convenience sample of 531 respondents. In addition to the three original components of TAM (Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, and Behavioural Intentions to Use), three external variables (Health Concerns, Perceived Trust, and Age) were also included in the model. The model was validated with confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling techniques.
   Results: Perceived Usefulness has a significant impact on behavioural intentions to adopt RFID-SM in the future, while the influence of Perceived Ease of Use is not significant. The most influential external variable is Perceived Trust, indicating the lack of confidence in personal data security ensured by the state and other institutions. As expected, Health Concerns factor has a negative effect on the Perceived Trust and Perceived Usefulness of RFID-SM.
   Conclusion: The results of the empirical study prove that all external variables considered in the model significantly influence the RFID-SM adoption. The Perceived Ease of Use is irrelevant to the attitude towards the RFID-SM adoption. In addition to the proposed model, the analysis of gathered data shows that the positive attitude toward the use of RFID-SM in healthcare is rising.

AB  - The present study monitored changes in beliefs about the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, depressive symptoms, and preventive motives between the first and second waves in South Korea using an online survey administered to 1,144 individuals nationally representative for age, gender, and areas of residence. While participants correctly updated their beliefs about the worsening pandemic situations, the perceived importance of social distancing did not change, and their motives to follow prevention measures shifted toward compulsory rather than voluntary motives. This inconsistency appeared to be mediated by depressive symptoms, such that negative belief changes followed by increased depressive symptoms were associated with the decreased perceived importance of social distancing and decreased voluntary motives. Our data highlights the importance of psychological responses to the dynamically evolving pandemic situations in promoting preventive behaviors.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to understand student interaction and learning supported by a collaboratively social annotation tool - Diigo. The researcher examined through a case study how students participated and interacted when learning an online text with the social annotation tool - Diigo, and how they perceived their experience. The findings suggested that students participated actively in the collaborative learning activity and were engaged in a variety of behaviors including self-reflection, elaboration, internalization, and showing support. Although students generally had a moderately positive attitude toward using the social annotation tool for collaborative learning, a few problems were identified. In particular, students found it distracting to navigate through a large amount of annotation while reading the text. The study has implications for future research on using or developing social annotation tools for educational purposes. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This article is an investigation of the use of English-language swear words by Swedish, non-native speaker PewDiePie in the context of self-recorded, Let's Play horror videos uploaded to the video sharing website, YouTube. Situating PewDiePie within the greater media landscape to establish both his success and notoriety, this article addresses the local interpretation of the globalization of English and the use of English swear words in Swedish media. The practice of swearing in the gaming context is discussed, and swearing instances in a selection of three of PewDiePie's horror game videos are analyzed. The article puts forth the argument that the use of English swear words contributes to the performance of PewDiePie as a specific, online persona, one that is both in line with the context of video gaming and conducive to a para-social relationship, allowing PewDiePie to achieve the overall goals of communicating with his viewers as peers and reducing the social distance between them. The article concludes that PewDiePie's practice of social swearing not only simulates casual conversation between friends, but actively reduces social distance, creates the illusion of intimacy, and contributes to his unprecedented success on YouTube.

AB  - Objectives Cervical cancer is 99.8% preventable when detected early; however, uptake of screening in the United Kingdom is at a 20-year low. Recently, a number of social media influencers have video logged about their experiences of cervical screening through narrative communication with their audience. Here we aimed to explore if accessing cervical screening information from a social media influencer can impact the theory of planned behaviour variables and predict intention to attend cervical screening appointments. Design Utilising a cross-sectional design a volunteer sample of 102 UK women (mean age = 28; SD = 3.10; range = 25-35) took part in an online questionnaire study. Results Hierarchical regression modelling revealed attitude as a significant predictor of intention to attend a cervical screening appointment and that social media influencers affect attitudes of their audience, indirectly influencing intention to attend. Conclusion Health messages communicated by social media influencers are effective in promoting positive attitudes but not directly influence intention to attend towards cervical screening. Further research should explore influencer impact on attitudes towards this health behaviour with the ultimate aim of increasing attendance and consequently saving lives.

AB  - Body image dissatisfaction has been associated with harmful effects on the psychological well-being of women in western societies. Religion has been suggested to be a protective factor against body image dissatisfaction, though its precise mechanisms are not fully understood. Thus, the present study investigated the relationship between religious denominations and body image, both positive and negative. Further, it examined strength of religious faith, media exposure, and modesty, as possible mediating factors underlying this relationship. Participants were 483 Jewish women belonging to ultra-Orthodox, modern-Orthodox, or to a secular population. All factors were measured by self-report questionnaires. Findings revealed that compared to secular Jewish women, ultra-Orthodox Jewish women maintain more positive attitudes regarding their bodies, and suffer less from body image dissatisfaction. Importantly, positive and negative body image had unique effects: Positive body image differed between the Ultra-Orthodox group and the other two groups, and this relationship was fully mediated both by media exposure and by strength of religious faith. For negative body image, secular women differed from the two other groups, and this relationship was fully mediated only by media exposure. These findings are discussed in light of sociocultural influences, and related clinical implications.

AB  - IntroductionIn Sweden, often seen as one of the most egalitarian countries, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed high levels of health inequality, especially harming people with a refugee background. This is also despite Sweden's image as a refugee-friendly country. In this context, the aim of this paper is to better understand how Swedish health- and social workers have reacted to the health- and social needs of refugees during the pandemic. The Swedish case is particularly interesting because, as seen in the paper, health- and social workers had the task of communicating health guidance to refugees who were sometimes more reliant on information from abroad where the consensus on COVID-19 restrictions ran contrary to the approach recommended by the Swedish public health authority. MethodThe study utilizes a qualitative content analysis of 13 in-depth interviews with health- and social workers in Sweden, active in the care of refugees within different kinds of health- and social care settings. ResultsThe analysis showed that healthcare services have remained open during the pandemic but with new precautions at reception areas impacting how refugees access healthcare. As discussed in the article, the shift to digital tools has particularly impacted refugees, worsening already existing barriers to healthcare services faced by those with refugee status. Public health recommendations were poorly designed to the needs of refugees whose living conditions often prevented them from self-isolation and social distancing. Furthermore, Sweden's initially non-restrictive approach to the pandemic instructed health- and social-workers to encourage refugees to take far fewer precautions (e.g., self-isolation, home-schooling, pregnant women to avoid virus hotspots) compared both with European neighbors and the international media typically used by refugees. When Sweden shifted toward a more restrictive approach, health- and social-workers had to revise their guidance in relation to the new recommendations around precautions. ConclusionRefugees have faced increased barriers to maintaining their health and wellbeing during the pandemic that exceed those experienced by the rest of the Swedish population. Refugees have, in general, taken precautions in regard to social distancing and followed recommendations but faced challenges with social distancing due to isolation and crowded living. Public health authorities have often failed to acknowledge that individuals use increasingly diverse sources of knowledge when trying to protect their health, and that not everyone has access to the knowledge needed to access healthcare and social systems. At the same time, there is a need to acknowledge that refugees are sometimes a source of expertise that was ignored by the Swedish health and social system during the pandemic. There is a need for urgent efforts to halt the worsening health conditions for this specific group, but also to counter knock-on societal effects and rising health inequity.

AB  - This paper investigates whether and how individual shocks of temporary employment translate into feelings of political alienation. Recently, research started to investigate cross-sectional associations between temporary employment, political attitudes and behavior. Yet, the cross-sectional research so far struggles to disentangle empirically whether the relationship between temporary work and political orientations is determined by structural factors only - such as skill-set and education - or whetherwe are also able to observe the dynamic patterns suggested in theoretical arguments. This paper takes up the task of tracing the dynamic relationship between temporary employment experiences and adjustments in political orientations. It is argued that temporary employment has ambiguous effects on political orientations and that we are in need for convincing strategies to tackle this heterogeneity. Using perceived risk measures as mediators, we propose a strategy to capture the dynamic effects of temporary employment. Fixed-effects regressions show that if temporary employment experiences are translated by increases in perceived job insecurity and perceived financial insecurity, trust in politics starts to erode. The identification of such dynamic patterns is highly relevant for research on the political effects of labor market disadvantages.

AB  - Answering calls for deeper consideration of the relationship between moral panics and emergent media systems, this exploratory article assesses the effects of social media - web-based venues that enable and encourage the production and exchange of user-generated content. Contra claims of their empowering and deflationary consequences, it finds that, on balance, recent technological transformations unleash and intensify collective alarm. Whether generating fear about social change, sharpening social distance, or offering new opportunities for vilifying outsiders, distorting communications, manipulating public opinion, and mobilizing embittered individuals, digital platforms and communications constitute significant targets, facilitators, and instruments of panic production. The conceptual implications of these findings are considered.

AB  - National identity is the cognition of citizens regarding to which political community they belong, and the tendency to accept the political, cultural and ethnic values of the state. Previous studies have found that national identity is heterogeneous at the subnational levels. Why do people hold different degrees of nationalism and patriotism in the subnational units? In this paper, we offer a political economic explanation of national identity, which links the state capacity with political attitudes. We employ a nationalism-patriotism framework to decompose the concept of national identity, then use the supervised learning approach to measure nationalism and patriotism based on a massive number of Weibo posts dating from 2011 to 2017. Automated text analysis shows that the state capacity plays an important role preventing the national identity from being weakened by globalization and the diversity of social information. Specifically, with the progress of China's globalization, multiculturalism and various information have crossed the national boundaries, which undermines China's national identity. In order to maintain this identity, the Chinese government utilizes its redistribution capacity to reinforce both nationalism and patriotism, and also its information capacity to strengthen nationalism.

AB  - ObjectiveThe marriage equality debate is becoming increasingly prominent in Australian political and media discourse. Moreover, as policy that would legislate marriage equality continues to be debated in political circles, public opinion on the topic appears to be becoming increasingly divided. This article presents a cross-sectional study exploring predictors of support for marriage equality.
   MethodA sample of 137 Australians (66% females) responded to a series of demographic items, a measure of attitudes towards gay men and lesbian women, and a forced-choice question asking whether or not they would support marriage between two peopleregardless of their gender.
   ResultsThe results revealed that support for marriage equality in this sample was predicted by religious affiliation, political orientation, and sexual prejudice. More specifically, individuals in support of marriage equality were more likely to be non-religious, politically liberal, and have more positive attitudes towards gay men (attitudes towards lesbian women were unrelated to support for marriage equality). Age and gender did not predict support for marriage equality.
   ConclusionsSupport for marriage equality in Australia can be predicted by social attitudes and demographic variables. These findings are discussed in terms of the implications of maintaining the legal status quo, which mandates marriage inequality.

AB  - There is a substantial amount of literature that focuses on the governance of offshore fisheries in Europe and abroad, the history of fishing industries in different countries, and anthropological studies of fishing communities around the world. There is also a large amount of literature that explores the attitudes of fishermen towards fisheries governance and management. However, there is very little research that has explored the political attitudes of fishermen through the use of quantitative survey data. Using a survey carried out just ahead of the referendum on the UK's membership of the EU, this paper analyses data from a sample of Scottish skippers who work on vessels over 10 m in length. The paper focuses on how fishermen in Scotland vote at both UK and Scottish elections, how they voted in the Scottish independence and EU referendums, their political and social attitudes and their demographic breakdown. On the EU referendum, the paper finds that fishermen, as well intending to overwhelmingly voting to leave the EU, did so for instrumental reasons in the belief that this course of action would benefit them and their industry.

AB  - Politically aggressive militant groups usually rely on support from a larger community, although evidence suggests that only some members of that larger community support that aggression. A major subtype of political aggression is that associated with religious differences-or Religio-Political Aggression (RPA). Little previous research has explored demographic or psychological factors that might distinguish supporters from non-supporters of RPA. In an exploratory study, we investigated whether factors previously associated with aggression might correlate with support for RPA in the case of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. During the second intifada, fifty-two 14-year-old Palestinian boys in Gaza completed self-report measures of life events, emotional status, and political attitudes. Teenaged boys who reported family members having been wounded or killed by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) expressed greater support for RPA (t(50) = 2.30, P = .026). In addition, boys who felt their group was treated unjustly reported greater support for RPA compared with those who did not (t(50) = 2.273, P = .027). Implications of these preliminary data are discussed. Aggr. Behav. 36:219-231, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - This meta-analysis examined over 40 years of research on interracial interactions by exploring 4 types of outcomes: explicit attitudes toward interaction partners, participants' self-reports of their own emotional state, nonverbal or observed behavior, and objective measures of performance. Data were collected from 108 samples (N = 12,463) comparing dyadic interracial and same-race interactions, predominantly featuring Black and White Americans. Effect sizes were small: Participants in same-race dyads tended to express marginally more positive attitudes about their partners (r = .07), reported feeling less negative affect (r = .10), showed more friendly nonverbal behavior (r = .09), and scored higher on performance measures (r = .07) than those in interracial dyads. Effect sizes also showed substantial heterogeneity, and further analyses indicated that intersectional, contextual, and relational factors moderated these outcomes. For example, when members of a dyad were the same sex, differences between interracial and same-race dyads in negative affect were reduced. Structured interactions led to more egalitarian performance outcomes than did free-form interactions, but the effects of interaction structure on nonverbal behavior depended on participant gender. Furthermore, benefits of intergroup contact were apparent: Differences in emotional state across dyadic racial composition disappeared in longer term interactions, and racial minorities, who often have greater experience with intergroup contact, experienced less negative affect in interracial interactions than did majority group members. Finally, there was a significant historical trend toward more egalitarian outcomes across dyadic racial composition for explicit attitudes and for nonverbal behavior; however, participants' emotional responses and performance have remained consistent.

AB  - Little is known about how older adults use and perceive mobile technology after their initial adoption. This study investigated older adults' post-adoption usage behavior and user perceptions regarding advanced mobile technologies. It also examined the relationships among usage behavior, user perceptions, user characteristics, and technology features. Specifically, user characteristics of demographic factors and user capabilities were examined using self-report and performance measurements. Technology features, usage behavior, and user perceptions were investigated using semi-structured interviews. The results indicated that for post-adoption behavior, older adults were still in the early adoption stage. They generally demonstrated positive attitudes toward mobile technologies but also reported the complexity of technologies. User characteristics, such as age, and capability of processing speed and attention, significantly influenced older adults' post-adoption usage behavior. Decreased visual abilities were observed to be critical factors related to older adults' perceived usefulness and perceived efficiency of mobile technologies. Technology features also presented some noteworthy problems that influenced older adults' perceived usability, particularly regarding navigation problems and icon design. This study provides a detailed understanding of how older adults use and perceive mobile technologies in the post-adoption phase from the perspectives of user characteristics and technology features to encourage further adoption.

AB  - Objectives The objective of this study was to survey pregnant and lactating toward COVID-19 vaccination in Jordan and determine the predictors of this attitude Methods This study used a 10 min anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey to collect data. The survey was carried out between September and October 2021. Eligible study participants included all pregnant and lactating women in Jordan. The participants were recruited through social media, midwives, and gynecologists. Survey was used to collect data from the participants. Results The mean attitude of pregnant and lactating women toward COVID vaccination was moderate 71 (SD=100.5). Many factors were predicted the attitude of pregnant and lactating women toward COVID-19 vaccination. The factors were source of data regarding COVID-19 (B=-0.140, p=0.009), level of income (B=-0.141, p=0.009), and social status (B=0.130, p=0.034). These results mean lower income, people who frequently hearing news from news channel or ministry of health and married are showed more positive attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination for children. Conclusions This is a large national study regarding attitude of pregnant and lactating women toward COVID-19 vaccination in Jordan. This study found that more than 50% for the parents were hesitant to allow their children to receive COVID-19 vaccination. There were no differences between pregnant and lactating women toward COVID-19 vaccination.

AB  - While forensic psychiatry is of increasing importance in mental health care, limited available evidence shows that attitudes toward the discipline are contradictory and that knowledge about it seems to be limited in medical students. We aimed to shed light on this subject by analyzing medical students' central attitudes toward and their association with knowledge about forensic psychiatry as well as with socio-demographic and education specific predictor variables. We recruited N = 1345 medical students from 45 universities with a German language curriculum across four European countries (Germany, Switzerland, Austria and Hungary) by using an innovative approach, namely snowball sampling via Facebook. Students completed an online questionnaire, and data were analyzed descriptively and multivariably by linear mixed effects models and multinomial regression. The results showed overall neutral to positive attitudes toward forensic psychiatry, with indifferent attitudes toward the treatment of sex offenders, and forensic psychiatrists' expertise in the media. Whereas medical students knew about the term 'forensic psychiatry', they showed a lack of specific medico-legal knowledge. Multi variable models on predictor variables revealed statistically significant findings with, however, small estimates and variance explanation. Therefore, further research is required along with the development of a refined assessment instrument for medical students to explore both attitudes and knowledge in forensic psychiatry.

AB  - Existing methodological efforts subsume the interview into broad epistemological abstractions, neglecting actual mechanics of the interview as practice, and dismiss linguistic and cultural asymmetry in the interview as a matter of (in)adequate resources. Reflecting on 24 semi-structured interviews exploring social media use among Hong Kong youth, this article develops a culturally sensitive approach that democratically exposes the way cultural norms surface in communication, using strategies which (a) transform the dialogical mechanics of an interview reflecting back and encouraging; (b) transform the positionality of the researcher building intersubjectivity and emotional rapport; (c) transform the context of the interview making shifts in space, language, and presentation. In doing so, a culturally sensitive approach generates practical recommendations for (a) humanizing the researcher to dismantle power imbalances and social distances and (b) naturalizing the interview into a more conversational form, both of which combine to expose the cultural logics that govern action and interpretation whilst constructing results into intimate narratives of people's life-worlds.

AB  - General ethnocentrism seems to be a powerful antecedent of immigration opinion, typically displaying larger effects than economic concerns. News about immigration, however, may focus attention on a particular group in a given historical moment. We predict group-specific affect, not general ethnocentrism, should most powerfully shape immigration policy opinion in the contemporary United States. We test this expectation with content analyses of news coverage, survey data from 1992 to 2008, a survey experiment, and official statistics. First, we find that mentions of Latinos in news coverage of immigration outpace mentions of other groups beginning in 1994, the year when Proposition 187, a proposal in California to end most social welfare and educational assistance to illegal immigrants, garnered significant national attention. Second, while ethnocentrism dominates economic concerns in explanations of Whites' immigration policy opinions, attitudes toward Latinos in particular account for nearly all of the impact of ethnocentrism since 1994. Finally, journalistic attention to Latino immigration roughly parallels actual rates of immigration from Latin America, suggesting the media shaping of policy opinion around this group may be driven by real-world demographic patterns.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between knowledge sharing and sustainable happiness, and tested the multiple mediating effects of self-efficacy and helping behavior in this relationship. A survey was conducted in Taiwan to test the attitudes of preschool teachers toward sustainable happiness and several related factors. The questionnaire consisted of four latent factors: knowledge sharing, sustainable happiness, self-efficacy, and helping behavior. Partial least squares were used to analyze the sample data and examine both the reliability and validity of the latent factors of the questionnaire in the measurement model. Statistical analysis indicated that the measurement model was reliable, and multiple mediation analysis was performed for hypothesized relationships. The results of the multiple mediating analysis indicated that self-efficacy and helping behavior positively mediate the association between knowledge sharing and sustainable happiness. The sustainable happiness of preschool teachers is influenced by their perceptions of knowledge sharing about their career happiness and workplace well-being to achieve sustainable development goals. Their positive attitudes toward self-efficacy and helping behavior enhance their individual happiness and wellbeing and achieve a sustainable workplace, which contributes to global sustainability.

AB  - Background: Precursors of marijuana use in early adolescence are largely unknown because studies generally focus on marijuana use among older adolescents or adults.
   Methods: In this study, we examined precursors of marijuana use in a sample of 1023 Dutch early adolescents (aged 11-14 at Time 1) who were never-marijuana user at baseline, by applying a 3-wave longitudinal design. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) was used as a theoretical framework and posits that marijuana-specific cognitions (i.e., positive and negative expectancies, evaluative attitude, social approval, and self-efficacy) are antecedents of marijuana use and that this relationship is mediated by the intention to start using marijuana.
   Results: In accordance with these premises, our results indicated that evaluative attitude, social approval, and self-efficacy at Time 1 are related to marijuana use at Time 3 (20 months follow-up) via the intention to start using marijuana at Time 2 (8 months follow-up). More specifically, the structural equation models showed that more positive marijuana attitudes, more approval from the social environment, and lower self-efficacy were related to marijuana use initiation through a stronger intention to start using marijuana.
   Conclusion: This outcome is important for prevention efforts in that our results underline the importance of weakening adolescents' positive attitudes toward marijuana, decrease social approval of marijuana use, and stimulating the development of early adolescents' refusal skills with respect to marijuana use.

AB  - Humans favor and venerate their ingroups, while disregarding outgroups to the degree of dehumanizing them. We explore the social construction of such boundaries and its associated speciesism toward two nonhuman outgroups: animals and machines. For this, we analyzed UK newspaper coverages of the binaries Human-Animal and Human-Machine between 1995 and 2010. We quantified if and how tolerance toward ambiguous concepts that challenge and expand definitions of humanness (e.g., nonhuman primates, cyborgs) varied across time as well as with journalist gender, political leaning, and expertise. In this analysis, the ca. 1100 individual journalists stood as proxies for the British public and therefore as a human-ingroup subset. We found more tolerance toward intermediaries in broadsheet newspapers, females, and subject experts, as opposed to tabloids, males, and subject novices. Moreover, ambiguity tolerance hit a low during the year 2000, likely due to Western sociopolitical turbulence-potentially including wider societal stress over the landmark millennium year itself-attesting that ingroups become more closed during stressful times. Compared with the plasticity of the Human-Animal dichotomy, the Human-Machine binary was more rigid, indicating that the relative novelty of IT developments triggers increased caution and anxiety. Our research suggests that cognitive mechanisms facilitating human-ingroup protection are deep-rooted, albeit malleable according to changing socioeconomic conditions.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has posed a serious risk with pre-existing health conditions. This study was conducted to understand the knowledge, attitude, and practices concerning COVID-19 among patients with chronic illnesses in Bangladesh during the pandemic. The study was conducted in Khulna city of Bangladesh following a qualitative research design. We employed telephone interviews to collect data from 40 participants with four common pre-existing chronic illnesses (diabetes, hypertension, respiratory/asthma, and heart disease). Findings show that the majority of the participants had a moderate level of knowledge and an overall positive attitude regarding COVID-19 but appropriate safety practices were often ignored as the pandemic grows older. We also observed that the knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding COVID-19 varied based on age, marital status, education, social class, and rural/urban residence. We concluded that improving medical advice/support, promotion of awareness through mass media, strict monitoring of protective measures and subsidies from the government, and self-consciousness could be effective strategies to mitigate the transmission of the disease and reduce risks for patients with chronic illness in Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Evidences show increase of positive attitudes of Nigerian adolescents towards gambling in the past decade. Nigerian adolescents have been shown to spend significant part of their academic time and resources on Soccer bets. This behaviour could act as a predisposing factor for poor academic performances and problem gambling at adulthood. The present study drew from the cognitive distortion model to examine the mediational role of near-miss in the erroneous cognition-betting intention association through a survey study design. Male adolescents (N = 237; Mean age = 17.37 years; SD = 4.13) of public schools in Nigeria who engage in Soccer betting took part in the study. They completed self-report measures of erroneous cognition, near-miss and betting intention. Results revealed that interpretative bias was not associated with near-miss while it was positively associated with betting intention. Illusion of control was positively associated with near-miss and betting intention. Near-miss was positively associated with betting intention and mediated the associations between interpretative bias and betting intention (negative mediation) and illusion of control, and betting intention (positive mediation). The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.
