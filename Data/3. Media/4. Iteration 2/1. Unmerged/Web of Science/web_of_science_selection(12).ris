TI  - From grand tour to virtual tour: Italy through the stereoscope in 1900

KW  - ATTRACTION
AB  - In1903, Underwood&Underwood published Italy through the Stereoscope: Journeys in and about Italian cities, a multimodal set that provided an immersive travel experience by combining the use of a visual device (the stereoscope and stereoviews), localisationtools (the maps), anda written commentary on each view. The paper argues that this medium', which was introduced as a realistic and immersive visual reproduction of the world, was an innovative forerunner of modern virtual-reality technologies. The visual three-dimensional effect obtained by the stereoviews is just one of the characteristics meant to enhance the virtual' experience of the viewer. The author analyses the rhetorical means, strictly intertwined with the photographic representations, to reinforce the impression and emotion and to replace the physical experience of a tour with that of an armchairtraveller. The framing of the picture, the choice of the points of view, and the style of staging and posing the people reveal an international standard. In spite of their claim of realistic representation, this vision is not ideologically neutral, and the analysis of this set reveals the biases and prejudices towards not only strangers but also the old' technology of 2D photography. For social and economicreasons, the ancientpracticeof taking thegrandtourfaded, but the conspicuous consumption of this medium allowed the middle class to gain cultural capital with a 3D visual tour in order to claim refinement.

AB  - Recent media coverage has called attention to what some see as an unreasonable use of force by law enforcement officers against unarmed Black citizens. Many of these incidents have stirred widespread concern, as there has been a large public outcry indicating that the incidents appear to have racial undertones, which is particularly pronounced given the fatal consequences that are too frequent. This article focuses on how psychological research on racial bias can explain some of the cognitive and affective processes that could be influencing law enforcement officer behavior in at least some of these incidents. Further, we discuss how industrial-organizational (I-O) psychologists can use this research and leverage current practices within the field to develop solutions and effectively deal with individual racial biases among officers within the law enforcement community. We also discuss avenues of future research within I-O psychology and hope to spark a conversation within the I-O community about additional ways the field can address tensions that have arisen between law enforcement and different communities regarding perceptions of excessive use of force by officers.

AB  - Few studies have considered confrontation in the context of coping with discriminatory experiences. These studies test for the first time whether confronting racial discrimination is associated with greater psychological well-being and physical health through the promotion of autonomy. In two separate samples of racial minorities who had experienced racial discrimination, confrontation was associated with greater psychological well-being, and this relationship was mediated by autonomy promotion. These findings did not extend to physical health symptoms. These studies provide preliminary evidence that confrontation may aid in the process of regaining autonomy after experiencing discrimination and therefore promote well-being.

AB  - The current research examines how status-legitimizing beliefs (SLBs) influence White people's perceptions of anti-White bias, endorsement of zero-sum beliefs, and support for Affirmative Action. We suggest that SLBs perpetuate inequality by increasing White people's perceptions of zero-sum beliefs and anti-White bias, which in turn lead to decreased support for Affirmative Action. White individuals primed with SLBs perceived greater anti-White bias, endorsed greater zero-sum beliefs, and indicated less support for Affirmative Action than individuals primed with neutral content. Mediation analysis revealed that the SLB prime decreased support for Affirmative Action by increasing perceptions of anti-White bias. This research offers experimental evidence that SLBs contribute to White people's perceptions of anti-White bias and to decreased support for Affirmative Action.

AB  - Recent studies have suggested that the combination of the emotions anger-contempt-disgust (ANCODI) is associated with intergroup hostility. This study examined if incidental elicitation of this emotion combination causally produces hostile cognitions, language, and behaviors. Members of political groups were primed with either ANCODI, fear+sadness, or no emotion, and then engaged in creativity task in relation to their opponent or a non-opponent outgroup. The ANCODI mix produced more hostile cognitions, language, and implicit behaviors associated with hostility, in some cases specifically toward their opponent outgroups, than individuals primed with other emotions. Multiple mediation analyses indicated that the three emotions and their interactions mediated many of the effects.

AB  - Amazon leads the market in ebooks with the Kindle brand, which encompasses a range of dedicated e-reader devices and a large ebook store. Kindle users are able to share the experience of reading ebooks purchased from Amazon by selecting passages of text for upload to the Kindle Popular Highlights website. In this article, I propose that the Kindle Popular Highlights database contains evidence that readers are re-appropriating commonplacing - the act of selecting important passages from a text and recording them in a separate location for later re-use - while reading public domain titles on the Kindle. An analysis of keyness in a corpus of 34,044 shared highlights from public domain titles suggests that readers focus on words relating to philosophy and values to draw an understanding of contemporary society from these classic works. This form of highlighting takes precedence over understanding and sharing key narrative moments. An examination of the top ten most popular authors in the corpus, and case studies of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice and William Shakespeare's Hamlet, demonstrate variation in highlighting practice as readers are choosing to shorten famous commonplaces in order to change their context for an audience that extends beyond the original reader. Through this analysis, I propose that Kindle users' highlighting patterns are shaped by the behaviour of other readers and reflect a shared understanding of an audience beyond the initial highlighter.

AB  - The average weight of employees in the United States workforce is increasing. Importantly, relatively heavier employees are often subject to stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination based solely on their weight. These biases may be further influenced by factors such as employee gender and the specific nature of the job. Thus, we employ the stereotype content model (SCM) to examine the multiplicative effects of weight and gender and argue that perceptions of employee warmth are more salient than perceptions of employee competence in customer service contexts. In support of our hypotheses, we found that weight and gender interacted to influence warmth, such that heavy women were perceived to be higher in warmth relative to less heavy women (with no effect for men). Furthermore, perceptions of warmth predicted service satisfaction, whereas perceptions of competence did not. Finally, perceptions of warmth (but not competence) explained the relations between weight and gender and service satisfaction for female (but not male) customer service agents. We end with a discussion of the theoretical implications related to the SCM along with practical implications for service industry organizations and employees.

AB  - We examine the social-psychological and personality bases of support for radical right parties (RRPs), using cognitive-motivational approaches of ideology. Our comprehensive model includes core ideological variables which mediate personality traits (Big Five) or how individuals engage in social relationships and accommodate novel stimuli. Structural equation models were tested in an Austrian population sample to examine support for a RRP, the FPO. Our results suggest that a "perceived immigrant threat" and, in part, social dominance orientation are directly related to RAP support, whereas right-wing authoritarianism has consistent indirect (mediated) impact Associations with lower Openness to Experience, lower Agreeableness, and to some extent also with Conscientiousness are mediated by the ideological variables. The conclusion discusses how RRPs' success and communication strategies can be linked to basic psychological motivations. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Marchi examines how the French Nouvelle Droite (ND) was introduced into Portugal at the end of the Salazarist regime and during the transition to democracy. The relevance of the Portuguese case lies in the fact that the early diffusion of the ND in Europe coincided with the profound crisis of the radical right in Portugal as it faced the liberalization of the authoritarian regime and repression during the revolutionary transition. For that reason the far right in Portugal, in comparative terms, can be seen to have been subject to historical constraints quite different from those in Spain and other Western European democracies. Marchi describes the groups on the Portuguese radical right, and certain figures who were inspired by the ND and disseminated its ideas in Portugal. His analysis of their main publications, their statements and the media campaign to promote the ND from the end of the 1960s to the beginning of the 1980s highlights the different reasons for and ways in which Portuguese radicals engaged and dealt with the ND. Marchi also looks at the reactions of the national right-wing milieu to the spread of ND ideas. As part of his paper's contribution to comparative studies on the transnational radical right, it also provides new evidence, derived from the Portuguese case, of the way in which one of the most important schools of right-wing thought at the end of the twentieth century has influenced extreme-right milieux all over Europe. In light of Tamir Bar-On's analysis of the ND's cultural and pan-European impact, the findings presented here confirm its transnational character while drawing on this and other cases from southern Europe to question the French movement's long-term effectiveness in reorienting the culture of the right-wing milieu.

AB  - Ethnic-racial socialisation is broadly described as processes by which both minority and majority children and young people learn about and negotiate racial, ethnic and cultural diversity. This article extends the existing ethnic-racial socialisation literature in three significant ways: (1) it explores ways children make sense of their experiences of racial and ethnic diversity and racism; (2) it considers ways children identify racism and make distinctions between racism and racialisation; and (3) it examines teacher and parent ethnic-racial socialisation messages about race, ethnicity and racism with children. This research is based on classroom observations, semi-structured interviews and focus groups with teachers, parents and students aged 8-12years attending four Australian metropolitan primary schools. The findings reveal that both teachers and parents tended to discuss racism reactively rather than proactively. The extent to which racism was discussed in classroom settings depended on: teachers' personal and professional capability; awareness of racism and its perceived relevance based on student and community experiences; and whether they felt supported in the broader school and community context. For parents, key drivers for talking about racism were their children's experiences and racial issues reported in the media. For both parents and teachers, a key issue in these discussions was determining whether something constituted either racism or racialisation. Strategies on how ethnic-racial socialisation within the school system can be improved are discussed.

AB  - This pilot study tested the overall and relative efficacy of 3 common approaches to multicultural education in a sample (N = 52) of White undergraduate students using a randomized controlled trial. Brief multicultural education interventions were delivered in the form of educational, social norming, and entertainment conditions. Affective (i. e., White guilt) and cognitive (i. e., awareness of White privilege) outcomes of interventions were assessed. Possible causal relations between intervention condition, White guilt, and awareness of White privilege were also examined. Analyses revealed a main effect and large effect size for intervention condition. Results showed that education and entertainment conditions produced higher scores on a measure of White guilt compared with control and that the entertainment condition produced higher scores on awareness of White privilege compared with all other conditions. Mediation analyses revealed that observed changes in White guilt scores from pretest to posttest explained the relationship between intervention condition and awareness of White privilege. Findings did not support a causal ordering with changes in awareness of White privilege as a mediator of intervention condition and White guilt. Results suggest that brief multicultural education interventions are effective and that entertainment-oriented interventions may be particularly useful in terms of producing desired changes in White college students.

AB  - This article presents a dramaturgical view of the social integration of minorities. Based on 30 interviews with prominent Australian Muslim leaders, we argue that they explain and approach the problem of social integration largely in presentational terms. As a corollary, their chief collective and political strategy towards social integration is to put forward alternative discourses to counter the dominant anti-Islam discourses. We use Goffman's (1959, 1963) dramaturgical model to analyse their strategies. In a striking difference from dominant narratives that situate Islamic values and western values as incompatible, the analysis we provide shows that Muslim leaders do not see Islamic teachings or texts as a problem for social integration; rather they view the problem as negative media representations and the solution as putting forward alternative images.

AB  - In spite of its importance, religious individual level differences have not received sufficient attention in the creativity literature. This study investigates the relationship between religious fundamentalism and individual creativity. It also examines the mediating role of need for cognition in this relationship. A sample of 272 Egyptian undergraduate students completed a questionnaire measuring their religious fundamentalism and need for cognition levels. To measure creativity, participants were asked to name creative methods for using a brick and a paperclip. Hierarchical multiple regression, Sobel test, and structural equation modeling confirmed that religious fundamentalism is negatively related to creativity, and that need for cognition partially mediates this relationship.

AB  - This study was to investigate the effect of annexin A5 on testosterone secretion from primary rat Leydig cells and the underlying mechanisms. Isolated rat Leydig cells were treated with annexin A5. Testosterone production was detected by chemiluminescence assay. The protein and mRNA of Steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR), P450scc, 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD), 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 beta-HSD), and 17 alpha-hydroxylase were examined by Western blotting and semi-quantitative RT-PCR, respectively. Annexin A5 significantly stimulated testosterone secretion from rat Leydig cells in dose- and time-dependent manners and increased mRNA and protein expression of StAR, P450scc, 3 beta-HSD, and 17 beta-HSD but not 17a-hydroxylase. Annexin A5 knockdown by siRNA significantly decreased the level of testosterone and protein expression of P450scc, 3 beta-HSD, and 17 beta-HSD. The significant activation of ERK1/2 signaling was observed at 5, 10, and 30 min after annexin A5 treatment. After the pretreatment of Leydig cells with ERK inhibitor PD98059 (50 mu mol l(-1)) for 20 min, the effects of annexin A5 on promoting testosterone secretion and increasing the expression of P450scc, 3 beta-HSD, and 17 beta-HSD were completely abrogated (P < 0.05). Thus, ERK1/2 signaling is involved in the roles of annexin A5 in mediating testosterone production and the expression of P450scc, 3 beta-HSD, and 17 beta-HSD in Leydig cells.

AB  - Information about the degree of one's genetic overlap with ethnic outgroups has been emphasized in genocides, is frequently learned about through media reporting, and is increasingly being accessed via personal genetic testing services. However, the consequence of learning about whether your own ethnic group is either genetically related to or genetically distinct from a disliked ethnic group remains unknown. Across four experiments, using diverse samples, measures and contexts, we demonstrate that altering perceptions of genetic overlap between groups in conflictin this case Arabs and Jewsimpacts factors that are directly related to interethnic hostility (e.g., aggressive behaviors, support of conflict-related policies). Our findings indicate that learning about the genetic difference between oneself and an ethnic outgroup may contribute to the promotion of violence, whereas learning about the similarities may be a vital step toward fostering peace in some contexts. Possible interventions and implications are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate particular psychosocial predictors of obesity bias in prehealth professionals, which include the internalization of athletic and general body ideals, perceived media pressure and information, and achievement goal orientations. Exercise science undergraduate students (n = 242) filled out a survey containing questions of demographic characteristics, achievement goals, social-cultural attitudes toward appearance (using Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire-3), and obesity bias measurements (using the antifat attitudes test and fat phobia scale). The results indicated that students were explicitly biased toward overweight and obese individuals, held had high task and ego goals, and had high internalization of an athletic body type ideal, as determined by mean scores being above the median values for each scale. Internalization of the athletic body type predicted obesity bias for fat phobia, weight control blame, and physical/romantic attractiveness. In conclusion, exercise science students may enter programs socialized from society and sport, and, potentially, these psychosocial attitudes and beliefs may have implications to working with future clients, especially for those of the general population and those whose body shape and size are different than themselves.

AB  - In three studies, we examined the impact of multiple categorization on intergroup dehumanization. Study 1 showed that perceiving members of a rival university along multiple versus simple categorical dimensions enhanced the tendency to attribute human traits to this group. Study 2 showed that multiple versus simple categorization of immigrants increased the attribution of uniquely human emotions to them. This effect was explained by the sequential mediation of increased individuation of the outgroup and reduced outgroup threat. Study 3 replicated this sequential mediation model and introduced a novel way of measuring humanization in which participants generated attributes corresponding to the outgroup in a free response format. Participants generated more uniquely human traits in the multiple versus simple categorization conditions. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings and consider their role in informing and improving efforts to ameliorate contemporary forms of intergroup discrimination.

AB  - The present study extends previous research on the influence of social dominance orientation (SDO) in international affairs by investigating the role of sociocognitive processes such as social identity complexity (SIC) and intergroup dehumanization in explaining the relationship between SDO and support for Arabs' autonomy. An Italian heterogeneous sample (N = 123), in terms of gender, age, political orientation, religiosity, and income level, was considered. We expected that those low on SDO would be more likely to support Arabs' autonomy, would have higher SIC, and would be less likely to dehumanize Arabs. We also expected that SIC and dehumanization would sequentially mediate the relationship between SDO and support for Arabs' autonomy. Results revealed that Italians low on SDO have higher SIC (i.e., a more inclusive social identity) which endorses lower dehumanization of Arabs. This in turn explained the influence of SDO on support for Arabs' autonomy. These findings integrate the literature about SDO and SIC and enhance the understanding of the sociocognitive processes underlying people's support for international egalitarian movements.

AB  - We present the first experimental evidence to our knowledge that ingroup relations attenuate core disgust and that this helps explain the ability of groups to coact. In study 1, 45 student participants smelled a sweaty t-shirt bearing the logo of another university, with either their student identity (ingroup condition), their specific university identity (outgroup condition), or their personal identity (interpersonal condition) made salient. Self-reported disgust was lower in the ingroup condition than in the other conditions, and disgust mediated the relationship between condition and willingness to interact with target. In study 2, 90 student participants smelled a sweaty target t-shirt bearing either the logo of their own university, another university, or no logo, with either their student identity or their specific university identity made salient. Walking time to wash hands and pumps of soap indicated that disgust was lower where the relationship between participant and target was ingroup rather than outgroup or ambivalent (no logo).

AB  - Introduction: To improve detection of child abuse and neglect (CAN), many emergency departments use screening methods. Apart from diagnostic accuracy, possible harms of screening methods are important to consider, especially because most children are not abused and do not benefit from screening. We performed a systematic literature review to assess parents' opinions about CAN screening, in which we could only include 7 studies, all reporting that the large majority of participating parents favor screening. Recently, a complete physical examination (called "top-toe" inspection [TTI], a fully undressed inspection of the child) was implemented as a CAN screening method at the emergency department of a teaching hospital in The Netherlands. This study describes parents' opinions about the TTI.
   Methods: We used a questionnaire to assess parents' opinions about the TTI of their children when visiting the emergency department. During the study period, 1000 questionnaires were distributed by mail.
   Results: In total, 372 questionnaires were returned (37%). A TTI was performed for 194 children (52%). The overall attitude of parents whose children underwent a TTI was positive; 77.3% of the respondents found the TTI acceptable, and 1.5% (N = 3) found it unacceptable. Seventy percent of the respondents agreed with the theorem that all children who visit the emergency department should have a TTI performed, and 7.3% (N = 14) disagreed.
   Discussion: Contrary to what is commonly believed, both in our systematic literature review and in our questionnaire study, the majority of participating parents agree with screening for CAN in general and with the TTI specifically. Sharing the results of this study with ED personnel and policy makers could take away prejudices about perceived disagreement of parents, thereby improving implementation of and adherence to CAN screening.

AB  - Although growth hormone (GH)- and prolactin (PRL)-secreting pituitary adenomas are considered benign, in many patients, tumour growth and/or invasion constitute a particular challenge. In other tumours, progression relies in part on dysfunction of intercellular adhesion mediated by the large family of cadherins. In the present study, we have explored the contribution of cadherins in GH and PRL adenoma pathogenesis, and evaluated whether this class of adherence molecules was related to tumour invasiveness. We have first established, by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, the expression profile of classical cadherins in the normal human pituitary gland. We show that the cadherin repertoire is restricted and cell-type specific. Somatotrophs and lactotrophs express mainly E-cadherin and cadherin 18, whereas N-cadherin is present in the other endocrine cell types. This repertoire undergoes major differential modification in GH and PRL tumours: E-cadherin is significantly reduced in invasive GH adenomas, and this loss is associated with a cytoplasmic relocalisation of cadherin 18 and catenins. In invasive prolactinomas, E-cadherin distribution is altered and is accompanied by a mislocalisation of cadherin 18, -catenin and p120 catenin. Strikingly, de novo expression of N-cadherin is present in a subset of adenomas and cells exhibit a mesenchymal phenotype exclusively in invasive tumours. Binary tree analysis, performed by combining the cadherin repertoire with the expression of a subset of known molecular markers, shows that cadherin/catenin complexes play a significant role in discrimination of tumour invasion.

AB  - With growing diversity and increased media attention to inequality, it is likely that stigmatized-group members will have increased political influence on social issues affecting other stigmatized groups. When might members of different stigmatized groups see commonality in their experiences or disadvantaged status, and when might another stigmatized group be treated solely as an out-group? This article provides an overview of new and important lines of research examining how perceived discrimination may shape intergroup relations among members of different stigmatized groups. Specifically, perceived discrimination is highlighted as a potentially common experience for members of different stigmatized groups that at times elicits coalitional attitudes, but is often solely experienced as a threat to social identity and thus elicits intergroup derogation. The dimensions on which individuals are stigmatized, aspects of their discrimination experiences, and contextual factors are important for predicting whether perceiving discrimination will spur coalition or derogation. This topic is vital for understanding intergroup relations and political behavior in the 21st century.

AB  - The excess pore pressure () generation and consequent reduction in effective stress lead to the softening of a liquefiable soil deposit that can alter ground motions in terms of amplitude, frequency content and duration. However, total stress models, which are the most currently used, do not take into account coupling of excess pore pressures and soil deformations. To assess this effect, two analyses were made: (1) a Biot hydraulic and mechanical computation of a saturated soil deposit with coupling pore pressures and soil deformations and (2) a mechanical computation of a decoupled model with same initial behaviour. Both analyses were performed with a fully nonlinear elastoplastic multi-mechanism model. As depends on the soil properties, two soils were analysed: loose-to-medium and medium-to-dense sand. The results regarding the profile of maximum accelerations and shear strains, the surface accelerations and their corresponding response spectra are analysed. The mean values of the normalized response spectra ratio of surface accelerations between the coupled and decoupled model show a deamplification of low and high frequencies (i.e. at frequencies lower than 1.0 Hz and higher than 10 Hz) that tend to increase with the liquefaction zone size. Coupling of and soil deformation is therefore of great importance to accurately model the ground motion response. On the contrary, while peak acceleration predictions could be conservative, the amplification on the low frequencies could be largely underestimated which could be highly prejudicial for flexible buildings.

AB  - Although stigma and its relationship to health and disease is not a new phenomenon, it has not been a major feature in the public discourse until the emergence of HIV. The range of negative responses associated with the epidemic placed stigma on the public agenda and drew attention to its complexity as a phenomenon and concept worthy of further investigation. Despite the consensus that stigma is one of the major contributors to the rapid spread of HIV and the frequent use of the term in the media and among people in the street, the exact meaning of 'stigma' remains ambiguous. The aim of this paper is to briefly re-visit some of the scholarly deliberations and further interrogate their relevance in explaining HIV-related stigma evidenced in South Africa. In conclusion a model is presented. Its usefulness - or explanatory potential - is that it attempts to provide a comprehensive framework that offers insights into the individual as well as the social/structural components of HIV-related stigma in a particular context. As such, it has the potential to provide more nuanced understandings as well as to alert us to knowledge-gaps in the process.

AB  - Objective: To compare the results of aortic valve replacement with access by sternotomy or minimally invasive approach.
   Methods: Retrospective analysis of medical records of 37 patients undergoing aortic valve replacement by sternotomy or minimally invasive approach, with emphasis on the comparison of time of cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic clamping, volume of surgical bleeding, time of mechanical ventilation, need for blood transfusion, incidence of atrial fibrillation, length of stay in intensive care unit, time of hospital discharge, short-term mortality and presence of surgical wound infection.
   Results: Sternotomy was used in 22 patients and minimally invasive surgery in 15 patients. The minimally invasive approach had significantly higher time values of cardiopulmonary bypass (114.3 +/- 23.9 versus 86.7 +/- 19.8min.; P=0.003), aortic clamping 87.4 +/- 19.2 versus 61.4 +/- 12.9 min.; P<0.001) and mechanical ventilation (287.3 +/- 138.9 versus 153.9 +/- 118.6 min.; P=0.003). No difference was found in outcomes surgical bleeding volume, need for blood transfusion, incidence of atrial fibrillation, length of stay in intensive care unit and time of hospital discharge. No cases of short-term mortality or surgical wound infection were documented.
   Conclusion: The less invasive approach presented with longer times of cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic clamping and mechanical ventilation than sternotomy, however without prejudice to the length of stay in intensive care unit, time of hospital discharge and morbidity.

AB  - Despite any factual evidence, the idea of a secret "Islamization of Europe" is finding increasing support among different groups in Germany. Anders Behring Breivik, who killed seventy-seven people in the July 22, 2011, massacre in Norway, was partly motivated by such beliefs. A test of revised integrated threat theory as a framework for analyzing Islamophobic conspiracy stereotypes in Germany. Symbolic and realistic threats are analyzed as mediators between different antecedents (in-group identification, ambiguity intolerance, clash of civilizations) and the dependent variable, conspiracy stereotypes. An online survey was conducted with 355 respondents from Berlin. The findings indicate that respondents with higher education and left-leaning political orientation were less likely to believe in conspiracy stereotypes and threats. The structural equation model indicates partial mediation via symbolic threats for clash of civilizations and education on conspiracy stereotypes. Symbolic threats fully mediate the relationship between in-group identification and ambiguity intolerance on conspiracy stereotypes.

AB  - Van Vossole's article explores the racist framing of the peripheral member states of the European Union, the PIGS (Portugal, Ireland (and/or Italy), Greece and Spain). It demonstrates a strong connection between the processes of racialization and depoliticization, as well as the return of colonial dynamics in the Eurozone. Side-stepping political economy and history, the culturalization of politics perfectly complements the post-political' neoliberal hegemony. Political and media discourses reproduce it in both populist and corporate interests. The culturalization of politics reduces the differences between centre and periphery to certain cultural characteristics and habits', as reflected in stereotypes of laziness, non-productivity, corruption, wasteful spending and lying. These make it possible to blame the PIGS for the current crisis, legitimizing drastic austerity measures and a loss of sovereignty. The loss of sovereignty shows remarkable similarities with what Kwame Nkrumah defined as neocolonialism: the continuation of colonial power relations through processes of economic dependence, conditional aid and cultural hegemony. While this problematic only resurfaced during the recent Euro crisis, Van Vossole discusses how today's racist discourses and neocolonial politics have their roots in the past, particularly in anti-Irish and anti-Mediterranean racism and in the (semi-)colonial position of the PIGS in the British and Ottoman empires. Besides structural violence against the periphery, a major consequence of this racialization is that it jeopardizes any possibility of further democratic political integration on the basis of a common European identity.

AB  - Objective: In this paper we introduce the construct of "internalized gay ageism," or the sense that one feels denigrated or depreciated because of aging in the context of a gay male identity, which we identify as an unexplored aspect of sexual minority stress specific to midlife and older gay-identified men.
   Methods: Using a social stress process framework, we examine the association between internalized gay ageism and depressive symptoms, and whether one's sense of mattering mediates or moderates this association, controlling for three decades of depressive symptom histories. The sample is 312 gay-identified men (average age = 60.7 years, range = 48-78, 61% HIV-negative) participating in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) since 1984/85, one of the largest and longest running studies of the natural history of HIV/AIDS in the U.S., who provided contemporary (2012/13) reports of stress experiences.
   Results: We find that internalized gay ageism can reliably be measured among these men, is positively associated with depressive symptoms net of an array of other factors that may also influence symptomatology (including depressive symptom histories), and mattering partially mediates but does not moderate its effect on depressive symptoms.
   Conclusion: Midlife and older gay men have traversed unparalleled historical changes across their adult lives and have paved the way for younger generations of sexual minorities to live in a time of less institutionalized discrimination. Still, they are at distinct risk for feeling socially invisible and devalued in their later years. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Intergroup bias-the tendency to behave more positively toward an ingroup member than an outgroup member-is a powerful social force, for good and ill. Although it is widely demonstrated, intergroup bias is not universal, as it is characterized by significant individual differences. Recently, attention has begun to turn to whether neuroanatomy might explain these individual differences in intergroup bias. However, no research to date has examined whether white matter microstructure could help determine differences in behavior toward ingroup and outgroup members. In the current research, we examine intergroup bias with the third-party punishment paradigm and white matter integrity and connectivity strength as determined by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We found that both increased white matter integrity at the right temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) and connectivity strength between the right TPJ and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) were associated with increased impartiality in the third-party punishment paradigm, i.e., reduced intergroup bias. Further, consistent with the role that these brain regions play in the mentalizing network, we found that these effects were mediated by mentalizing processes. Participants with greater white matter integrity at the right TPJ and connectivity strength between the right TPJ and the DMPFC employed mentalizing processes more equally for ingroup and outgroup members, and this non-biased use of mentalizing was associated with increased impartiality. The current results help shed light on the mechanisms of bias and, potentially, on interventions that promote impartiality over intergroup bias. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is well known that pituitary TSH exerts the major task in the regulation of thyroid function. However, this gland is capable of certain degree of autonomy, independently of TSH control. Iodine plays an important role in thyroid physiology and biochemistry. The thyroid is capable of producing afferent iodolipids such as 2-iodohexadecanal (2-IHDA). It was shown that this iodolipid mimic some of the inhibitory effects of excess iodide on several thyroid parameters.
   Objectives: To identify the miRNAs regulated by 2-IHDA in rat thyroid cells and likely characterize their role in thyroid cell proliferation and function.
   Results: FRTL-5 cells were grown in the presence of TSH and treated with 2-IHDA. Among the miRNAs up-regulated by 2-IHDA we focused on miR-let-7f and miR-138. When we transfected the miRNAs, miR-let-7f but not miR-138 overexpression inhibited proliferation of FRTL 5 cells, while miR-let-7f inhibition restored cell growth in 2-IHDA treated cultures. Analysis of cell cycle by flow cytometric DNA analysis revealed that miR-let-7f inhibition reduced the percentage of 2-IHDA treated cells in G1 phase and an increased of the percentage of cells in S phase was observed upon anti-let-7f transfection. The expresion of Cyclin D1 and Cydin D3 were reduced after the transfection of miR-let-7f and miR-138, respectively. In in vivo studies we observed that miR-let-7f and miR-138 were up regulated by 2-IHDA during goiter involution.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of 2-IHDA on FRTL-5 thyroid cell proliferation are mediated in part through the induction of let-7f microRNA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Because implicit evaluations are thought to underlie many aspects of behavior, researchers have started looking for ways to change them. We examine whether and when persuasive messages alter strongly held implicit evaluations of smoking. In smokers, an affective anti-smoking message led to more negative implicit evaluations on four different implicit measures as compared to a cognitive anti-smoking message which seemed to backfire. Additional analyses suggested that the observed effects were mediated by the feelings and emotions raised by the messages. In non-smokers, both the affective and cognitive message engendered slightly more negative implicit evaluations. We conclude that persuasive messages change implicit evaluations in a way that depends on properties of the message and of the participant. Thus, our data open new avenues for research directed at tailoring persuasive messages to change implicit evaluations.

AB  - This is the first known study to explore how religious identity conflict impacts suicidal behaviors among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) young adults and to test internalized homophobia as a mediator. A secondary analysis of 2,949 youth was conducted using a national dataset collected by OutProud in 2000. Three indicators of identity conflict and an internalized-homophobia scale (mediator), were included in logistic regressions with three different suicide variable outcomes. Internalized homophobia fully mediates one conflict indicator and partially mediates the other two indicators' relationship with suicidal thoughts. Internalized homophobia also fully mediates the relationship between one conflict indicator and chronic suicidal thoughts. Two indicators were associated with twice the odds of a suicide attempt. LGBT young adults who mature in religious contexts have higher odds of suicidal thoughts, and more specifically chronic suicidal thoughts, as well as suicide attempt compared to other LGBT young adults. Internalized homophobia only accounts for portions of this conflict.

AB  - Although integration involves a process of mutual accommodation, the role of majority groups is often downplayed to passive tolerance, leaving immigrants with the sole responsibility for active integration. However, we show that common group identity can actively involve majority members in this process across five studies. Study 1 showed that common identity positively predicted support of integration efforts; Studies 2 and 3 extended these findings, showing that it also predicted real behavior such as monetary donations and volunteering. A decrease in modern racism mediated the relations across these studies, and Studies 4 and 5 further demonstrated that it indeed mediated these effects over and above acculturation expectations and color-blindness, which somewhat compromised integration efforts. Moreover, the last two studies also demonstrated that common, but not dual, groups motivated integration efforts. Common identity appears crucial for securing majorities' altruistic efforts to integrate immigrants and, thus, for achieving functional multiculturalism.

AB  - Drawing on Intergroup Contact Theory, this study examines the effect of contact between hosts and backpackers on host perceptions of backpackers. Survey data collected from people employed in the accommodation sector (N = 416) in Lijiang, China found that contact enhances hosts' understanding of backpackers and helps hosts evaluate backpackers' impact in a more positive way. The effect of both quantity and quality of host-backpacker contact was determined and quality was found to be more influential. The study also found that the perceptions of backpackers mediated the effect of the quality of host backpacker contact on host evaluations of backpacker impacts. The results help explain the findings of previous studies and indicate directions for improving the relationship between hosts and tourists. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and their receptors (FGFRs) are increasingly recognized as important regulators of embryo development in mammals. This study investigated the importance of FGF signaling during in vitro development of ovine embryo. The mRNAs of four FGFR subtypes were detected throughout preimplantation development of in vitro fertilized (IVF) embryos, peaked in abundance at the morula stage, and decreased significantly at the blastocyst stage. To gain insight into the role of these mRNAs in embryo development, IVF embryos were cultured in the presence of FGF2 (100 or 500ng/ml: beginning from days 1 or 4 to 7) or PD173074 (1 mu M: beginning from days 1 to 7) as usual treatments for activation or inhibition of FGFRs, respectively. FGF2-supplementation did not affect the percentage of embryos that developed to the blastocyst, blastocyst cell count and the proportion of cells allocated in inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) compared to control (p>0.05). Also, increasing the dosage or duration of FGF2 treatment did not significantly alter blastocyst yield or differential cell count (p>0.05). PD173074-mediated inhibition of FGFRs did not significantly affect blastocyst yield (p>0.05). Assessment of expression profiles of lineage-associated markers revealed that FGF2 (500ng/ml) supplementation: (i) significantly increased expression of putative hypoblast marker (GATA4), (ii) significantly decreased expression of putative epiblast (EPI) marker (NANOG) and (iii) did not change TE markers (CDX2 and IFNT) and pluripotency makers (OCT4, SOX2 and REX1). In summary, FGF2-mediated activation of FGFRs may promote a switch in transcriptional profile of ovine ICM from EPI- to hypoblast-associated gene expression.

AB  - ObjectiveThe study investigates sources of asymmetry between individual attitudes toward nationalist inclusion and exclusionfocusing on why public support in Russia for deporting all migrants remained about the same from 2005 to 2013, while support for admitting all migrants significantly declined.
   MethodsData from surveys based on multistage random sampling of the adult population of the Russian Federation in 2005 (N = 579) and 2013 (N = 805) are subjected to multiple (OLS) regression analysis, in which support for deportation and admission of migrants are dependent variables and survey measures (with different specifications) of intergroup threat, competition, bias, contact, and the immigration security dilemma, as well as education and media exposure are the independent variables.
   ResultsOnly two predictors consistently explained support for both inclusion and exclusion of migrants in Russia in both 2005 and 2013perceived state strength and economic vulnerability. In every test, support for exclusion nonrandomly related to more predictors in the same model than support for inclusion.
   ConclusionIn changing political and socioeconomic contexts exclusionist views are more persistent than inclusive views. Both measures need to be used in research on intergroup relations and nationalism. Otherwise, one is more likely to accept false positives while underestimating some significant enduring predictors.

AB  - In times of economic downturn, perceived realistic intergroup threats (e.g., labour competition) often dominate political and media discourse. Although local outgroups (e.g., local immigrants) can be experienced as sources of realistic threats, we propose that such threats can also be perceived to be caused by distant outgroups (e.g., European Union members perceiving Greece to threaten their economies) and that such distant threats can carry over into local intolerance (e.g., increasing intolerance towards local immigrant groups). We predicted and found in two studies that perceived distant realistic threats carried over into local intolerance via two different pathways. First, direct reactions towards the distant outgroup can generalize to culturally similar local outgroups (the group-based association pathway). Secondly, Study 2 indicated that when the distant threat was attributed to stereotypical outgroup traits (e.g., being lazy), distant realistic threats activated local realistic threats, which subsequently influenced local intolerance (the threat-based association pathway). Taken together, our studies indicate that perceived realistic threats foreign can turn domestic, but in two different ways.

AB  - One of the most important social identities that children learn to define themselves and others by is sex, becoming a salient social category by early childhood. Although older children begin to show greater flexibility in their gendered behaviors and attitudes, gender rigidity intensifies again around the time of puberty. In the current study, we assessed behavioral and neural biases to sex across a wide age group. Ninety-three youth (ages 7-17 years) provided behavioral rating of same-and opposite-sex attitudes, and 52 youth (ages 4-18 years) under-went an fMRI scan as they matched the emotion of same-and opposite-sex faces. We demonstrate significant age-related behavioral biases of sex that are mediated by differential amygdala response to opposite-sex relative to same-sex faces in children, an effect that completely attenuates by the teenage years. Moreover, we find a second peak in amygdala sensitivity to opposite-sex faces around the time of puberty. Thus, the amygdala codes for developmentally dependent and motivationally relevant social identification across development.

AB  - This article examines features of preference organization in disaffiliative responses to possibly racist actions, drawing on a corpus of more than 120 hours of recorded interactions from South African radio call-in shows. My analysis demonstrates how features of dispreferred turn shapes provide producers of possibly racist actions with opportunities to withdraw or back down from them. In cases where these opportunities are not taken up, subsequent responses may progressively include more features of preferred turn shapes. Responses may also include features of preferred turn shapes from the outset, thereby treating the prior actions as unequivocally racist. Responses that treat prior actions as such, however, also recurrently exhibit features of dispreference, thereby displaying speakers' orientations to cross-cutting preferences in responding to racism, with disaffiliative responses being dispreferred actions in some senses, but preferred actions in others. I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for everyday antiracism in interactional settings.

AB  - Research on parochial altruism demonstrated that hostility toward out-groups (parochialism) represents the dark side of the willingness to benefit one's in-group even at own costs (altruism). Parochial aggression thereby emerged mainly under conditions of threat. Extremist propaganda videos, for instance by right-wing extremists, try to capitalize on parochial altruistic mechanism by telling recipients sharing their national identity that this nation is under threat wherefore they for have to join the extremist's cause to prevent the extinction of their nation. Most of the time, propaganda videos are rated as uninteresting and non-persuasive by the target audience. Yet, evolutionary media psychology posits that the interest in and effectiveness of media increases when evolutionarily relevant problems are addressed. Consequently, interest in parochial altruistic right-wing extremist messages should increase under conditions of threat. The current study tested this assumption by randomly assigning German non-Muslims (N = 109) to either an existential threat (here: mortality salience) or a control condition and asking them to evaluate extremist propaganda that addressed them as either in-group members (right-wing extremists) or as out-group members (Islamic extremists). In support of the hypotheses, subjects under conditions of threat reported a higher interest in the right-wing extremist propaganda and perceived it as more persuasive. We discuss the results concerning the implications for evolutionary media psychology and the transmission of parochial altruism in propaganda videos.

AB  - Support for collective action, an initial step in challenging social inequalities, can have important implications for intergroup relations in contemporary plural societies. The present study, conducted among majority Finns (n = 274) and Russian immigrants in Finland (n = 228), investigated the relationship between perceived cultural discordance (i.e., disagreement between majority and minority groups about the importance of cultural maintenance for minority members) and support for collective action benefiting the minority. Specifically, it was expected that the association between cultural discordance and collective action would be at least partially mediated by intergroup anxiety and outgroup trust, and that both the direct and indirect effects of cultural discordance would depend on group status (i.e., majority vs. minority). The results showed that among majority group members, the association was negative and mediated by high intergroup anxiety and low outgroup trust, whereas among minority group members, the association was positive and mediated by only low outgroup trust.

AB  - Population innumeracy (the tendency to overestimate immigrant or minority population sizes) has sparked scholarly interest. However, erroneous size estimates are not the only consequential misperception. There are also qualitative questions that are prone to error, such as the most common origin of immigrants. Using data from the Finnish National Election Survey, the current study provides the first detailed examination of misperceptions about the primary source of immigration. I consider both their extent and correlates. Results indicate that about one-fifth are incorrect, with most faultily identifying Somalia as the primary origin. These misperceptions are related significantly to media exposure and demographic factors, suggesting that they are more than random ignorance. Source misperceptions are strongly associated with perceptions of cultural threat from immigrants, suggesting potential consequences for faulty views. Overall, findings indicate that innumeracy research should expand to include misperceptions beyond size.

AB  - Imagining oneself in a stereotyped role may not only increase women's endorsement of stereotypes about women and science, but also stifle broader concerns about social change. In the experiment, 81 women imagined themselves on a stereotypical or a counter-stereotypical career path (vs. a control condition). Participants in the stereotypical imagery condition endorsed to a higher extent the stereotypes about women and science, and crucially, were more resistant to social change in general. Stereotype endorsement mediated the relationship between exposure to stereotypes and resistance to social change. Results imply that tackling occupational gender stereotypes is crucial not only because they exclude women from male-dominated careers, but also because of a potentially pervasive negative impact on broader egalitarian concerns.

AB  - Gliptins have been recently shown to conquer neuronal degeneration in cell cultures via modulating glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1. This peptide produced in the gut not only crosses the blood-brain barrier but is also synthesized in the brain and acts on GLP-1R exerting central anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects, thus impeding neuronal damage. This study investigated the antiparkinsonian effect of vildagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor in a rat rotenone model targeting mainly the RAGE-NFB/Nrf2-signaling pathways, to judge the potential anti-inflammatory/antioxidant effects of the drug. Vildagliptin markedly improved the motor performance in the open field and rotarod tests, effects that were emphasized by the accompanied reduction in striatal dopamine content. It modified the striatal energy level (ADP/ATP) associated with partial antagonism of body weight reduction. This incretin enhancer suppressed nuclear factor (NF)B and, consequently, the downstream inflammatory mediator tumor necrosis factor-. Normalization of receptor for advanced glycated end product (RAGE) is a main finding which justifies the anti-inflammatory effects of vildagliptin, together with hampering striatal inducible nitric oxide synthase, intracellular adhesion molecule-1 as well as myeloperoxidase. The antioxidant potential of vildagliptin was depicted as entailing reduction in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances and the transcriptional factor Nrf-2 level. Vildagliptin guarded against neuronal demise through an antiapoptotic effect as reflected by the reduction in the mitochondrial matrix component cytochrome c and the key downstream executioner caspase-3. In conclusion, vildagliptin is endowed with various neuroprotective effects and thus can be a promising candidate for the management of Parkinson's disease.

AB  - The purpose of the current study was to examine the relative impact of actual and perceived weight, weight importance, entity mindset, and ethnicity on anti-fat attitudes as well as to examine whether certain variables play the role of mediator. Participants included a multiethnic U.S. sample of 923 female undergraduates who completed a series of measures online. Lower BMI, higher perceived weight, higher importance of weight, endorsement of an entity mindset, and identification as White as compared to Black, Hispanic, or Asian predicted higher overall anti-fat attitudes. Examination of the individual Antifat Attitudes Questionnaire subscales (i.e. dislike, fear of fat, and willpower) using Relative Weight Analysis suggested that weight importance is an important predictor of multiple aspects of anti-fat attitudes. In addition, weight importance mediated the relationship between perceived weight and fear of fat as well as the relationship between ethnicity and dislike. Implications of findings and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - To investigate the development of follicles and incidence of apoptosis in vitrified cultured mouse ovaries in the presence and absence of Kit ligand, 1-week-old mouse ovaries were cultured in the presence or absence of Kit ligand for 7 days. Development and function of ovarian follicles was evaluated by histology and hormonal analysis. Apoptosis assessment was conducted by analysis of DNA laddering, TdT (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase)-mediated dUDP nick-end-labelling and caspase-3/7 activity. The proportion of preantral follicles and the level of 17-beta oestradiol, progesterone and dehydroepiandrosterone were increased in all cultured groups, and it was significantly higher in Kit ligand treated groups than in the control (P < 0.001). The number of apoptotic signals in both vitrified samples is significantly higher than in the non-vitrified control (P < 0.01), and these signals are significantly lower in both Kit ligand treated groups than in non-Kit ligand treated groups (P < 0.001). The level of caspase-3/7 activity was higher in vitrified cultured ovaries than non-vitrified group (P < 0.01). Kit ligand was shown to improve in-vitro development of follicles, and also acted as an anti-apoptotic factor in vitrified ovaries. The developmental potential of follicles in vitrified groups was lower than that in fresh ovaries. (C) 2015 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although many of the world's most serious outbreaks of conflict and violence center on religion, social science research has had relatively little to say about religion's unique role in shaping individuals' attitudes about these events. In this paper we investigate whether Americans' religious beliefs play a central role in shaping attitudes toward the continuing threat of terrorism and their willingness to assist officials in countering these perceived threats. Our analysis of an original data collection of almost 1600 Americans shows that more religious respondents are more likely to express concerns about terrorism. However, this relationship is mediated by their level of conservatism. We also find that more religious respondents are more likely to claim that they will assist government officials in countering terrorism. This relationship remained even after accounting for conservatism, and people's general willingness to help police solve crimes like breaking and entering. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Besides other mechanism(s) 17 beta-estradiol (E2) facilitates neuronal survival by increasing, via estrogen receptor beta (ER beta), the levels of neuroglobin (NGB) an anti-apoptotic protein. In contrast, E2 could exert protective effects in cancer cells by activating apoptosis when the ER beta level prevails on that of ER alpha as in colon cancer cell lines. These apparently contrasting results raise the possibility that E2-induced NGB up-regulation could regulate the ER beta activities shunning this receptor subtype to trigger an apoptotic cascade in neurons but not in non-neuronal cells. Here, human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (DLD-1) that only expresses ER beta and HeLa cells transiently transfected with ER beta encoding vector has been used to verify this hypothesis. In addition, neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cells were used as positive control. Surprisingly, E2 also induced NGB up-regulation, in a dose- and time-dependent manner, in DLD-1 cells. The ER beta-mediated activation of p38/MAPK was necessary for this E2 effect. E2 induced NGB re-allocation in mitochondria where, subsequently to an oxidative stress injury (i.e., 100 mu M H2O2), NGB interacted with cytochrome c preventing its release into the cytosol and the activation of an apoptotic cascade. As a whole, these results demonstrate that E2-induced NGB up-regulation could act as an oxidative stress sensor, which does not oppose to the pro-apoptotic E2 effect in ER beta-containing colon cancer cells unless a rise of oxidative stress occurs. These results support the concept that oxidative stress plays a critical role in E2-induced carcinogenesis and further open an important scenario to develop novel therapeutic strategies that target NGB against E2-related cancers.

AB  - We examined the role of social dominance orientation (SDO) as a predictor of men's reactions to romantic rejection and attitudes toward female sexuality. In Study 1 (n=158), we found that men who scored higher in SDO were more likely to blame women for romantic rejection, and report having responded to women's past rejection with persistence and manipulation (e.g., convincing her to "give him another chance"), as well as with aggression and threats of violence. In Study 2 (n=398), we replicated these findings, and further found that men higher in SDO were more likely to endorse rape myths (e.g., believing that sometimes a woman's barriers need to be "broken down" in order to attain sex), and to want to lower the legal age of sexual consent in women. Two mediators explained this relationship, hostile sexism and the belief that insubordinate women need to be disciplined. Practical and theoretical implications are discussed.

AB  - AimTo discuss a research method, the Implicit Association Test, for use in nursing research. The Implicit Association Test measures implicit attitudes, which may mediate health-related and caregiving behaviours.
   BackgroundImplicit attitudes are automatic and often unconscious, but may affect the behaviours of nurses and their patients. The Implicit Association Test has been used to measure implicit attitudes in fields from health care to marketing, but has seldom appeared in nursing. The Implicit Association Test is a computer-based tool consisting of a series of categorization tasks. Implicit Association Tests are scored based on the speed of matching either words or images to categories. Assumptions of the Implicit Association Test method, its administration, psychometrics and potential use in nursing research are reviewed.
   DesignDiscussion paper.
   Data sourcesPubMed, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsychINFO((R)) and Health and Psychosocial Instrument databases were searched from the Implicit Association Test's introduction in 1998-April 2013. Search terms used were Implicit Association Test' OR IAT'.
   Implications for nursingNursing theories include attitudes as mediators of behaviour and health, but measurement has been limited to explicit attitudes. A reliable, valid and flexible tool is available to measure implicit attitudes. This tool largely circumvents self-report bias related to socially sensitive topics.
   ConclusionNursing research is needed to investigate implicit attitudes held by nurses and patients when these may influence health-related behaviours and outcomes. The Implicit Association Test can measure implicit attitudes and is suitable for adoption in nursing research.

AB  - Biological lay theories of race have proven to have pernicious consequences for interracial relations, yet few studies have examined how intergroup contact itself (particularly with those who naturalistically challenge these conceptions) affects beliefs about race. Three studies (a correlational study, an interaction study, and an experimental study) examine whether exposure to racially ambiguous individuals reduces Whites' biological lay theories of race across time. Study 1 demonstrates that increased exposure to racial ambiguity across 2 weeks reduced White individuals' biological lay theories. Study 2 shows that Whites who interacted in a laboratory setting with a racially ambiguous individual were less likely to endorse biological lay theories, an effect that sustained for 2 weeks. Study 3 finds that the reduction in biological lay theories after exposure to racial ambiguity is mediated by the tendency for Whites' lay theories of race to conform to beliefs they presume racially ambiguous individuals hold.

AB  - There is mounting evidence to suggest that East European migrants in the UK have been victims of discrimination. Reports of pay gaps point to the possibility of structural discrimination, restrictions on employment operate as a kind of legal discrimination, and politicians and the media have constructed East European migrants as different and at times threatening. The Hungarians and Romanians we spoke with in Bristol also reported some discrimination, albeit in ways that deflected its racialised connotations. But they also denied that they were victims of discrimination. Why would the supposed victims of discrimination deny discrimination? We argue they did this to attenuate, and potentially reverse, the status degradations they suffered as disadvantaged and at times racialised labour migrants in Britain. We examine two discursive strategies they employed to negotiate this higher status. First, they claimed a higher social class status by embracing the meritocratic values of the dominant class. Second, they claimed a higher racial status by emphasising their whiteness and Europeanness. These were discursive attempts to reposition themselves more favourably in Britain's racialised status hierarchies.

AB  - Atheists are often portrayed in the media and elsewhere as angry individuals. Although atheists disagree with the pillar of many religions, namely the existence of a God, it may not necessarily be the case that they are angry individuals. The prevalence and accuracy of angry-atheist perceptions were examined in 7 studies with 1,677 participants from multiple institutions and locations in the United States. Studies 1-3 revealed that people believe atheists are angrier than believers, people in general, and other minority groups, both explicitly and implicitly. Studies 4-7 then examined the accuracy of these beliefs. Belief in God, state anger, and trait anger were assessed in multiple ways and contexts. None of these studies supported the idea that atheists are particularly angry individuals. Rather, these results support the idea that people believe atheists are angry individuals, but they do not appear to be angrier than other individuals in reality.

AB  - Neuronal-activity-regulated pentraxin (NARP/NPTX2/NP2) is a secreted synaptic protein that regulates the trafficking of glutamate receptors and mediates learning, memory, and drug addiction. The role of NPTX2 in regulating structural synaptic plasticity and behavior in a developing vertebrate is indefinite. We characterized the expression of nptx2a in larvae and adult zebrafish and established a transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-mediated nptx2a mutant (nptx2a(-/-)) to study the role of Nptx2a in regulating structural synaptic plasticity and behavior. Similar to mammals, the zebrafish nptx2a was expressed in excitatory neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Its expression was induced in response to a mechanosensory stimulus but did not change during day and night. Behavioral assays showed that loss of Nptx2a results in reduced locomotor response to light-to-dark transition states and to a sound stimulus. Live imaging of synapses using the transgenic nptx2a:GAL4VP16 zebrafish and a fluorescent presynaptic synaptophysin (SYP) marker revealed reduced synaptic density in the axons of the spinal motor neurons and the anterodorsal lateral-line ganglion (gAD), which regulate locomotor activity and locomotor response to mechanosensory stimuli, respectively. These results suggest that Nptx2a affects locomotor response to external stimuli by mediating structural synaptic plasticity in excitatory neuronal circuits.

AB  - Individuals exercise self-control daily to achieve desired goals; at the same time, people engage in social interaction daily and influence (feel powerful) or are influenced (feel powerless) by others. Does controlling the self have an unforeseen consequence for people's perception of their capacity to control others? Five studiesone correlational and four experimentaldemonstrate that ego depletion from prior self-control determines one's personal sense of power; low-level, concrete mental construals account for this relationship. Our results showed that people with higher trait self-control reported a greater sense of power (Study 1). People who had depleted their self-control-related regulatory resources (vs. those who had not) experienced a lower sense of power (Study 2). The relationship between ego depletion and low sense of power was mediated by construal level (Study 3) and observed only when low-level, concrete construals were present, but not under high-level, abstract construals (Studies 4 and 5).

AB  - Low molecular weight components of shark cartilage are reported to have anti-tumor as well as immuno-stimulating effects. Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that have a key role in establishment of anti-cancer immune response. In this study, the effect of 14 kDa protein from shark cartilage was investigated on stimulation and maturation of dendritic cells. The isolated 14 kDa protein from shark cartilage extract was added to DCs medium during overnight culture and their maturation and T cells stimulation potential was investigated. The majority of shark-cartilage-treated DCs expressed higher levels of maturation markers and were more effective in stimulation of allogenic T cells compared with non-treated DCs (p < 0.05). Our results showed that shark cartilage 14 kDa protein can potentially be used in DC-mediated T-cells stimulation and induction of desirable immune responses in clinical trials such as cancer immunotherapy. However, further studies are required to examine this proposal.

AB  - Research on the leaderships and electorates of populist right-wing parties emphasizes that most of these parties are charismatic and male-dominated, both as regards their leaderships and their voters. However, while studies about the gender gap focus mainly on demand-side factors, such as electoral support, socio-economic characteristics and the voters' attitudes towards issues such as immigration, those that analyse the role and position of gender issues are still rare. Similarly, or even more, overlooked is an analysis of the rhetoric, style, charisma and discourse of populist female leaders, such as those representative of two now well-established Scandinavian populist right-wing parties: the Dansk Folkeparti (DF, Danish People's Party) and Norway's Fremskrittspartiet (FrP, Progress Party). Both parties have long been led by women although Pia Kj AE rsgaard of the DF recently stepped down, leaving the party leadership to Kristian Thulesen Dahl, a man of the younger generation of party members; Siv Jensen in Norway smoothly followed the long-term and charismatic leadership of Carl I. Hagen in 2006. The main focus of the paper, however, is on Pia Kj AE rsgaard, discussing the role gender plays in relation to her style, rhetoric and/or discursive strategies, but also in the gendered constructions featured in the Danish mainstream media. In the article, Meret also refers to the case of Marine Le Pen and the Front national (FN) in order to consider whether the Nordic cases represent a specific framework for female leadership, highly influenced by context and opportunity.

AB  - Religious diversity in schools is a growing interest among educational researchers. This qualitative case study examines how 15 Turkish-Muslim children in elementary and middle school negotiated their religious identities as they responded to various experiences in American schools and in their communities. Unlike some earlier studies that highlighted cultural conflict as a theme in Muslim adolescents' relationship with schools in the United States, this study is based on a framework that illustrates the voices and agency of young children, and utilizes data from interviews, participant observations and cultural artifacts. Findings demonstrate the ways parents and children mediated challenges their religious identity posed by choosing strategies that made their religious identities invisible, or by finding innovative ways to negotiate their identity and religious practices. Children who participated in the study did not view American identities in conflict with their Muslim identities. Learning about the experiences of immigrant parents and children may provide teachers with insight for creating educational experiences that are responsive to the needs of these communities. This knowledge base can also assist teachers in better responding to biases about Muslims, which might negatively influence children's identity construction and academic and social achievement.

AB  - Global identification has become a popular construct in recent psychological debate as it relates to harmonious intergroup relations and a caring for all humanity. Based on social identity theorizing, the current research tests whether global identification can also predict consumer choices, at the expense of lower personal benefit. Importantly, we assumed that concerns about global injustice represent a crucial component of that relation. We predicted that participants who identified strongly with all humanity would rather choose a Fairtrade product alternative over a conventional one, compared with low identifiers. In addition, we assumed that this effect be mediated by perceived global injustice. Both predictions were confirmed in a consumer choice study (N = 68). Overall, global identification and globally relevant consumer behavior seem meaningfully interconnected, and we discuss these findings with regard to recent theoretical developments in Fairtrade consumption research.

AB  - Stigma is a widely used concept in social science research and an extensive literature claims that stigmatisation contributes to numerous negative health outcomes. However, few studies compare groups that vary in the extent to which they are stigmatised and even fewer studies examine stigma's independent and mediating effects. This article addresses these gaps in a comparative study of perceived stigma and drug use among three low-income feminised service occupations: sex work, food and alcoholic beverage serving, and barbering and hairstyling. An analysis of longitudinal data shows positive associations between sex work, perceived stigma, and socially less acceptable drug use (for example, heroin and cocaine), and that stigma mediates part of the link between sex work and the use of these drugs. Our overall findings suggest that perceived stigma is pronounced among those who work in the sex industry and negatively affects health independently of sex work involvement.

AB  - Group-based relative deprivation (GRD) is a critical predictor of support for social change. Because resistance to change and acceptance of inequality are core features of a conservative ideology, we predicted that GRD would negatively correlate with conservatism. Moreover, given the central role affect plays in bridging the association between experiences with inequality and group-based responses, we expected that this hypothesized relationship would be mediated by intergroup emotions. We tested these hypotheses in a large national sample of MAori (N = 685)-the indigenous peoples of New Zealand. As predicted, GRD was indirectly associated with conservatism through participants' warmth toward the majority outgroup (i.e., New Zealand Europeans) and the minority ingroup (i.e., MAori): whereas GRD was negatively correlated with warmth toward outgroup members, GRD was positively correlated with warmth toward the ingroup. In turn, warmth toward the (a) outgroup and (b) ingroup was positively and negatively associated with conservatism, respectively. Similar results were obtained when replacing conservatism with participants' (a) satisfaction with the government and (b) support for New Zealand's main center-right political party. Our findings demonstrate the complex relationship between GRD and political beliefs, while also highlighting the crucial role of emotions in connecting GRD with group-based attitudes.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression and effect of resistin on ovarian activities of Scotophilus heathi. Immunohistochemical study showed marked variation in resistin immunostaining during different reproductive phases. Most intense immunostaining of resistin was noticed in thecal-interstitial cells in ovary during the period of delayed ovulation, the period of increased androgen synthesis and suppressed ovulation. The changes in ovarian resistin level also correlated positively with circulating leptin level and body white adipose tissue accumulation. The in vitro study showed that resistin alone preferentially stimulated progesterone synthesis, but with luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulated androgen secretion. Resistin alone dose-dependently increased expression of LH-receptor, steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and insulin receptor proteins in the ovary, whereas together with LH showed dose-dependent stimulatory effect on expression of androgen receptor and insulin receptor proteins in the ovary. In conclusion, during the period of fat accumulation increased ovarian resistin level may be responsible for increased androgen synthesis through insulin receptor mediated pathways in the ovary of S. heathi.

AB  - This research investigated the role of group-based anger and efficacy in explaining the effects of subgroup (ethnic) and common (European) identity on collective action among Kurds in Europe responding to different types of disadvantage. Whereas stronger Kurdish identity positively predicted intentions for collective action (mediated by anger and efficacy), stronger common ingroup identity was negatively related to collective action intentions. This effect occurred primarily when structural disadvantage was salient, not when attention was drawn to a specific incident of disadvantage, and was mediated by anger but not efficacy. The findings complement recent work demonstrating that intergroup harmony can undermine social change, suggesting that stronger common-group identification reduces collective action by reducing minority-group members' sensitivity to potential bias against them.

AB  - Despite a proliferation of research on Islam and Muslims in the media, very little work has focused on Muslim women, a much-debated social group that merits special consideration. This article aims to investigate how Muslim women are represented in BBC News website texts using a purpose-built corpus (1.9 million words in 3269 articles). The research employs analytical tools from the discourse-historical, socio-cognitive, and sociosemantic approaches to critical discourse studies. These are combined with corpus-based methodologies to investigate the semantic macrostructures that tend to be associated with Muslim women and the discursive strategies employed in the representation of the hijab. The study is novel in its exhaustive approach to identifying salient and underreported issues related to Muslim women in news discourse. It also introduces a more integrated analysis that combines manual and automated techniques and tackles the quantification of qualitative results where possible. Findings suggest that Muslim women's representations are largely restricted in terms of regional coverage. Semantic macrostructures related to conflict and crime are prevalent. The hijab remains a nodal discourse surrounding Muslim women whose function as a descriptive feature is often unclear, raising serious questions about its relevance. A number of recommendations are made for journalists to become cognizant of their own context models when reporting on Muslim women.

AB  - A nation-wide sample of 634 previous or current members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (LDS), non-heterosexual adults (ages 18-33), were surveyed to examine how specific aspects of minority stress are individually and collectively associated with depression, and how such associations differ across sex, sexual orientation, and level of affiliation with the LDS church. When five stressors were examined simultaneously, need for others' acceptance (NA) was the strongest predictor of depression, followed by internalized homophobia (IH). All minority stress factors were found to be individually predictive of depression and did not differ across sex or sexual orientation subgroups. Differences were observed, however, when considering current LDS status, such that participants who were no longer affiliated with the LDS church reported stronger relationships between some minority stressors and depression. Implications of religious identity salience as a potential mediator of relationships between specific stressors and depression are discussed.

AB  - This study investigates the personality processes involved in the debate surrounding the use of cognitive ability tests in college admissions. In Study 1, 108 undergraduates (M-age=18.88 years, 60 women, 80 Whites) completed measures of social dominance orientation (SDO), testing self-efficacy, and attitudes regarding the use of cognitive ability tests in college admissions; SAT/ACT scores were collected from the registrar. Sixty-seven undergraduates (M-age=19.06 years, 39 women, 49 Whites) completed the same measures in Study 2, along with measures of endorsement of commonly presented arguments about test use. In Study 3, 321 American adults (M-age=35.58 years, 180 women, 251 Whites) completed the same measures used in Study 2; half were provided with facts about race and validity issues surrounding cognitive ability tests. Individual differences in SDO significantly predicted support for the use of cognitive ability tests in all samples, after controlling for SAT/ACT scores and test self-efficacy and also among participants who read facts about cognitive ability tests. Moreover, arguments for and against test use mediated this effect. The present study sheds new light on an old debate by demonstrating that individual differences in beliefs about hierarchy play a key role in attitudes toward cognitive ability test use.

TI  - STANLEY KUNITZ'S CRACKED VOCATION
T2  - STUDIES IN AMERICAN JEWISH LITERATURE
LA  - English
AB  - Though Stanley Kunitz was among the most decorated poets of his generation, he did not secure his first college teaching position until he was in his forties, and it wasn't until he was well into his fifties that he began to receive widespread acclaim for his work. Ultimately, these early fissures in Kunitz's vocation were problems of professionalization that can be traced back to his origins. As the youngest son of a hardscrabble immigrant widow in A gritty industrial city, Kunitz transcended his difficult childhood, but found it more complicated to contend with his heritage as he shaped a career for himself. Though Kunitz made isolated attempts to reckon with his Jewish and Lithuanian roots, his more usual course was to de-emphasize that heritage. But if Kunitz's poetics proved to be a poetics of sublimation in the main, there are also instances in which the sorrows of his station shine through-as, for instance, in the masterful short poem "An Old Cracked Tune," where Kunitz takes pains to reassert his beleaguered identity, to think through the terms of the prejudices he faced up to, and, in his own terms, "to embrace a wounded name."

AB  - Almost all academic literature across disciplines and most of the news media explain racial inequality as the result of the discrimination and racism of whites toward nonwhites. In contrast, I argue that it is the favoritism or advantages that whites provide to other whites that is the primary mechanism by which racial inequality is reproduced in the post-civil rights period in the U.S. I provide evidence for my argument with data at the individual, organizational, and societal levels. I also discuss how my argument accords with management theory about diversity and inequality, considering the literature on anti racism, implicit or unconscious bias, micro-inequities (or micro-aggressions), the need for mentors, and white privilege. I end with a discussion of objections that might be raised with regard to my framing of racial inequality as the result of whites providing advantages to other whites, including concerns about egregious negative acts toward nonwhites. Overall, I argue that my argument that favoritism takes precedence over racism and discrimination is consistent with the research evidence in the field. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Hedonic hunger refers to consumption of food just for pleasure and not to maintain energy homeostasis. Recently, consumption of food for pleasure was reported to be associated with increased circulating levels of both the orexigenic peptide ghrelin and the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG) in normal-weight subjects. To date, the effects of hedonic hunger, and in particular of chocolate craving, on these mediators in obese subjects are still unknown.
   Methods: To explore the role of some gastrointestinal orexigenic and anorexigenic peptides and endocannabinoids (and some related congeners) in chocolate consumption, we measured changes in circulating levels of ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), anandamide (AEA), 2-AG, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), and oleoylethanolamide (OEA) in 10 satiated severely obese subjects after consumption of chocolate and, on a separate day, of a non-palatable isocaloric food with the same bromatologic composition. Evaluation of hunger and satiety was also performed by visual analogic scale.
   Results: The anticipatory phase and the consumption of food for pleasure were associated with increased circulating levels of ghrelin, AEA, 2-AG, and OEA. In contrast, the levels of GLP-1, PYY, and PEA did not differ before and after the exposure/ingestion of either chocolate or non-palatable foods. Hunger and satiety were higher and lower, respectively, in the hedonic session than in the non-palatable one.
   Conclusions: When motivation to eat is generated by exposure to, and consumption of, chocolate a peripheral activation of specific endogenous rewarding chemical signals, including ghrelin, AEA, and 2-AG, is observed in obese subjects. Although preliminary, these findings predict the effectiveness of ghrelin and endocannabinoid antagonists in the treatment of obesity.

AB  - One of humanity's most pressing problems is the inequality between people from developed and developing countries, which counteracts joint efforts to combat other large scale problems. Little is known about the psychological antecedents that affect the perception of and behavioral responses to global inequality. Based on, and extending, Duckitt's dual-process model, the current research examines psychological antecedents that may explain how people in an industrialized Western country respond to global inequality. In two studies (N-1 = 116, N-2 = 117), we analyzed the relationship between the Big Five and justice constructs, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and behavioral intentions to reduce global inequality. Two-group path analysis revealed support for the dual-process model in that RWA and SDO were important predictors of behavioral intentions and partially acted as mediators between personality and such intentions. Moreover, justice sensitivity explained variance beyond the classic DPM variables. In Study 2, we additionally assessed individuals' global social identification and perceived injustice of global inequality that explained additional variance. Extending previous work on the dual-process model, these findings demonstrate that individual and group-based processes predict people's responses to global inequality and uncover potentials to promote behavior in the interest of global justice.

AB  - In cultural contexts in which sexist beliefs are considered traditional, shifts toward gender equality represent an example of cultural change. Polyculturalism is defined as the belief that cultures change constantly through different racial and ethnic groups' interactions, influences, and exchanges with each other and, therefore, are dynamic and socially constructed rather than static. Thus, polyculturalism may involve openness to cultural change and, thereby, would be expected to be associated with lower sexist attitudes. Four studies (both cross-sectional and longitudinal) with undergraduate and community samples in the Northeastern United States tested whether endorsement of polyculturalism is inversely associated with sexism, above and beyond potentially confounding belief systems. Across studies, for both women and men, endorsement of polyculturalism was associated with lower sexist attitudes for two classes of sexism measures: (a) attitudes toward the rights and roles of women and (b) ambivalent sexist attitudes toward women. Associations remained significant while controlling for potentially confounding variables (colorblindness, conservatism, egalitarianism, gender and ethnic identity, gender and race essentialism, multiculturalism, right-wing authoritarianism, and social dominance orientation). Greater openness to criticizing one's culture mediated polyculturalism's association with attitudes toward the rights and roles of women but not with ambivalent sexist attitudes toward women. Studying polyculturalism may provide unique insights into sexism, and more work is needed to understand the mechanisms involved.

AB  - Popular support for enhanced border and internal controls to deal With undocumented immigration is examined in relation to contextual measures of group threat as well as perceived levels of cultural and economic threat posed by undocumented immigrants. Results from a national survey of non-Latino respondents (N = 1,364) indicate that presumed threatening context measured in static terms is inconsequential. But when context is measured in dynamic terms that also reflect dispersion and potential contact, it significantly predicts support for border controls. Perceived threats are stronger predictors of support for enhanced controls than either contextual indicators of presumed threat or individual characteristics of respondents. Results also show that perceived economic and cultural threats mediate the effects of individual respondent characteristics and dynamic contextual conditions as well. Implications for future research on immigrant threat emphasize the importance of context measured in both change and dispersion-related terms and responses to threat that distinguish alternative dimensions of control. Future work should also consider that perceptions of threat may not only have direct influence on immigration policy preferences but can mediate the effects of context and individual characteristics on those preferences.

AB  - Perceivers extractmultiple social dimensions from another's face (e. g., race, emotion), and these dimensions can become linked due to stereotypes (e. g., Black individuals. angry). The current research examined the neural basis of detecting and resolving conflicts between top-down stereotypes and bottom-up visual information in person perception. Participants viewed faces congruent and incongruent with stereotypes, via variations in race and emotion, while neural activity was measured using fMRI. Hand movements en route to race/emotion responses were recorded using mouse-tracking to behaviorally index individual differences in stereotypical associations during categorization. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) showed stronger activation to faces that violated stereotypical expectancies at the intersection of multiple social categories (i.e., race and emotion). These regions were highly sensitive to the degree of incongruency, exhibiting linearly increasing responses as race and emotion became stereotypically more incongruent. Further, the ACC exhibited greater functional connectivity with the lateral fusiform cortex, a region implicated in face processing, when viewing stereotypically incongruent (relative to congruent) targets. Finally, participants with stronger behavioral tendencies to link race and emotion stereotypically during categorization showed greater dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation to stereotypically incongruent targets. Together, the findings provide insight into how conflicting stereotypes at the nexus of multiple social dimensions are resolved at the neural level to accurately perceive other people.

AB  - The bat Scotophilus heathi exhibit prolonged anovulatory condition known as delayed ovulation coinciding with the period of extensive fat accumulation. The present study was undertaken to find out whether extensive accumulation of fat in S. heathi is responsible for suppression of ovarian activity by increasing production of adipokine resistin in the bat. This was achieved by (a) investigating variation in serum resistin level in relation to the changes in the body fat mass and (b) evaluating the effect of resistin treatment on ovarian activity with reference to steroid synthesis. An attempt was also made to determine whether resistin mediate its effects on ovary through signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling mechanism. The results showed significant seasonal variation in serum resistin level with the peak level coinciding with the period of maximum fat accumulation, high circulating androgen level and period of anovulation. The treatment with resistin to the bat caused increase in androstenedione due to stimulatory effects on 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, but decrease in estradiol level due to inhibitory effect on aromatase. Resistin treatment increased androgen receptor protein together with increased insulin receptor but not through conventional luteinizing hormone receptor and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein mediated pathways. This study further showed that resistin treatment increases androstenedione synthesis and up-regulates insulin receptor in the ovary through STAT3 mediated pathways. These findings suggest that obese women through increased resistin synthesis may causes development of non-ovulatory antral follicles through insulin receptor signaling cascade.

AB  - A religious prosociality stereotype exists such that religiosity and prosociality are presumed to be positively associated, as evidenced by proxy measures such as personality traits. However, studies using self- and peer-ratings of Agreeableness and Conscientiousness have not simultaneously controlled for the religiosity of the participant and the target. One hundred and sixty students completed measures of religiosity in a prescreening survey. Later, participants rated an array of targets, including a Christian and an atheist, on adjectives corresponding to Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Regardless of participant religiosity, atheist targets were rated as being lower in Agreeableness and Conscientiousness relative to those labeled as Christians. This bias was greater for highly religious participants. This effect was mediated by perceptions of the morality of the target independent of participants' broader attitudes concerning the target's religious group. Implications are discussed.

AB  - Men and women who violate traditional expectations with regard to professional status are perceived negatively by others, and can face negative outcomes in the workplace. Here we examine whether these negative perceptions extend to observers' evaluations of status violators' intimate relationships. We employed a fictional scenario depicting a heterosexual married couple, manipulating the professional status of each character while holding all other information constant. Participants (N = 396) projected lower relationship satisfaction onto the husband when he had lower professional status than his wife (nontraditional condition). Participants in this condition also liked and sympathized with the wife less, and perceived her as having more power in the relationship than her husband. Finally, these effects were mediated by ratings of the characters on perceived normative masculinity/femininity. These findings contribute to existing research on the penalties that both male and female gender role violators face, suggesting additional consequences for outsiders' perceptions of their intimate relationships.

AB  - Many studies of intergroup relations have examined the effects of group identity on various types of intergroup cognition and behavior. However, few studies have focused on the perceived group identity of outgroup members. This study examined the effects of perceptions of outgroup identity on anticipated rejection by an outgroup. In Study 1, we administered a questionnaire pertaining to 30 social groups to Japanese undergraduate and vocational students. The collective images and intro-individual processes relating to perceived outgroup identity were investigated by applying correlation analysis and multilevel structural equation modeling. In Study 2, we conducted an experiment in which we manipulated the participants' perceptions of relative levels of outgroup members' identity. Both studies demonstrated, as predicted, that people anticipated rejection by strongly identified outgroup members more than by weakly identified outgroup members. Furthermore, in Study 2, anticipated same-group favoritism mediated the relationship between the manipulation of perceived outgroup identity and anticipated rejection. These findings suggest the important role of perceived outgroup identity in intergroup cognition.

AB  - Members of groups with low societal status can pursue individual upward mobility to improve their status. We examine the conditions under which ingroup and outgroup members are most inclined to support such upward mobility attempts. Whereas both ingroup and outgroup supports are important, there may be tension: dissociation from the low status group may lower ingroup support, whereas association with the low status group may lower outgroup support. Ingroup association can be expressed by communicating one's affective involvement or by behaving in line with typical ingroup practices. As predicted, studies 1 and 2 show that support from the low status ingroup depends more on affective involvement than on behavioral identity expression (BIE). In contrast, studies 3-5 show that support from the high status group is more driven by the upwardly mobile individual's BIE. Mediational analyses show that these opposite patterns are driven by differential processes, prompted by the group's respective positions in the social hierarchy. The findings provide insight into how members of low status groups negotiate the competing demands of the high and low status groups as they pursue upward mobility. Moreover, they show how affective involvement and BIE differentially affect ingroup support and outgroup opposition. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This research explored whether advertisements can insult consumers by underestimating their intelligence. It also posed the question whether advertising that underestimates consumers' intelligence signals that the advertiser has a prejudiced view of its consumers a perception that, then, impacts negatively on consumer perceptions of the brand. Two experimental studies found that consumers, indeed, may find advertising insulting to their intelligence and, consequently, rate such advertising lower. Inferring that the advertiser does not think very highly of their intelligence, consumers expected the offered products to be of lower quality and rated the advertiser lower. The tests extended across three different product categories and ruled out competing explanations.

AB  - This study analyzes the mediating role of social identity in the relationship between enacted stigma and internalized stigma and quality of life of people with HIV.
   A total of 557 people with HIV participated in this study. Participants were recruited from hospitals and non-governmental organizations. Questionnaires measuring perceived stigma (Berger's HIV Stigma Scale), social identity (Cameron's three factor identity scale), and quality of life (Ruiz and Baca's Quality of Life Questionnaire) were administered. The instruments were adapted for use with the Spanish population. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the mediation model, and multigroup SEM was conducted to evaluate its invariance.
   Both enacted stigma and internalized stigma had a negative influence on the quality of life of people with HIV, but this influence occurred in different ways. Enacted stigma had a direct negative influence on quality of life. No dimension of group identity protected people with HIV from its negative influence. However, the negative influence of internalized stigma was totally mediated by some dimensions of group identification, mainly through in-group affect.
   Group identification not only did not protect people with HIV from the negative effects of stigmatization, but it may even be detrimental in the case of internalized stigma. This suggests that in highly stigmatized groups, the salience of identity is negative and worsens the members' opinion of their own group. This argues for different kinds of intervention to improve the quality of life of people with HIV.

AB  - People's concerns about being rejected temper their interest in forming interracial friendships. For Blacks, identity threat can magnify their rejection concerns and reduce friendship interest. The present research explores the role that threat and safety cues play in Blacks' concerns about being rejected by Whites. Prior to an interaction, participants learned information about their partner that was comprised of two safety cues or a safety cue accompanied by a threat cue. In Study 1, Blacks who received both a safety and a threat cue were more concerned about being rejected and were less interested in forming an interracial friendship than Blacks who received only safety cues. Whites were unaffected by these cues. In Study 2, Blacks' perceptions of their interaction partner's warmth mediated the cues' effects on rejection concerns and friendship interest. This research suggests that a single threatening cue can undermine safety cues during interracial interactions.

AB  - This research examines how core consumers of selective brands react when non-core users obtain access to the brand. Contrary to the view that non-core users and downward brand extensions pose a threat to the brand, this work investigates the conditions under which these non-core users enhance rather than dilute the brand image. A distinction between two types of non-core users based on how they are perceived by current users of core products is introduced: "brand immigrants" who claim to be part of the in-group of core users of the brand and "brand tourists" who do not claim any membership status to the brand community. A series of studies show that core consumers respond positively to non-core users when they are perceived as brand tourists. The brand tourism effect is mediated by core users' pride and moderated by brand patriotism and selectiveness of the brand.

AB  - Two mock jury studies investigated whether jurors' religious characteristics relate to verdicts and sentencing decisions. In Study 1, adding religious characteristics to a model with only demographics and authoritarianism increased the model's explanatory power. Scoring high on devotionalism was significantly related to not guilty verdicts; scoring high on fundamentalism was significantly related to guilty verdicts. In both studies, being on a religious quest was significantly related to prodefendant legal decisions. Lawyers can use this information in jury selection. Further, authoritarianism was a mediator of the relationship between some religious variables and legal decisions, helping explain the underlying reasons for such relationships.

AB  - This research examines for the 1st time the effects of relative deprivation and relative gratification, based on social comparison, on implicit and overt forms of discrimination toward the outgroup in a minimal group setting. Study 1 showed that compared to a control condition, relative deprivation and relative gratification enhanced implicit discrimination-measured through variations of linguistic abstraction in intergroup descriptions. Whereas both relative deprivation and relative gratification produced linguistic ingroup favoritism, linguistic productions of relatively deprived groups also conveyed outgroup derogation. Study 2 showed that relatively deprived and relatively gratified groups were overtly discriminatory in intergroup allocations of negative outcomes. The effects of relative deprivation were mediated by perceived intergroup rivalry and, in part, by perceived common fate. Perceived common fate partly accounted for the effects of relative gratification. Study 3 focused on mediators of relative gratification. First, members of relatively gratified (vs. control) groups worried about losing the ingroup advantage, which together worked as sequential mediators of discrimination. Second, relatively gratified groups reported higher existential guilt, which, in turn, was related to expectations of discrimination by the relatively deprived outgroup, and these sequentially mediated the effects of relative gratification. Overall, these studies highlight that both relative deprivation and relative gratification enhance intergroup discrimination and contribute to the understanding of the underlying processes.

AB  - Weaver compared the work attitudes of Mexican Americans and Euro-Americans with data from 19 nationwide public opinion surveys. He found Mexican Americans productive, cooperative, and networking with a strong sense of work ethic and job satisfaction. Since 2000, the Mexican American population has grown by 57% to 32.9 million. It is more native born, more proficient in English, better educated, more often in important jobs, and has spread across the country. Yet, many live in poverty, and their labor force participation and median household income have declined. To investigate whether their work attitudes have been affected, Weaver's study was replicated with data from three recent nationwide public opinion surveys to compare 326 Mexican Americans and 2,166 Euro-Americans. The results showed Mexican American work attitudes had become even more favorable. The findings placed beyond doubt the question of whether the work attitudes of Mexican Americans limit their contributions to organizational effectiveness.

AB  - Background: Stigma and discrimination against people with mental illness remain barriers to help seeking and full recovery for people in need of mental health services. Yet there is scarce research investigating the experiences of psychiatric stigma on mental health service users in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The aim of this study was therefore to explore the experiences of psychiatric stigma by service users in order to inform interventions to reduce such stigma and discrimination in one LMIC, namely South Africa.
   Methods: Participants comprised a total of 77 adults aged above 18 years, made up of service providers including professional nurses (10), lay counsellors (20), auxiliary social workers (2); and service users (45).
   Results: Psychiatric stigma was found to be perpetuated by family members, friends, employers, community members and health care providers. Causes of psychiatric stigma identified included misconceptions about mental illness often leading to delays in help-seeking. Experiencing psychiatric stigma was reported to worsen the health of service users and impede their capacity to lead and recover a normal life.
   Conclusion: Media campaigns and interventions to reduce stigma should be designed to address specific stigmatizing behaviours among specific segments of the population. Counselling of families, caregivers and service users should include how to deal with experienced and internalized stigma.

AB  - From an intergroup relations perspective, relative group size is associated with the quantity and quality of intergroup contact: more positive contact (i.e., intergroup friendship) supports, and negative contact (i.e., experienced discrimination) hampers, minority identity, and school success. Accordingly, we examined intergroup contact as the process through which perceived relative proportions of minority and majority students in school affected minority success (i.e., school performance, satisfaction, and self-efficacy). Turkish minorities (N = 1,060) were compared in four Austrian and Belgian cities which differ in their typical school ethnic composition. Across cities, minority experiences of intergroup contact fully mediated the impact of perceived relative group size on school success. As expected, higher minority presence impaired school success through restricting intergroup friendship and increasing experienced discrimination. The association between minority presence and discrimination was curvilinear, however, so that schools where minority students predominated offered some protection from discrimination. To conclude, the comparative findings reveal positive and negative intergroup contact as key processes that jointly explain when and how higher proportions of minority students affect school success.

AB  - While arguably central to the human experience, religion is a largely understudied component of social life and of politics. The comparative literature on religion and politics is limited in scope, and offers mostly descriptions of trends. We know, for example, that restrictions on freedom of religion are on the rise worldwide. In our theoretical framework, the recently higher universal levels of globalization combine with other sources of threat to account for the trend away from religious freedom. As threat to the majority religion increases, due to globalization and an increasing number of minority religions, freedom of religion is on the decline. Data for two decades from 147 nations are used to test hypotheses. Time-series cross-sectional and mediation models estimated at different levels of analysis with data from two independent sources confirm that threat systematically accounts for changes in religious freedom, with globalization playing a key role.

AB  - This study examines the relation of dimensions of ethnocentrism with socio-structural factors such as socioeconomic status (SES), feelings of anomie, and authoritarianism. Using clustered sampling, 500 students were selected from ten high schools in Ahvaz, Iran. Results of structural equation modeling showed that SES has a direct positive effect on ethnocentrism and an indirect effect through anomie and authoritarianism. Similarly, anomie mediates the effect of SES on authoritarianism. Anomie was found to have an indirect effect on dimensions of ethnocentrism via authoritarianism. Findings confirmed the proposed conceptual path model, which is consistent with findings from other countries. The influence of feelings of anomie in the model is highlighted since it has a very important effect on dimensions of ethnocentrism.

AB  - Aim. Lumbar disc herniation associated with back pain is often related to disc degeneration. Back pain after microdiscectomy often persists, prejudicing clinical outcome and quality of life. To this day, the evolution of disc degeneration after classical microdiscectomy has never been proven. Percutaneous dynamic stabilization after microdiscectomy has been proposed as a novel surgical strategy for treatment of back pain with herniated disc. However, clinical results are still debated and no evidences about the long-term evolution of back pain and relationships between neuroradiological imaging and clinical outcome have been provided. We report our preliminary observations concerning the clinical and neuroradiological outcome of 11 patients treated with microdiscectomy and dynamic percutaneous lumbo-sacral stabilization, after a long-term follow-up (2-years).
   Methods. This was an uncontrolled case series. The study included 11 patients (3 F, 8 M) with L5-S1 discal herniation and degeneration underwent microdiscectomy and percutaneous dynamic stabilization, from December 2008 to November 2009. All the patients were symptomatic with back and leg pain non-responsive to long-term (8-12 months) medical and physical treatments. VAS and Satisfaction Index were used, respectively, for evaluation of clinical outcome and general postoperative patients' satisfaction. Modic and Pfirrmann scores were used for evaluation of neuroradiological outcome. All the patients underwent to microdiscectomy and implantation of the same percutaneous device for dynamic stabilization of the middle vertebral column during the same surgery. Modic, Pfirrmann, VAS and Satisfaction Index scores were collected before surgery and over the follow-up (45 days, 1 and 2 years). MRI and dynamic X-Ray 2 years after surgery were compared to the preoperative imaging.
   Results. Motion preservation at the functional spinal unit after surgery was demonstrated in all the cases. All patients reported a reduction or complete resolution of back and leg pain, they were satisfied and came back to normal socio-professional life. No modification of the preoperative Pfirrmann was observed, even in those patients who experienced restoration of back pain. No surgical complications nor device failures were reported.
   Conclusion. Percutaneous minimally invasive lumbosacral dynamic stabilization after microdiscectomy seems a reliable and effective technique in order to obtain a resolution of back pain and seems to prevent the Pfirrmann worsening, over a long-term follow-up.

AB  - What strategies do Tea Party movement organizers use to achieve frame alignment, that is, uniformity of grievance, purpose, and action, with their participants? Evidence to answer this question is gathered from a year-length participant-observation case study of one city-based Tea Party organization, primarily through the meetings of its localized grassroots chapters. Principal findings are that Tea Party organizers employ quality control of off-message grievances, for example, abortion, as well as any action or communication that would or could be perceived as racially prejudicial, or otherwise inflammatory. Formally, these findings demonstrate the influence of organizational hierarchy on grassroots practice. Substantively, they demonstrate the complex relationship between a broader conservative ideological repertoire as empirically deployed by participants, and the more focused frame alignment attempts of a particular social movement organization. In short, the findings elucidate the importance of interaction and organizational structure as they influence social movement messaging and action.

AB  - Responding to Jackson and Joshi's (2011) call for specific models of the effects of particular diversity types and against the backdrop of the rising desire for the public expression of religious identities in the workplace (Hicks, 2003), we develop a framework that systematically explores when and how the expression of diverse religious identities induces relational conflicts in organizational units. In developing this framework, we integrate the respective literatures on religion studies (e.g. Hicks, 2003), identity-disclosure (e.g. Ragins, 2008) and diversity within organizational groups (Jackson and Joshi, 2011). Our framework specifies three paths whereby the public expression of diverse religious identities can engender relational conflicts. As mediators, we discuss perceivers' attribution of proselytism and religious discrimination, as well as identity threats. Moreover, we examine the moderating roles of actors' and perceivers' religious fundamentalism, perceivers' religious identity salience and minority members' attribution of majority members' religious hegemonial claims. At the theoretical level, we delineate particularities of religious identity diversity that distinguish this diversity type from other deep-level diversity attributes. Concerning practical implications, we argue that it is important to not only foster self-expression, but also to be cognizant of the risks that the public expression of religious identities entails.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine whether providing information about the lifestyle changes required for an individual to lose weight following bariatric surgery would mitigate the negative judgments of that individual.
   Methods: In an experimental design, participants provided their initial impressions of a woman with obesity before learning that she had lost a significant amount of weight through: (1) diet/exercise, (2) surgery, or (3) surgery + diet/exercise. Participants then provided their impressions of the woman after she had lost weight.
   Results: For ratings of laziness, competence, and responsibility for weight loss, the individual who lost weight through surgery was rated most negatively, followed by the individual who lost weight through surgery+diet/exercise, with the individual who lost weight through diet/exercise alone rated as least lazy, most competent, and most responsible for her weight loss. Mediation analyses further showed that group differences in target ratings of laziness/competence were due to perceptions of responsibility for weight loss.
   Conclusions: Providing information about the lifestyle changes required for losing weight following bariatric surgery can somewhat dampen the negative evaluations of surgery patients. These findings also highlight the importance of perceived effort in judgments of individuals with obesity.

AB  - Psychological research has made significant advancements in the study of stigma but has tended to focus on individual and interpersonal stigma processes. Recently, researchers have expanded the stigma construct to consider how broader, macrosocial forms of stigma-termed structural stigma-also disadvantage stigmatized individuals. In this article, I review cross-sectional, quasi-experimental, and longitudinal studies demonstrating that structural stigma is a risk indicator for psychiatric and physical-health morbidities among lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations. As this work is still in its infancy, the next generation of research will benefit from identifying mediators and moderators of the structural stigma-health association and from examining direct and synergistic relationships between structural and individual forms of stigma.

AB  - Thirty three healthy, New Zealand rabbits, underwent a total gastrectomy via laparotomy and subsequent evaluation of gastric dimensions. Were measured the lengths of the lesser and greater gastric curvature, in addition to the largest diameters of the organ. They presented average overall length of the lesser and greater curvature, respectively 6.7 cm and 27.3 cm. In addition, open surgical specimen presented a total area of 172.6 cm(2). The sample was divided into two groups by age to perform comparisons between weight and stomach measures. Group 1 consisted of animals with age equal or less than 138 days and group 2 those with more than 138 days. No significant differences were found between the groups. This may suggest the use of younger animals to perform experiments related to surgical training involving the stomach, without dimensional prejudice of organ or generation of technical difficulties. Finally, it was noted also the predominance of the left gastric artery in the irrigation of the gastric wall and the presence of a transparent film between the liver and stomach in all animals.

AB  - This study set out to examine native Dutch adolescents' tolerance (N = 1,139) of Muslim immigrants in relation to the endorsement of assimilation, national identification, and contact with ethnic minority peers. The focus was on two dimensions of tolerance: the acceptance of practices by Muslim actors, and Muslims persuading co-believers to engage in the same practices. Tolerance was found to be higher for the practices than for persuading others. Higher endorsement of assimilation was related to lower levels of tolerance, and this relation was stronger for higher compared to lower national identifiers. Assimilation mediated the positive relationship between intergroup contact and tolerance. These effects did not differ for the two dimensions of tolerance. The implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Novels from the 18th and 19th centuries have powerfully shaped modern conceptions of marriage and family life. With the development of the British realist novel, the courtship and marriage plot took on a new cultural prominence that "naturalized" a deeply cultural institution and normalized a particular set of heterosexual gender roles. The cultural significance of these novels can be measured by their reverberations in contemporary popular culture and their impact on modern life stories. Jane Austen's (1813/2002) Pride and Prejudice and Helen Fielding's (1996) popular adaptation of Austen's novel, Bridget Jones's Diary, offer family theorists and researchers a case study on the influence of canonical plot structures on modern stories about marriage.

AB  - Elementary school-age children (N = 137, 70 boys, ages 4-10) were randomly assigned to receive one of two types of lessons aimed at increasing the inclusiveness of peer relations and improving children's ability to identify bias in media. Children in the pro-social condition were taught to identify and respond to undesirable/unfair social behaviors (e.g., teasing), whereas children in the pro-egalitarian condition were taught to respond to these same behaviors, with additional attention to gender bias (e.g., teasing about gender role nonconformity). After five lessons, children completed immediate and 6-month delayed measures of egalitarian attitudes, intergroup liking, responses to hypothetical peers' sexist remarks, and ability to identify sexism in media. The lessons did not differentially affect children's gender egalitarian attitudes and intergroup liking. As expected, however, children in the pro-egalitarian condition were better able to identify sexism in media and to respond to peers' sexist comments than were children in the pro-social condition.

AB  - The present research investigated the relationship between socio-structural characteristics of intergroup differences, identity concealment, and self-esteem in members of a stigmatized minority group. Structural equation modeling of survey responses collected at a convention showed that socio-structural characteristics interact to predict concealment strategies as a way of managing perceived stigma. Perceived permeability of intergroup boundaries predicted increased endorsement of concealment, moderated by the legitimacy and stability of intergroup status differences. Interacting socio-structural characteristics also predicted self-esteem, an effect mediated by identity concealment. The results illustrate that socio-structural characteristics can help predict stigmatized minority group members' endorsement of identity concealment despite its potentially maladaptive effects.

AB  - Previous research has indicated that females are more likely than males to endorse collectivistic values and religious conservatism. The present research investigated an evolutionary explanation for these sex differences. More specifically, the sex differences in social conservatism may be due to variation in the behavioral immune system (BIS). The BIS is a set of psychological mechanisms that are proposed to be evolved solutions to disease threat. Four studies were conducted to examine this evolutionary explanation. In Study 1, BIS measures (e.g., disgust sensitivity) fully mediated sex differences in collectivism. This effect was specific to sexual disgust (Study 2). In Studies 3 and 4, the effect was extended to other forms of social conservatism (i.e., religious conservatism) and measures of the BIS. Together, these results suggest that sex differences in collectivism and religious conservatism may be explained in part by sex differences in the BIS.

AB  - Research with adults has demonstrated a "black sheep effect" (BSE) whereby, relative to evaluations of normative group members, ingroup deviants are derogated more than outgroup deviants. The developmental subjective group dynamics (DSGD) model holds that the BSE should develop during middle childhood when children apply wider social norms. Three hundred and thirty-eight children who were between 5 and 12 years old judged a normative (socially desirable) and a deviant (socially undesirable) member from an ingroup or an outgroup school. Results confirmed a developmental increase in the BSE, the first time this has been demonstrated. Children's own evaluations of group members were mediated by their expectations about ingroup peers' evaluations. In line with DSGD and social domain theories, with age, children's explanations of peer evaluations for ingroup deviance focused relatively more on loyalty. Practical and theoretical implications for peer inclusion and exclusion are discussed.

AB  - Drawing on evidence from a case study of a racially transitioning suburb of Chicago, we argue that both blacks and whites discursively form, maintain, protect, and navigate contradictory class and racial identities. The interactions between race and class are complex, but how do these complexities manifest themselves? We contend that racial groups utilize discursive storytelling to maintain boundaries, and that this is one of the ways in which racial and class inequalities are created and preserved. Furthermore, we explore the interworking of race and class, focusing on how class location helps mediate self-proclaimed middle class blacks' and whites' discourse on stigmatized forms of blackness. We conclude with a discussion of the sociological implications of this boundary maintenance, focusing on the ways in which whites and blacks in the middle class utilize various forms of capital to preserve status and power.

AB  - We sought to examine the fluidity of ethnic identification and test shared reality's hypothesis concerning the effects of interpersonal relationships on ethnic identification. To investigate the effects of ethnicity of spouse on ethnic identification, Asian-American women (66 from same-ethnicity marriages, 46 from mixed-ethnicity marriages) completed several measures of ethnic identification after thinking about positive aspects of their relationship with either their spouse or their mother. Women in same-ethnicity marriages reported equivalent levels of ethnic identification whether they thought about their mother or their spouse. Women in mixed-ethnicity marriages reported lower ethnic identification when they thought about their different-ethnicity spouse; but when thinking about their mother, they reported high ethnic identification equivalent to the levels reported by women in same-ethnicity marriages. Mediational analyses revealed that, consistent with shared reality theory, shared understanding of one's ethnic identity with one's spouse partially mediated the relationship between same- and different-ethnicity spouses and ethnic identification. Implications for theories of ethnic identity and for individuals in mixed-ethnicity romantic relationships are discussed.

AB  - Although stereotype awareness is a prerequisite for stereotype threat effects (Steele & Aronson, 1995), research showed girls' deficit under stereotype threat before the emergence of math-gender stereotype awareness, and in the absence of stereotype endorsement. In a study including 240 six-year-old children, this paradox was addressed by testing whether automatic associations trigger stereotype threat in young girls. Whereas no indicators were found that children endorsed the math-gender stereotype, girls, but not boys, showed automatic associations consistent with the stereotype. Moreover, results showed that girls' automatic associations varied as a function of a manipulation regarding the stereotype content. Importantly, girls' math performance decreased in a stereotype-consistent, relative to a stereotype-inconsistent, condition and automatic associations mediated the relation between stereotype threat and performance.

AB  - Chronic glucocorticoid therapy is associated with reduced bone mineral density. In paediatric patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, increased levels of androgens could not only counteract this effect, but could also advance bone age, with interference in the evaluation of densitometry. We evaluate bone mineral density in paediatric patients with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia taking into account chronological and bone ages at the time of the measurement. Patients aged between 5 and 19 years underwent radiography of the hand and wrist followed by total body and lumbar spine densitometry. Chronological and bone ages were used in the scans interpretation. In fourteen patients, mean bone mineral density Z-score of total body to bone age was -0.76 and of lumbar spine to bone age was -0.26, lower than those related to chronological age (+0.03 and +0.62, resp.). Mean Z-score differences were statistically significant (P = 0.004 for total body and P = 0.003 for lumbar spine). One patient was classified as having low bone mineral density only when assessed by bone age. We conclude that there was a reduction in the bone mineral density Z-score in classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia paediatric patients when bone age was taken into account instead of chronological age.

AB  - Our study aims to explore determinants and mechanisms that support affirmative action programs (AAPs). Managing the programs and enhancing women's well-being in organizational life requires knowledge about support for AAPs. Although many studies have examined attitudes toward these, they have confined their scope of research to their particular theoretical disciplines. Our study analyzes the impact of four primary factors. gender, political factors, psychological factors, and social structure on support for the programs. These in turn consist of eight variables, as we shall see, and we examine the varieties of causal mechanisms that are concerned with moderation and mediation, as well as the causal relationships within the variables. Our findings suggest that the four factors have comparative strengths in explaining support for AAPs and have moderating, mediating, and causal impact on them.

AB  - This paper reports on the occurrence of ergot alkaloids in cereals and cereal products in Europe. It includes occurrence data our group previously submitted to the European Food Safety Authority and new data we gathered afterwards. A total of 1,065 samples of cereals and cereal products intended for human consumption and animal feeding were analysed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for the presence of ergot alkaloids. The sample set included rye-, wheat- and multigrain-based food as well as rye-, wheat- and triticale-based feed. The study revealed that 59% of the analysed food and feed samples were contaminated with ergot alkaloids to some extent. In 55% of the samples, the levels of the -ine isomers were above the limit of quantification (LOQ), while contamination with the -inine isomers was found in 51% of the samples. The median values for the main ergot alkaloids (-ine forms) and the epimers (-inine forms) were 1 and 2 mu g/kg, respectively. Ergot alkaloids were present in 84% of rye food, 67% of wheat food, 48% of multigrain food, 52% of rye feed, 27% of wheat feed, and 44% of triticale feed at total alkaloid levels ranging from (LOQ) to 12,340 mu g/kg. Though the highest frequencies of contamination were observed for food samples, the feed samples, in particular Swiss rye feed, accounted for the highest levels of ergot alkaloids. The frequencies and levels of contamination were significantly lower in organic samples compared to conventional samples. Maximum levels of individual ergot alkaloids up to 3,270 mu g/kg (for ergotamine) were observed. Overall, ergosine, ergokryptine and ergocristine were the frequently occurring ergot alkaloids. The co-occurrence of all six ergot alkaloids was noted in 35% of the positive samples. Occurrence of a single ergot alkaloid was mainly observed for ergometrine.

AB  - Sexist comments are not perceived equally in the eyes of women. We extend previous research by examining the degree to which multiple types of potentially sexist comments made by multiple types of men are perceived as sexist. Further, we examine the degree to which three possible mediators-prototypicality, perceived intent, and interdependence-explained these effects. Female undergraduate students (N = 248) were randomly assigned to read a scenario in which a hostile sexist, benevolent sexist, or objectifying comment was made by one of three types of men: a stranger, their boss, or their boyfriend. Results demonstrate that hostile sexism was perceived as more sexist than benevolent sexism or objectification. Comments made by boyfriends were also rated as less sexist than those made by bosses or strangers. Furthermore, perceptions of prototypicality of the comment or perpetrator and perceived intent to harm mediated the effect of study manipulations on perceptions of sexism.

AB  - In three studies we examined the importance of cultural continuity for attitudes towards Muslim immigrants. Study 1 showed that perceiving national culture to be temporally enduring predicted opposition to Muslim expressive rights, and this effect was mediated by perceptions of continuity threat. Studies 2 (survey) and 3 (experiment), examined whether attitudes towards Muslim immigrants are dependent on the specific content of cultural continuity. Study 2 showed that a stronger perception of religious tolerant continuity was associated with lower opposition to Muslims, via reduced levels of continuity threat, whereas a Christian continuity representation was associated with higher continuity threat and more opposition. In Study 3, the causal effect of religious tolerant continuity was the same, but the salience of Christian continuity only resulted in more opposition to Muslims among younger adults. Together, these findings illustrate the importance of perceptions and representations of cultural continuity for the understanding of current intergroup dynamics.

AB  - In four studies, we investigated the effects of power on retributive justice judgments (i.e., the severity of punishment that people consider being fair). In Study 1, results revealed that participants who were primed with high power recommended more severe punishment than participants who were primed with low power, but only when the offender possessed negative character traits. In Study 2, these effects were replicated in an applied setting. In Study 3, we found that the inclination of power holders to base retributive justice judgments on negative traits only materialized when the power position was acquired legitimately. In Study 4, no trait information was given. Power again increased punishment, and this effect was mediated by trait appraisal ratings. It is concluded that legitimate power holders are more punitive due to their tendency to base retributive justice judgments on information or assumptions of negative traits that are stereotypically associated with offenders.

AB  - This longitudinal experiment addresses a critical gap in the intergroup relations literature by showing that the theory-driven nine-week dual identity E-contact (DIEC) intervention is successful in maintaining a reduction in intergroup bias twelve months post-intervention. Here, 92 Muslim and 96 Christian students completed measures of affective intergroup bias, intergroup anxiety, and outgroup knowledge twelve months after completing either the DIEC or control program. In line with predictions, these main effect analyses revealed that the affective intergroup bias reduction observed among DIEC participants, compared to control participants at two weeks post-intervention was maintained at twelve months post-intervention. Additional analyses investigating religious group differences revealed however that this bias reduction was confined to Muslim DIEC students only. Finally, outgroup friendship was found to continue to moderate, and intergroup anxiety continue to mediate, the effects of the DIEC program on intergroup bias reduction for Muslim students - even with a twelve month absence of cooperative intergroup contact or dual identity curricula. This final and significant piece of empirical information is definitive in addressing the dearth of long-term intergroup bias reduction literature. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In addition to their hypotensive properties, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to exert clinical antidyslipidemic effects. The mechanism underlying these ARB lipid metabolic effects remains unclear. Some ARBs, for example, telmisartan, activate peroxisome proliferator-activated activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma). We hypothesized that PPAR-gamma- activating ARBs might exert antidyslipidemic effects via PPAR-alpha. In this study, we assessed the effect of telmisartan on the expression of PPAR-alpha and lipoprotein lipase (LPL). PPAR-alpha expression was detected by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot in HepG2 hepatocytes as well as differentiated C2C12 myocytes treated with increasing concentrations of telmisartan (0.1-10 mu mol/L) for 48 h. Results showed that 1 mu mol/L and 10 mu mol/L telmisartan significantly increased the expression of PPAR-alpha mRNA and protein in HepG2 cells (p<0.01). No effect was shown in differentiated C2C12 cells. Similarly, 1 mu mol/L and 10 mu mol/L telmisartan significantly increased the expression of LPL mRNA and protein in HepG2 cells (p<0.01), and this increase was significantly (p<0.01) inhibited by the PPAR-alpha-specific antagonist MK886. These results indicate that certain of the antidyslipidemic effects of telmisartan might be mediated via increased PPAR-alpha-dependent induction of LPL expression.

AB  - This study investigated religious stress, gay-related stress, sexual identity, and mental health outcomes in lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) adolescents and emerging adults. The model examined negative LGB identity as a mediator of the relationships between (1) religious stress and mental health, and (2) gay-related stress and mental health. The data indicated that negative LGB identity fully accounted for both relationships. Findings suggest that a negative sense of sexual identity for LGB youth helps explain the links between religious and gay-related stressors and mental health. As LGB youth may have limited control over these stressors, the importance of helping LGB youth maintain a positive LGB identity, despite homonegative messages from others, is discussed.

AB  - A growing body of research shows that perceived community disorder is not solely driven by crime, but is influenced by the community's social cohesion and ethnic composition. Drawing on two waves of survey data from 2509 and 2651 individuals in Wave 1 and Wave 2 respectively, living in 71 communities in Brisbane Australia, we examine changes in ethnic composition over two time periods and how these changes influence perceived neighbourhood disorder. We also test whether or not social cohesion mediates these associations. Our findings indicate that high proportions of Indigenous residents and high levels of reported crime averaged across time are associated with greater perceived disorder. Whereas increases in household income over time are associated with lower perceived disorder. We also find that social cohesion is strongly associated with perceived disorder over time, but does not mediate the relationship between the racial and ethnic composition of the community and disorder. Yet when a community's social cohesion is considered, the effect of increasing household income becomes non-significant.

AB  - I use data from the 2004 General Social Survey (N=719) and multivariate analyses to: explore the effects of race on attitudes toward Muslims; evaluate the extent to which the racial differences were mediated by psychological and religious factors; and assess whether the race effects differed significantly by gender. The findings show that blacks report significantly more favourable feelings toward Muslims than whites. Those respondents who are female, more educated and Catholic also hold significantly higher scores on the 100-point scale assessing feelings toward Muslims. After controlling for religious and psychological factors, I find that the racial difference in feelings toward Muslims is increased, indicating that the race effect is suppressed by these factors. Moderation analysis reveals that white men hold the highest level of negative feelings toward Muslims, compared to women and black men. The findings suggest challenging the misconstrued perceptions of Muslims through education and endorsement of positive images.

AB  - We examine how viewers' narrative involvement is impacted by a character's membership in a highly stigmatized group. In particular, we explore how perspective-taking with a character, a dimension of the identification construct (J. Cohen, 2001), influences in-group/out-group perception. Participants viewed 1 of 2 edited versions of the film Sherrybaby, where the main character was manipulated to be relatively more stigmatized (recovering drug addict) or less stigmatized (single mother). As predicted, participants differed with respect to perspective-takingthe highly stigmatized character corresponded to less perspective-taking. Furthermore, the mediation and moderation results lend support to the argument that perspective-taking increases perceptions of in-group belonging and is of particular importance in determining whether a narrative influences in-group/out-group perspectives.

AB  - Does accountability (the expectation that one will be called on to justify one's beliefs or actions to others) attenuate or amplify stereotyping? The authors hypothesized that the effect of accountability on stereotype use in impression formation depends on perceivers' implicit theory (entity versus incremental). The authors assessed the effects of accountability and implicit theories on participants' impression of the target (Studies 1 and 2), attention to the target's stereotype-consistent versus -inconsistent behavior (Study 1), and sense of being entitled to judge the target (Study 2). In both studies, accountability amplified the stereotypicality of entity theorists' impressions but, if anything, attenuated the stereotypicality of incremental theorists' impressions. Moreover, in Study 1, the more attention accountable entity (but not incremental) theorists paid to counterstereotypic information, the more stereotype-driven were their impressions. In Study 2, for entity theorists but not incremental theorists, perceived judgeability mediated the relationship between accountability and stereotypicality of judgment.

AB  - This study addressed racial differences in perceived masculinity, defined as people's perceptions about how masculine a group of people is. College students (N = 250; the majority were White American women) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions to provide their reactions to 1 of the following target groups: Asian American men, Black American men, or White American men. Participants perceived Asian American men as less masculine than Black and White American men and Black American men as the most masculine group. A qualitative analysis of participants' open-ended responses concerning their stereotypes of the 3 target groups of men identified the following stereotypes categories: interpersonal qualities, physical attributes, physical/athletic abilities, aggression, professional success, diligence, musical abilities, foreigner, normalcy, discrimination, and sexual/romantic abilities. In addition, participants' endorsement of 8 of these 11 stereotypes varied as a function of the target group's race. Stereotypes about men's physical attributes and physical/athletic abilities mediated racial differences in perceived masculinity. Moreover, a moderation analysis showed that racial differences in perceived masculinity were most pronounced among participants with high levels of racial essentialist beliefs. Finally, a mediated moderation analysis indicated that the link between the condition by racial essentialist beliefs interaction effect and perceived masculinity was mediated through its association with stereotypes concerning physical/athletic abilities. Implications of these findings for the psychology of men of color are discussed.

AB  - Using illustrations from the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s and their aftermath, Baker argues that understanding popular music and public discourses about it can help to understand the dynamics of ethnopolitical conflict. Studies of war and conflict have approached music as political communication, as an object of securitization, as a means of violence and as a symbol of ethnic difference, while international law in the context of another case of collective violence, Rwanda, has even begun to question whether performing or broadcasting certain music could constitute incitement to genocide. Drawing on poststructuralist perspectives on the media and ethnicization in conflicts, Baker explores and interrogates the discourse of popular music as a weapon of war that was in use during and after the violent break-up of Yugoslavia. Music during the Yugoslav wars was used as a tool of humiliation and violence in prison camps, and to provoke fear of the ethnic Other in line with a strategy of ethnic cleansing; it was also conceptualized as a morale-booster for the troops of one's own side. A discourse of music as a weapon of war was also in use and persisted after the war, when its referent was shifted to associate music-as-a-weapon not to the brave and defiant ingroup so much as the aggressive Other. This was then turned against a wider range of signifiers than those who had directly supported the Other's troops and had the effect of perpetuating ethnic separation and obstructing the reformation of a (post-)Yugoslav cultural space. Despite evidence that music did serve as an instrument of violence in the Yugoslav wars (and the precedent of the Bikindi indictment in Rwanda), Baker concludes that music should be integrated into understandings of ethnopolitical conflict not through a framework of incitement and complicity but with respect for the significance of music in the everyday.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to examine the relationship between socioeconomic status, parental control, and authoritarianism in Iran. A sample of 460 students was surveyed from Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz in Iran. Results demonstrated that subjective socioeconomic status, parental control, and parents' education have significant influence on authoritarianism. Further analysis showed that parental control partially mediates parents' education association with authoritarianism with a relatively high effect size. These findings highlight the importance of parental control and socioeconomic status in the development of authoritarianism in Iran. Furthermore, the higher authoritarianism of low socioeconomic status is mostly due to lower education levels rather than the income of the family. The findings were discussed with regards to literature as well as the socio-cultural sphere of Iran.

AB  - We examined how immigrants' acculturation style (multiculturalism versus assimilation) affects the host society's willingness to help immigrants. The results from this experiment supported our expectations in showing that multiculturalism triggered less immigrant helping than assimilation, but only among high national identifiers. In addition, immigrants pursuing multiculturalism were perceived as less warm than those pursuing assimilation, and perceived warmth mediated the interaction effect of identification and acculturation style on helping. Whereas help could improve immigrants' integration into the host society and reduce the degree to which the latter views immigrants as threatening, these results ironically demonstrate that immigrants who are viewed as most threatening receive the least amount of help.

AB  - In this paper, intergroup contact was evaluated as a strategy to favor outgroup humanization. We tested a double-mediation model, in which contact is associated with both decreased salience of intergroup boundaries and the adoption of a common identity. These recategorizations, in turn, are related to lower levels of anxiety and higher levels of empathy, both emotions being proximal predictors of outgroup humanization. The model was tested using structural equation modeling in the context of different intergroup relations: Italians versus immigrants (Study 1); Northern Italians versus Southern Italians (Study 2). Supporting the hypotheses, group representations and emotions mediated the relationship between contact and humanity attributions. The practical implications of results are discussed.

AB  - Preovulatory follicle dynamics and plasma oestradiol around the time of onset of oestrus as well as ovulation rate were assessed, during non-breeding season, in prolific (W; n =20) and non prolific (AB; n = 20) strains of the Barbarine sheep. Oestrus cycles were synchronized with progestagen sponges for 14 days followed by introduction of rams. Transrectal ultrasonographic monitoring of the ovaries was carried out from the day of pessaries removal up to oestrous exhibition. Blood samples were collected every 4 h and were analyzed for plasma concentrations of oestradiol by radioimmunoassay. Laparoscopy was performed 11 days after introduction of rams to assess number of corpora lutea (CL). Results indicate that along the first 5 days after introduction of rams, 20 and 14 ewes of respectively the AB and W ewes exhibited oestrus (P < 0.01). Ewes of the W strain had more medium (3.5-5.4 mm) follicles than AB ones during the follicular phase; the difference being significant (P < 0.01) 24 h before oestrus. The number of medium follicles prior to oestrus changed little in AB ewes but declined rapidly from 5.8 +/- 0.7 to 4.0 +/- 0.6 in W females (P < 0.05). Differences in medium follicles between strains were not reflected in the number of large (>= 5.5 mm) or the growing large follicles during the follicular phase. Around oestrus, plasma oestradiol concentrations were higher for Win comparison to AB ewes (22.3 +/- 12.6 vs. 11.8 +/- 6.2 pg/ml; P < 0.01) and mean ovulation rates were 1.8 +/- 0.8 and 1.1 +/- 0.3 for respectively W and AB ewes (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the increased ovulation rate in the W strain is related to an extended period of follicle recruitment with appearance of co-dominance effects. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Because of their meritocratic ideology, Western countries might promote the belief that every individual is responsible for his or her socioeconomic position. These beliefs might enhance discrimination which, in turn, might affect health. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the role of perceived discrimination within income-related health inequalities.
   Two-year follow-up data (2008-2010) from the Dutch Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social sciences panel (N = 2,139) were used to examine the relation between income, perceived discrimination, and self-rated health and feeling hindered by health problems.
   Results showed that poor health was more prevalent in the low income and in the discriminated group. Participants from the low income group were also more likely to perceive discrimination (OR = 1.57, 95 % CI = 1.03-2.42). However, there was no substantial evidence for a mediating effect of perceived discrimination on the income-health association.
   The results emphasise the importance of a more in-depth study of discrimination in relation to socioeconomic health inequalities. Since ethnicity was a major confounder, it is recommended to take account of the complex interplay between discrimination and both the socioeconomic and ethnic background.

AB  - Past research suggests that people identify with positively evaluated groups. However, some in-groups may be evaluated highly yet identification may be hampered by social norms prohibiting in-group pride. Social norms may stem in part from in-group history. In Study 1, Germans rated their nation more highly on quality-of-life dimensions, yet identified with their country less than Americans. Social norms about the perceived appropriateness of in-group pride mediated differences in cross-national identification (Study 2). Moreover, people high in conformity were most strongly influenced by social norms about national pride. One antecedent of national pride norms was the perceived in-group's history: Focus on positive historical events increased the perception of national identification as appropriate, compared to a focus on negative historical events (Study 3).

AB  - Despite the prevalence of ageism in the workplace, little empirical effort has been devoted to analysing the contextual factors that may help reduce it. Building upon research on intergroup contact and multiculturalism, we examine in two studies how intergenerational contact and organizational multi-age perspective may contribute toward mitigating ageism and improving work attitudes through a dual identity process. In Study 1, SEM analyses confirm that workers' dual identity is a key mediator of the effects of context on both ageism and attitudes at work. Study 2 replicates and extends the results of Study 1, firstly by showing the mediational effects of perceived procedural justice, and secondly by investigating stereotypes more closely related to the population of older workers. As a set, our findings shed new light on ageism at work as well as on the protective role of two aspects of the social context.

AB  - Past research suggested that the strong relationship between having high levels of religiosity and/or political conservatism and harboring a high level of negativity toward homosexuals often is accounted for by the strength of individuals' authoritarian views. In an effort to build upon this extant research, the goal of this study was to examine the way in which components of authoritarianism mediate the relationship between religiosity and political conservatism and homonegativity. To achieve this goal, a recently developed modality of path analysis that allows for the effect of one independent variable on another to be controlled was used. Because preliminary analyses indicated that attitudes toward same-sex marriage and homonegativity demonstrated multicollinearity, a composite measure was created. Results suggested that the overall strength of the relationship between religiosity and political conservatism with homonegativity remains statistically significant, even after accounting for three components of authoritarianism and the potential effect of social desirability. These authoritarianism components also had a significant indirect effect on the strength of the relationship between religiosity and homonegativity, with authoritarian submission and conventionalism fully mediating this relationship. Implications of these findings were discussed.

AB  - According to a "parasite stress" hypothesis, authoritarian governments are more likely to emerge in regions characterized by a high prevalence of disease-causing pathogens. Recent cross-national evidence is consistent with this hypothesis, but there are inferential limitations associated with that evidence. We report two studies that address some of these limitations, and provide further tests of the hypothesis. Study 1 revealed that parasite prevalence strongly predicted cross-national differences on measures assessing individuals' authoritarian personalities, and this effect statistically mediated the relationship between parasite prevalence and authoritarian governance. The mediation result is inconsistent with an alternative explanation for previous findings. To address further limitations associated with cross-national comparisons, Study 2 tested the parasite stress hypothesis on a sample of traditional small-scale societies (the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample). Results revealed that parasite prevalence predicted measures of authoritarian governance, and did so even when statistically controlling for other threats to human welfare. (One additional threat-famine-also uniquely predicted authoritarianism.) Together, these results further substantiate the parasite stress hypothesis of authoritarianism, and suggest that societal differences in authoritarian governance result, in part, from cultural differences in individuals' authoritarian personalities.

AB  - Six studies explored the overlap between racial and gender stereotypes, and the consequences of this overlap for interracial dating, leadership selection, and athletic participation. Two initial studies captured the explicit and implicit gender content of racial stereotypes: Compared with the White stereotype, the Asian stereotype was more feminine, whereas the Black stereotype was more masculine. Study 3 found that heterosexual White men had a romantic preference for Asians over Blacks and that heterosexual White women had a romantic preference for Blacks over Asians; preferences for masculinity versus femininity mediated participants' attraction to Blacks relative to Asians. The pattern of romantic preferences observed in Study 3 was replicated in Study 4, an analysis of the data on interracial marriages from the 2000 U.S. Census. Study 5 showed that Blacks were more likely and Asians less likely than Whites to be selected for a masculine leadership position. In Study 6, an analysis of college athletics showed that Blacks were more heavily represented in more masculine sports, relative to Asians. These studies demonstrate that the gender content of racial stereotypes has important real-world consequences.

AB  - Two experiments integrated research on the roles of common identity and social norms in intergroup orientations. Experiment 1 demonstrated that learning that ingroup members categorized the ingroup (Spaniards) and outgroup (Eastern European immigrants) within a common identity (European) produced more positive intergroup orientations toward immigrants. By contrast, learning that outgroup members held the same position elicited less positive orientations compared with a condition in which the information came from a neutral source. The effects were mediated by one-group representations. Experiment 2 also found that endorsement of a common identity generated more positive intergroup orientations when it was expressed by ingroup than outgroup members and revealed how this effect may be sequentially mediated by personal one-group representations and symbolic threat.

AB  - Mutually exclusive genetic alterations in the RET, RAS, or BRAF genes, which result in constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, are present in about 70% of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs). However, the effect of MAPK activation on other signaling pathways involved in oncogenic transformation, such as Notch, remains unclear. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the MAPK pathway regulates Notch signaling and that Notch signaling plays a role in PTC cell proliferation. Conditional induction of MAPK signaling oncogenes RET/PTC3 or BRAF(T1799A) in normal rat thyroid cell line mediated activation of Notch signaling, upregulating Notch1 receptor and Hes1, the downstream effector of Notch pathway. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of MAPK reduced Notch signaling in PTC cell. Thyroid tumor samples from transgenic mice expressing BRAF(T1799A) and primary human PTC samples showed high levels of Notch1 expression. Down-regulation of Notch signaling by.-secretase inhibitor (GSI) or NOTCH1 RNA interference reduces PTC cell proliferation. Moreover, the combination of GSI with a MAPK inhibitor enhanced the growth suppression in PTC cells. This study revealed that RET/PTC and BRAF(T1799A) activate Notch signaling and promote tumor growth in thyroid follicular cell. Taken together, these data suggest that Notch signaling may be explored as an adjuvant therapy for thyroid papillary cancer.

AB  - Researchers taking a social constructionist perspective on identity agree that identities are constructed and negotiated in interaction. However, empirical studies in this field are often based on interviewer-interviewee interaction or focus on interactions with members of a socially dominant out-group. How identities are negotiated in interaction with in-group members remains understudied. In this article we use a narrative approach to study identity negotiation among Moroccan-Dutch young adults, who constitute both an ethnic and a religious (Muslim) minority in the Netherlands. Our analysis focuses on the topics that appear in focus group participants' stories and on participants' responses to each other's stories. We find that Moroccan-Dutch young adults collectively narrate their experiences in Dutch society in terms of discrimination and injustice. Firmly grounded in media discourse and popular wisdom, a collective narrative of a disadvantaged minority identity emerges. However, we also find that this identity is not uncontested. We use the concept of second stories to explain how participants negotiate their collective identity by alternating stories in which the collective experience of deprivation is reaffirmed with stories in which challenging or new evaluations of the collective experience are offered. In particular, participants narrate their personal experiences to challenge recurring evaluations of discrimination and injustice. A new collective narrative emerges from this work of joint storytelling.

AB  - This article reviews influences leading to extreme violence between groups. It then describes principles and practices of prevention, especially early prevention, and reconciliation: addressing difficult life conditions in ways that include everyone in society; diplomacy that addresses crises and prevents conflicts from becoming intractable; developing constructive visions and groups which make destructive ideological movements less likely; generating positive orientation to previously devalued others; moderating respect for authority in part by encouraging individual judgment; fostering healing by groups from past victimization and psychological woundedness. The socialization of children for inclusive caring and moral courage, developing societal values of cooperation and community, and active bystandership by citizens, leaders, and the media to resist influences leading to violence and create positive institutions that help fulfill basic psychological needs are all important for a world without genocide. The article also describes interventions promoting reconciliation in Rwanda and neighboring countries and research evaluating their effects.

AB  - As classmates form an important social reference group for preadolescents, this study examined the relation between classmates' multicultural beliefs and the ethnic attitudes of fifth- and sixth-grade ethnic majority students (ages 9-13). Thirty-eight school classes in the Netherlands participated. We focused on the native Dutch (n=548) but information from all students (N=838) was used to assess classmates' beliefs and other classroom variables. Multilevel analyses showed that classmates' multicultural beliefs were positively related to students' ethnic out-group attitudes, especially for children who felt more accepted by their peers, and negatively to their attitude toward the Dutch in-group. These links were mediated by students' personal multicultural beliefs, and they were independent of the proportion of co-ethnics in the classroom. Results indicate that it is important to look at specific peer groups (i.e. classmates) to understand children's interethnic attitudes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Endorsement of authoritarian attitudes has been observed to increase under conditions of terrorist threat. However, it is not clear whether this effect is a genuine response to perceptions of personal or collective threat. We investigated this question in two experiments using German samples. In the first experiment (N=144), both general and specific authoritarian tendencies increased after asking people to imagine that they were personally affected by terrorism. No such effect occurred when they were made to think about Germany as a whole being affected by terrorism. This finding was replicated and extended in a second experiment (N=99), in which personal and collective threat were manipulated orthogonally. Authoritarian and ethnocentric (ingroup bias) reactions occurred only for people highly identified with their national ingroup under personal threat, indicating that authoritarian responses may operate as a group-level coping strategy for a threat to the personal self. Again, we found no effects for collective threat. In both studies, authoritarianism mediated the effects of personal threat on more specific authoritarian and ethnocentric reactions. These results suggest that the effects of terrorist threat on authoritarianism can, at least in part, be attributed to a sense of personal insecurity, raised under conditions of terrorist threat. We discuss the present findings with regard to basic sociomotivational processes (e.g., group-based control restoration, terror management) and how these may relate to recent models of authoritarianism.

AB  - Introduction Hypopituitarism is associated with higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and premature death. Furthermore, some clinical and therapeutic features of hypopituitarism have been associated with a worse prognosis. Objective We reviewed, retrospectively, a large series of adult patients with hypopituitarism using stringent epidemiological criteria. Prevalence, association with cardiovascular risk factors, mortality and survival have been analysed. Design and Methods Two hundred and nine adult hypopituitary patients (56.9% females) from a population of 405 218 inhabitants, followed for 10 years. Results Prevalence of hypopituitarism at the end of the study was 37.5 cases/100 000 inhabitants. Incidence of hypopituitarism was 2.07 cases/100 000 inhabitants and year. Thirty-two patients died during the period of the study. Standardized mortality rate (SMR) was 8.05, higher in males (8.92 vs 7.34) and in younger patients (84.93 vs 5.26). Diagnosis of acromegaly (P = 0.033), previous radiotherapy (P = 0.02), higher BMI (P = 0.04), diabetes mellitus (P = 0.03) and cancer (P < 0.0001) were associated with mortality. A lower survival was associated with older age at diagnosis, nontumoural causes, previous radiotherapy, diabetes mellitus with poor metabolic control and malignant disease. Conclusions Prevalence of hypopituitarism was 37.5 cases/100 000 inhabitants, and annual incidence was 2.07 cases/100 000 inhabitants. SMR was 8 times higher in hypopituitarism than in general population and was also higher in males and younger patients. Reduced survival was significantly related to cancer, nontumoural causes of hypopituitarism, older age at diagnosis, previous radiotherapy and diabetes mellitus with poor metabolic control.

AB  - Objectives: Pregnancy is one of the most critical periods for iodine deficiency. The aim of the present study was to assess the iodine status and dietary intake of pregnant women in a population changing from high to lower consumption of milk and fish.
   Design: Cross-sectional observational study. Urine samples were collected for measuring urinary iodine concentration (UIC) and creatinine, and blood samples for measuring serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Frequency of consumption of selected food and beverages was obtained through a semi-quantitative validated FFQ. The difference in the distribution of UIC, ratio of iodine to creatinine (I:Cr) and TSH between groups following recommendations on fish and dairy product intake or not (fish >= 2 times/week as a main meal, diary products >= 2 portions/d) was assessed.
   Setting: Primary Health Care of the Capital Area, Reykjavik, Iceland.
   Subjects: Randomly selected pregnant women (19-43 years old, n 162).
   Results: The median UIC was 180 mu g/l, I: Cr 173 mu g/g and TSH 1.5 mmol/l. Women who did not consume fish >= 2 times/week and also did not consume dairy products in line with the recommended intake level of >= 2 portions/d had median UIC of 160 mu g/l (I: Cr 149 mu g/g) compared with 220 mu g/l (I: Cr 190 mu g/g) in the group following both the recommendations for fish and those for dairy products. Use of dietary supplements in the two groups was similar.
   Conclusions: Iodine status in the population studied was within the optimal range (150-249 mu g/d) defined by the WHO.

AB  - An internet-related survey distributed to Norwegian students explored predictors of fear-related xenophobia toward immigrants. Specifically, this study examined a new social construct called "entitativity" (i.e., the extent to which out-group members are perceived as bonded together in a cohesive or organized unit), as well as frequency of informal social contact and valence of a recent encounter in relation to certain xenophobic attitudes. Correlational and multiple regression analyses indicated that perceived out-group entitativity was a moderate predictor of fear-related xenophobia. Voluntary informal contact was a weak predictor of fear-related xenophobia, whereas negative evaluation of an encounter in the recent past was a strong predictor. Further analysis indicated that the effect of entitativity on xenophobia was strongest when informal social contact was low. Moreover, analysis indicated that the effect of valenced contact was partly mediated through perception of entitativity.

AB  - Most theories addressing the topic have proposed that threat and fear underlie right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), and many empirical findings have been consistent with this proposition. Important questions, however, remain unanswered, such as whether RWA is associated with fear and threat in general or only specific kinds of fear and threat. Theories of RWA generate markedly different predictions on this issue, particularly with respect to social or personal fears, and whether the association would also hold for the closely related construct of social dominance orientation (SDO). We investigated the issue by asking 463 undergraduate students to rate their feelings of fear, concern, and anxiety to a comprehensive 93-item list of potential fears and threats, which were formulated as either personal or social. Exploratory factors analysis identified five distinct fearthreat factors: Harm to Self, Child, or Country; Personal and Relationship Failures; Environmental and Economic Fears; Political and Personal Uncertainties; and Threats to Ingroup. All the fearthreat factors were correlated with RWA, with the strongest correlations being for Threats to Ingroup, and with stronger effects for social than for personal fears. None of the fear factors correlated with SDO. These relationships were not affected by controlling for Social Desirability or Emotional Stability (EMS). When the intercorrelations between fear factors and EMS were controlled using ridge regression, only Threats to Ingroup predicted RWA. Structural equation modeling indicated good fit for a model in which low levels of EMS had a significant path to Threats to Ingroup, which in turn had a significant path to RWA, and EMS having a significant though weak indirect (fully mediated) inverse effect on RWA. Implications of these findings for theories of authoritarianism and future research are discussed.

AB  - Anandamide (AEA) is a lipid mediator that participates in the regulation of several reproductive functions. This study investigated the endocannabinoid system in normal (NP) and preeclamptic (PE) placentas, and analyzed the potential functional role of AEA in the regulation of nitric oxide synthesis.
   The protein expression and localization of NAPE-PLO, FAAH and CB1 receptor were analyzed in normal and preeclamptic pregnancies using immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. NAPE-PLO expression was shown to be significantly higher (p < 0.05) in PE tissues than in NP. In contrast, a decrease in FAAH protein (p < 0.001) was detected in placentas collected from women with preeclampsia. Both enzymes were mainly located in the syncytiotrophoblasts from normal and preeclamptic tissues. No differences were seen in CB1 receptor from both groups of placental villous.
   Exogenous and endogenous AEA significantly increased NOS activity. Although pre-incubation with AM251 (CB1 antagonist) had no effect, co-incubation with both AEA and AM251 diminished NOS activity from normal term placentas. We observed increased NOS activity in placental villous from women with preeclampsia compared with normotensive pregnant women. Furthermore, NOS activity from preeclamptic tissues was diminished by co-treatment with AM251, illustrating that the NO levels could be modulated by AEA.
   These data suggest that AEA may be one of the factors involved in the regulation of NOS activity in normal and preeclamptic placental villous. Interestingly, the differential expression of NAPE-PLO and FAAH suggests that AEA could play an important role in the pathophysiology of PE. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose - The main purpose of this research is to empirically test how animosity, religiosity, and ethnocentrism interact to affect judgment about US products and purchase action of consumers in a progressive Islamic country like Malaysia. There are many studies that have been conducted in conservative Islamic countries such as Iran, Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
   Design/methodology/approach - The product chosen for this research is US fast food restaurants. A questionnaire was constructed and responses were obtained from 410 Malaysian consumers from different ethnic backgrounds. The authors tested the framework using structural equation modeling (SEM).
   Findings - Based on the test results, the authors conclude the following significant relationships: animosity on purchase action of consumers, ethnocentric tendencies on animosity of consumers, religiosity on ethnocentric tendencies of consumers, religiosity on animosity of consumers, ethnocentric tendencies of consumers on judgment of foreign product, foreign product judgment of consumers on purchase action, and animosity and ethnocentrism play mediating roles.
   Originality/value - The current study adds significantly to the body of knowledge on consumer behavior, especially the roles of animosity, religiosity, and ethnocentrism. The findings can help marketing managers to formulate appropriate strategies when consumers decide to boycott US products.

AB  - Using a community sample of 197 people living with HIV/AIDS, we examined how awareness of societal stigma (felt stigma) and negative feelings toward oneself as a member of a stigmatized group (self-stigma) are related to psychological well-being. Both felt stigma and self-stigma were significantly correlated with symptoms of depression and anxiety, but controlling for felt stigma reduced self-stigma's association with depressive symptoms to nonsignificance. Global self-esteem and social avoidance fully mediated the associations between self-stigma and distress but only partially mediated the associations between felt stigma and distress. Felt stigma mediated the relationship between distress and HIV-related changes in physical appearance.

AB  - State- and local-level ordinances attempting to 'crack down' on undocumented immigration have been proliferating across the United States. Hazleton, Pennsylvania's Illegal Immigration Relief Act (IIRA), passed in 2006, was one of the most visible of these laws. Using the events leading up to the passage of the IIRA as a case study and integrating racial stratification and moral panic theories, I conceptualize passage of this punitive law as a racial degradation ceremony performed in the wake of allegations of a Latino-on-white homicide and amid local demographic shifts and economic decline. Specifically, by comparing local media coverage of two homicides committed in Hazleton (one that led to the passage of the IIRA, a second that was far less impactful) and studying official discourse at city council meetings where the ordinance was introduced and passed, I find that officials relied heavily on the racialized tropes of the war on crime in constructing an 'illegal' immigration 'problem', thus degrading the city's new immigrants, symbolically uplifting the white majority, and in turn reaffirming the racial order.

AB  - The role of the skeleton in the regulation of energy metabolism in humans is not clear. This study investigates the hypothesis that biomarkers of bone turnover are associated with indices of glucose homeostasis and systemic inflammation in young adults. A cross-sectional study investigating the relationships between biomarkers of bone turnover (serum total and uncarboxylated osteocalcin, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, C-telopeptide of type I collagen, urinary N-telopeptide of type I collagen) and glucose metabolism (fasting plasma glucose [FPG], insulin, insulin resistance [homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance]), systemic inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP] and interleukin-6), adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), and body composition was conducted in 268 young, nondiabetic overweight and obese adults aged 20 to 40 years (116 men, 152 women; body mass index, 27.5-32.5 kg/m(2)). Data on diet, physical activity, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and parathyroid hormone were also collected. In women, there was a stepwise increase in lean body mass (P < .05) and a decrease in serum hsCRP (P < .001) across tertiles of total osteocalcin. Multiple linear regression analysis showed significant inverse associations between total osteocalcin and FPG (beta = -0.350; P = .016; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.35 to -0.04), insulin (beta = -0.455; P = .002; 95% CI, -1.9 to -0.46), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (beta = -0.508; P = .001; 95% CI, -10.93 to -3.17) in women with total osteocalcin concentrations below the group median. Men in the lowest tertile of uncarboxylated osteocalcin had twice the concentration of hsCRP than did other men (P = .05). In this sample, women with less lean body mass had lower circulating total osteocalcin concentrations and exhibited higher FPG, insulin resistance, and hsCRP compared with their similarly sized counterparts, suggesting that associations between osteocalcin and systemic inflammation, glucose homeostasis, and insulin resistance may be influenced by differences in sex and body composition.

AB  - Differences between women and men in the expression of prejudice toward obese people coexist with widespread antifat attitudes. It has been argued that these differences stem from women's tendency to internalize the social norm of slimness and to develop eating concerns, while men tend to resort to externalization and to showing antifat attitudes. Data obtained from 597 students (264 male and 333 female) revealed that men showed more prejudice against obese people, and that women had high scores in eating problems questionnaires. Finally, it is discussed why men and women adopt different strategies to deal with the social norm of thinness.

AB  - Few social psychological investigations have focused on the potential active role of the majority in integration. The present study examines the relationship between intergroup perception and majority attitudes toward the proactive integration of immigrant minorities in Norway. It assesses how and whether perceived entitativity of immigrants, endorsement of counterstereotypic portrayals of immigrants and metaperspectives along the appraisal dimensions of warmth/competence predict the integration attitudes of majority members in Norway as measured by the Majority Integration Efforts (MIE) scale. Correlational and multiple regression analysis yielded two strong (perceptions of positive immigrant integration intentions and perceived entitativity) and two moderate (perceptions of high immigrant competence in Norwegian society and metawarmth) predictors of these attitudes. Further analysis indicated that the main effect of perceived immigrant entitativity on MIE attitudes was partially mediated by perceptions of counterstereotypic intentions and competence. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed. We conclude by highlighting how the perception of immigrants' positive integration intentions and their heterogeneity as a group may best promote majority support for proactive integration efforts.

AB  - Five studies show that being the target of a positive stereotype is a negative interpersonal experience for those from individualistic cultures because positive stereotypes interfere with their desire to be seen as individuals separate from their groups. U.S.-born Asian Americans and women who heard a positive stereotype about their group in an intergroup interaction (e.g., "Asians are good at math," "women are nurturing") derogated their partner and experienced greater negative emotions than those who heard no stereotype. Negative reactions were mediated by a sense of being depersonalized, or "lumped together" with others in one's group, by the positive stereotype (Studies 1-3). Cross-cultural differences (Study 4) and an experimental manipulation of cultural self-construal (Study 5) demonstrated that those with an independent self-construal reacted more negatively to positive stereotypes than those with an interdependent self-construal. By bringing together research on stereotypes from the target's perspective with research on culture, this work demonstrates how cultural self-construals inform the way people interpret and respond to being the target of positive stereotypes.

AB  - Old-fashioned racism (OFR) was unrelated to white Americans' partisan preferences throughout the post-civil rights era. This study argues OFR could return to white partisanship following decades of dormancy because of Obama's presidency. After first demonstrating that such attitudes were significantly stronger predictors of opposition to Obama than ideologically similar white Democrats, I support that spillover hypothesis with the following evidence: opposition to interracial dating was correlated with white partisanship in 2009 despite being unrelated to party identification in 12 earlier surveys; moreover, evaluations of Obama completely mediated that relationship between OFR and partisanship; old-fashioned racism predicted changes in white panelists' partisanship between 2006 and 2011; these attitudes were also a stronger determinant of midterm vote preferences in 2010 than they were in 2006, with that relationship once again mediated by President Obama; and experimentally connecting Obama to congressional candidates significantly increased the relationship between OFR and 2010 preferences.

AB  - We suggest that temporal stability in the frequency of stereotype-consistent behavior can be used to estimate whether this behavior reflects internal stable dispositions (i.e., stereotype-consistent traits) shared within the group rather than other factors. Based on this reasoning, we expect that people may be more likely to judge a target group in stereotypical ways when the percentage of members of this group performing the stereotype-consistent behavior is stable rather than when the trend has been increasing or decreasing up to the present. This hypothesis was applied to the perceived endorsement of Flemish nationalism in Belgium. The main hypothesis was confirmed. The effect of temporal trend on stereotyping was mediated by an indicator of perceived group homogeneity.

AB  - The present research examines the implications of psychological essentialism for attitudes toward same-sex marriage (SSM), a hotly contested policy issue. Based on the literature on psychological essentialism, we tested the novel proposition that negative SSM attitudes are the result of essentialist thinking about the institution of marriage itself, the idea that marriage is universal, unique as a human union, invariant, and not the result of human agency. Two studies (n = 351 and n = 117) confirm these predictions, but also demonstrate the essentialist conceptions of marriage are more potent predictors of SSM attitudes than essentialist conceptions of homosexuality. Additional analyses indicated that essentialist conceptions of homosexuality and marriage did mediate the effects of religiosity and political orientation on SSM attitudes. The discussion focuses on the implications for the ongoing policy debate.

AB  - When interacting with someone from another social group, one's responses may be influenced by both stereotypes and evaluations. Given behavioral results suggesting that stereotypes and evaluative associations operate independently, we used fMRI to test whether these biases are mediated by distinct brain systems. White participants viewed pairs of Black or White faces and judged them based on an evaluation (who would you befriend?) or a stereotype-relevant trait (who is more likely to enjoy athletic activities?). Multi-voxel pattern analysis revealed that a predominantly occipital network represented race in a context-invariant manner. However, lateral orbitofrontal cortex preferentially represented race during friendship judgments, whereas anterior medial prefrontal cortex preferentially represented race during trait judgments. Furthermore, representation of race in left temporal pole correlated with a behavioral measure of evaluative bias during friendship judgments and, independently, a measure of stereotyping during trait judgments. Whereas early sensory regions represent race in an apparently invariant manner, representations in higher-level regions are multi-componential and context-dependent. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Method We exploit a split-ballot design in two waves of the Ohio Poll to test hypotheses about effects of contextual and respondent-level characteristics on immigrant stereotypes. Results Respondents generally rated Asian immigrants most positively and Latin American immigrants most negatively, with European and Middle Eastern immigrants occupying an intermediate position. Findings from regression analyses indicate little direct effect of county-level percent foreign born or media consumption. The strongest effects observed were income on stereotypes of Middle Eastern and Asian immigrants and concerns about the problem of unauthorized immigration on stereotypes of Latin American and Middle Eastern immigrants. Conclusion Our findings suggest that views about the characteristics of certain groups of immigrants are strongly linked to national-level debates about unauthorized immigration.

AB  - This article investigates the ethnographic methodological question of how the researcher observes objectively while being part of the problem they are observing. It uses a case study of ABC Pool to argue a cooperative approach that combines the role of the ethnographer with that of a community manager who assists in constructing a true representation of the researched environment. By using reflexivity as a research tool, the ethnographer engages in a process to self-check their personal presumptions and prejudices, and to strengthen the constructed representation of the researched environment. This article also suggests combining management and expertise research from the social sciences with ethnography, to understand and engage with the research field participants more intimately which, ultimately, assists in gathering and analysing richer qualitative data.

AB  - The high level of political cynicism in contemporary society is often considered a serious threat to democracy. The concept, however, has received only scant attention in psychology. The current work introduces political cynicism and extensively explores its psychological implications by investigating the concept's validity, predictive utility and status as a dispositional variable. Our results revealed that political cynicism is empirically distinguishable from the closely related constructs of social cynicism and political trust. Furthermore, political cynicism was found to strongly related to a wide range of political variables, such as voting intentions, political normlessness and political estrangement, as well as to broad social attitudes and racial prejudice. Finally, we show that political cynicism yields limited but meaningful relationships with Neuroticism and Agreeableness, although social cynicism is more clearly related to the Five-Factor Model personality dimensions. It is therefore concluded that political cynicism can be reliably measured and distinguished from closely related concepts and that it yields meaningful relationships with other relevant psychological variables.

AB  - The present study was undertaken to investigate the preimplantation developmental competence of cloned pig embryos that were derived from fibroblast cell nuclei by different methods for the activation of reconstructed oocytes. In subgroups IA and IB, nuclear-transferred (NT) oocytes derived from either adult cutaneous or fetal fibroblast cells that had been classified as nonapoptotic by intra vitam analysis for programmed cell death using the YO-PRO-1 DNA fluorochrome underwent sequential physical (i.e., electrical) and chemical activation (SE-CA). This novel method of SE-CA, which was developed and optimized in our laboratory, involves treatment of reconstituted oocytes with direct current pulses and subsequent exposure to 7.5 mu M calcium ionomycin, followed by incubation with 30 mu M R-roscovitine (R-RSCV), 0.7 mM 6-dimethylaminopurine and 3.5 mu g/mL cycloheximide. In subgroups IIA and IIB, NT oocytes were subjected to the standard method of simultaneous fusion and activation mediated by direct current pulses. The proportion of cloned embryos in subgroup IA that reached the morula and blastocyst stages was 145/248 (58.5%) and 78/248 (31.5%), respectively. The proportions of cloned embryos in subgroup IB that reached the morula and blastocyst stages were 186/264 (70.5%) and 112/264 (42.4%), respectively. In turn, subgroup IIA yielded proportions at the morula and blastocyst stages of 110/234(47.0%) and 49/234 (20.9%), respectively. Subgroup JIB yielded proportions at the morula and blastocyst stages of 144/243 (59.3%) and 74/243 (30.5%), respectively. In summary, the SE-CA of NT oocytes reconstructed from either type of nonapoptotic/nonnecrotic (i.e., YO-PRO-1-negative) fibroblast cell resulted in porcine cloned embryos with considerably better in vitro developmental outcomes than those of cloned embryos generated using the simultaneous fusion and activation approach. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the successful stimulation of porcine NT oocytes using electric pulses followed by an additional activation with a higher dose (1.5 times) of calcium ionomycin and subsequent exposure to a combination of 30 AM R-RSCV and lower concentrations (by 3 times) of 6-dimethylaminopurine and cycloheximide. Moreover, we report here the first use of R-RSCV, a novel meiosis-promoting factor-related p34(cdc2) kinase inhibitor, in the oocyte activation protocol for the somatic cell cloning of pigs.

AB  - Context It has been suggested that patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) harbouring the BRAFV600E mutation have a worse prognosis. We showed in PTC that high levels of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and its cognate receptor (uPAR) inversely correlate with disease-free interval (DFI). Objectives To investigate the effects of BRAFV600E on the expression of uPA and uPAR and to evaluate the prognostic relevance of BRAFV600E alone or in combination with uPA and uPAR. Design/Setting/Patients/Intervention The case study included 91 patients with PTC. All patients underwent thyroidectomy and radioiodine therapy. Follow-up was available for 75 patients. Main outcome measures The BRAFV600E mutation was analysed by sequencing and mutant allele-specific PCR amplification; uPA and uPAR expression by quantitative RT-PCR. Results BRAFV600E was found in 44 of the 91 patients and associated with older age, but not with high-risk clinicopathological features. Urokinase PA and uPAR mRNA levels were higher in tumour tissues by 9.51 similar to +/-similar to 1.30 and 4.64 similar to +/-similar to 0.44 fold, respectively, compared to normal matched tissues, being significantly higher in BRAFV600E-positive patients. In vitro induction of BRAFV600E in PCCL3 cells caused a significant increase in both uPA and uPAR mRNAs. Higher levels of uPA and uPAR correlated with lymph node metastases, TNM stage and disease recurrences. KaplanMeier and multivariate analyses demonstrated that uPA and uPAR were associated with shorter DFI, while the BRAFV600E was not. Conclusion In PTC, BRAFV600E induces uPA and uPAR expression. The latter, but not BRAFV600E, associates with advanced stages and shorter DFI. If confirmed in larger case studies, they may represent reliable prognostic markers for more accurate risk stratification and postoperative decision-making in patients with PTC.

AB  - Despite efforts to recruit and retain more women, a stark gender disparity persists within academic science. Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student-who was randomly assigned either a male or female name-for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants' preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.

AB  - The authors investigated the effects of perspective taking on opinions about reparations for victims of historical harm. In two studies, they showed that when non-Indigenous Australians took an Indigenous Australian perspective, this increased perceived entitlement to, and decreased anger toward, monetary compensation. Moreover, perceived entitlement mediated the relationship between anger about monetary compensation and perspective taking. Study 2 demonstrated the mutual influence of emotions and perceived entitlement. In particular, self-image shame rather than group-based guilt or anger predicted support for reparation when an Indigenous Australian perspective was adopted. The results suggest that taking the perspective of people who have experienced harm from one's own group can bolster a commitment to positive social change in relation to a pressing social issue.

AB  - This study investigated stigma directed at formerly obese persons who lost weight and became lean (through behavioral or surgical methods), or lost weight but remained obese, relative to weight-stable obese and weight-stable lean persons. This study also compared stigma directed at obese persons following exposure to descriptions of persons who lost weight vs. remained weight stable. In a between-subject experimental design, participants (n = 273) were randomly assigned to read vignettes describing targets varying across two dimensions, weight stability (i.e., weight stable or weight lost) and current weight (i.e., currently obese or currently lean). Participants completed measures of stigma against specific targets and measures of stigma against obese individuals in general. Lean individuals who were formerly obese were stigmatized more on attractiveness than weight-stable lean individuals, and as much as currently obese individuals. Stigma across domains was greater among currently obese individuals (regardless of whether they had lost weight from a higher weight) than among currently lean individuals. After reading vignettes describing weight loss, participants demonstrated greater obesity stigma than after reading vignettes describing weight-stable individuals. These results suggest that residual stigma remains against people who have previously been obese, even when they have lost substantial amounts of weight and regardless of their weight-loss method. Exposure to portrayals of the malleability of body weight, such as those promoted in the popular media, may significantly worsen obesity stigma.

AB  - Three experiments integrate research from political science and social psychology to examine the consequences of two competing visions of American national identity. American identity has been defined not only in terms of shared ethnocultural heritage originating in Europe (the ethnocultural prototype) but also in terms of shared commitment to civic service (the civic responsibility prototype). Three experiments tested the consequence of highlighting each of these national prototypes on perceivers' inclusion of ethnic minorities as legitimately American. Experiments 13 showed that highlighting ethnic minorities' allegiance to their ethnic subgroup (versus downplaying it) challenges the ethnocultural prototype and makes ethnic minorities appear less American. Process data showed that this effect was mediated by increased threats to American distinctiveness. By contrast, emphasizing ethnic minorities' national service (versus local community service) highlights ethnic minorities' fit with the civic responsibility prototype and makes ethnic minorities appear more American (Experiments 23). Process data showed that this effect was mediated by enhanced American distinctiveness. Collectively, these experiments highlight how inclusion of ethnic minorities in the nation can wax and wane depending on which definition of national character is salient in the social context.

AB  - This study examined associations between attitudes toward human rights and civil liberties (HR-CL) and a range of ideological, personality, and individual difference traits. A total of 474 German-speaking participants completed measures of attitudes toward HR-CL, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), Big Five personality traits, conspiracist ideation, and political cynicism. Preliminary analyses showed no significant sex differences on attitudes toward HR-CL. When these predictors were entered into a multiple regression, the only significant predictors were RWA, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness and Openness-Intellect. Further analyses showed that the relationship between Openness-Intellect and attitudes toward HR-CL was mediated by RWA. These results are discussed in relation to intervention programmes aimed at promoting more egalitarian HR-CL attitudes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two studies documented the "David and Goliath" rule-the tendency for people to perceive criticism of "David" groups (groups with low power and status) as less normatively permissible than criticism of "Goliath" groups (groups with high power and status). The authors confirmed the existence of the David and Goliath rule across Western and Chinese cultures (Study 1). However, the rule was endorsed more strongly in Western than in Chinese cultures, an effect mediated by cultural differences in power distance. Study 2 identified the psychological underpinnings of this rule in an Australian sample. Lower social dominance orientation (SDO) was associated with greater endorsement of the rule, an effect mediated through the differential attribution of stereotypes. Specifically, those low in SDO were more likely to attribute traits of warmth and incompetence to David versus Goliath groups, a pattern of stereotypes that was related to the protection of David groups from criticism.

AB  - Using data from Italy, Spain, and Germany (N= 1,569), this study investigated the role of basic values (universalism and security) and basic traits (openness and agreeableness) in predicting perceptions of the consequences of immigration. In line with Schwartz's (1992) theory, we conceptualized security as having two distinct components, one concerned with safety of the self (personal security) and the other with harmony and stability of larger groups and of society (group security). Structural equation modelling revealed that universalism values underlie perceptions that immigration has positive consequences and group security values underlie perceptions that it has negative consequences. Personal security makes no unique, additional contribution. Multi-group analyses revealed that these associations are invariant across the three countries except for a stronger link between universalism and perceptions of the consequences of immigration in Spain. To examine whether values mediate relations of traits to perceptions of immigration, we used the five-factor model. Findings supported a full mediation model. Individuals traits of openness and agreeableness explained significant variance in security and universalism values. Basic values, in turn, explained perceptions of the consequences of immigration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The model of 'oncogene-induced senescence' (OIS), resulting in cell-proliferation arrest, has recently been suggested as a possible explanation for the non-progression of pituitary tumours to malignancy. The aim of the study was to compare the expression of beta-galactosidase as a molecular marker of OIS, and p21/p16 as additional markers involved in mediating OIS, in pituitary adenomas, carcinomas and normal pituitary tissue. DESIGN: We performed: a) semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry (beta-galactosidase, p16, p21) in 41 pituitary adenomas [(11 GH-secreting, 9 PRL-secreting, 10 ACTH-secreting, 11 non-functioning (NFPAs)], 6 carcinomas (3 multihormonal: PRL/ACTH/GH, PRL/ACTH, PRL/GH/FSH; 1 non-functioning; 2 ACTH-secreting) and 7 normal pituitary tissues; b) quantitative PCR of mRNA (p16 and p21) in 6 GH-secreting, 6 NFPAs and 6 normal pituitary tissues. RESULTS: beta-galactosidase was significantly increased in GH-secreting tumours (P = 0.002), NFPAs (P = 0.04), macroadenomas (P = 0.03) and carcinomas (P = 0.02), as compared to normal pituitary tissue. We found that p16 expression was significantly lower in all tumours (both adenomas and carcinomas) probably secondary to reduced transcription, at least for NFPAs; p21 showed a different biological behaviour, implying that p21 and p16 may play different roles in the senescence of each individual type of adenoma. CONCLUSIONS: beta-galactosidase was significantly over-expressed in GH-secreting and NFPAs, and unexpectedly also in carcinomas. We speculate that the senescence pathway, which may explain the rarity of malignant progression to carcinomas in GH-secreting and NFPAs, might not be universal but cell-type specific.

AB  - Culture has been shown to influence response styles. The authors conducted two studies to test the notion that African Americans would be more likely to respond to racism directly, whereas Asian Americans would be more likely to respond indirectly and therefore more subtly. Study 1 showed that Black women subjected to a racist comment from a confederate during an online interaction were more likely than Asian women to verbally reproach the perpetrator. These group differences were not present when the outcome measure was indirect responding-administration of good/bad jellybeans. Study 2 used an online format to demonstrate that Asian women were more likely than Black women to say they would not respond directly to a racist comment. This group difference in unwillingness to confront was significantly mediated by a goal of maintaining peace with their interaction partner. Implications of these findings for the study of discrimination, coping, and well-being are discussed.

AB  - The goal of the present study was to examine whether exclusion leads to increased intergroup hostility and stronger fundamentalist religious beliefs. Using Cyberball, we examined how adolescents from different ethnic groups in the Netherlands (of Moroccan, Turkish, and Dutch descent with either Muslim, Christian, or secular beliefs) responded to being included or excluded by ethnic in- and outgroup members. We expected that exclusion by ethnic outgroup members would represent a categorization threat and would result in greater hostility. We hypothesized that exclusion by ethnic ingroup members would represent an acceptance threat and would result in responses that reduce uncertainty and increase one's chances of being accepted by others (e.g.. a stronger endorsement of fundamentalist religious beliefs). The results revealed that among all ethnic groups, exclusion by ethnic outgroup members led to more hostility toward the co-players and the co-players' ethnic group than exclusion by ethnic ingroup members. This was mediated by the extent to which people attributed their exclusion to the racist attitudes of their co-players. Among Muslims and Christians, exclusion by ethnic ingroup members led to more support for fundamentalist beliefs. We discuss the theoretical extension that these results provide, and practical issues raised regarding the consequences that may occur through the marginalization of religious and ethnic groups.

AB  - Previous research has shown that alcohol consumption can increase the expression of race bias by impairing control-related processes. The current study tested whether simple exposure to alcohol-related images can also increase bias, but via a different mechanism. Participants viewed magazine ads for either alcoholic or nonalcoholic beverages prior to completing Payne's (2001) Weapons Identification Task (WIT). As predicted, participants primed with alcohol ads exhibited greater race bias in the WIT than participants primed with neutral beverages. Process dissociation analyses indicated that these effects were due to automatic (relative to controlled) processes having a larger influence on behavior among alcohol-primed relative to neutral-primed participants. Structural equation modeling further showed that the alcohol-priming effect was mediated by increases in the influence of automatic associations on behavior. These data suggest an additional pathway by which alcohol can potentially harm inter-racial interactions, even when no beverage is consumed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Ageism, a form of prejudice in which one relates negatively to people due to their age, exists throughout life. However, no attempt has been made to compare ageist attitudes across the life cycle, from young adulthood to old age. Consequently, the current study examined age and gender differences in ageism throughout adulthood.
   Methods: 955 Israeli participants (age range: 18-98 years) were divided into three age-groups: young (18-39), middle-aged (40-67), and old (68-98), and were administered the Fraboni Scale of Ageism. Age and gender differences were examined both for the three groups and for subgroups within the older adult cohort.
   Results: Multivariate analysis of variance revealed that middle-aged participants were significantly more ageist than younger and older groups. Across all age groups, men exhibited more avoidance and stereotypical attitudes toward older adults than women. Among the old age group, participants aged 81-98 held more ageist stereotypes and reported more avoidance of older adults than those aged 68-73. Within the older adult cohort, gender was a significant predictor for ageist attitudes among those aged 68-73 and 81-98, but not for people aged 74-80.
   Conclusions: Ageism demonstrates a changing pattern across the life span. While gender differences remain stable, ageist attitudes toward growing old as we age ourselves are constantly changing. In order to gain a better understanding of ageism as a general and global phenomenon, we need to consider the role of such attitudes in different stages of life.

AB  - Intergroup contact and group relative deprivation have both been shown to play a key role in the understanding of intergroup relations. Nevertheless, we know little about their causal relationship. In order to shed some light on the directionality and causality of the relationship between intergroup contact and group relative deprivation, we analysed responses by East and West Germans from k= 97 different cities, collected 6 (NT1= 1,001), 8 (NT2= 747), and 10 years (NT3= 565) after reunification. Multi-level cross-lagged analyses showed that group relative deprivation at T1 led to more (rather than less) intergroup contact between East and West Germans 2 years as well as 4 years later. We found no evidence for the reverse causal relationship, or moderation by group membership. Furthermore, admiration mediated the positive effect of relative deprivation on intergroup contact for both East and West Germans. This intriguing finding suggests that intergroup contact may be used as a proactive identity management strategy by members of both minority and majority groups.

AB  - Perceiving one's romantic relationship as socially marginalized (i.e., as lacking social approval and acceptance) has been linked to an array of worse relational outcomes, including a greater likelihood of breakup. The present research extended this line of work by examining whether individuals who perceive disapproval specifically because of their current romantic relationship tend to experience worse personal health as well. Using an internet-based sample of romantically involved individuals, this study revealed that perceived marginalization of one's relationship was associated with reporting more symptoms of poor physical health, as well as lower self-esteem. Each of these associations was mediated by negative affect. Moreover, perceived marginalization was directly associated with engagement in riskier health behaviors, including more cigarette smoking and less frequent condom use. These associations remained, even when controlling for important personal and relationship characteristics. Thus, perceiving that one's relationship is socially marginalized is associated with worse health outcomes for the partners involved.

AB  - This article examines the interactive effects of power, competency threats, and gratitude expression on the tendency to denigrate others. The results of two experiments indicate that (1) power holders whose competence has been threatened are more likely than others to denigrate interaction partners, and (2) receiving gratitude expression has self-affirming effects for insecure power holders. Experiment 1 demonstrated that high-power, but not low-power, individuals who received threatening feedback about their competence denigrated the competence of their partners. Importantly, this tendency was ameliorated when subordinates expressed gratitude for previous help provided from the power holder. Experiment 2 demonstrated that the ameliorating effect of gratitude expression on threatened power holders' tendency to denigrate subordinates is mediated by increased perceptions of social worth. Implications for research on power, gratitude expression, and the self are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present research investigated the antecedents of ambivalent sexism (i.e., hostile and benevolent forms) in both men and women toward own and other gender. In two heterogeneous adult samples (Study 1: N?=?179 and Study 2: N?=?222), it was revealed that gender itself was only a minor predictor of sexist attitudes compared with the substantial impact of individual differences in general motivated cognition (i.e., need for closure). Analyses further showed that the relationship between need for closure and sexism was mediated by social attitudes (i.e., right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation), which were differently related to benevolent and hostile forms of sexism. In the discussion, it is argued that sexism primarily stems from individual differences in motivated cognitive style, which relates to peoples' perspective on the social world, rather than from group differences between men and women.

AB  - This study proposed a path model linking boyhood gender nonconformity and parental disapproval of self-expression to public self-consciousness, attempts to cover or down-play the visibility and relevance of one's sexual minority identity, and anxious affect in the daily lives of young gay male college students (mean age = 20.56, SD = 2.13). To establish the relevance of boyhood gender nonconformity and parental disapproval of self-expression in gay men's lives, gay participants' (n = 136) scores on these variables were first compared with the scores of a similar sample of young heterosexual men (n = 56) and then linked to reports of public self-consciousness, covering, and anxious affect measured over the course of nine days. As hypothesized, gay men reported experiencing these developmental stressors to a higher degree than their heterosexual peers. The best fitting path model in the sample of gay men established the mediating role of daily public self-consciousness and sexual orientation covering in the relationship between parental disapproval of self-expression and daily anxiety. This final model connects etiological models of anxiety to the developmental stressors faced by some gay men. The results suggest routes through which gay-related stress may begin earlier in development than commonly assumed, while continuing to impact gay men's open self-expression, and ultimately their experience of anxiety, into young adulthood. Public self-consciousness and sexual orientation covering are discussed as psychotherapeutic targets to address in order to alleviate anxious symptoms among young gay men.

AB  - Both majority and minority group members fear race-based rejection, and respond by disparaging the groups that they expect will reject them. It is not clear, however, how this process differs in minority and majority groups. Using large representative samples of White (N= 4,618) and Maori (N= 1,163) New Zealanders, we found that perceptions of race-based rejection predicted outgroup negativity in both groups, but in different ways and for different reasons. For White (but not Maori) New Zealanders, increased intergroup anxiety partially mediated the relationship between cognitions of rejection and outgroup negativity. Maori who expected to be rejected on the basis of their race reported increased ethnic identification and, in part through this, increased support for political action benefiting their own group. This finding supports collective-action models of social change in historically disadvantaged minority groups.

AB  - Background: In patients with well-differentiated (WD) neuroendocrine tumors (NET), long-acting octreotide (LAR), conventionally administered at a dose of 30 mg every 28 days, has well-documented anti-secretive but limited anti-proliferative effects. Aim: The objective of this study was to evaluate a different schedule of LAR treatment consistent with a shorter interval between administrations (21 days) in WDNET patients with progressive disease at standard-dose interval. Subjects and methods: Twenty-eight patients followed for diagnosis and therapy of WDNET who had tumor progression during therapy with LAR 30 mg every 28 days were enrolled. Clinical, biological, and objective tumor response was evaluated after LAR 30 mg every 21 days. Time to progression was also evaluated after LAR 30 mg every 21 days and compared to LAR 30 mg every 28 days. Results: The treatment with LAR 30 mg every 21 days resulted in complete and partial control of clinical symptoms in 40% and 60% of cases, respectively. Circulating neuroendocrine markers were significantly decreased in 30% of cases. A stabilization of disease was obtained in 93% and objective response in 7%. The median time to progression was significantly longer by using the shortened interval of LAR administration as compared to the standard one (30 vs 9 months, p<0.0001). The treatment was safe and well tolerated. Conclusions: The shortened schedule of LAR administration was able to re-institute control of clinical symptoms, to decrease level of circulating neuroendocrine markers and to increase time to progression in patients previously escaping from a standard schedule treatment.

AB  - The present paper argues for a discourse analytic approach to social psychological peace research and demonstrates the potential of such an approach through a re-specification of the concept of attitudes to war. This is illustrated through an analysis of a series of televised debates broadcast in the UK in FebruaryMarch 2003 in the build-up to the formal outbreak of the Iraq War. Analysis draws attention to the importance of rhetorical context and function, the inseparability of attitude object and evaluation and the formulation of evaluations as specific or general. Findings are discussed in the context of recent calls for methodological pluralism in social psychological peace research with a suggestion that matters of epistemology stand prior to methodology.

AB  - We address a series of criticisms, raised by Woodley (2011), of our paper "Cognitive ability, right-wing authoritarianism, and social dominance orientation: A five-year longitudinal study amongst adolescents" (Heaven, Ciarrochi, & Leeson, 2011). We argue that, while Woodley (2011) presents some interesting points, his criticisms do not alter our initial interpretation that verbal intelligence influences the individual's ideological perspective. We also argue that the use of RWA and SDO in our paper is not problematic given that these variables are treated as ideological constructs and not measures of personality. We further challenge the assumption that our reported relationship between low IQ and conservative ideology reflects the greater flexibility of intelligent participants in endorsing liberal norms. Finally, as suggested by Woodley, we re-analysed our data using a General Factor of Personality (GFP). The results indicated that in predicting ideology, GFP did not uniquely account for variance above and beyond that of intelligence, thus failing to support one of the central hypotheses of the cultural-mediation model.

AB  - We predicted that able-bodied individuals and White Americans would have a difficult time saying no to persuasive appeals offered by disabled individuals and Black Americans, due to their desire to make such interactions proceed smoothly. In two experiments, we show that members of stigmatized groups have a peculiar kind of persuasive "power" in face-to-face interactions with non-stigmatized individuals. In Experiment 1, wheelchair-bound confederates were more effective in publicly soliciting donations to a range of charities than confederates seated in a regular chair. In Experiment 2, Whites changed their private attitudes more following face-to-face appeals from Black than White confederates, an effect mediated by their increased efforts to appear agreeable by nodding and expressing agreement. This difference was eliminated when impression management concerns were minimized - when participants viewed the appeals on video. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Obesity is linked to increased risk of colon cancer, currently the third most common cancer. Consequently rising levels of obesity worldwide are likely to significantly impact on obesity-related colon cancers in the decades to come. Understanding the molecular mechanisms whereby obesity increases colon cancer risk is thus a focus for research to inform strategies to prevent the increasing trend in obesity-related cancers. This review will consider research on deregulation of adipokine signalling, a consequence of altered adipokine hormone secretion from excess adipose tissue, with a focus on leptin, which has been studied extensively as a potential mediator of obesity-related colon cancer. Numerous investigations using colon cell lines in vitro, in vivo studies in rodents and investigations of colon cancer patients illuminate the complexity of the interactions of leptin with colon tissues via leptin receptors expressed by the colon epithelium. Although evidence indicates a role for leptin in proliferation of colon epithelial cells in vitro, this has been contradicted by studies in rodent models. However, recent studies have indicated that leptin may influence inflammatory mediators linked with colon cancer and also promote cell growth dependent on genotype and is implicated in growth promotion of colon cancer cells. Studies in human cancer patients indicate that there may be different tumour sub-types with varying levels of leptin receptor expression, indicating the potential for leptin to induce variable responses in the different tumour types. These studies have provided insights into the complex interplay of adipokines with responsive tissues prone to obesity-related colon cancer. Deregulation of adipokine signalling via adipokine receptors located in the colon appears to be a significant factor in obesity-related colon cancer. Molecular profiling of colon tumours will be a useful tool in future strategies to characterise the influence that adipokines may have on tumour development and subsequent therapeutic intervention. Study of the molecular mechanisms linking obesity with cancer also supports recommendations to maintain a normal body weight to reduce the risk of colon cancer.

AB  - The epidermal growth factor (EGF) activates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt cascade among other signaling pathways. This route is involved in cell proliferation and survival, therefore, its dysregulation can promote cancer. Considering the relevance of the PI3K-Akt signaling in cell survival and in the pathogenesis of cancer, and that GH was reported to modulate EGFR expression and signaling, the objective of this study was to analyze the effects of increased GH levels on EGF-induced PI3K-Akt signaling.
   EGF-induced signaling was evaluated in the liver of GH-overexpressing transgenic mice and in their normal siblings. While Akt expression was increased in GH-overexpressing mice, EGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt, relative to its protein content, was diminished at Ser473 and inhibited at Thr308; consequently, mTOR, which is a substrate of Akt, was not activated by EGF. However, the activation of PDK1, a kinase involved in Akt phosphorylation at Thr308, was not reduced in transgenic mice. Kinetics studies of EGF-induced Akt phosphorylation showed that it is rapidly and transiently induced in GH-overexpressing mice compared with normal siblings. Thus, the expression and activity of phosphatases involved in the termination of the PI3K-Akt signaling were studied. In transgenic mice, neither PTEN nor PP2A were hyperactivated; however, EGF induced the rapid and transient association of SHP-2 to Gab1, which mediates association to EGFR and activation of PI3K. Rapid recruitment of SHP2, which would accelerate the termination of the proliferative signal induced, could be therefore contributing to the diminished EGF-induced activity of Akt in GH-overexpressing mice.

AB  - Recent theoretical extensions of threat theory have posited that Whites frequently view Blacks as a criminal threat because of stereotypes linking race and crime. Several studies have found indirect support for this hypothesis and have shown that the percentage of neighborhood residents who are Black is positively associated with the perceptions of victimization risk and fear of crime by White residents. To date, however, little research has investigated whether, as theory would suggest, this relationship is either a consequence of or is contingent on Whites holding stereotypes of Blacks as criminals. In this article, we address this issue by examining whether racial typification of crime mediates or moderates the relationships between static and dynamic measures of neighborhood racial composition and the perceptions of victimization risk by Whites. The results offer mixed support for the threat hypothesis and show that racial typification of crime conditions the relationship between perceived changes in neighborhood racial composition and the perceptions of victimization risk by Whites, but neither explains nor influences the association between static measures of racial composition and the latter. The implications of the findings for threat theory and research are discussed.

AB  - Proto-oncogenes are involved in cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. In the present study, we investigated the roles and mediating pathways of proto-oncogenes c-erbB(2) and c-myb in mouse oocyte maturation by RT-PCR, real-time quantitative PCR, western blot, and recombinant proto-oncogene protein microinjection. Results showed that both c-erbB(2) and c-myb antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (c-erbB(2) ASODN and c-myb ASODN) inhibited germinal vesicle breakdown and the first polar body extrusion in a dose-dependent manner. However, microinjection of recombinant c-erbB(2) or c-myb protein into germinal vesicle stage oocytes stimulated oocyte meiotic maturation. In addition, the expression of c-erbB(2) and c-myb mRNA was detected in oocytes; and c-erbB(2) ASODN and c-myb ASODN inhibited c-erbB(2) mRNA and c-myb mRNA expression, respectively. Maturation promoting factor (MPF) inhibitor roscovitine did not affect the expression of c-erbB(2) mRNA and c-myb mRNA, but blocked the effects of recombinant c-erbB(2) and c-myb protein-induced oocyte maturation. Further, cyclin B1 protein expression in oocytes was remarkably inhibited by c-erbB(2) ASODN, c-myb ASODN, and roscovitine. Nonsense tat ODN had no effect on the expression of c-erbB(2), c-myb, and cyclin B1. These results suggest that c-erbB(2) and c-myb may induce oocyte maturation through mediating a pathway involving the activation of NTH.

AB  - 'If you say "Handsworth"', the novelist Salman Rushdie remarked in 1986, 'what do you see? Most people would see fire, riots, looted shops ... and helmeted cops ... a front page story.' In the 1980s, 'front page' images of violence and disorder had come to define areas of black settlement such as Handsworth. However, for both Stuart Hall and Paul Gilroy, photography has the potential of unearthing alternative histories of black people in Britain. Connell explores how this might work in practice by taking Handsworth, an inner-city area of Birmingham, as its case study. Following the Handsworth riots in 1985, a photograph of the 'black bomber' appeared on the front page of every national tabloid newspaper, and Handsworth became conceptualized by the media as 'Frontline Britain'. At the same time, there are numerous examples of photographs from within Handsworth that attempt to present a different view of the community: images taken at high-street portraiture studios, community photography projects and the documentary work of the professional photographers Vanley Burke and Pogus Caesar. What such images offer the historian, it will be shown, is not clear cut. Photographs from within Handsworth are suggestive of possible themes in any alternative history of race in Britain, particularly in their emphasis on everyday life. However, Connell shows that it is also necessary to understand what is often the unacknowledged politics behind these images, something that makes them-in differing ways-as problematic as the stereotypical narratives presented on the front pages of tabloid newspapers.

Openness, Neuroticism, and Conscientiousness exerted direct effects on right-wing authoritarianism; the first two relationships were partially mediated by dangerous world beliefs. Most importantly, the relationship between dangerous world beliefs and right-wing authoritarianism was moderated by Openness: dangerous world beliefs significantly influenced right-wing authoritarianism solely for participants high in Openness. Limitations and possible developments of this research are discussed.

AB  - This research extends the role incongruity analysis of employment-related gender bias by investigating the role of dispositional and situational antecedents, specifically political ideology and the salience of cues to the traditional female gender role. The prediction that conservatives would show an anti-female candidate bias and liberals would show a pro-female bias when the traditional female gender role is salient was tested across three experimental studies. In Study 1, 126 participants evaluated a male or a female job applicant with thoughts of the traditional female gender role activated or not. Results showed that when the gender role is salient, political ideology moderates evaluations of the female candidates such that conservatives evaluate her negatively and liberals evaluate her positively. Study 2 (89 participants) replicated this effect and showed that this political ideology-based bias does not occur when the non-traditional female gender role is made salient. Study 2 also demonstrated that the observed effects are not driven by liberals' and conservatives' differing perceptions regarding the female applicant's qualifications for the job. Finally, Study 3 (159 participants) both replicated the political ideology-based evaluation bias for female candidates and demonstrated that this bias is mediated by conservatives' and liberals' attitudes toward the roles of women in society.

TI  - Unnatural Appetites: Sodomitical Panic in Hogarth's The Gate of Calais, or, O the Roast Beef of Old England (1748)
T2  - OXFORD ART JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - Hogarth's The Gate of Calais, also known as 0 the Roast Beef of Old England (1748), has been extensively studied in relation to its expression of British Protestant prejudice against the French and against Roman Catholicism. However, other aspects of the work have not received such attention. In the eighteenth-century the appetite for food was popularly employed as a metaphor for sexual desire. The painting, and the widely circulated engraving made from it, could, therefore, admit of an erotic reading, particularly bearing in mind the frequency of complex sexual references in Hogarth's works. The carnality so satirised was not simply related to anti-Catholic parody of transubstantiation, because this composition can be interpreted as having been structured around coded expressions of same-sex desire. Hogarth's interest in this theme can be related not only to his homosocial environment, but also to the events in Calais that inspired him. Hogarth's experience as a prisoner aroused in him a 'sodomitical panic' which can be seen as the precursor of the 'homosexual panic' studied by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick as an aspect of male sexual anxiety at the end of the nineteenth century. This work can be interpreted, therefore, as evidence for sexual as well as national and religious insecurity in mid-eighteenth-century Britain.

AB  - Previous research has shown a negative bias in the perception of whole facial expressions from out-group members. Whether or not emotion recognition from the eyes is already sensitive to contextual information is presently a matter of debate. In three experiments we tested whether emotions can be recognized when just the eyes are visible and whether this recognition is affected by context cues, such as various Islamic headdresses vs. a cap or a scarf. Our results indicate that fear is still well recognized from a briefly flashed (100 ms) image of a women wearing a burqa with less than 20% transparency of the eye region. Moreover, the type of headdress influences how emotions are recognized. In a group of participants from non-Islamic background, fear was recognized better from women wearing a niqab than from women wearing a cap and a shawl, whereas the opposite was observed for happy and sad expressions. The response patterns showed that fearful and anger labels were more often attributed to women with a niqab vs. a cap and a shawl and again, an opposite pattern was observed for the happy response. However, there was no general response bias: both correct and incorrect responses were influenced by the facial expression as well. Anxiety levels and/or explicit negative associations with the Islam as measured via questionnaires did not mediate the effects. Consistent with the face literature, we conclude that the recognition of emotions from the eyes is also influenced by context.

AB  - Because group-based emotions are rooted in the social identity of the perceiver, we propose that group-based emotions should be sensitive to changes in this social identity. In three experiments, young women reported feeling more anger, fear, and disgust toward Muslims when their identity as women had been made salient, in comparison with various control conditions where their identity as young adults, as social sciences students, their personal identity, or no identity had been made salient. These effects were mediated by appraisals of intergroup threats. In Experiment 3, the salience of the woman social identity also increased intentions to avoid Muslims.

AB  - This study examines whether and to what extent perceived threat mediates the relationship between expectations towards the Roma acculturation and anti-Roma attitudes. A model was tested using structural equation modeling. The sample consisted of 687 Serbian adolescents (mean age 17), of which 53% were females. In a survey-based study, we assessed participants' acculturation expectations, their feelings towards the Roma, and their perception of economic and symbolic threat. The results provide support for the expected interrelationships between the constructs: the endorsement of integrative acculturation expectations was negatively associated with perceived threat and Romaphobia, whereas the preferences for assimilation, segregation, or marginalization were associated with more perceived threat, and more Romaphobia. Moreover, the relationships between acculturation expectations and Romaphobia were partially (in case of integration and marginalization) and fully (in case of assimilation and segregation) mediated by perceived threat. The implications and suggestions for future research are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Strategies to improve the efficacy of endocrine agents in breast cancer (BC) therapy and to delay the onset of resistance include concomitant targeting of the estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which regulate cell-cycle progression and are supported by recent clinical results.
   Methods: BC cell lines expressing aromatase (AROM) and modeling endocrine-sensitive (MCF7-AROM1) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-dependent de novo resistant disease (BT474-AROM3) and long-term estrogen-deprived (LTED) MCF7 cells that had acquired resistance associated with HER2 overexpression were treated in vitro and as subcutaneous xenografts with everolimus (RAD001-mTORC1 inhibitor), in combination with tamoxifen or letrozole. End points included proliferation, cell-cycle arrest, cell signaling, and effects on ER-mediated transactivation.
   Results: Everolimus caused a concentration-dependent decrease in proliferation in all cell lines, which was associated with reductions in S6 phosphorylation. Everolimus plus letrozole or tamoxifen enhanced the antiproliferative effect and G(1)-accumulation compared with monotherapy, as well as increased phosphorylation (Ser(10)) and nuclear accumulation of p27 and pronounced dephosphorylation of Rb. Sensitivity was greatest to everolimus in the LTED cells but was reduced by added estrogen. Increased pAKT occurred in all circumstances with everolimus and, in the BT474 and LTED cells, was associated with increased pHER3. Decreased ER transactivation suggested that the effectiveness of everolimus might be partly related to interrupting cross-talk between growth-factor signaling and ER. In MCF7-AROM1 xenografts, letrozole plus everolimus showed a trend toward enhanced tumor regression, versus the single agents. In BT474-AROM3 xenografts, everolimus alone was equally effective at reducing tumor volume as were the combination therapies.
   Conclusions: The results provide mechanistic support for recent positive clinical data on the combination of everolimus and endocrine therapy, as well as data on potential routes of escape via enhanced HER2/3 signaling. This merits investigation for further improvements in treatment efficacy.

AB  - Purpose - In a multicultural context, this study aims to investigate the effect of ingroup versus outgroup categorization and stereotypes on residents' emotional and behavioral reactions in neighbor-to-neighbor conflicts. Based on the literature on the "black sheep effect", the authors predicted that residents would actually be more irritated by ingroup than outgroup antagonists. Secondly, they predicted that reactions to deviant behavior by an outgroup antagonist would be shaped by the valence of stereotypes about the respective groups.
   Design/methodology/approach - Residents with either a native-Dutch or a Turkish background (n = 529) completed a questionnaire on outgroup stereotypes, and responded to a conflict situation in which the ethnicity of an antagonist was manipulated between subjects.
   Findings - Supporting the black sheep effect, results reveal that both native-Dutch and Turkish residents reported more negative emotions towards an ingroup than an outgroup antagonist. In addition, when confronting an outgroup antagonist, stereotype negativity was related to more negative emotions and intentions for destructive conflict behavior.
   Social implications - The current study demonstrates that residents may actually get irritated more easily by ingroup than outgroup antagonists. Reactions to outgroup antagonists are further moderated by stereotype valence; negative outgroup stereotypes may lead to less tolerance towards outgroup antagonists and higher chances for conflict escalation.
   Originality/value - This is the first paper in which evidence for the black sheep effect is obtained in a field study and simultaneously for majority and minority members. In addition, evidence is presented that emotions may mediate the influence of the antagonist's group membership on conflict behavior.

AB  - Introduction: The majority of breast tumors at primary diagnosis are estrogen receptor positive (ER+). Estrogen (E) mediates its effects by binding to the ER. Therapies targeting the estrogenic stimulation of tumor growth reduce mortality from ER+ breast cancer. However, resistance remains a major clinical problem.
   Methods: To identify molecular mechanisms associated with resistance to E-deprivation, we assessed the temporal changes in global gene expression during adaptation to long-term culture of MCF7 human breast cancer cells in the absence of estradiol (E2), long term estrogen deprived (LTED), that leads to recovery of proliferative status and models resistance to an aromatase inhibitor (AI). The expression levels of proteins were determined by western blotting. Proliferation assays were carried out using the dual platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)/Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl) inhibitor nilotinib. Luciferase reporter assays were used to determine effects on ER-mediated transactivation. Changes in recruitment of cofactors to the gene regulated by estrogen in breast cancer 1 (GREB1) promoter were determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Gene expression data were derived from 81 postmenopausal women with ER+ BC pre-treatment and at two-weeks post-treatment with single agent anastrozole in a neoadjuvant trial.
   Results: The PDGF/Abl canonical pathway was significantly elevated as early as one week post E-deprivation (P = 1.94 E-04) and this became the top adaptive pathway at the point of proliferative recovery (P = 1.15 E-07). Both PDGFR beta and Abl protein levels were elevated in the LTED cells compared to wild type (wt)-MCF7 cells. The PDGF/Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib, suppressed proliferation in LTED cells in the presence or absence of E. Nilotinib also suppressed ER-mediated transcription by destabilizing the ER and reducing recruitment of amplified in breast cancer-1 (AIB1) and the CREB binding protein (CBP) to the promoter of the E- responsive gene GREB1. High PDGFRb in primary ER+ breast cancer of 81 patients prior to neoadjuvant treatment with an AI was associated with poorer antiproliferative response. Additionally PDGFRb expression increased after two weeks of AI therapy (1.25 fold, P = 0.003).
   Conclusions: These preclinical and clinical data indicate that the PDGF/Abl signaling pathway merits clinical evaluation as a therapeutic target with endocrine therapy in ER+ breast cancer.

AB  - Third-person perception (TPP) refers to the belief that others are more influenced by the media than you yourself are. This theory was extended to people's perceptions of the effects of legalizing same-sex marriage (SSM). It was predicted that people might believe that legalizing SSM would affect others' marriages, but not their own. It was also predicted that high right-wing authoritarians (RWAs) would display TPP more than low RWAs. Participants (135 undergraduate heterosexual students) estimated the effect of legalizing SSM on their own as well as other people's attitudes about marriage and sexuality. Results indicated that participants displayed TPP. The hypothesis about a link between RWA and TPP was supported. Implications of these findings and future research directions are discussed.

AB  - By nature, stereotypes require processes of categorization or semantic association, including social information about groups of people. There is empirical evidence that the anterior temporal lobe (ATL) processes domain-general semantic information, and supports social knowledge. A recent study showed that inhibitory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the ATL reduced racial stereotypes on an implicit association test (IAT). However, it was not determined whether this was caused by changes to specific social, or general semantic processing, or both. The current study addresses these theoretical issues. The design investigated the effect of rTMS to the left or right ATL, or a sham stimulation, on a social IAT (gender stereotypes), a non-social IAT (living versus non-living associations), and a non-semantic control (Stroop) task. The results showed that low-frequency rTMS to both left and right ATL significantly reduced D-scores on the gender IAT compared to the sham group; however, there were no differences on the non-social IAT or the Stroop. The findings show the ATL has a role in mediating stereotypes, and the decrease of bias after stimulation could be due to weakening of social stereotypical associations either within the ATL or via a network of brain regions connected with the ATL.

AB  - Background/Aims: Ketamine has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory effects on astrocytes stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism has not been elicited clearly. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of ketamine on TLR4 expression and NF-kappa B-p65 phosphorylation, as well as the production of proinflammatory cytokines in LPS challenged astrocytes. Methods: Astrocytes were stimulated with LPS (1 mu g/ml) in the absence and presence of various concentrations of ketamine (10, 100, 1000 mu M). The concentrations of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were measured by ELISA, the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in astrocytes was detected by immunofluorescence staining, the level of phosphorylated NF-kappa B p65 and the expression of TLR4 were detected by western blotting. Results: LPS increased TLR4 expression and the phosphorylation of NF-kappa B p65 subunit as well as GFAP expression and the production of IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in cultured astrocytes. Ketamine (100 and 1000 mu M) reduced the expression of GFAP and the production of these proinflammatory cytokines, inhibited the expression of TLR4 and attenuated the phosphorylation of NF-kappa B p65 in astrocytes challenged by LPS. Conclusion: The inhibitory effects of ketamine on LPS-induced astrocytes activation and inflammation response may be mediated by suppressing NF-kappa B activation through reducing the expression of TLR4.

AB  - Taking an approach from religion as a social identity and using large-scale comparative surveys in five European cities, we investigate when and how perceived discrimination is associated with religious identification and politicization among the second generation of Turkish and Moroccan Muslims. We distinguish support for political Islam from political action as distinct forms of politicization. In addition, we test the mediating role of religious identification in processes of politicization. Study 1 estimates multi-group structural equation models of support for political Islam in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Sweden. In line with a social identity model of politicization and across nine inter-group contexts, Muslims who perceived more discrimination identified (even) more strongly as Muslims; and high Muslim identifiers were most ready to support political Islam. In support of a competing social stigma hypothesis, however, negative direct and total effects of perceived discrimination suggest predominant depoliticization. Using separate sub-samples across four inter-group contexts in Belgium, Study 2 adds political action tendencies as a distinct form of politicization. Whereas religious identification positively predicts both forms of politicization, perceived discrimination has differential effects: Muslims who perceived more discrimination were more weary of supporting political Islam, yet more ready to engage in political action to defend Islamic values. Taken together, the studies reveal that some Muslim citizens will politicize and others will depoliticize in the face of discrimination as a function of their religious identification and of prevailing forms of politicization.

AB  - In aging men, serum endogenous testosterone is inversely associated with common carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and directly with beneficial plasma lipid levels; however, the relationship to endothelial function is poorly characterized. We examined the association between serum testosterone and endothelium-dependent brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in middle-aged to elderly men. A group of 83 men aged 40-69 years (mean 55.9 +/- 7.5 [SD]) with andropausal symptoms were studied. We measured their serum lipids, testosterone, luteinizing hormone, mean carotid IMT and brachial artery FMD by high resolution B-mode ultrasound. Brachial FMD correlated inversely with vessel diameter (r = -0.38, p = 0.0004), alcohol consumption (r = -0.22, p = 0.047) and serum testosterone (r = -0.27, p = 0.01), but not with luteinizing hormone. In multivariate analysis, FMD was explained by testosterone (beta = -0.17, p = 0.0226), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (beta = 4.17, p = 0.0312) and vessel diameter (beta = -4.37, p < 0.0001) when adjusted for age, body mass index, triglycerides, blood pressure, carotid IMT, smoking, alcohol consumption, cardiovascular diseases and use of lipid lowering medication (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors). In middle-aged to elderly men, there is an inverse correlation between serum testosterone and brachial FMD. These data suggest that testosterone may have an adverse effect on systemic endothelial function.

AB  - National belonging is often defined in terms of "ethnic" ancestry and "civic" commitment (with the latter typically implying a more inclusive conception of belonging). The authors report three Scottish studies manipulating the prominence of these criteria. In Study 1 (N = 80), a Chinese-heritage target was judged more Scottish (and his criticisms of Scotland better received) when Scotland was defined in civic terms. In Study 2 (N = 40), a similar manipulation in a naturalistic setting showed a civic conception of belonging resulted in more help being given to a Chinese-heritage confederate. Study 3 (N = 71) replicated Study 2 and showed the effect was mediated by judgments of the confederate's Scottishness. These studies emphasize the importance of exploring how ingroup identity is defined.

AB  - Although U. S. President Barack Obama received extensive media coverage during the 2008 U. S. presidential campaign and later during the first two years of his presidency, many people still perceive him as elusive, or even contradictory. Using biographical facts and objective at-a-distance measures, this article presents a personality profile of Obama. The profile is organized around a fourfold conception of personality. Personality can be understood as the residue of past and present social contexts and is publicly visible as traits or consistencies of style. Internal beliefs, values, and other cognitions, as well as implicit motives, can only be indirectly observed and so are measured through content analysis. The resulting profile is used to explain some outcomes, as well as paradoxes and puzzles of Obama's performance as president. It also suggests predictions about the future course of his presidency.

AB  - Over the past ten years, the topic of judicial recusal has received increased attention in virtually every quarter in the media, in the legal commentary, and even in Congress. The reason for this surge in interest is not due to recent changes in the applicable recusal standards or enhanced investigative reporting, but rather largely appears to be the result of inadequate attention to or perhaps in some cases, arrogance or callous disregard for the recusal standards, exacerbated by procedural deficiencies that prevent the recusal rules from being fully effective. This Article seeks to identify the flaws with the current approach to judicial recusal, and then offers a four-step proposal for restoring faith in the judiciary.

AB  - Background: Pancreatic endocrine carcinomas are rare and heterogeneous. Published results concerning treatment of advanced tumours are inconsistent and responses to standard chemotherapy remain unsatisfactory.
   Aim: To investigate the ability of the FOLFIRI regimen to manage progressive unresectable metastatic well-differentiated endocrine carcinomas of the pancreas as first-line chemotherapy.
   Methods: 20 patients with metastatic or advanced well-differentiated endocrine carcinomas of the pancreas and progressive disease were enrolled in a prospective multicentre phase II trial to receive chemotherapy with FOLFIRI schedule (irinotecan 180 mg/m(2) infusion combined with simplified LV5FU2) every 14 days. The primary end point was the non-progression rate at 6 months.
   Results: The 6-month non-progression rate was 80% (95% confidence interval [56-94%]), with stabilisation in 15 patients and 1 objective response. Overall survival at 24 months was 65% [40-82%]. Median progression-free survival was 9.1 months 16.5-17.3 months]. The median number of administered cycles was 12 [range 1-28]. Grade 3/4 haematologic toxicity occurred in 5 patients (25%) and grade 3 digestive toxicity in 11.
   Conclusion: The FOLFIRI regimen, as first-line chemotherapy, achieved stabilisation in most patients whose tumours had been progressing and was well-tolerated. It could be an alternative therapy for advanced well-differentiated endocrine carcinomas of the pancreas. (C) 2011 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study tests the relative predictive power of Allport's contact conditions in reducing intergroup bias with a multilevel model. In addition, it is argued that a fourth contact condition, cooperation, mediates the relationships between the first three contact conditions (authority support, equal status, goal interdependence) and intergroup bias, rather than being an independent predictor. A multilevel model with N = 266 individuals within k = 48 work groups in a larger mail order company shows that equal status and goal interdependence negatively predict intergroup bias, with goal interdependence as the stronger predictor. These effects are partially mediated by cooperation. However, while authority support is predictive of intergroup cooperation, no relationship with intergroup bias emerged. Theoretical and practical implications of the relative predictive power of contact conditions and the mediation by cooperation are discussed.

They may have a significant impact on those affected by rape as well as the performance of legal and public participants in the justice system. Rape myths may differ over time and within different societies and cultural settings. Awareness of contemporary and local rape myths is necessary if they are to be successfully challenged through public campaigns and other means. This study sought to assess the prevalence of myths concerning rape and sexual abuse in a national population survey.

AB  - This article examines how the experience of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks has prompted both a hardening of a narrow version of US national identity figured in prejudicial terms and, conversely, an increased willingness to explore difference as it occurs both within the US (i.e. in the relations between Americans) and abroad (i.e. in the relations between Americans and foreigners). Through close textual analysis of two feature films - 25th Hour (Spike Lee, 2002) and Rendition (Gavin Hood, 2007) - this article profiles this increased willingness to explore difference as it is indexed in both the form and content of the films under discussion.

AB  - Socio-psychological barriers play a major role in the continuation of intractable conflicts. They are responsible for the socio-psychological closure that resists and prevents the entertainment of alternative information that could potentially facilitate the acceptance of ideas advancing peacemaking processes. In an attempt to validate a process model that depicts the functioning of the socio-psychological barriers to conflict resolution, an empirical study was conducted among a nationwide representative sample of Jews in Israel, within the context of the Middle Eastern conflict. The reported study utilized a large scale survey, based on a nationwide representative sample of Israeli Jews who were asked to respond to a questionnaire which included the model's selected variables. As hypothesized, the results showed a path leading from general worldviews (e.g. General values, Right Wing Authoritarianism, Implicit theories about groups) to openness to new information and readiness to compromise through the mediation of the conflict-related societal beliefs (e.g. victimhood, delegitimization). These results indicate that closure to new information that may shed new light on both the rival and the conflict emerges as a crucial factor in the maintenance of society members' non-compromising views. The theoretical as well as the applied implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - We review 50-odd years of research on Allport's (1954) 'contact hypothesis', to assess progress, problems, and prospects. We chart the progress that has been made in understanding two distinct forms of contact: direct and indirect. We highlight the progress made in understanding the effects of each type of contact, as well as both moderating and mediating factors, and emphasize the multiple impacts of direct contact, especially. We then consider some of the main critiques of inter-group contact, focusing on empirical issues and whether contact impedes social change, and provide a research agenda for the coming years. We conclude that this body of work no longer merits the modest title of 'hypothesis', but fully deserves acknowledgement as an integrated and influential theory.

AB  - This paper considers how well standard calibration curve for translocations constructed for lymphocyte cultures irradiated in vitro with gamma-rays from (60)Co compares with the translocations yield in lymphocytes taken from people at a long post-exposure time. Data were used from radiation accident victims overexposed to doses ranging from 0.2 to 8.5 Gy and who were cytogenetically followed-up for various times upto 50 y. Their cultured lymphocytes had been scored both by the conventional dicentric method and by FISH for all translocations involving painted chromosomes (2, 3, 8); (2, 3, 5) or (2, 4, 12). The in vivo dose response relationship was derived by fitting translocation frequencies to the contemporary individual doses obtained independently and confirmed by different biological assays and physical dosimetry. A comparison with the conventional in vitro curve indicates reductions of translocation frequencies with increasing time which would prejudice retrospective dose assessment by FISH. This has led to the possibility to amend the in vitro dose response curve for translocations to make it more suitable for use in retrospective biodosimetry. This approach for retrospective biodosimetry therefore uses a dose response relationship based on truly persisting translocations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two studies (a) explored the role of pervasiveness of discrimination (pervasive vs. rare) in determining targets' responses to discrimination, and (b) examined the extent to which threats to participants' worldview can account, in part, for detrimental effects of pervasive discrimination. As predicted, across both studies, pervasiveness of discrimination moderated the relationship between attributions to prejudice for failure to obtain a job and psychological well-being (depressed affect and state self-esteem). When discrimination was presented as pervasive, attributions to prejudice related to lower state self-esteem and greater depressed affect. When discrimination was portrayed as rare, attributions to prejudice were related to higher state self-esteem and unrelated to depressed affect. Study 2 further showed that being able to affirm the world as just countered the negative consequences of pervasive discrimination, whereas it did not influence responses to discrimination that was perceived as rare.

AB  - Obesity is understood as a major medical and public health challenge, but the stigma attached to it also creates extraordinary suffering. The pervasiveness of morally negative views toward the overweight and obese, such as laziness and lack of self-control, are undeniable in mainstream U.S. society, situated both institutionally (such as health care barriers or media stereotypes) and interpersonally (such as the negative comments of others). To test basic pathways related to the etiology of women's vulnerability to feeling "fat-stigma" in interpersonal relationships, we present a study conducted between August and November 2009 that combines social network, anthropometric, body image, and interview data for 112 women aged 18-45 years, living in Phoenix, Arizona, U.S., and linked follow-up interviews with 823 of their social ties. Based on the proposition that some social network characteristics should amplify the personal experience of stigma, and others should ameliorate it, we ask: what relationship qualities make women more sensitive to the judgments of others about their weight? We find that what others say about women has only a very limited influence on how women judge others' negative views of their weight once actual body size is taken into account, but that women are more influenced by the opinions of those they are closer to and interact with more often. Ultimately, the degree to which women perceive themselves to be judged by others regarding their weight is not well explained by the actual opinions of people in their networks, either known or unknown to them. The assumption that social network norms exert considerable influence on people's stigma experiences needs to be carefully evaluated, at least in the domain of overweight and obesity.

AB  - Three studies demonstrated that a salient multicultural ideology increases hostile treatment of threatening outgroup interaction partners. The effect of multiculturalism on hostile behavior was evident regardless of whether threat was operationalized in terms of disagreement with an outgroup partner on important social issues (Studies 1 and 3) or rejection by the partner (Study 2). Moreover, the results clearly point to the learning orientation fostered by multiculturalism-as opposed to other factors such as enhanced other-focus, group-level attributions, or focus on differences-as the critical mediator of its effect on hostile behavior under threat. Thus, it appears that multiculturalism enhances the expression of hostility because it prompts individuals to really engage with and attach meaning and importance to threatening behaviors exhibited by outgroup members. The effects of multiculturalism were distinct from those of anti-racism and color-blindness, which set in motion processes that in many respects are directly opposite to those instantiated by multiculturalism. The findings highlight that the behavioral implications of multiculturalism may be quite different in conflictual interactions than they have previously been demonstrated to be in less threatening exchanges.

AB  - In this study we focus on the relationship between ethnic diversity and informal social capital. As this refers to rather strong social ties in the intimate domain, it is a strict test of Putnam's claim that ethnic diversity would decrease social capital. In order to explain these relationships, we derived mediating mechanisms from conflict and contact theory. Using data from the European Social Survey (2002/2003), we applied multilevel analyses considering three levels: individuals, regions and countries. Our results revealed a direct positive effect of ethnic diversity at the country level on informal helping, yet no indirect effect via the mediating variables. At the regional level, we only found an indirect effect of ethnic diversity. Here, ethnic diversity increases the likelihood of intergroup contact that in turn is positively related to both informal social meeting and helping. Perceived ethnic threat turned out to have a negative effect on informal social meeting. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Thiazolidinediones, specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) ligands, used in type-2 diabetes therapy, show favourable effects in several cancer cells. In this study we demonstrate that the growth of H295R and SW13 adrenocortical cancer cells is inhibited by rosiglitazone, a thiazolidinediones member, even though the mechanisms underlying this effect appeared to be cell-specific. Treatment with GW9662, a selective PPAR-gamma-inhibitor, showed that rosiglitazone acts through both PPAR-gamma-dependent and -independent mechanisms in H295R, while in SW13 cells the effect seems to be independent of PPAR-gamma. H295R cells treated with rosiglitazone undergo an autophagic process, leading to morphological changes detectable by electron microscopy and an increased expression of specific proteins such as AMPK alpha and beclin-1. The autophagy seems to be independent of PPAR-gamma activation and could be related to an increase in oxidative stress mediated by reactive oxygen species production with the disruption of the mitochondrial membrane potential, triggered by rosiglitazone. In SW13 cells, flow cytometry analysis showed an arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle with a decrease of cyclin E and cdk2 activity, following the administration of rosiglitazone. Our data show the potential role of rosiglitazone in the therapeutic approach to adrenocortical carcinoma and indicate the molecular mechanisms at the base of its antiproliferative effects, which appear to be manifold and cell-specific in adrenocortical cancer lines.(C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Direct effects of GLP-1, kinase-mediated, on glucose and lipid metabolism in rat and human extrapancreatic tissues, are amply documented and also changes in type-2 diabetic (T2D) patients. Here, we explored the characteristics of the GLP-1 action and those of its analogs Ex-4 and Ex-9, on muscle glucose transport (GT) and metabolism in human morbid obesity (OB), as compared with normal and T2D subjects. In primary cultured myocytes from OB, GT and glycogen synthase a (GSa) activity values were lower than normal, and comparable to those reported in T2D patients: GT was increased by either GLP-1 or Ex-9 in a more efficient manner than in normal or T2D, up to normal levels; the Ex-4 increasing effect on GSa activity was two times that in normal cells, while Ex-9 failed to modify the enzyme activity. In OB, the control value of all kinases analyzed - PI3K, PKB, MAPKs, and p70s6K - although lower than that in normal or T2D subjects, the cells maintained their response capability to GLP-1, Ex-4, Ex-9 and insulin, with some exceptions. GLP-1 and exendins showed a direct normalizing action in the altered glucose uptake and metabolism in the muscle of obese subjects, which in the case of GLP-1 could account, at least in part, for the reported restoration of the metabolic conditions of these patients after restrictive surgery.

AB  - Interpersonal provocation is a common and robust antecedent to aggression. Four studies identified angry rumination and reduced self-control as mechanisms underlying the provocation-aggression relationship. Following provocation, participants demonstrated decreased self-control on an unpleasant task relative to a control condition (Study 1). When provoked, rumination reduced self-control and increased aggression. This effect was mediated by reduced self-control capacity (Study 2). State rumination following provocation, but not anger per se, mediated the effect of trait rumination on aggression (Study 3). Bolstering self-regulatory resources by consuming a glucose beverage improved performance on a measure of inhibitory control following rumination (Study 4). These findings suggest that rumination following an anger-inducing provocation reduces self-control and increases aggression. Bolstering self-regulatory resources may reduce this adverse effect.

AB  - Four experiments examine the emotional and attitudinal consequences of victim group rejection of a gesture of reconciliation from a transgressor group. Participants were reminded about an ingroup transgression and were told that their ingroup provided an apology (Studies 1 and 4) or an offer of repair (Studies 2 and 3). The authors varied whether the victim group rejected or accepted these gestures. As predicted, rejection resulted in greater anger and lower levels of satisfaction directed toward the victim group. Victim group response had little systematic effect on anxiety or shame, however. Appraisals of the response as illegitimate mediated the effects of victim group response (Studies 3 and 4). Furthermore, Study 4 showed that the emotional backlash toward victim groups who reject an offer of reconciliation leads to heightened racism and reduced intentions to financially compensate victim groups. Implications for how groups reconcile in the face of historical transgressions are discussed.

AB  - Openness to Experience and Need for Closure (NFC) are dispositional variables related to social-cultural right-wing attitudes. The present study investigated their joint effects. Factor analysis revealed an 'experiential' dimension with high loading openness items, and a 'cognition' dimension with high loadings for most NFC items and about a quarter of the openness item set. The experiential openness items were weakly related to right-wing attitudes, demonstrating little predictive value. Conversely, the cognitive openness and NFC items were powerful predictors of right-wing attitudes, and also played an important role in integrative models, both as a predictor of authoritarianism-based racism and as a mediator of age related increments in right-wing attitudes. It is concluded that right-wing attitudes should be primarily understood in terms of (motivated) cognition, and to a smaller extent in terms of experiential openness. The distinction between 'experiential' and 'cognitive' openness is critically assessed, and it is asserted that because cognition is a multifaceted construct openness contains more than one cognitive dimension.

AB  - The present paper explores Flemish majority members' expectations concerning the acculturation of Turkish minorities. We studied two kinds of antecedents: majority members' perceptions of Turkish minorities' acculturation behavior and their experiences of intergroup contact. The possible mediating role of outgroup affect was also investigated. 247 Flemish high school students completed a survey. Data were analyzed using path analyses. Results show that positive contact experiences and perceiving that Turkish immigrants make efforts to engage in contact with the host group and/or to adopt the host culture are associated with less negative affective reactions towards Turkish migrants. Perceiving that Turkish immigrants maintain their heritage culture is associated with more negative affective reactions. Our results further revealed that increased negative affective reactions are associated with less support for culture maintenance and for contact with the host group but with a higher demand for host culture adoption. The present results also show that expectations of contact engagement and expectations of host culture adoption cannot be considered as equivalent. This implies that results from studies using Berry's conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Berry, 2001) and results from studies using Bourhis' conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Bourhis, Moise, Perreault, & Senecal, 1997) are not directly comparable. Our data also clearly disconfirm the orthogonal structure of the fourfold acculturation model for majority members' acculturation expectations, suggesting that relying on the specific dimensions defining acculturation expectations may constitute a more valid approach to understand ongoing acculturation processes.

AB  - Being the victim of discrimination can have serious negative health-and quality-of-life-related consequences. Yet, could being discriminated against depend on such seemingly trivial matters as garbage on the streets? In this study, we show, in two field experiments, that disordered contexts (such as litter or a broken-up sidewalk and an abandoned bicycle) indeed promote stereotyping and discrimination in real-world situations and, in three lab experiments, that it is a heightened need for structure that mediates these effects (number of subjects: between 40 and 70 per experiment). These findings considerably advance our knowledge of the impact of the physical environment on stereotyping and discrimination and have clear policy implications: Diagnose environmental disorder early and intervene immediately.

AB  - Helping behavior can affect the power dynamics between social groups (<link rid="b43">Nadler, 2002). The present research investigated whether helping also affects one's views of those power dynamics, as indexed by social dominance orientation (SDO) scores (<link rid="b52">Pratto, Sidanius, Stallworth, & Malle, 1994). College students in an introductory psychology course were randomly assigned to a helping (service learning) group or a control group. Students in the helping group participated in 18 hr of community service over 9 weeks, and showed a significant decrease in SDO, compared to the control group. Empathy mediated the relationship between helping and SDO. The pedagogical implications of service learning are also discussed, as are the potential moderating roles of helping type and contact.

AB  - The present study investigates in an adult sample (N = 220) whether the relationships between the Five-Factor Model personality dimensions and punitive attitudes (i.e., deterrence, desert, Moral Balance, incapacitation, and rehabilitation) are mediated by right-wing attitudes (i.e., Right-Wing Authoritarianism and Social Dominance Orientation). Three important results were obtained. First, the specific punitive attitudes referred to three higher order dimensions: Harsh Punishment, Social-Constructive treatment and Moral Balance. Second, Harsh Punishment was largely driven by right-wing attitudes and broadband personality traits. Furthermore, RWA fully mediated the effect of Neuroticism, while the effects of Openness to ExperienceOpenness and Extraversion were only partially mediated. Third, Social-Constructiveness and Moral Balance were only poorly related to broadband personality and right-wing attitudes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examined attitudes towards weak and strong assimilation in a sample of 3,121 pupils from 70 secondary schools in Brussels with a multilevel linear analysis. Controlling for socio-demographic variables, members of some ethnic minority groups endorsed weak assimilation to a greater extent than the majority. Within members of the majority, the French-speaking Belgians held similar attitudes towards assimilation to the Dutch-speaking Belgians. Among ethnic minorities, the identification of pupils from some foreign-origin countries with the mainstream society was positively associated with the endorsement of strong assimilation, while their ethnic identification remained non-significant. Intergroup friendship among pupils of foreign origin was positively related to strong assimilation. Moreover, pupils of foreign origin who experienced institutional discrimination against ethnic minorities in favour of the majority endorsed strong assimilationism to a lesser extent. Among the majority, the perception that people of foreign origin are victims of discrimination was positively related to the endorsement of weak assimilation. However, this association was mediated by the experience by the majority of institutional discrimination against the majority and in favour of ethnic minorities. In-group identification among the majority was not associated with the endorsement of assimilation. The results and their implications for future research and policy makers are discussed.

AB  - This paper explores the discursive construction of immigrants' criminality in interview accounts obtained by a sample of Greek people in Thessaloniki (Northern Greece). Analysis, which adopts a discursive approach to stereotypes and category construction, indicates that fear and insecurity on the part of Greek people are represented as a sine qua non consequence of immigration to Greece. Two different lines of argument are used to account for the arousal of fear. According to the first, fear constitutes a corollary of a widespread stereotypical representation of immigrants as criminals. The stereotype of immigrants' criminality is considered to be ill-warranted and it is attributed to the media or to other unspecified people. According to another, more regularly used, line of argument, however, fear is predicated upon the sordid living conditions of immigrants in Greece which make the probability of them being involved in illegal acts particularly high. In this case, fear is seen to derive from a 'rational estimate' of the probability of immigrant's involvement in criminal acts. Nested within the discourse of 'risk' the stereotypical image of immigrants' criminality is sustained and used to account for the need to protect the 'ingroup' from 'immigrant groups' through immigration control and surveillance.

AB  - This article employs evidence from a literature within social psychology on the malleability of scores on the Implicit Association Test (IAT), a measure that is widely used to assess implicit attitudes, and other implicit cognition measures, to provide a theoretical framework for incorporating implicit processes into sociological accounts of culture. Studies from this literature demonstrate the fundamentally contextual and interactional nature of implicit cognition; that is, how the cultural environment shapes the activation of cognitive associations. Understanding how culture works to influence behavior requires attention to the interaction between the cultural environment-including symbols and media, place, situations, and networks-and cognitive representations. Using this theoretical framework, I discuss how evidence from the sociology of culture regarding the nature of this cultural environment can inform our understanding of culture in action.

AB  - The association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum concentration of thyroid hormones and pituitary thyrotropin stimulating hormone (TSH) was studied in nine hypothyroid patients (HT) before and in seven after L-thyroxine treatment. With L-thyroxine, median free T4 increased 4-fold in serum (3.5 pmol/L vs 17.5 pmol/L) and 3-fold in CSF, (3.9pmol/L vs 11.5 pmol/L). Correspondingly, total T3 in serum increased two-fold (0.9 nmol/L vs 2.2 nmol/L). Unexpectedly, free T3 concentration in CSF was similar (1.5 pmol/L vs.1.5 pmol/L) before and during treatment. In HT, TSH in serum correlated with TSH in CSF as did free T4 in serum and in CSF. During L-thyroxine, the correlation with TSH in serum and CSF remained. Likewise, the free T4 concentration in serum correlated with that in CSF. However, no correlation was found between T3 in serum and free T3 in CSF. It seems evident that free T4 in serum equilibrates with that in the CSF both in the HT and during L-thyroxine. Despite a two-fold increase in total serum T3, free T3 in CSF remained unchanged, which agrees with previous results in rats showing that T3 is less exchangeable between serum and CSF. Alternatively, an accelerated conversion of T4 to T3 might have maintained the concentration of T3, due to strongly increased levels of TSH found in the hypothyroid state. The notion that free T4 in serum reflects the CSF concentration of free T4 is consistent with previous reports from studies in animals.

AB  - Aims: Ligands for the vitamin D receptor (VDR) regulate apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) gene expression in a tissue-specific manner. The vitamin D metabolite 24, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (24, 25-(OH)(2)D-3) has been shown to possess unique biological effects. To determine if 24, 25-(OH)(2)D-3 modulates apo A-I gene expression, HepG2 hepatocytes and Caco-2 intestinal cells were treated with 24, 25-(OH)(2)D-3 or its precursor 25-OHD3.
   Main methods: Apo A-I protein levels and mRNA levels were measured by Western and Northern blotting, respectively. Changes in apo A-I promoter activity were measured using the chlorampenicol acetytransferase assay.
   Key findings: Treatment with 24, 25-(OH)(2)D-3, but not 25-OHD3, inhibited apo A-I secretion in HepG2 and Caco-2 cells and apo A-I mRNA levels and apo A-I promoter activity in HepG2 cells. To determine if 24, 25(OH)(2)D-3 represses apo A-I gene expression through site A, the nuclear receptor binding element that is essential for VDRs effects on apo A-I gene expression, HepG2 cells were transfected with plasmids containing or lacking site A. While the site A-containing plasmid was suppressed by 24, 25-(OH)(2)D-3, the plasmid lacking site A was not. Likewise, treatment with 24, 25-(OH)(2)D-3 suppressed reporter gene expression in cells transfected with a plasmid containing site A in front of a heterologous promoter. Finally, antisense-mediated VDR depletion failed to reverse the silencing effects of 24, 25-(OH)(2)D-3 on apo A-I expression.
   Significance: These results suggest that the vitamin D metabolite 24, 25-(OH)(2)D-3 is an endogenous regulator of apo A-I synthesis through a VDR-independent signaling mechanism. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite the recent proliferation of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) thematic content in U. S. media, there have been relatively few empirical investigations examining its impact on heterosexuals' attitudes toward LGB individuals. This study examined the effect of one type of content, male-male homoerotic imagery, on male and female heterosexuals' attitudes toward, stereotypes about, and affective reactions to gay men. One hundred ninety-eight undergraduate students were assigned to either a male-male or male-female erotica condition, and their corresponding attitudes toward gay men were assessed. Results revealed that the effect of erotic imagery (male-male vs. male-female) on participants' stereotype and affect scores differed for men and women at varying levels of sexual anxiety. The implications of these findings are discussed in light of the literature on exposure to erotic imagery and attitudes toward gay men. In particular, the study highlights the need for additional research that acknowledges within-gender heterogeneity with respect to antigay attitude valence, extremity, and function.

AB  - This study conducted a content analysis to examine the types of images that accompany online news stories about obesity and to determine how obese people are portrayed in news photographs. Images were selected from news articles about obesity obtained from 5 major news Web sites, during a 2-week period in September of 2009. Images accompanying news stories about obesity (N = 549) were systematically coded. Of 441 individuals identified in news photographs, 65% were overweight/obese and 27% were nonoverweight. Overall, 72% of images that depicted an overweight or obese person were portrayed in a negative, stigmatizing manner. Overweight/obese individuals were significantly more likely to have their heads cut out of the photos, to be portrayed showing only their abdomens or lower bodies, and to be shown eating or drinking than were nonoverweight individuals. Overweight/obese individuals were significantly less likely to be shown fully clothed, wearing professional clothing, or exercising than were nonoverweight individuals. Obese individuals are frequently stigmatized in online news photographs; this phenomenon has important implications for public perceptions of obese persons and may reinforce pervasive prejudice and discrimination.

AB  - Within the context of the Basque Country in Spain we examined how ethnic (Basque) and national (Spanish) identification relate to the evaluation of Spaniards, Basques, Andalusians and Catalans. On a sample of adolescent participants we tested a structural equation model which considered identity content (Basque separatism) as a mediator of the relationship between group identifications and group evaluations. While Spanish and Basque identification were associated with a positive evaluation of Spanish and Basque in-groups, respectively, the evaluation of out-groups that are relatively similar to the in-group were not affected by identification. In contrast, dissimilar out-groups tended to be evaluated more negatively by higher in-group identifiers. Basque separatism mediated the negative relationship between Basque identification and the evaluation of Spaniards and of Andalusians as a prototypically Spanish subgroup. It is concluded that identification relates differently to the evaluation of different out-groups, and that the ideological content of identity plays an important role in determining intergroup relations.

AB  - Although it is generally assumed that support for democratic values and beliefs develops as a result of social learning, the concrete socializing circumstances through which this occurs are less obvious. This study investigated the relationship between democratic family functioning and democratic values of adolescents. Adolescents' (N - 1,341, 16- to 17-year-olds) reports on their parents' psychological control, autonomy granting, warmth, and behavioural control were considered predictors of adolescents' democratic orientation. The results demonstrated that the democratic functioning of families was positively related to adolescents' support for democratic values when controlling for the effects of gender, political experience, authoritarianism, empathy, and political activism. Additionally, this study examined the possible role of empathy as a mediator in the relation between democratic family functioning and adolescent's democratic values. The results show that empathy was a partial mediator of a family's contribution to adolescents' democratic orientation.

AB  - In 2 studies (N = 907), we developed and validated the Perceptions of Diversity Instructors (PDI-32) measure, which assesses college students' ratings of instructors teaching a race-focused diversity course. We also explored how the professor's race/ethnicity, students' attitudes toward similarities and differences, and perceived professor bias influenced students' ratings. Supporting the source effects outlined in the persuasion literature and prior qualitative research, the results indicated that students expect African American instructors to be more biased (subjective/judgmental) but assume European American instructors to have less content expertise (inexpert/unaware). Also, students who are more open to discussing diversity issues rated the instructors more positively. Finally, students' expectation of professor bias mediated the relationship between the professor's race/ethnicity and students' evaluations.

AB  - Priming stereotypes can lead to a variety of behavioral outcomes, including assimilation, contrast, and response behaviors. However, the conditions that give rise to each of these outcomes are unspecified. Furthermore, theoretical accounts posit that prime-to-behavior effects are either direct (i.e., unmediated) or mediated by cognitive processes, whereas the role of affective processes has been largely unexplored. The present research directly investigated both of these issues. Three experiments demonstrated that priming a threatening social group ("hoodies") influences both affect and behavior in an interpersonal context. Hoodie priming produced both behavioral avoidance and several affective changes (including social apprehension, threat sensitivity, and self-reported anxiety and hostility). Importantly, avoidance following hoodie priming was mediated by anxiety and occurred only under conditions of other-(but not self-) focus. These results highlight multiple routes through which primes influence affect and behavior, and suggest that attention to self or others determine the nature of priming effects.

AB  - Endogenous opioid peptides (EOP) and dopamine (DA)-derived salsolinol are implicated in the suckling-induced prolactin surge. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the opioidergic and salsolinergic activity in the mediobasal hypothalamus of nursing sheep. The sheep were infused intracerebroventricularly with opioid receptors antagonists: naloxone (all types of receptors, n=6); naloxonazine (mu receptor, n=6) or the vehicle (control, n=6) in a series of five 30-min infusions (60 mu g/60 mu l) from 10:00 to 15:00, at 30-min intervals. The period of the experiment included the non-suckling (10:00-12:30) and suckling (12:30-15:00) periods. Simultaneously, a push pull perfusion of the infundibular nucleus/median eminence was performed in every sheep to study the dopaminergic system activity. Blood samples were also collected at 10-minute intervals to determine plasma prolactin concentration. Both the mean perfusate salsolinol and plasma prolactin concentrations were higher during the suckling vs. non-suckling (P<0.001) period in the control. The perfusate DA concentration was below the detection limit in this group. Treatment with either naloxone or naloxonazine significantly (P<0.01) diminished plasma prolactin concentration, as compared with the controls and blocked the prolactin surge during suckling. In drug-infused sheep, the perfusate salsolinol concentration was below the detection limit but the increased DA and its metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid concentrations were observed. In conclusion, the stimulatory action of EOP on prolactin secretion in nursing females is mediated, at least in part, by salsolinol, and the ligands for mu opioid receptor may be the primary factors of this relationship, especially with respect to the suckling-induced prolactin surge.

AB  - Objective: Weight reduction improves several obesity-related health conditions. We aimed to compare the effect of bariatric surgery and comprehensive lifestyle intervention on type 2 diabetes and obesity-related cardiovascular risk factors.
   Design: One-year controlled clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00273104).
   Methods: Morbidly obese subjects (19-66 years, mean (S. D.) body mass index 45.1 kg/m(2) (5.6), 103 women) were treated with either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery (n=80) or intensive lifestyle intervention at a rehabilitation centre (n=66). The dropout rate within both groups was 5%.
   Results: Among the 76 completers in the surgery group and the 63 completers in the lifestyle group, mean (S. D.) 1-year weight loss was 30% (8) and 8% (9) respectively. Beneficial effects on glucose metabolism, blood pressure, lipids and low-grade inflammation were observed in both groups. Remission rates of type 2 diabetes and hypertension were significantly higher in the surgery group than the lifestyle intervention group; 70 vs 33%, P=0.027, and 49 vs 23%, P=0.016. The improvements in glycaemic control and blood pressure were mediated by weight reduction. The surgery group experienced a significantly greater reduction in the prevalence of metabolic syndrome, albuminuria and electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy than the lifestyle group. Gastrointestinal symptoms and symptomatic postprandial hypoglycaemia developed more frequently after gastric bypass surgery than after lifestyle intervention. There were no deaths.
   Conclusions: Type 2 diabetes and obesity-related cardiovascular risk factors were improved after both treatment strategies. However, the improvements were greatest in those patients treated with gastric bypass surgery.

AB  - Oxidative stress induced by chronic hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes plays a crucial role in progressive loss of beta-cell mass through beta-cell apoptosis. Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has effects on preservation of beta-cell mass and its insulin secretory function. GLP-1 possibly increases islet cell mass through stimulated proliferation from beta-cell and differentiation to beta-cell from progenitor cells. Also, it probably has an antiapoptotic effect on beta-cell, but detailed mechanisms are not proven. Therefore, we examined the protective mechanism of GLP-1 in beta-cell after induction of oxidative stress. The cell apoptosis decreased to similar to 50% when cells were treated with 100 mu M H2O2 for up to 2 hr. After pretreatment of Ex-4, GLP-1 receptor agonist, flow cytometric analysis shows 41.7% reduction of beta-cell apoptosis. This data suggested that pretreatment of Ex-4 protect from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Also, Ex-4 treatment decreased GSK3 beta activation, JNK phosphorylation and caspase-9, -3 activation and recovered the expression of insulin2 mRNA in beta-cell lines and secretion of insulin in human islet. These results suggest that Ex-4 may protect beta-cell apoptosis by blocking the JNK and GSK3 beta mediated apoptotic pathway.

AB  - Administration of hypertonic saline (HS) solution to rats with acute pancreatitis (AP) decreases mortality and systemic inflammation. We hypothesized that these effects are related not only to systemic inflammatory reduction, but also to a reduction of the pancreatic lesion. Acute pancreatitis was induced in Wistar rats by injection of 2.5% sodium taurocholate. Animals were divided in groups: without AP, not treated AP, AP treated with NaCl 0.9%, and AP treated with NaCl 7.5%. Trypsinogen activation peptides and amylase activity were increased in ascitic fluid and serum and were not affected by treatment with HS. Pancreatic inflammation was evaluated by increased myeloperoxidase activity, malondialdehyde formation, and histopathology for severity of pancreatic lesions. The HS did not affect these parameters. Expression of cyclooxygenase 2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase was markedly increased in the pancreas of the AP group and was reduced by treatment with HS. This treatment also reduced the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 but not of IL-10 in the pancreatic tissue. These results show that HS modulates cytokine production and expression of enzymes responsible for inflammatory mediator production in the pancreas without affecting the severity of the pancreatic lesions.

AB  - The beneficial effects of pregnancy on the symptoms of inflammatory diseases are well documented. The modulation in the uterine functions in the presence of generalized inflammation, however, is much less characterized. The aim of the present study was to explore the modulatory action of adjuvant arthritis on the adrenergic functions of the uterus in nonpregnant and late pregnant rats. Adjuvant arthritis was induced by the subplantar injection of M butyricum. Presynaptic functions were characterized by a superfusion technique and by registration of the contractions of isolated uterine rings elicited by electric field stimulation. The functions of the adrenoceptors were characterized by constructing concentration-response curves with agonists for both alpha- and beta-receptors. Where these curves differed significantly from the control, the expressions of these receptors at the mRNA level were additionally determined. Adjuvant arthritis substantially decreased the uptake and release of [H-3]noradrenaline in myometrial samples from nonpregnant rats, but caused no change at term. The electrically induced contractions were decreased by inflammation in both gestational states. Arthritis resulted in decreased beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation (in both the nonpregnant and the late-pregnant animals) and an increase in alpha-mediated contraction at term. It can be concluded that adjuvant arthritis deteriorates the adrenergic innervation of the uterus. The effects of exogenous sympathomimetics are shifted, favoring a state of higher contractility. If similar mechanisms are operative in humans, the present results could imply that beta-adrenoceptor agonists are not ideal tocolytics when pregnancy is complicated by generalized inflammation.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between college students' perceptions of their campus' multicultural climate and their acceptance of racial/ethnic diversity. A two-mediator model, based on acculturation principles, was successfully fit to survey data from 434 college students of diverse racial/ethnic heritage. Results showed that valuing positive interactions with members of ethnocultural groups other than one's own is a positive mediator and strength of ethnocultural identity is a (much less important) negative mediator of the relationship between student perceptions of multicultural campus programming and personal acceptance of diverse racial/ethnic groups. Furthermore, each mediator independently contributed to the prediction of such acceptance. Overall, the model accounts for about 25% of the variance in acceptance of diversity and was a better fit to the data than a reverse path model. Follow-up analyses, separately by ethnic group, showed that perceptions of campus programming predicted acceptance of diversity for the White subsample, but not for the Latino subsample. Nevertheless, the two acculturation-related constructs were important for both groups, with the model accounting for 28% and 24% of their respective variances in acceptance of diversity. Practical implications are drawn.

AB  - P>Objective
   Cabergoline is a highly effective medical treatment for patients with hyperprolactinaemia. There is an increased risk of valvular heart disease in patients receiving cabergoline for Parkinson's disease. This study examined whether cabergoline treatment of hyperprolactinaemia is associated with a greater prevalence of valvulopathy.
   Design
   Cross-sectional, two-dimensional echocardiographic study performed by a single echocardiographer.
   Patients
   Seventy-two patients (median age 36 years, 19 men) receiving cabergoline for hyperprolactinaemia, and 72 controls prospectively matched for age, sex and cardiovascular risk factors.
   Measurements
   Assessment of valvular mobility, regurgitation and morphology.
   Results
   Median cumulative dose exposure for cabergoline was 126 (58-258) mg, and patients had received cabergoline for 53 (26-96) months. The frequency of mild mitral regurgitation was identical (5/72, 7%) in patient and control groups. Mild aortic regurgitation was not significantly different between groups (4/72 [controls] vs 2/72 [patients], P = 0 center dot 681). There was only one case of tricuspid regurgitation, which was mild and observed in a cabergoline-treated patient. Nodular thickening of the right coronary cusp, noncoronary cusp or left coronary cusp of the aortic valve was observed at a similar frequency in both groups. There were no cases of extensive thickening of any valvular leaflet.
   Conclusion
   Our data demonstrates that there is no association between cabergoline treatment for hyperprolactinaemia and valvulopathy. This study therefore supports continued use of low-dose cabergoline for patients with hyperprolactinaemia.

AB  - Plastic and cosmetic surgery covers a wide range of medical interventions, dealing with either restoration of form and function or enhancing morphological characteristics. Objective complications in plastic surgery are rare as the mortality is very low, vital organs are rarely affected, and the patients are usually healthy (the purpose being usually corporal enhancement not repair). Recently an increasing number of malpractice cases had gained mass-media attention, leading to a nationwide and even international debate about the standards of healthcare in Romania. The purpose of this study is to determine the main characteristics of plastic surgery malpractice cases in Romania. Malpractice claims in plastic surgery were analyzed on a four year period (2006-2010); the cases found (13) were analyzed by using descriptive statistical methods. The study group included eight males and five females, with a medium age of 40 years; cases were divided into traumatic, cosmetic and non-traumatic. The main reason for malpractice claims was related to a medical care deficit followed by procedure deficit. Most malpractice claims were in agendo only three being ommissive and are usually due to medical negligence.

AB  - The rate-limiting and regulated step in steroidogenesis, the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, is facilitated by the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and cytochrome P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage (P450scc). We have isolated cDNAs encoding StAR and P450scc from the Atlantic stingray, Dasyatis sabina, and characterized the steroidogenic activity of the encoded proteins using a heterologous expression system. Green monkey kidney (COS-1) cells cotransfected with D. sabina StAR and human P450scc/adrenodoxin reductase/adrenodoxin fusion (F2) constructs produced significantly more pregnenolone than cells transfected with the F2 construct alone. COS-1 cells transfected with a modified F2 construct (F2DS) in which human P450scc is replaced by D. sabina P450scc had higher rates than cells transfected with D. sabina P450scc alone. In other vertebrates, the stress peptide adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) elicits its effects on corticosteroidogenesis in part through regulation of StAR and P450scc mRNAs. In vitro incubation of D. sabina interrenal tissue with porcine ACTH significantly increased intracellular cAMP and corticosteroid production. As demonstrated by quantitative PCR, ACTH also induced significant increases in mRNA abundance of both StAR and P450scc. Our results suggest that, as in higher vertebrates, chronic ACTH-induced glucocorticoid synthesis in elasmobranchs is mediated by regulation of primary steroidogenic mRNAs. This study is the first to demonstrate steroidogenic activity of an elasmobranch P450scc protein and express a composite elasmobranch steroidogenic pathway in a heterologous cell line. Also, the regulation of SCAR and P450scc mRNAs has not previously been demonstrated in elasmobranch fishes. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Thymic carcinoid is an important component of the tumor spectrum causing Ectopic ACTH Syndrome (EAS) and usually carries a poor prognosis. Efforts have been focused on exploring the mechanism of the excessive ACTH production in non-pituitary tumors, whereas few studies have reported the molecular events underlying the tumor progression. In this study, seven patients with ACTH producing thymic carcinoids were enrolled. Of note is that five of them showed either lymph node metastasis, local invasion or distant metastasis. By using cDNA profiling approach, we evaluated the expression of cell adhesion pathway genes and found a remarkable overexpression of p21-activated kinase 3 (PAK3) in all thymic carcinoids which was further confirmed at both transcriptional and translational level. RAC1, an upstream activator of PAK3, was also overexpressed in thymic carcinoids. Overexpression of PAK3 in NIH3T3 cell enhanced cell migration and invasion. Importantly, we observed c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) was activated in PAK3 transfected cells, and inhibition of JNK activity by SP600125, a JNK pathway inhibitor, abolished PAK3 mediated cell migration. Activation of JNK pathway was also detected in thymic carcinoid with high level of PAK3 expression. Our findings suggested a potential role of PAK3 in the progression of ACTH-producing thymic carcinoid.

AB  - Known as the cross-race effect (CRE), psychological research has consistently shown that people are less accurate at identifying faces of another, less familiar race. While the CRE has most often been demonstrated in recognition memory, its effects have also been found in temporally preceding social-cognitive stages-including racial categorization, perceptual discrimination, and higher-level cognitive processing. Using path models of own- and other-race face processing, the current study sought to estimate how temporally preceding processes might mediate the CRE established in recognition memory. Results demonstrated that racial categorization and higher-level cognitive processes primarily mediate the CRE in recognition memory, and that the degree of interracial contact moderated the incidence of repetition errors on other-race faces.

AB  - Three studies tested the effects of essentialist beliefs regarding the national in group in situations where a perpetrator group has inflicted harm on a victim group. For members of the perpetrator group, it was hypothesised that 'essentialism' has a direct positive association with 'collective guilt' felt as a result of misdeeds conducted by other ingroup members in the past. Simultaneously, it was hypothesised to have an indirect negative association with collective guilt, mediated by perceived threat to the in group. Considering these indirect and direct effects jointly, it was hypothesised that the negative indirect effect suppresses the direct positive effect, and that the latter would only emerge if perceived 'ingroup threat' was controlled for This was tested in a survey conducted in Latvia among Russians (N = 70) and their feelings toward how Russians had treated ethnic Latvians during the Soviet occupation; and in a survey in Germany among Germans (N = 84), focussing on their feelings toward the Holocaust. For members of the victim group, it was hypothesised that essentialism would be associated with more anger and reluctance to forgive past events inflicted on other in group members. It was proposed that this effect would be mediated by feeling connected to the ingroup victims. This was tested in a survey conducted among Hong Kong Chinese and their feelings toward the Japanese and the Nanjing massacre (N = 56). Results from all three studies supported the hypotheses.

AB  - The guinea pig spermatozoid nucleus contains actin, myosin, spectrin and cytokeratin. Also, it has been reported that phalloidin and/or 2,3-butanedione monoxime retard the sperm nuclear decondensation caused by heparin, suggesting a role for F-actin and myosin in nuclear stability. The presence of an F-actin/myosin dynamic system in these nuclei led us to search for proteins usually related to this system. In guinea pig sperm nuclei we detected calmodulin, F-actin, the myosin light chain and an actin-myosin complex. To define whether calmodulin participates in nuclear-dynamics, the effect of the calmodulin antagonists W5, W7 and calmidazolium was tested on the decondensation of nuclei promoted by either heparin or by a Xenopus laevis egg extract. All antagonists inhibited both the heparin- and the X. laevis egg extract-mediated nuclear decondensation. Heparin-mediated decondensation was faster and led to loss of nuclei. The X. laevis egg extract-promoted decondensation was slower and did not result in loss of the decondensed nuclei. It is suggested that in guinea pig sperm calmodulin participates in the nuclear decondensation process.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to understand the interrelationships between stress, hormones and basic ovarian functions in the ovary. For this purpose, we compared the expression of markers of proliferation (PCNA, cyclin B1), of apoptosis (Bax, caspase-3) and secretory activity (release of progesterone, P-4, and insulin-like growth factor, IGF-I) in whole ovarian follicles and granulosa cells cultured in conditions of normal temperature (37.5 degrees C) and feeding (with serum), high temperature (41.5 degrees C, with serum) and malnutrition (37.5 degrees C, without serum), with and without hormones [IGF-I, leptin and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)]. The expression of proliferation and apoptosis markers was evaluated by SDS PAGE-western blotting whereas radioimmunoassay (RIA) measured the release of hormones. High temperature dramatically induced a reduction in both proliferation and apoptosis markers in both ovarian follicles and granulosa cells and induced a significant increase in P-4 and IGF-I release by ovarian granulosa cells but not in P-4 secretion by ovarian follicles. Serum deprivation increased accumulation of cyclin B1 but not other markers of proliferation (PCNA) and apoptosis (Bax, caspase-3) or P-4 release in ovarian follicles. On the contrary, it inhibited the expression of apoptotic marker (Bax), release of both P-4 and IGF-I but it did not affect proliferation marker (PCNA) in granulosa cells. Adding IGF-I, leptin and FSH affected proliferation, apoptosis and secretory activity of ovarian cell functions but also prevented an inhibitory effect of high temperature on the expression of Bax and PCNA and an inhibitory action of serum deprivation on PCNA in ovarian follicles. Furthermore, treatment with these hormones prevented an inhibitory action of thermal stress on Bax, PCNA, P-4 and IGF-I in ovarian granulosa cells. The present observations (1) confirm the involvement of hormones (IGF-I, leptin and FSH) in the control of proliferation, apoptosis and secretory activity of ovarian cells, (2) demonstrate for the first time that heat stress/increased temperature can induce a reduction in ovarian cell proliferation and apoptosis and an oversecretion of ovarian hormones, (3) show that malnutrition/serum deprivation can reduce both apoptosis and secretory activity of ovarian cells, (4) demonstrate the differences in the response of granulosa and other ovarian follicular cells to stresses, and (5) are the first demonstration that hormones (IGF-I, leptin and FSH) could be used for preventing the effect of stresses on ovarian cell functions.

AB  - P>MicroRNAs have been associated to fine-tuning spatial and temporal control of gene expression during neuronal development. The neuronal Cl(-) extruding, K(+)Cl(-) co-transporter 2 (KCC2) is known to play an important role in neuronal Cl(-) homeostasis and in determining the physiological response to activation of anion selective GABA receptors. Here we show that microRNA-92 is developmentally down-regulated during maturation of rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) in vitro. Computational predictions suggest several high-ranking targets for microRNA-92 including the KCC2 gene. Consistently, the KCC2 protein levels were up-regulated in mature CGN in vitro and a functional association between microRNA-92 and KCC2 3' untranslated region was established using luciferase assays. The generation of an inward directed Cl(-) electrochemical gradient, necessary for the hyperpolarizing effect of GABA, requires robust KCC2 expression in several neuronal types. Here we show that lentiviral-mediated microRNA-92 over-expression reduced KCC2 protein levels and positively shifted reversal potential of GABA induced Cl(-) currents in CGNs. In addition KCC2 re-expression reversed microRNA-92 electrophysiological phenotype. Consistently microRNA-92 inhibition induced both an increase of the level of KCC2 and a negative shift in GABA reversal potential. These findings introduce a new player in the developmental change of GABA from depolarization to hyperpolarization.

AB  - Despite the fact that sexism is an inherently intergroup phenomenon, women's group-level responses to sexism have received relatively little empirical attention. We examine the intergroup reactions experienced by 114 female students at a U.S. university in New England who imagined being a bystander to a sexist cat-call remark or control greeting. Results indicate that women experienced greater negative intergroup emotions and motivations towards the outgroup of men after overhearing the cat-call remark. Further, the experience of group-based anger mediated the relationship between the effect of study condition on the motivation to move against, or oppose, men. Results indicate that bystanders can be affected by sexism and highlights how the collective groups of men and women can be implicated in individual instances of sexism.

AB  - Steroids exert their actions through several pathways. The classical genomic pathway, which involves binding of steroids to receptors and subsequent modulation of gene expression, is well characterized. Besides this, rapid actions of steroids have been shown to exist. Since 30 years, research on rapid actions of steroids is an emerging field of science. Today, rapid effects of steroids are well established, and are shown to exist for every type of steroid. The classical steroid receptors have been shown to be involved in rapid actions, but there is also strong evidence that unrelated structures mediate these rapid effects. Despite increasing knowledge about the mechanisms and structures which mediate these actions, there is still no unanimous acceptance of this category. This article briefly reviews the history of the field including current controversies and challenges. It is not meant as a broad review of literature, but should increase the awareness of the endocrinology society for rapid responses to steroids. As members of the organizing committee of the VI International Meeting on Rapid Responses to Steroid Hormones 2009, we propose a research agenda focusing on the identification of new receptoral structures and the identification of mechanisms of actions at physiological steroid concentrations. Additionally, efforts for the propagation of translational studies, which should finally lead to clinical benefit in the area of rapid steroid action research, should be intensified.

AB  - American undergraduate participants (N = 205) read an interview transcript and then evaluated male interviewers and a female job applicant to investigate perceptions of women who receive benevolent or hostile sexism (relative to non-sexist controls). As predicted, positive evaluations of the male interviewer in the benevolent and hostile sexist conditions negatively predicted participants' hiring decisions-an effect that was fully mediated by low ratings of applicant competence. In accord with ambivalent sexism theory's claim that women who challenge male dominance are not eligible for protective paternalism, participants' hostile sexism scores predicted lower ratings of applicant competence and hireability, but only when the interviewer was a benevolent sexist. Implications for workplace discrimination are discussed.

AB  - The expression of the novel peptide apelin and its receptor APJ within specific regions of the brain, in particular the magnocellular neurones of the hypothalamus and the circumventricular organs, has implicated the apelinergic system in mechanisms controlling fluid homeostasis. In addition, apelin and APJ are considered to be involved in controlling arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion into the circulation and release within the hypothalamic-neurohypophysial system. To clarify the role of APJ during regulation of fluid homeostasis, we compared the effects of osmotic stimulation on the urinary concentrating capacities and central nervous system responses of salt-loaded (SL) and water-deprived (WD) female APJ knockout (APJ-/-) mice and wild-type controls. SL resulted in a significantly increased urine volume in APJ-/- mice compared to wild-type controls, whereas WD in APJ-/- mice failed to reduce urine volume as seen in wild-type controls. AVP transcripts in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei and plasma AVP concentrations were significantly attenuated in SL APJ-/- mice compared to SL wild-type, but increased comparably in wild-type and APJ-/- mice after WD. Analysis of c-fos mRNA expression in the median preoptic nucleus and subfornical organ in response to either WD or SL showed attenuated expression in APJ-/- compared to wild-type mice. These findings further implicate the apelinergic system in mechanisms controlling fluid homeostasis, particularly at a neuroendocrine level, and suggest stimulus-specific involvement in vasopressinergic activity.

AB  - Five studies examined the stigmatization of materialism Participants expressed negative stereotypes of materialistic people, considering them to be more selfish and self-centered than experiential people (Study 1). Participants also viewed materialistic pursuits as more extrinsically motivated than experiential pursuits (Study 2). These stereotypes led respondents from varied demographic backgrounds to form less favorable impressions of individuals who were associated with prototypically materialistic versus experiential purchases, a result that was statistically mediated by impressions that materialistic purchases were more extrinsically motivated (Study 3). These differential impressions are primarily attributable to the denigration of materialistic people rather than the admiration of experiential people (Study 4). The stigmatization of materialism led participants to like less and enjoy interacting less with their conversation partners when discussing materialistic rather than experiential purchases (Study 5). The authors discuss these findings' implications for self-perception, accurate social perception, and well-being.

Openness, Conscientiousness and perceived societal threat to safety exerted additive effects on RWA; the relation between Openness and RWA was partially mediated by societal threat to safely and that between societal threat to safety and RWA was moderated by Openness.

AB  - Objective: Relatively little research has investigated the connection between religiosity and physical child abuse risk. Certain aspects, such as specific religious orientation or beliefs, and cognitive schema, such as socially conformist beliefs, may account for the connection that some have claimed increase religious parents' abuse potential. The current study examined whether greater Extrinsic religiosity, but not intrinsic religiosity, was associated with elevated physical abuse potential. Those who hold a literal interpretation of the Bible and attend church More frequently were also expected to evidence increased abuse risk. Additionally, the role of social conformity in mediating or moderating the association between religiosity and abuse potential was investigated.
   Methods: Two hundred and seven regularly attending Christians of various denominations completed self-report measures of religiosity, social conformity, and child abuse potential.
   Results: Findings indicate that Extrinsic religiosity was associated with increased physical abuse potential, with greater social conformity further moderating this association. Intrinsic religious orientation was not associated with abuse risk. Further, those who consider the Bible to be literally true were more socially conformist and evidenced greater abuse risk.
   Conclusions: For those working with religious parents, the particular nature of religiosity needs to be considered when interpreting a connection between religiosity and abuse risk, as well as the potential attitudes the parent holds regarding the need for conformity. Given the complexity of religiosity, future research should explore other potential mediating and moderating factors that could further clarify its connection to physical abuse risk.
   Practice implications: Clarifying how religiosity relates to child abuse risk has implications for professionals working with the vast numbers of parents for whom religion is a visible force in their daily lives. Findings from the present study suggest that professionals should consider the underlying motivation for an individual's religion as well as the importance the individual places on conformity. Religiosity per se may not be as critical to predicting physical abuse risk as selected approaches to religion or particular attitudes the religious individual assumes in their daily life.

AB  - We examine the processes involved in the development of interracial friendships. Using Reis and Shaver's intimacy model, we explore the extent to which disclosure and perceived partner responsiveness influence intimacy levels in developing interracial and intraracial friendships. White and ethnic minority participants completed diary measures of self and partner disclosure and partner responsiveness every two weeks for 10 weeks about an in-group and an out-group person whom they thought they would befriend over time. The results revealed that perceived partner responsiveness mediated the relationships between both self and partner disclosure and intimacy in interracial and intraracial relationships. The implications of these results for intergroup relations are discussed.

AB  - Although considerable evidence implicates the cytokine interlukin-18 (IL-18) in metabolic syndrome (MetS), the direct effect of IL-18 on vascular changes of MetS remains unknown. We investigated the chronic in vivo effect of IL-18 on development of MetS and vascular inflammation and remodeling by over-expressing IL-18 protein in fructose-fed rats (FFR), a model of MetS using intravenous administration of an adenovirus encoding rat IL-18. Increased serum IL-18 and vascular inflammatory response were found in FFR. Overexpression of IL-18 aggravated insulin resistance and enhance vascular inflammation and remodeling, which can be reflected by increased aortic expressions of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and enhanced infiltration of macrophages and increased aortic wall thickness and wall-to-lumen ratio. Interestingly, the levels of interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) and the activity of nucleus factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) were also significantly increased. Together, these results indicated that chronic elevated IL-18 levels at a supraphsiological concentration aggravated insulin resistance, enhanced vascular inflammation and remodeling, probably by increasing the level of IRAK1 and the activity of NF-kappa B. Targeting expression of IL-18 or its specific downstream mediators may retard the progression of MetS and its complications. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research has shown that perceived group status positively predicts competence stereotypes but does not positively predict warmth stereotypes. The present study identified circumstances in which group status positively predicts both warmth and competence judgments. Students (N = 86) rated one of two groups (psychologists vs. engineers) presented as either being low or high in social status on warmth and competence. Results showed that status positively predicted competence stereotypes for both groups, but warmth stereotypes only for psychologists, for whom warmth traits are perceived to be functional in goal achievement. Moreover, for psychologists perceived warmth mediated the relationship between status and perceived competence. Results are discussed in terms of the contextual malleability of the relationship between perceived status, warmth, and competence.

AB  - The decision to shoot a gun engages executive control processes that can be biased by cultural stereotypes and perceived threat. The neural locus of the decision to shoot is likely to be found in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), where cognition and affect converge. Male military cadets at Norwich University (N=37) performed a weapon identification task in which they made rapid decisions to shoot when images of guns appeared briefly on a computer screen. Reaction times, error rates, and electroencephalogram (EEG) activity were recorded. Cadets reacted more quickly and accurately when guns were primed by images of Middle-Eastern males wearing traditional clothing. However, cadets also made more false positive errors when tools were primed by these images. Error-related negativity (ERN) was measured for each response. Deeper ERNs were found in the medial-frontal cortex following false positive responses. Cadets who made fewer errors also produced deeper ERNs, indicating stronger executive control. Pupil size was used to measure autonomic arousal related to perceived threat. Images of Middle-Eastern males in traditional clothing produced larger pupil sizes. An image of Osama bin Laden induced the largest pupil size, as would be predicted for the exemplar of Middle East terrorism. Cadets who showed greater increases in pupil size also made more false positive errors. Regression analyses were performed to evaluate predictions based on current models of perceived threat, stereotype activation, and cognitive control. Measures of pupil size (perceived threat) and ERN (cognitive control) explained significant proportions of the variance in false positive errors to Middle-Eastern males in traditional clothing, while measures of reaction time, signal detection response bias, and stimulus discriminability explained most of the remaining variance.

AB  - A cross-sectional study (N = 61) investigated the relationship between young people's previous experiences of intergenerational contact and their willingness to engage in future contact with the elderly. Regression analyses confirmed that frequent positive intergenerational contact predicted more positive outcome expectancies, less intergroup anxiety, and more willingness to engage in future contact with elderly people. Meditation analyses confirmed that outcome expectancies mediated the influence of contact on intergenerational anxiety, and intergenerational anxiety, in turn, mediated the influence of both contact and outcome expectancies on willingness to engage in future contact with elderly people. Discussion focuses on the implications for strategies aimed at reducing ageism.

AB  - The New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense has been a cause du scandale since it was formed in the early 1990s. Indeed, the Anti-Defamation League has described it as 'the largest organized anti-Semitic and racist black militant group in America'. It is somewhat surprising, then, that there has been very little detailed analysis of the party and its activities. Mulloy begins to fill this gap by outlining the origins and development of the party, and by closely examining the ongoing dispute between the New Black Panthers and surviving members of the original Black Panther Partyestablished by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale in Oakland, California in 1966over the right to claim the name, the history and the legacy of the Panthers in the United States. Critically assessing the strategies and actions of the New Black Panthers, Mulloy argues that its high-profile, media-centred approach to political activism has largely been a failure with regard to its overall aim of reviving the Black Power movement in the United States.

AB  - The present research demonstrated that cognitive complexity is related to the perception of contemporary, subtle racism. Results indicated that the perception of subtle racism was related to attributional complexity. Further, greater attributional complexity was also related to greater racial complexity, defined as the ability of individuals to overcome the normative assumption that racism is no longer a major social problem in the United States and the extent that individuals think about racism. The relationship between attributional complexity and racial complexity held even when accounting for need for cognition, perspective taking, empathy, and political ideology. Finally, we found that racial complexity mediated the effect of attributional complexity on the perception of subtle racism. Taken together, the results of these three studies contribute a general cognitive mechanism related to the perception of subtle racism; an extension of cognitive and attributional complexity; and a new construct, racial complexity, related to the perception of contemporary, subtle racism.

AB  - Spermatogenic impairment and the apoptotic pathways involved in establishing sterility of male hybrids obtained from crossing Graomys griseoflavus females with Graomys centralis males were studied. Testes from G. centralis, G. griseoflavus and hybrids were compared at different ages. Terminal transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling assay (TUNEL), Fas, Bax and cytochrome c labelling were used for apoptosis evaluation, and calbindin D-28k staining as an anti-apoptotic molecule. In 1-month-old animals, spermatocytes were positive for all apoptotic markers, but moderate TUNEL (+) spermatocyte frequency was only found in G. centralis. At subsequent ages, the apoptotic markers were downregulated in testes from parental cytotypes, but not in hybrid testes. TUNEL (+) spermatocytes were present at 78% and 44% per tubule cross-section in 2- and 3-month-old hybrid animals, respectively. Pachytene spermatocyte death in adult hybrids occurs via apoptosis, as revealed by high caspase-3 expression. Calbindin was highly expressed in spermatocytes of adult hybrids, in which massive cell death occurs via apoptosis. Calbindin co-localisation with TUNEL or Fas, Bax and cytochrome c was very limited, suggesting an inverse regulation of calbindin and apoptotic markers. Hybrid sterility is due to breakdown of spermatogenesis at the pachytene spermatocyte stage. Both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are involved in apoptosis of spermatocytes, which are the most sensitive cell type to apoptotic stimuli.

AB  - Public opinion surrounding two of the most well-known gay rights issuessame-sex marriage and adoption by gays and lesbiansvaries widely: About 30% of the public favors same-sex marriage, while about 50% favors adoption. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the demographic variables that predict attitudes toward same-sex marriage and adoption by gays and lesbians. Political ideology and attendance at religious services emerged as the strongest predictors. However, a close examination of the two issues shows that there were important differences between them. These differences may aid gay rights advocates in crafting media campaigns designed to increase support for same-sex marriage.

AB  - This article highlights the role of sexual orientation in the social transmutation of space, thereby illustrating how certain landscapes, generally characterised by heteronormativity, are queered by cultural phenomena such as the Pink Loerie Mardi Gras (PLMG) in Knysna. It is, however, not the intent of this article to describe the processes of producing queer space in a 'celebratory' tone only, but also to investigate the manner in which hierarchies of race, class, gender and especially sexual orientation are sometimes re-asserted in relation to such spatial practices. The power-laden binaries initially disrupted by the queering of space can, in fact, revert when the PLMG is employed as a mechanism that attempts to control, discipline or even normalise queer bodies. It seems that capitalist role-players (such as corporate sponsors and other stakeholders in the tourism industry) seek to manage the PLMG in terms of 'how much' space it occupies and who is represented (and therefore included or excluded from this space). This leads one to critique the supposed 'Otherness' of the PLMG, because if it is influenced by prejudiced ideologies of consumerism and cosmopolitanism that ultimately operate in favour of heteronormativity and what it considers to be 'different enough', then to what extent can the festival legitimately or freely call itself 'queer'?

AB  - Wade examines the presence and absence of race, and David Theo Goldberg's thesis in The Threat of Race that racism under neoliberalism continues in hidden form, not named as such. Wade argues that Goldberg's approach privileges an overly institutional presence for race and thus loses sight of the real and continuing presence of race in contemporary societies, especially notable in biotechnological and genomic contexts. This depends on defining race in a clear way, so that it can be recognized when it is present: race is not about biology, but about a constant movement between nature and culture, mediated by classifications of Others, based on histories of western colonialism and postcolonialism. Wade goes on to argue that, in Latin America, racialized difference is, if anything, made more explicit in the context of what Charles Hale has labelled 'neoliberal multiculturalism'.

AB  - Silvio Berlusconi's use of ethnicity and immigration as national security issues in his successful campaign for election to the Italian presidency in 2008 was by no means unique in contemporary Europe. What was surprising was the speed of his right-wing government's legislative restriction of migrants in the form of the so-called 'security package', first introduced just five weeks after the election. Woodcock explores the striking fact that this 'security package', and the intense wave of racist violence by Italians against Roma that it legitimized and encouraged, was proposed and justified in response to media reports of Italian babies being stolen by 'Zingari' from the 'nomad camps' and of Italian women being raped and beaten by Romanian men of 'Zingari' ethnicity. Gender and ethnicity are the twin constitutive discourses of modern European society, and racialized subjects are necessarily gendered. The stereotype of 'dangerous black men sexually threatening white women' has been mobilized in a vast range of European and colonial nationalist projects in order to justify the policing of both racialized masculine subjects and women as objects of the patriarchy. Similarly, the depiction of women as hysterical, sexually vulnerable objects in need of (white) masculine protection is an old story that the Italian media recognize as a fairy tale even as they reproduce the discourse. Woodcock explores what has not been mentioned thus far, namely, that gender stereotypes are vital to the mobilization of violent racism against the Roma in contemporary Italy, and how conservative gender binaries are strengthened and policed in a time of social crisis through the stereotyping of Roma as racial threat.

AB  - There is a growing push within the social sciences to conduct translational science that not only advances theory but also achieves real world impact. The goals of this paper are (a) to encourage scholars to engage in translational science by conducting research that responds to pressing social challenges, and (b) to provide concrete recommendations on how to incorporate such practices into their research programs. To do this, we bring together perspectives of academics and practitioners who have experience merging science with practice. We begin by defining what translational science is, describing the benefits of engaging in translational science for peace and conflict studies, and highlighting past research that has done this successfully. Next, we describe various aspects of conducting translational science, such as how researchers can partner with nonacademic stakeholders to create social impact and advance scientific theory, and how they can disseminate findings for public impact. We also address key challenges researchers might face when conducting translational research and provide practical tips that social scientists can use to effectively engage in what we coined the "Bruneauian" approach for how to address such challenges. Specifically, we focus on the skills needed for study design and deployment, how researchers can sensitively interact with vulnerable communities, statistical and methodological considerations, logistical challenges, and how to develop relationships with practitioners. Finally, we conclude with a practitioner's perspective on how to foster these types of relationships.

AB  - Stereotype is a type of social bias massively present in texts that computational models use. There are stereotypes that present special difficulties because they do not rely on personal attributes. This is the case of stereotypes about immigrants, a social category that is a preferred target of hate speech and discrimination. We propose a new approach to detect stereotypes about immigrants in texts focusing not on the personal attributes assigned to the minority but in the frames, that is, the narrative scenarios, in which the group is placed in public speeches. We have proposed a fine-grained social psychology grounded taxonomy with six categories to capture the different dimensions of the stereotype (positive vs. negative) and annotated a novel StereoImmigrants dataset with sentences that Spanish politicians have stated in the Congress of Deputies. We aggregate these categories in two supracategories: one is Victims that expresses the positive stereotypes about immigrants and the other is Threat that expresses the negative stereotype. We carried out two preliminary experiments: first, to evaluate the automatic detection of stereotypes; and second, to distinguish between the two supracategories of immigrants' stereotypes. In these experiments, we employed state-of-the-art transformer models (monolingual and multilingual) and four classical machine learning classifiers. We achieve above 0.83 of accuracy with the BETO model in both experiments, showing that transformers can capture stereotypes about immigrants with a high level of accuracy.

AB  - As government welfare programming contracts and NGOs increasingly assume core aid functions, they must address a long-standing challenge-that people in need often belong to stigmatized groups. To study other-regarding behavior, we fielded an experiment through a text-to-give campaign in Greece. Donations did not increase with an appeal to the in-group (Greek child) relative to a control (child), but they were halved with reference to a stigmatized out-group (Roma child). An appeal to fundamental rights, a common advocacy strategy, did not reduce the generosity gap. Donations to all groups were lower near Roma communities and declined disproportionately for the Roma appeal. Qualitative research in 12 communities complements our experiment. We conclude that NGO fundraising strategies that narrowly emphasize either in-groups or out-groups, or fundamental rights language, may not be as effective as broader appeals, and we discuss implications for public goods provision in an era of growing nationalism.

AB  - Gender is many things to many people. It is at once uniting and divisive. Gender in advertising presents a range of opportunities for marketers but is linked inextricably to concepts of masculinity-femininity and sexuality and has the potential to create strong positive or negative responses from different audiences. Using an experimental methodology, this study examines how depictions of gender and sexuality combine to influence consumer attitudes. The findings demonstrate how individuals' political ideology determines their emotional response to such advertisements and that the resulting emotional response and attitude to the advertisement act as causal mechanisms responsible for product-related attitudes.

AB  - This paper presents the Sensory Interactive Table (SIT): an instrumented, interactive dining table. Through the use of load cells and LEDs that are embedded in the table surface, SIT allows us to study: (1) the eating behaviors of people in a social setting, (2) the social interactions around the eating behaviors of people in a social setting, and (3) the continuous cycle of feedback through LEDs on people's eating behavior and their response to this feedback in real time, to ultimately create an effective dietary support system. This paper presents the hard- and software specifications of the system, and it shows the potential of the system to capture mass-related dimensions in real time and with high accuracy and spatial resolution.

AB  - Misinformation - information that is false or inaccurate - can continue to influence people's memory and reasoning even after it has been corrected. Researchers have termed this the continued influence effect (CIE). However, to date, research has focused exclusively on examining the CIE in a single polarity, namely the ongoing effect of initially affirmed material that is later negated. No research has yet examined how reliance on outdated information may be affected if this polarity is reversed, that is, if initially-negated information is reinstated. It also remains unclear how participants' pre-existing beliefs may impact the acceptance of a correction, with prior evidence showing conflicting results. To investigate these questions, across two experiments we presented participants scoring high versus low on measures of relevant attitudes with fictional news reports that contained a piece of critical attitude-relevant information. This information was either true throughout, false throughout, initially-affirmed then retracted, or initially-negated then reinstated. Participants' reliance on the critical information was subsequently measured with the use of inferential-reasoning items. Reinstatement of initially-negated information was insufficient to bring reliance on that information to a baseline level - that is, reliance on information presented as true throughout was greater than reliance on negated and then reinstated information. This result was symmetrical with the conventional CIE observed with a reversed polarity. The effect of participants' pre-existing attitudes on continued reliance was equivocal. The results therefore suggest that the CIE is not contingent on polarity, raising questions about the cognitive mechanisms underlying the effect.

AB  - Lookism refers to discrimination based on appearance. This study explored the factors that may lead individuals to accept lookism in the selfie era in which the importance of appearance is increasingly emphasized. Selfie culture, especially exposure rather than production, was suggested as a new phenomenon that reinforces the premium of beauty. Then this study tested how selfie exposure (present) interacts with individual personality (constant) and behavior (past) to influence the acceptance of lookism over time. Self-esteem (constant personality) and cosmetic procedures (past behavior) were chosen as factors that may affect lookism acceptance. A two-wave online panel survey was conducted in Korea among females aged 20 to 39 (N = 1064 and 782). Selfie exposure at Wave 1 was positively associated with lookism acceptance at Wave 2 only among those who were least likely to accept lookism: individuals with high self-esteem and no cosmetic procedures. Selfie culture has potential to lead people furthest from lookism to accept discrimination in favor of attractive people.

AB  - This study used the 2017 Las Vegas and 2016 Orlando mass shootings as case studies to explore alleged double standards in reporting of events featuring Muslim and non-Muslim mass perpetrators of violence. The study used framing theory and content analysis to examine Los Angeles Times and New York Times coverage of the shootings during the one week immediately following each event. Findings are consistent with previous literature and the researchers' expectations. The Orlando shooting, carried out by a Muslim, was allotted more coverage despite the fact that it produced nine fewer fatalities than the Las Vegas shooting, perpetrated by a white non-Muslim. The analysis also showed that the examined newspapers were more likely to employ a "terrorism" frame in their coverage of the Orlando shooting than in their coverage of the Las Vegas shooting; link the Orlando mass shooting with the global war on terrorism; and to humanize Stephen Paddock, the white perpetrator of the Las Vegas shooting. Framing differences found in this study may contribute to downplaying the threat of white male gun violence, and to reinforcing fears of Islam and Muslims.

AB  - The Internet poses a number of challenges for academics. Internet specificities such as anonymity, the decontextualisation of discourse, the misuse or non-use of references raise methodological questions about the quality and the authenticity of the data available online. This is particularly true when dealing with extremist groups and grass-root militants that cultivate secrecy. Based on a study of the far-right on Twitter, this article explores these methodological issues. It discusses the qualitative indicators we have developed to determine whether a given Twitter account should be included in the sample or not. By using digital traces drawn from profiles, interactions, content and through other visual information, we recontextualize user's profile and analyze how digital traces participate in providing far right ideas with a wider representation.

AB  - Studies assessing citizens' attitudes towards Europe have mostly used explicit concepts and measures. However, psychologists have shown that human behaviour is not only determined by explicit attitudes which can be assessed via self-report, but also by implicit attitudes which require indirect measurement. We combine a self-report questionnaire with an implicit Affective Misattribution Procedure for the first time in an online environment to estimate the reliability, validity and predictive power of this implicit measure for the explanation of European Union-skeptical behaviour. Based on a survey with a sample representative for Germany, we found evidence for good reliability and validity of the implicit measure. In addition, the implicit attitude had a significant incremental impact beyond explicit attitudes on citizens' proneness to engage in EU-skeptical information and voting behaviour.

AB  - We investigated the effects of antiforeigner political advertisements on implicit and explicit stereotypes. While stereotypical associations may become automatically activated (implicit stereotypes), individuals can reject these thoughts and decide not to use them for an overtly expressed judgment (explicit stereotypes). We hypothesized that even if citizens negated stereotypical content, advertisements might still affect implicit stereotypes. This hypothesis was tested using an experiment where participants (N = 186) were exposed to zero, two, four, or six stereotypical advertisements. The results showed that stereotypical advertisements did not influence explicit stereotypes but did influence implicit stereotypes, even in critical recipients who negated the stereotypical content.

AB  - Background: Thyroid surgery is common, but complications may occur. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a minimally invasive alternative to surgery. We hypothesized that an optimized HIFU device could be safe and effective for ablating benign thyroid nodules without affecting neighboring structures.
   Methods: In this open, single-center feasibility study, 25 patients were treated with HIFU with real-time ultrasound imaging 2 weeks before a scheduled thyroidectomy for multinodular goiter. Thyroid ultrasonography imaging, thyroid function, were evaluated before and after treatment. Adverse events were carefully recorded. Each patient received HIFU for one thyroid nodule, solid or mixed, with mean diameter >= 8 mm, and no suspicion of malignancy. The HIFU device was progressively adjusted with stepwise testing. The energy level for ablation ranged from 35 to 94 J/pulse for different groups of patients. One pathologist examined all removed thyroids.
   Results: Three patients discontinued treatment due to pain or skin microblister. Among the remaining 22 patients, 16 showed significant changes by ultrasound. Macroscopic and histological examinations showed that all lesions were confined to the targeted nodule without affecting neighboring structures. At pathological analysis, the extent of nodule destruction ranged from 2% to 80%. Five out of 22 patients had over 20% pathological lesions unmistakably attributed to HIFU. Seventeen cases had putative lesions including nonspecific necrosis, hemorrhage, nodule detachment, cavitations, and cysts. Among these 17 cases, 12 had both ultrasound changes and cavitation at histology that may be expected for an HIFU effect. In the last three patients ablated at the highest energy level, significant ultrasound changes and complete coagulative necrosis were observed in 80%, 78%, and 58% of the targeted area, respectively. There were no major complications of ablation.
   Conclusion: This study showed the potential efficacy of HIFU for human thyroid nodule ablation. Lesions were clearly visible by histology and ultrasound after high energy treatments, and safety and tolerability were good. We identified a power threshold for optimal necrosis of the target thyroid tissue. Further studies are ongoing to assess nodule changes at longer follow-up times.

AB  - We assessed whether the COVID-19 outbreak in the United Kingdom was associated with a rise in sinophobic hate crimes as well as the temporal distribution of victimization rates. A victimization survey (N = 393) showed that following the first known case of COVID-19 in the United Kingdom, Chinese/East Asian persons had a higher likelihood of being hate crime or incident victims than members of other ethnic minority groups. Specifically, victimization reported by Chinese/East Asian participants reached its highest level in March 2020 (before lockdown); it then dropped significantly after an initial relaxation of restrictions in May 2020. Overall, we documented a temporary, potentially slightly delayed hate crime trigger effect of the COVID-19 outbreak.

AB  - The current study uses data from The British Broadcasting Corporation Loneliness Experiment to explore the social stigma of loneliness and how it varies by gender, age and cultural individualism. We examined stigmatizing judgements of people who are lonely (impressions of those who feel lonely and attributions for loneliness), perceived stigma in the community and self-stigma (shame for being lonely and inclination to conceal loneliness), while controlling for participants' own feelings of loneliness. The scores on most measures fell near the mid-point of the scales, but stigmatizing perceptions depended on the measure of stigmatization that was used and on age, gender and country-level individualism. Multilevel analyses revealed that men had more stigmatizing perceptions, more perceived community stigma, but less self-stigma than women; young people had higher scores than older people on all indicators except for internal versus external attributions and people living in collectivist countries perceived loneliness as more controllable and perceived more stigma in the community than people living in individualistic countries. Finally, young men living in individualistic countries made the most internal (vs. external) attributions for loneliness. We discuss the implications of these findings for understandings of loneliness stigma and interventions to address loneliness.

AB  - The study examines whether qualitative and quantitative characteristics of intercultural service encounters (ISEs) between majority customers and ethnic minority service providers are associated with better attitudes toward the entire minority group. The study was conducted in Israel through an online survey of 402 respondents. The study revealed that the customers derived pleasure from high perceived value of services and from taking advantage of a good deal. This pleasure, in turn, was positively related to attitudes toward the outgroup. High perceived value of service was associated with higher frequency of ISE that may be interpreted as repurchasing behavior. Overall, the total effect of perceived value of services between majority population and ethnic minority on attitudes toward this minority was significant and positive. Thus, economic beneficiality, which is a very important component of ISE, may contribute to improving relationships between groups in deep conflict.

AB  - Y Multiple terror attacks rocked London in 2017. These attacks brought to the forefront of public consciousness London Mayor Sadiq Khan's unique identity as a Muslim leader confronting Islamic terrorism in a Western city. Through theoretical lenses of restorative rhetoric and the Disaster Communication Intervention Framework, this rhetorical criticism analyzes how Khan situated himself as a rhetorical symbol against terrorism while crafting a vision of unity and resilience rooted in diversity. By analyzing Khan's anti-terrorism rhetoric in 2017 and the years prior, we explore how Khan used personal identity in his calls for collective response to disaster. The study contributes to scholarly understanding of how political leaders respond to disasters and offers practical guidelines for leaders working to foster post-disaster resilience in diverse communities.

AB  - Surveys conducted across multiple countries show that most people view seeking lower immigration to help maintain the majority group's population share as a sign of racial self-interest-as opposed to racism. We investigated whether the belief that it is not racist to want immigration restrictions for cultural reasons is associated with ingroup identification (a positive attachment to and solidarity with one's group) or collective narcissism (a conviction that the ingroup is exceptional and deserves special treatment). We argue that if this belief reflects concern for the ingroup, it should be linked to ingroup identification. However, if it is a defensive justification of the ingroup's privileged position, it should be linked to collective narcissism. Across four studies, national (Study 1: United Kingdom, N = 467; Study 2: Poland, N = 1,285) and ethnic (Study 3a: United States, N = 2,000; Study 3b: United States, N = 2,938) narcissism emerged as predictors of the belief that ethnoculturally motivated immigration restrictions are racial self-interest (vs. racism). This belief was also associated with justifying collective violence against migrants (Study 2) and supporting the alt-right (Studies 3a-3b). We found less consistent evidence for an association between ingroup identification and immigration-restriction beliefs. We discuss implications for intergroup relations and political extremism.

AB  - Stigmatization of one or more discredited attributes has a profoundly negative social impact on stigmatized individuals. Researchers have applied narratives as a persuasion device to reduce stigma. However, the overall effect of narratives on stigma is yet known. This research synthesized and quantified the effect of narratives in reducing stigma and identifies moderating factors. Forty-six effect sizes were extracted from 40 articles investigating the effect of narratives on stigmatization in various stigmatized conditions. A small effect of narratives on reducing stigma was yielded, which indicated that narratives were effective in reducing stigma. Narratives constructed with the first-person point of view were to be superior in reducing stigma. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Polynczuk-Alenius's article contributes to a better understanding of the racist moment in Poland that began in the aftermath of the 'refugee crisis' in 2015. It does so by zooming in on Christian far-right discourse and reconstructing a cognitive map of the social world manufactured therein. To this end, it analyses the blog of the former Catholic priest Jacek Miedlar, now a far-right activist and one of the leaders of the anti-refugee movement. In doing so, the article relies on two compatible bodies of research that have rarely been used together. Theoretically, the article approaches Christian far-right discourse as an articulation of the paranoid style and concentrates on its conspiratorial aspect. Analytically, it uses the fourfold model of authoritarian communication developed by the Frankfurt School to dissect systematically the conspiratorial tale expounded on Miedlar's blog. Accordingly, the empirical analysis of 116 blog posts treats the following themes: 1) the discontent diagnosed by Miedlar (anti-Polonism, epitomized by the suppression of nationalist and Christian values in favour of European universalism); 2) the alleged operators of anti-Polonism (the Jewish-orchestrated conspiracy bent on dominating the world and its puppets); 3) the movement that will rise up against this cabal (namely, the Polish Catholic nationalists armed with conservative values); and 4) the leader of the struggle (Miedlar himself as a Christ-like martyr figure). The article concludes that the anti-Muslim discourse, premised on an appeal to racist sentiments, served as a gateway into the conspiratorial, deeply antisemitic world-view of the Christian far-right milieu. In Poland, as elsewhere, such a world-view, stored and transmitted through the fringe far-right discourse, usually seems to gain traction in wider society during times of crisis.

AB  - Authoritarianism emerges in times of societal threat, in part driven by desires for group-based security. As such, we propose that the threat caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased authoritarian tendencies and that this can be partially explained by increased national identification. We tested this hypothesis by collecting cross-sectional data from three different countries in April 2020. In Study 1, data from Ireland (N = 1276) showed that pandemic threat predicted increased national identification, which in turn predicted authoritarianism. In Study 2, we replicated this indirect effect in a representative UK sample (N = 506). In Study 3, we used an alternative measure of authoritarianism and conceptually replicated this effect among USA citizens (N = 429). In this US sample, the association between threat and authoritarian tendencies was stronger among progressives compared to conservatives. Findings are discussed and linked to group-based models of authoritarianism.

AB  - What can enhance positive inter-group contacts in a world of mass immigration is a subject high on the theoretical and practical agenda. However, there is a lack of research examining how contacts with different immigrant groups are related to characteristics of the group, as perceived by the receiving society. Using Threat-Benefit Theory (Tartakovsky & Walsh, 2016a, 2016b, 2019, 2020), the present study examines how different domains of positive and negative appraisal of a specific immigrant group may relate to contacts with group members. Using a representative sample of 1600 adults in the majority of the Jewish population in Israel, we applied network analysis to examine relationships between threat-benefit appraisal, opportunities for contact and levels of positive and negative contacts with four immigrant groups: diaspora immigrants from Ethiopia, Western countries and the former Soviet Union and asylum seekers. Levels of contact were related to particular domains of appraisal, which differed across immigrant groups. However, opportunities for contact had a stronger association with contact than the appraisal. Results point to a theoretical need to develop nuanced models related to inter-group contact, which consider particular characteristics of the immigrant group as perceived by the local population.

AB  - Introduction: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted to evaluate the factor structure of Spanish translation and adaptation of the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI) in a sample of Colombian adults. Method: The sample of the study was n 968. Respondents were aged between 18 and 52 years old (M-age=22.81, SD=4.42). Descriptive analyses, confirmatory factor analysis, and Cronbach's Alpha calculation were carried out. Results: Internal consistency for the global scale was high (alpha=.89). Likewise, the coefficients of the Alternative factor and the Control factor were similar (alpha=.90, 95% CI=.89-.90 and alpha=.83, 95% CI=.81-.85, respectively). A two-factor structure performed best according to the results of model selection criteria. This model suggested the existence of two correlated factors, with correlated items within factors (Item19 similar to Item20 and Item8 similar to Item10) Conclusions: Overall, the results suggest that the CFI scale exhibits construct validity and adequate reliability, both for the general scale and the subscales in the Colombian sample, enabling their use in contexts such as clinical or research.

AB  - Definitions of violence are contested, ranging from minimalistic conceptions privileging physical attacks to more comprehensive approaches recognizing a broad array of physical, sexual, psychological, and economic violations. Investigating the phenomenon of violence against women in politics, I theorize semiotic violence as a fifth form of violence against women, one that mobilizes sexist words and images to injure, discipline, and subjugate women. While perpetrated against individual women, these acts amplify gender inequalities by suggesting to the general public that women as a group are unworthy. Drawing on research in multiple disciplines, as well as a global database of news items collected between 2014 and 2019, I identify two modes of semiotic violence: rendering women invisible and rendering women incompetent. The first seeks to erase women as political actors and deny their right to speak and be heard in political debates. The second rejects women's qualifications to serve in political roles based on gendered tropes related to temperament, knowledge, sexual objectification, and femininity. Semiotic violence is not only part of a broader continuum of violence, I suggest, but also the most widespread, concealed, and trivialized form of violence against women. Recognizing semiotic violence is thus important for both feminist research and activism, creating new vocabularies to speak about women's experiences-and, in turn, challenging the structural inequalities that normalize these harms.

AB  - Focusing on the Muslim Other in Amsterdam, the article explores how individual young Muslims embody their agency in the forms of micro-practices and socio-spatial relations. By highlighting the spatio-corporeal aspects of Muslims' presence within urban space, our ethnography foregrounds how young Muslims negotiate identities and belonging within everyday urban spaces of encounter. Dealing with the everyday panoptical white Othering gaze, we describe a range of "unremarkable" ordinary practices and everyday small agencies that young Muslims in Amsterdam adopt including invisibility, challenging whiteness, and accumulating whiteness.

AB  - In this study, we explore how ethnic minority Muslim girls in Norway manage social control as an everyday experience within a political context where minority communities are portrayed as performing excessive control. Theoretically, our analysis draws on perspectives on social control, interactionist perspectives on identity, and Hage's (2010. "The Affective Politics of Racial Mis-interpellation." Theory, Culture & Society 27 (7-8): 112-129. doi:10.1177/0263276410383713) concept of vacillation. Based on interviews with 17 girls self-identifying as Muslim, we identify two strategic positions from which the girls manage and respond to social control. From what we label a pragmatic position, they oppose categorisation as victims as well as certain gendered norms in minority as well as majority contexts. From what we label a pious position, the girls employ religious norms as a rationale when they define themselves as moral subjects rising above social control. We also find that negotiating contradictory norms and expectations may be perceived as double-bind situations (Bateson, G. 2000 [1972]. Steps to an Ecology of Mind: Collected Essays in Anthropology, Psychiatry, Evolution, and Epistemology. Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press), leaving the girls in an affective state that we label 'pissed off'. Our analysis contributes to the literature by connecting the concept of vacillation to youth's identity work in a minority position, and more specifically to the strategic positionings Muslim girls speak from as they manage social control.

AB  - Disapproval of others' beliefs and practices is an inevitable consequence of living with diversity, and the ability to tolerate, or put up with, these differences is crucial to maintain a functional society. Considering reasons to condone what one disapproves of is considered a key aspect of tolerance. Across three national samples (N = 1,708), the current research examines how recognizing arguments to support practices that one disapproves of increases tolerance. Studies 1-2 demonstrate that when participants generate arguments to support Muslim minority practices (Study 1) and Orthodox Protestant minority practices (Study 2), they disapprove of, they show increased tolerance towards such practices in society. In Study 3, the importance of considerations is experimentally extended by demonstrating that perceiving objectionable behaviour as more reasonable increases tolerance. Collectively, these studies demonstrate the importance of engaging in and perceiving reasonable considerations to enhance tolerance of dissenting beliefs or practices.

AB  - Despite the legalization of same-sex marriage in the United States (U.S.) and an increasing number of out gay and lesbian business leaders, we have little knowledge of the role played by leaders' same-sex sexual orientation in the leadership process. To fill this important research void, we drew from a recent theoretical model on leaders' sexual orientation and conducted four experimental studies designed to test and retest whether leaders' same-sex sexual orientation affects followers' leadership perceptions and conformity to influence attempts, and how the intersectionality of leaders' same-sex sexual orientation with leaders' gender orientation and follower characteristics may modify the influences of leaders' same-sex sexual orientation on the follower outcomes. Based on over 2,100 working adults in the U.S., the results of the four studies, where leaders were depicted as charismatic, indicate that leaders' same-sex sexual orientation could have negative impacts on the follower outcomes. However, same-sex sexual orientation leaders did not suffer double stigma penalization by having additional marginalized identities (e.g., also being women). Female followers were more supportive of same-sex sexual orientation leaders than male followers. Our research advances knowledge of and responds to calls for more research attention to leader sexual orientation in the leadership process. Research and practical implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - This study explores the country-specific, regional and cultural differences and similarities between China and two European countries in their coverage of the European refugee issue and seeks to provide a deeper understanding of the various political interests, social values, and journalism cultures in the countries under study. It analyzed and compared 2,368 news articles in Belgian, Swedish, and Chinese newspapers from 2015 to 2017. The analysis demonstrated that Chinese newspapers put less emphasis on welcoming the refugees by politicians and citizens, but are more prone to report on Islamic religion in their coverage of the refugees than the Belgian and Swedish newspapers. The empirical evidence suggests that the differences in reporting are not only a representation of different political interests and social engagement of the three countries, but, to a large extent, a result of different journalism cultures across nations.

AB  - How can ethnic reconciliation be achieved in conflict settings where populations are physically separated? We address this question by examining the role of "extended contact"-a form of indirect contact which entails learning about the contact experiences of others-in the context of Cyprus's frozen conflict. We field a survey experiment in order to test two pathways through which extended contact works: (1) by helping build a common identity; and (2) by activating empathy. We find that our treatments are associated with greater trust in the outgroup and greater support for cross-ethnic interaction, but only among segments of the population that are initially less favorable toward reconciliation.

AB  - Intercollegiate sport in the US is known to be heteronormative, heterosexist, and often an unwelcoming space for LGBTQ individuals, including coaches. A decade ago, scholars documented the scarcity of LGBTQ family narratives in online coaching biographies on athletics Web sites. In the years following, a socio-cultural and legal shift occurred pertaining to LGBTQ rights and visibility in the US. This study extends and replicates Calhoun et al.'s research by examining family narratives of a sample of all NCAA Division-I head coaches of women's teams (N = 3601). Data collected in 2018 as part of the annual Women in College Coaching Report Card (TM) illustrated despite socio-cultural changes, very few (n = 18, .05%) online biographies included a same-sex family narratives-all were women. Eleven of the 18 head coaches were interviewed, and Erving Goffman's work was employed to theoretically ascertain why and how these women managed identities, stigma, enacted power, and performed character, namely courage. Implications and future research are offered.

AB  - The present study aimed to examine the link between metastereotypes of international students and their intergroup intentions and adjustment within the receiving country, considering the role of intercultural communication apprehension with host majority members. Participants were 191 international PhD students in Italy. All of them completed a questionnaire measuring positive and negative metastereotypes referred to their group (i.e., international students), intercultural communication apprehension, psychological adjustment, self-disclosure, and contact intentions with Italian majority members. Path analysis showed that the effects of positive and negative metastereotypes were not completely symmetrical. Positive metastereotypes were directly linked to self-disclosure and intended contact, while negative metastereotypes presented a direct link to psychological adjustment. Nevertheless, both of them were related to intercultural communication apprehension, which in turn was associated with psychological adjustment and willingness to communicate personal information and to have contacts with Italians. These findings proved that metastereotypes can be implicated in international students' intergroup relations and adjustment, with some differences between negative and positive beliefs. It is also the latter that interventions should address to improve international students' psychological well-being and intergroup relations within the receiving country.

AB  - This research investigated whether ingroup norm moderates the effect of positive or prosocial interactions on the understanding of intergroup prosocial behaviors. Among four experiments in three different cultural samples (U.S. Americans, Kosovan Serbs, and Kosovan Albanians; N = 808), results showed that participants attributed fewer prosocial motives and reported less willingness to accept help when the helper was an outgroup than an ingroup member. However, these effects were weaker or nonsignificant in the tolerant norm condition, as compared to the intolerant norm or control conditions. In addition, participants were more willing to interact with the outgroup (vs. ingroup) helper in the tolerant norm condition, as compared to the intolerant norm or control conditions. Finally, normative expectations, the attribution of prosocial motives to the helper, and the anticipated quality of the interaction with the helper sequentially explained the observed effects. The theoretical and practical implications of these results for intergroup help and intergroup contact literature are discussed.

AB  - Across two studies (n = 555), we examine the detrimental effects of the "angry black woman" stereotype in the workplace. Drawing on parallel-constraint-satisfaction theory, we argue that observers will be particularly sensitive to expressions of anger by black women due to widely held stereotypes. In Study 1, we examine a three-way interaction among anger, race, and gender, and find that observers are more likely to make internal attributions for expressions of anger when an individual is a black woman, which then leads to worse performance evaluations and assessments of leadership capability. In Study 2, we focus solely on women and expand our initial model by examining stereotype activation as a mechanism linking the effects of anger and race on internal attributions. We replicated findings from Study 1 and found support for stereotype activation as an underlying mechanism. We believe our work contributes to research on race, gender, and leadership, and highlights an overlooked stereotype in the management literature. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Objectives: Despite the fact that Christopher Columbus did not discover America and was arguably one of the most brutal colonizers in recorded history, the United States continues to celebrate a holiday in his honor. A growing movement by Native American activists and allies aims to adopt Indigenous Peoples Day in lieu of Columbus Day to shed light on historical inaccuracies, acknowledge the legacy of colonialism, and celebrate Indigenous Peoples. Research suggests that national narratives, such as those undergirding Columbus Day, build on negative stereotypes about minoritized groups to help bolster national identities. We examined whether national identification and negative stereotyping of Native Americans shapes support for each holiday. Method: We conducted 2 large-scale national studies (Study 1: college students, N = 4,625; Study 2: adults, N = 2,805). Results: Across both samples, people who endorsed the continued celebration of Columbus Day and people who were least supportive of adopting Indigenous Peoples Day were those high in national identification. In contrast, people who endorsed eliminating Columbus Day and people who supported adopting Indigenous Peoples Day were relatively low in national identification who also believed that negative stereotypes about Native Americans were highly unacceptable (Studies 1 and 2) and/or inaccurate (Study 2). Conclusions: The results suggest that garnering support for eliminating Columbus Day and adopting Indigenous Peoples Day requires inter-rogating the roots of national identification and rejecting negative stereotypes about Native Americans. Implications for why people continue to hold onto national narratives that reify the continued subordination of minority groups are discussed.

AB  - We describe a method of implementing the axisymmetric evolution of general-relativistic hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics through modification of a multipatch grid scheme. In order to ease the computational requirements required to evolve the post-merger phase of systems involving binary compact massive objects in numerical relativity, it is often beneficial to take advantage of these system's tendency to rapidly settle into states that are nearly axisymmetric, allowing for 2D evolution of secular timescales. We implement this scheme in the spectral Einstein code and show the results of application of this method to four test systems including viscosity, magnetic fields, and neutrino radiation transport. Our results show that this method can be used to quickly allow already existing 3D infrastructure that makes use of local coordinate system transformations to be made to run in axisymmetric 2D with the flexible grid creation capabilities of multipatch methods. Our code tests include a simple model of a binary neutron star postmerger remnant, for which we confirm the formation of a massive torus which is a promising source of post-merger ejecta.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of journalists' gender on the perceived credibility of news articles. In an experiment, participants evaluated the credibility of two different news articles with a typical male and female topic either written by a female or male journalist. News articles written by male journalists were perceived as significantly more credible overall, but especially when the article had a typical male topic. Both effects were stronger for female participants than for male participants. Younger male participants rated female journalists overall as less credible compared to older male participants. The experiment highlights that audiences still have a preconceived idea about what female journalists are meant to report about, while generally giving preference to male journalists. This underlines the need for a better visibility of female journalists in all areas of reporting to viably change these perceptions.

AB  - Since 2011, we have witnessed both the worst terror attack ever on Norwegian soil as well as an attempted act of terror. Both actions were conducted by right-wing extremists, who were radicalized by inspiration from, but not actual participation in, far right anti-Islamist groups. Even though most of the current far right groups in Norway do not openly support violence they are not innocent, as the rhetoric they propagate has directly inspired such actions. In this article, we use social movement theory to understand interviews we conducted with leaders of two anti-Islamist groups and one neo-Nazi group, specifically to analyse their mobilizing ideas and proposed solutions to the problems they imagine, as well as whether they believe they have support in the general population. Further, we analyse how the actors' views relate to broader discourses in society. As a background to our analysis, we refer to the larger landscape of far-right groups in Norway during past decades, as well as their equivalents in other European countries.

AB  - This paper studied affective generalization from intergroup contact, namely when and how affective empathy, anxiety, and trust-related feelings towards specific outgroup members (contact-related affective variables) generalize to the whole outgroup (outgroup-related affective variables). We analysed affective generalization using multilevel models, with items of each affective variable nested within the individual, to avoid aggregation bias due to averaging across items, hence false positives. As hypothesized, we found strong associations, but not perfect correspondence, between contact-related and outgroup-related affective variables. Moreover, we found that category salience facilitated the affective generalization of affective empathy and trust, whereas the quantity of intimate contact facilitated the generalization of anxiety. These findings suggest that affective intergroup climate hinges upon specific contact interactions, and that it is vital to promote positive affective reactions during contact and the formation of more intimate relationships with outgroup members.

AB  - We examined the association between intelligence, party identification, and political orientations using genetically informative data gathered from German twins and their families (n = 9553 individuals including 1524 adolescent and young-adult twin pairs). The results indicated that supporters of the Pirate Party and the Green Party had levels of intelligence that were significantly higher than those of other party identifiers, with the exception of individuals who preferred the Free Democrats. These findings were remarkably similar to results based on British research participants that were reported in a previous study. We also observed a significant, albeit modest, negative correlation between intelligence and political conservatism, and our data indicated that this correlation could be accounted for by common genetic influences on those two variables. The findings of the study were interpreted in light of competing theories on the nature of the relationship between intelligence, party identification, and political orientations.

AB  - Collective action researchers have recently started investigating solidarity-based collective action by advantaged groups. This literature, however, has overlooked intergroup meta-beliefs (MBs, i.e., beliefs about the outgroup's beliefs), which we argue are crucial, since solidarity inherently involves protesting for the outgroup. In the context of racial inequality in the U.S., we focused on three MBs White Americans could hold: responsibility, inactivity, and allyship. In two studies (N-total = 648), we found that inactive and responsible MBs predicted higher collective action tendencies among low White identifiers via guilt and obligation to act. Conversely, we found that both predicted lower collective action tendencies among high White identifiers, via perceived unfairness. Finally, we found that ally MB was positively associated with collective action tendencies, regardless of identification. We highlight the importance of the meta-perspective in understanding solidarity-based collective action, and discuss conceptual and practical implications of these findings.

AB  - This article aims to explore the argumentative lines employed in an online public deliberation concerned with legislation on same-sex civil union in Greece. Drawing on rhetorical and discursive developments in political social psychology and sexual citizenship debates, the article focuses on arguments regarding the relevance and the implications of public deliberation on the construction of LGBTQI+ claims and rights. The analytic corpus consisted of 1,000 comments, analyzed with the concepts and tools of Rhetorical and Critical Discursive Social Psychology. A recurring line of arguing against the legislation questioned the democratic quality of public deliberation, representing it as a means used to legitimize predetermined decisions. Moreover, overtly discriminatory arguments were predicated on the values of participatory democracy. Accounts in favor of the legislation, though, challenged public deliberation on the grounds that it allows room for the dispute of universal human rights. The potential contribution of these findings to the understanding of the dilemmas of participatory democracy, the reproduction of heteronormativity, and the assimilation of LGBTQI+ claims is discussed.

AB  - In order to understand how people from all major racial groups in the United States feel about racial representation in film, this study employed Q methodology to assess the motivations, attitudes, and opinions of individuals on this issue. Four factors were identified: (1) balanced critics, (2) storyline devotees, (3) tolerant learners, (4) grounded advocates. These four groups of people with common opinions on diversity in film represent a spectrum on perceptions of race, from colourblind to anti-racist. Variation in factor differences are explained through the lens of symbolic interactionism. In three of the four groups, individuals indicated a desire for more racially diverse film casts. The fourth group did not oppose racial representation in film, rather, these individuals were more concerned about the quality of the storyline. Implications for Hollywood's incorporation of racially diverse casts are discussed.

AB  - Opposition to Australia's resettlement of refugees has received considerable focus in discursive research; however, limited attention has been paid to how such opposition is challenged through talk. Existing anti-racism studies indicate a tendency to construct perspectives in support of welcoming newcomers as arguments against hegemonic viewpoints: a phenomenon known as "duelling discourses". To explore the applicability of this concept to discussions about seeking asylum, this research employed rhetorical analysis alongside a critical discourse paradigm to examine how 24 Western Australian voters voiced competing perspectives about asylum seekers. Further demonstrating duelling discourses, the sample routinely discussed seeking asylum in a dialogic manner, orienting their positions as direct arguments against constructions of asylum seekers as illegal immigrants, economic migrants and "bogus refugees". This article discusses these findings and considers their implications for both critical discourse and anti-racism scholarship.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the effect of intergroup contact on processing of own- and other-race faces using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Previous studies have shown a neural ownrace effect with greater BOLD response to own race compared to other race faces. In our study, white participants completed a social-categorization task and an individuation task while viewing the faces of both black and white strangers after having answered questions about their previous experiences with black people. We found that positive contact modulated BOLD activity in the right fusiform gyrus (rFG) and left inferior occipital gyrus (lIOC), regions associated with face processing. Within these regions, higher positive contact was associated with higher activity when processing black, compared to white faces during the social categorisation task. We also found that in both regions a greater amount of individuating experience with black people was associated with greater activation for black vs. white faces in the individuation task. Quantity of contact, implicit racial bias and negatively valenced contact showed no effects. Our findings suggest that positive contact and individuating experience directly modulate processing of out-group faces in the visual cortex, and illustrate that contact quality rather than mere familiarity is an important factor in reducing the own race face effect.

AB  - Measures of social capital such as trust have been declining in America for the better part of a century, while an influx of racial and ethnic diversity has apparently quickened the decline. Direct interactions with diversity still contribute to feelings of trust, only demographic differences now prevent the requisite contact from occurring. New means of creating shared experiences have thus become more vital, and the present study tests the value of games-based role-playing for fostering trust in immigrant populations. Students in an online American Government class at a major southeastern university were asked to create a fictional persona from Mexico, India, or China, and seek US citizenship. Their success or failure factored into their overall grade. Results suggest that role-playing the administrative experience of immigrants contributes to trusting them over time. This has value for life in a diversifying society.

AB  - The implications of intergroup contact for the social integration of rural migrant workers have received limited scholarly attention in China. Drawing on Allport's contact hypothesis and its recent extensions, this study investigates, from the perspective of urban residents, the situational and relational contexts within which intergroup encounters occur. Using the Urban Resident Survey conducted in 2014 across thirteen cities in China, we compare contact between urbanites and migrants in two social spaces: the workplace and the residential community. We also examine whether their associations with intergroup friendships differ for urbanites with kinship ties to migrants. Our findings highlight the complexities of contact, along with its strengths and limitations in bringing diverse groups closer together. Workplace contact is positively associated with intergroup friendships, whereas residential community contact is negatively related to such ties. Furthermore, kinship relations with migrants can undermine positive contacts but do not provide a buffer for negative encounters.

AB  - Social workers have an ethical duty to recognize and support each person's spiritual identity and ameliorate diverse forms of religious bias. These ethnical mandates are increasingly salient in light of recent Federal Bureau of Investigation data indicating that Jews, Muslims, Christians, and other people of faith are frequent victims of hate crimes. These discriminatory actions do not occur in a vacuum, but are legitimized by widely disseminated, subtly detrimental messages-commonly referred to as microaggressions. To assist social workers in identifying and counteracting these negative messages, this article delineates seven types of spiritual microaggressions that are frequently encountered in societal discourse. It concludes by offering some suggestions to help create a society that upholds and defends each person's spiritual integrity and well-being.

AB  - This article aims at diagnosing the development of Ummah while Muslims are living as minority in Australia. Through a sociological approach, qualitatively, some issues considered in understanding the development are practices of secularism, multiculturalism and protection of human rights. This academic framework in comprehending the development might be claimed as a new trajectory of sociological exploration. Accordingly, this study is proposed to become a preliminary research on Muslims' freedom of religion living in secular country. This article finds that Australia is a state that consistently has protected its citizens' freedom of religion and the Australian government, in dealing with social and religious issues, and law enforcement, has worked professionally. However, Muslims have faced challenging realities of cases of discrimination coming from fundamentalist Christians. The cases, indeed, can be mitigated through inter-religious dialogue and cooperation. This article argues that, so far, the development of Ummah in the country has been running well. Under the protection of a secular state, minority Muslims in Australian multicultural societies can enjoy their freedom of religion. Practices of inter-religious tolerance are stronger than the tensions and conflicts have happened.

AB  - Roche's article discusses 'language oppression' as a form of domination that is coherent with other forms of oppression along the lines of 'race', nation, colour and ethnicity. Scholars have defined language oppression as the 'enforcement of language loss by physical, mental, social and spiritual coercion'. It is part of an evolving suite of concepts from linguistics, sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology that examines issues of language discrimination, or 'linguicism'. Roche explores one aspect of linguicism-language erasure-and how it relates to language oppression, focusing on Tibetans in the People's Republic of China (PRC). He examines how language oppression is produced through practices of erasure: the ways in which certain populations and their languages are systematically rendered discursively invisible. He argues that the erasure of certain languages in the Tibetan context is systematically reproduced by two otherwise opposed political projects: the colonial project of the PRC state; and the international Tibet movement that seeks to resist it. He refers to the contingent cooperation between these two opposed projects as 'articulated oppression'. In concluding the article he examines how the disarticulation of this oppression is a necessary condition for the emancipation of Tibet's minority languages, and discusses the broader significance of this study for understanding language oppression, and its relation to other forms of oppression.

AB  - This article uniquely demonstrates how UK debates about supporting child refugees during the "refugee crisis" came to be used as support for leaving the European Union (EU). The research question "how did users of a news website respond to a report about the UK government's decision to allow child refugees into the UK?" is addressed with a rigorous discursive analysis of an internet discussion forum on the anti-immigrant website MailOnline consisting of 2,014 unique posts, with a reach of 30 million viewers. Analysis demonstrated that (1) child refugees were presented as adults, (2) allowing in refugees was presented as a "burden" on taxpayers, (3) the decision was presented as opposed to the public's will, and (4) this was used as a warrant for leaving the EU. The significant implication of this analysis is that political attempts at associating the refugee crisis with the EU may have been successful in this context.

AB  - The present study examined the benefits of meeting new people on Facebook for social capital. Results of a two-wave national web survey (N = 387) indicate that using the site to meet and interact with new people relates to trusting more in the average person over time. Facebook sociability also moderates the negative association between neighborhood diversity and trust over time. Diversity has less of a negative impact on trust locally for users who interact with new people online. Novel interactions on sites like Facebook improve perceptions of difference, demonstrating value for reconnecting the populace.

AB  - This study presents the psychometric proprieties of the Italian version of the Social Dominance Orientation(7) (SDO7) Scale, originally developed by Ho et al. (2015). We recruited a convenience sample (N = 497) to answer an online self-report questionnaire, including the SDO7 Scale and other relevant convergent and divergent measures. The confirmatory factor analysis revealed that SDO7 presents a satisfactory fit to the data, both as a two-correlated factor structure and as a one-dimensional measure. The two-correlated factor structure is confirmed as composed by two subdimensions as in the original version: the SDO-Dominance (SDO-D) and the SDO-Anti-Egalitarianism (SDO-E). Since the total SDO7 score measures people's support for asymmetrical group relationships, the SDO-D is concerned with people's support for dominant-submissive forms of intergroup relationships whereas the SDO-E refers to the desire to support intergroup inequalities. The scale and subscales also present satisfactory indexes of reliability as well as convergent and divergent validity.

AB  - Objective With an aim of extending the scope of group threat theory from within-country tensions between racial groups to international economic competition, this study specifically examined the impacts of perceived relative economic status of an in-group country on attitudes about contentious political issues with a rival out-group country. Methods Two survey experiments were administered, both of which manipulated Japanese participants' perceptions of the relative economic powers of Japan and South Korea. Results When Japanese perceive that their country's economic power is declining relative to South Korea's economy, they demonstrate more hardline attitudes about territorial and historical issues between the two countries. Conclusion This study demonstrates the applicability of group threat theory to bilateral international relations. It also suggests that public opinion about international conflicts is a function of the long-term rebalancing of economic power, which cannot be easily influenced by short-term policies.

AB  - Elevation is a mixed-affect emotional experience in response to witnessing good deeds, moral beauty, or virtue. Although studied extensively in entertainment, it has been largely ignored in political communication. The results of two experimental studies with U.S. adults (n = 210 and n = 630) suggest that political speeches can evoke elevation responses, and that such an elevation response is not affected by the political party of the speaker. An elevating response was associated with greater positivity toward politics and the speaker (Studies 1 and 2), as well as increased perceived closeness with one's own party and the opposing party (Study 2). Elevation was also associated with lower political cynicism. These outcomes further predicted both intentions to participate in the political process and information-seeking behavior. In a time when U.S. politics seem especially divided, elevation may represent one possible avenue for encouraging political discourse and participation.

AB  - In this article, Forchtner investigates the construction of an 'ideal', extreme-right, ecologically sensitive subject. A concern for the natural environment is in no way new to the extreme right, and has long been part of its ideological make-up. In particular, claims that the laws of nature are applicable to the social world and that a community is embedded in an ecosystem have long been features of a right-wing ecological imaginary. Through an analysis of all the articles on a paradigmatic ecological issue, biodiversity, published in Germany's exemplary extreme-right magazine preoccupied with ecology, Umwelt & Aktiv (Environment & Active), this cultural imaginary is reconstructed. Included in it as key themes are human responsibility for environmental degradation, the ecological value of flora and fauna, and criticism of modernity's levelling tendencies (both biologically and culturally). Taking responsibility for the community's Heimat (homeland) is, consequently, a crucial element for this subject: a subject who aims for purity, order and the stability of ecosystems.

AB  - Women continue to be underrepresented in STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) fields. As such, there has been an increased interest in interventions to reduce bias against, and increase inclusion of, women in STEM. In this paper, we compare and contrast two commonly used strategies: awareness and blindness. We demonstrate that gender-blindness a diversity ideology that advocates for downplaying gender differences, rather than embracing them has the potential to diminish stereotyping of women in STEM fields. In six total studies, we show that men who believe, or are primed with, gender-blindness (compared to gender-awareness) are less likely to endorse gender stereotypes around women's STEM competencies. By measuring (Study 1) and manipulating (Studies 2-5) gender-blindness, we show that gender-blindness (compared to awareness) minimizes the gender gap on explicit stereotyping measures, as well as diminishes STEM stereotyping in target evaluations. Across six studies, we show the influence of diversity ideologies on stereotyping of women in STEM.

AB  - Cross-cultural partnerships can provide a competitive edge for organizations, but also hinder trust between individuals, and thus the flow of diverse knowledge that facilitates positive organizational outcomes. We investigate whether openness to experience (openness, in short) protects against lower trust in cross-cultural partnerships by weakening the effect of cultural diversity on trust formation processes (defined by perceived similarity and trustworthiness, serially). We randomly assigned White, American participants to partners from either the same or different (i.e., Chinese) cultural background. After introductions, participants rated their partner's similarity and trustworthiness, and played a game assessing behavioral trust. Openness was measured 3-7 days prior. People high (versus low) on openness were more trusting towards culturally dissimilar partners because they perceived them as more similar, and thus more trustworthy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This article investigates youth perceptions of China's rise in seven Asian societies. Unlike previous studies' findings that most Asians hold positive views of China's influence, this study finds that Asian youth view a rising China more coolly than does the general public. Even though they acknowledge that China's rise offers increased opportunities, Asian youth tend to strongly distrust and worry about the negative influence of China. The results show that most youth in Asian countries surveyed believe China's rise will challenge global order and that China will not maintain peaceful relations with other Asian countries. Multilevel analyses show that both microlevel personal traits and macrolevel structural factors can account for how Asian youth view China's rise. The results indicate that China has not successfully convinced young Asian citizens of its determination to rise peacefully. China's foreign policymaking should take greater consideration of Asian public opinion rather than be dominated by wishful thinking.

AB  - Three online experiments were conducted to determine whether gender differences in feelings of power are most evident in objectively lower or higher power situations (total n=1360; Studies 1 and 2: 238 and 771U.S. MTurk respondents respectively; Study 3: 351 Canadian university students). We focused on evaluating whether men's and women's responses were in line with a cushioning account, whereby the higher power generally accorded to men as a group essentially serves as a back-up power source for men in lower power positions. We also evaluated support for a ceiling account, whereby women's feelings of power are limited in higher power positions. Results were consistent with the cushioning account: Men reported feeling more powerful than women did when imagining or recalling occupying a lower power position and in a control baseline, but no gender difference was evident under higher power conditions. Results further revealed that women's feelings of power were more variable across lower versus higher power positions than were men's and indicated that women's feelings of power are quite responsive to situationally afforded high power when it is available. Overall our findings suggest that occupying a higher power role eradicates gender differences in feelings of power that are otherwise evident and thus has an equalizing effect.

AB  - Does the perception of migration in times of crisis have implications that transcend the domain of policy support and alter systemic preferences among citizens? In an experimental study (N = 312) conducted in Macedonia, a postcommunist country on the "Balkan route", we test how perceived threat from migrants affects attitudes towards increased concentration of political authority, conceptualised as support for presidential powers (such as veto rights, army use and policy enactment), and a presidential system. Ultimately, priming realistic and symbolic threat (in combination with presidential functions) has failed to influence participants' attitudes, due to perceptions of low outlet credibility and high issue salience. However, subsequent analysis demonstrates that citizens who see migrants as threatening towards cultural cohesion are indeed more willing to see an empowered president. We discuss the implications of openness towards institutional design with more streamlined decision making in the context of rising illiberalism and populism in the region.

AB  - In 2012-13, we signed up for Facebook in seven Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries and used Facebook advertisements to encourage young people to participate in our survey. Nearly 18,000 individuals responded. Some of the questions in our survey dealing with attitudes about women's work and cosmetics were adopted from a survey conducted by the Frankfurt School in 1929 in Germany. The German survey had shown that a great number of men, irrespective of their political affiliation harbored highly authoritarian attitudes toward women and that one sign of authoritarianism was men's attitude toward cosmetics and women's employment. We wanted to know if the same was true of the contemporary MENA. Our results suggest that lipstick and makeups as well as women's employment are not just vehicles for sexual objectification of women. In much of MENA world a married woman's desire to work outside the house, and her pursuit of the accoutrement of beauty and sexual attractiveness, are forms of gender politics, of women's empowerment, but also of antiauthoritarianism and liberal politics. Our results also suggest that piety among Muslims per se is not an indicator of authoritarianism and that there is a marked gender difference in authoritarianism. Women, it seems, are living a different Islam than men.

AB  - This experiment tested whether interacting with a peer who holds explicitly anti-fat attitudes leads to cognitive performance deficits and poorer psychological and cardiovascular outcomes among higher body weight women by increasing anticipated rejection. One hundred and forty six higher body weight women were randomly assigned to interact in a non-romantic context with a same-sex peer who endorsed explicit anti-fat or unbiased attitudes. All women showed greater heart rate reactivity and anger when interacting with an anti-fat peer. The heavier women were, and the more they thought they were overweight, the more they anticipated rejection when interacting with an anti-fat peer. This anticipated rejection was in turn associated with poorer cognitive performance, lower state self-esteem, and increased negative emotions, rumination, compensatory efforts, and thoughts related to anxiety and evaluation. These effects were not observed among women in our sample categorized as slightly "overweight" or who perceived themselves as only slightly overweight. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A recurring theme in the psychological literature is that the self-fulfilling effect of stereotypes can accumulate across perceivers. This article provides the first empirical support for this long-standing hypothesis. In three experiments (Ns = 123-241), targets more strongly confirmed a stereotype as the number of perceivers who held stereotypic expectations about them increased. A fourth experiment (N = 121) showed that new perceivers judged targets according to the stereotypic behaviors they had previously been channeled to adopt, an effect that even occurred among perceivers who were privy to the fact that targets' behavior had been shaped by the actions of others. The authors discuss ways in which these effects may contribute to group inequalities.

AB  - Bovine growing oocytes with a diameter of 105-115 mu m from early antral follicles (1.2-1.8 mm) are able to resume meiosis, but lack the competence to mature to metaphase II. To confer full maturation competence onto the oocytes, culture systems which can support their growth and prevent their meiotic resumption during culture are needed. In this study, we cultured growing oocytes for 5 days to examine the effects of different phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors on meiotic arrest and acquisition of full maturation competence of growing oocytes, and their gap junctional communication with cumulus cells. Growing oocyte-cumulus complexes (OCCs) were cultured with 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX; broad-spectrum PDE inhibitor), rolipram (PDE4 inhibitor), cilostamide and milrinone (PDE3A inhibitors). The mean diameters of oocytes increased similarly in all groups. IBMX, cilostamide and milrinone induced antrum formation by OCCs and maintained meiotic arrest of oocytes during culture, whereas rolipram neither promoted antrum formation nor maintained oocyte meiotic arrest. Gap junctional communication between oocytes and cumulus cells was maintained by IBMX and cilostamide, but not by rolipram as judged by the transfer of injected lucifer yellow dye from oocytes to cumulus cells. In subsequent in vitro maturation, oocytes grown with IBMX, cilostamide and milrinone showed full maturation competence. These results suggest that PDE3A inhibition maintains the meiotic arrest of bovine growing oocytes and sustains their gap junctional communication with cumulus cells for 5 days, thereby contributing to their acquisition of full maturation competence.

AB  - This study investigated students' perspectives about bullying towards same-country and immigrant peers. Thirty-five Italian and immigrant students (age range: 11-15) took part to the study. Participants were probed with two bullying scenarios, depicting respectively a new classmate from another Italian city and from a foreign country. A Grounded Theory approach was adopted to examine participants' perspectives about the motives for bullying. Findings showed that a process of socializing deviance is at the core of both forms of bullying. This social process refers to a series of shared beliefs within the peer group about the victim's deviant features. Three sub-categories related to both forms of bullying emerged from the core concept: (a) Rejecting the newcomer deviance, (b) Rejecting physical deviance, (c) and Rejecting personality deviance. These sub-categories were related to the sub-categories of bullying towards immigrant peers: (d) Rejecting cultural deviance, (e) and Learned racism. Findings are discussed in terms of their theoretical and practical relevance.

AB  - This article conducts a critical discourse analysis of the Hungarian government's National Consultation campaign on immigration and terrorism' in early 2015. The analysis draws on a discourse-historical approach to illuminate how the language and contents of the consultation draw on the discursive and political repertoires of the post-2010 Orban governments and how, at the same time, they are underpinned by particular elements in the history of migration and diversity in Hungary. The consultation framed immigration as both an economic and security threat and conflated asylum seekers, economic migrants and terrorists, as well as regular and irregular migration. Nevertheless, these discourses would later feed into the government's response to the large number of asylum seekers who entered the country in the summer of 2015 and would be used to legitimize the actions subsequently taken to tackle what would internationally come to be defined as a crisis'.

AB  - Many social science-based interventions entail the transfer of evidence-based knowledge to the "target population," because the acquisition and the acceptance of that knowledge are necessary for the intended improvement of behavior or development. Furthermore, the application of a certain prevention program is often legitimated by a reference to science-based reasons such as an evaluation according to scientific standards. Hence, any implementation of evidence-based knowledge and programs is embedded in the public understanding of (social) science. Based on recent research on such public understanding of science, we shall discuss transfer as a process of science communication.

AB  - This research examined how leader illegitimacy affects leaders' and subordinates' responses to relinquishing power decisions. The processes underlying responses to leader illegitimacy and relinquishing power were also examined. Across four studies, participants were placed in leader roles (Studies 1a/1b) or subordinate roles (Studies 2a/2b) in an online competition. In Studies 1a/1b, participants assigned a leadership role learned, via a leadership skills test, that their leadership was illegitimate or legitimate. By contrast, in Studies 2a/2b, participants assigned a subordinate role were confronted with either an illegitimate leader who retained their power after performing poorly or a legitimate leader who received the leader role after a poor-performing leader had relinquished their power. Results demonstrated that leaders who felt they did not belong in their leadership role relinquished more power when their leadership was illegitimate (vs. legitimate) and subordinates who felt less in control and greater anger supported illegitimate (vs. legitimate) leaders less.

AB  - What does the American public label as "terrorism?" How do people think about the factors motivating violence, and in turn, the policies that are favored? Using ingroup and outgroup dynamics, we argue that the terrorist label is more readily applied to Arab-Americans than Whites, and to members of militant groups. Moreover, people attribute different motives to violence committed by Arabs versus Whites, and favor different policies in response. We conducted an experiment where we randomly assigned one of six stories about a failed armed attack, each with a different combination of ethnicity and group affiliation. We find that an Arab ethnicity and Islamist group affiliation increase the likelihood of labeling an act as terrorism. Attacks by Whites and members of a White supremacist group are less likely to be labeled terrorism. Rather, Whites are more likely to be called "mass shooters." Despite never discussing motive, Arab-American attackers are more likely to be ascribed political or religious motives, while White suspects are more likely to be seen as mentally ill. Lastly, an Arab ethnicity increases support for counterterrorism policies and decreases support for mental health care.

Participantswere asked to rate quarterbacks based on stereotypes identified in previous literature and then were asked to rate the credibility of stereotype-consistent or inconsistent messages. The study found that participants stereotyped both races, but Black participants actually stereotyped more strongly. Only messages concerning stereotype-consistent descriptors of White quarterbacks were rated as more credible. These results are interpreted based on social identity theory.

AB  - The displaced children of Europe, who live in and through landscapes and in temporary accommodationstheir bare worlds of life stuffed into rucksacksare our constant companions, their movement and immobility paraded as a geopolitical inconvenience and security threat to governments and officials even before they embark on treacherous Mediterranean sea and land crossings to hoped-for asylum in Europe. Gigliotti examines the humanitarian ambitions and changing narrative authority in the coverage of displaced children in the photography of David Chim' Seymour, notably from his UNICEF/UNESCO-commissioned tour of Europe in the summer of 1948 and, briefly, in UNICEF's online platform, Refugees in Europe: Then and Now'. She outlines the post-war historical context of internationalism and humanitarian engagement with the visual to advocate for displaced children's rights to place, home and belonging, and concludes with an analysis of the representation of the post-war refugee and displaced person as a memory emissary in today's refugee crises.

AB  - This study analyzed the impact of the November 2015 Paris attacks on online hate. On the basis of social identity based theories of group relations, we hypothesized that exposure to online hate will increase in social climate of fear, uncertainty, and polarization. We expected that the increase of hate will be evident in the case of online hate associated to ethnicity or nationality, religion, political views, or terrorism, but not specifically other hate-associated categories. Societal level determinants of the temporal changes in online hate exposure have not been tested before. Our study utilized two cross-sectional, demographically balanced datasets to analyze the change in online hate exposure among Finnish young people aged 15 to 30. The first sample was collected in May-June 2013 and the second one in December 2015, only 1 month after the November 2015 Paris attacks. The results supported the hypotheses indicating that the quantity and quality of online hostilities are affected by the wider societal conditions. We suggest that more evidence of societal level determinants of online hostility is needed in order to understand online hate exposure rates at different times. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Black people are widely negatively stereotyped. The presence of unconscious stereotypes can be effectively assessed with the administration of "racial priming tasks." An ethnically diverse group was subjected to a priming paradigm to test whether racial cues could bias the identification of target objects. Participants were asked to categorize objects (either as dangerous or nondangerous) after the presentation of Black/White faces as primes. Results show that both Black and White participants were faster in categorizing dangerous objects when primed with Black faces compared to the control condition (i.e., scrambled faces). One possible explanation for this effect is that Black faces are generally associated with a feeling of danger, which ultimately leads to faster responses.

AB  - Human babies not only are reliable triggers of tender feelings and protective tendencies, they also happen to be exceptionally fat compared to the newborns of most other species. These two facts are used to formulate a hypothesis predicting that overweight males, due to their great physical resemblance to babies, not only are perceived as cute, but also are associated with negatively evaluated traits (e.g., immaturity, lack of willpower) that are saliently inconsistent with traits required for adults. In this study, a great many physical features of adult males varying widely in weight were measured and correlated with subjective judgements. Providing preliminary support for the hypothesis, it was found that the features that were correlated with objective and perceived fatness (e.g., circularity of body parts, relatively large head, short and thick neck) also correlated with perceived babyishness. Perceived fatness and babyishness had curvilinear influences on the positive and prosocial appraisal of cuteness, but were primarily negatively related to perceived willpower and beauty. Results are used to formulate an alternative evolutionary perspective on social responses to overweight and obese individuals, emphasizing the uniquely human adaptive value of fatness and the misfiring of the underlying response mechanism under modern conditions of living.

AB  - Ideologically committed people are similarly motivated to avoid ideologically crosscutting information. Although some previous research has found that political conservatives may be more prone to selective exposure than liberals are, we find similar selective exposure motives on the political left and right across a variety of issues. The majority of people on both sides of the same-sex marriage debate willingly gave up a chance to win money to avoid hearing from the other side (Study 1). When thinking back to the 2012 U.S. Presidential election (Study 2), ahead to upcoming elections in the U.S. and Canada (Study 3), and about a range of other Culture War issues (Study 4), liberals and conservatives reported similar aversion toward learning about the views of their ideological opponents. Their lack of interest was not due to already being informed about the other side or attributable election fatigue. Rather, people on both sides indicated that they anticipated that hearing from the other side would induce cognitive dissonance (e.g., require effort, cause frustration) and undermine a sense of shared reality with the person expressing disparate views (e.g., damage the relationship; Study 5). A high-powered meta-analysis of our data sets (N = 2417) did not detect a difference in the intensity of (d = 0.63) and conservatives' (d = 0.58) desires to remain in their respective ideological bubbles.

AB  - Based on two cross-sectional probability samples (Study 1: N = 1,382, Study 2: N = 1,587), we studied the interplay between positive and negative intergroup contact, different types of intergroup emotions (i.e., episodic intergroup emotions encountered during contact and more general chronic intergroup emotions), and outgroup behavior in the context of intergroup relations between non-immigrant Germans and foreigners living in Germany. In Study 1, we showed that positive and negative contact are related to specific episodic intergroup emotions (i.e., anger, fear and happiness). Results of Study 2 indicate an indirect effect of episodic intergroup emotions encountered during contact experiences on specific behavioral tendencies directed at outgroup members via more chronic situation-independent intergroup emotions. As expected, anger predicted approaching (discriminatory) behavioral tendencies (i.e., aggression) while fear predicted avoidance. The results extend the existing literature on intergroup contact and emotions by addressing positive and negative contact simultaneously and differentiating between situation-specific episodic and chronic intergroup emotions in predicting discriminatory behavioral tendencies.

AB  - In two quasi-experimental vignette studies, we have analyzed how societal threat to safety moderates the relation between right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and psychological distress. In Study 1 (Italian community sample, N=343), we focused on depressive symptoms (measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and the General Health Questionnaire). Two moderated regressions showed that the relation between RWA and both measures of depressive symptoms was positive and significant only among people exposed to a socially threatening scenario. In Study 2 (Italian student sample, N=219), we focused on state anxiety and replicated Study 1's results. The findings indicated that, in conditions of societal threat to safety, RWA is a risk factor for psychological distress. Strengths, limitations, and possible developments of this research are discussed.

AB  - Anti-Islamic sentiments have become central to right-wing populist mobilization in Western societies, which often results in negative portrayals of Muslims in political campaigns. Although these portrayals may have detrimental effects on minority members' identity formation and attitudes toward majority members, little is known about their effects on members of the depicted group. A lab experiment with 145 young Muslims reveals that right-wing populist ad exposure increases perceived discrimination, which in turn decreases individuals' self-esteem and national identification, and encourages hostility toward majority members. Religious identification, in contrast, is not affected by ad exposure. Implications of these findings for intergroup relations and democratic processes are discussed.

AB  - Research within cultural psychology and intergroup relations represent two, often separate and distinct, approaches to examining social groupsincluding outcomes and experiences that define and distinguish group membership and its consequences. Often, social group membership (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender, and social class) is tied to persistent and pervasive dividesseparations that mark the difference in who attends college, stays in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, and even views personal and societal events (e.g., microaggressions, police-involved shootings) as involving bias. Addressing such complex and often divisive issues, psychological science has contributed theoretical and applied insights to mitigate social differences and inequalities experienced by historically disadvantaged social groups. The present paper integrates research on cultural psychology and intergroup relations by (a) reviewing empirical findings on sociocultural selves and intergroup contact and (b) considering how merging approaches from these literatures, using a selves in contact framework, can inform and elaborate theoretical perspectives and applications aimed at reducing inequality.

AB  - Political theorists and philosophers have recently directed their attention to understanding how individuals may become motivated to act as ethical cosmopolitans. A prominent theory - termed thick cosmopolitanism - argues that the realization one's ingroup is responsible for causing harm to people in distant nations will increase cosmopolitan helping behavior. Additionally, thick cosmopolitanism suggests that guilt may explain this effect. This article presents the first experimental tests of these claims, and is the first research to use experiments to investigate cosmopolitan helping. Results demonstrate a substantial, but previously unrecognized, limitation to thick cosmopolitanism. Specifically, reminders of ingroup responsibility for causing harm not only increased individuals' acceptance of responsibility and collective guilt, which indirectly enhanced cosmopolitan helping (Studies 1 and 2), but simultaneously increased dehumanization of the harmed outgroup, which indirectly diminished helping (Study 2). These conflicting processes resulted in no overall increase in cosmopolitan helping, contrary to the predictions of thick cosmopolitanism.

AB  - The present research examined how messages advocating different intergroup ideologies affect outcomes relevant to minority group members' ability to exert power in exchanges with dominant group members. We expected that salient multiculturalism would have positive implications for minority group members' feelings of power by virtue of highlighting essential contributions they make to society, and that no such empowering effect would be evident for them in connection with alternative ideologies such as color-blindness or for dominant group members. Results across four studies involving different participant populations, operationalizations of ideology, ethnic minority groups, and experimental settings were consistent with these hypotheses and further indicated that the effects of salient multiculturalism on feelings of power had downstream implications for expectations of control in an ostensibly upcoming intergroup interaction and general goal-directed cognition.

AB  - Contemporary anti-Islamic discourses in Australia construct Islam as an uncivilised belief system and its Muslim followers as homogenous unassimilable Others. Within these discourses, the diversity among Muslim women has been overshadowed, and they are constructed as a monolithic 'veiled' woman. Drawing on 20 conversational interviews with veiled and unveiled Australian Muslim women from various cultural backgrounds, this paper explores the diverse ways in which Muslim women resist and challenge anti-Islamic discourses on Islam, Muslims and Muslim women. Guided by intersectional theories on identity and resistance, our analysis show that the women drew on discursive and performative strategies to contest anti-Islamic representations that homogenise and vilify Muslims and construct Muslim women as veiled and oppressed. The findings also show that the ways in which women contested hegemonic anti-Islamic representations were diverse and informed by intersecting power and social locations, including race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality. Implications for research on resistance and identity negotiations of minority groups are discussed.

AB  - This article lays out a theoretical framework for cultural fusion theory. This theory borrows from various theoretical frameworks to provide a more realistic description of the immigrant experience. Specifically, cultural fusion theory describes how newcomers acculturate into the dominant culture and maintain aspects of their minority culture, while at the same time the dominant or host culture also fuses aspects off the newcomer's culture into the dominant culture to create a fused intercultural identity. Boundary conditions, assumptions, axioms, and theorems are presented to define cultural fusion theory.

AB  - Although abundant research has documented positive interpersonal outcomes of perspective taking, a growing body of evidence indicates that perspective taking can also induce negative interpersonal outcomesin other words, it backfires. We aim at integrating these seemingly contradictory findings, suggesting that perspective taking backfires when it causes the perspective-taking individual to feel threatened. Threat can emerge from the very act of perspective taking if the target of perspective taking is perceived as too different from the self or if adopting another's perspective creates the potential for negative self-evaluation. Furthermore, threat may emerge if perspective taking successfully creates perceptions of self-other overlap, but the overlapping characteristics accentuate potentially threatening characteristics of the target. Our theoretical model affords predictions for other conditions in which perspective taking is linked to self-threat and may backfire.

AB  - The present study investigated the role of authoritarianism in the association between the actual proportion of ethnic minorities (objective diversity) within a neighborhood and majority members' subjective perception thereof (perceived diversity). Additionally, we tested how authoritarianism affects the direct and indirect relationships between objective diversity and outgroup threat, anxiety, and mistrust. Analyses in a nationally stratified sample of Dutch citizens (N=848) without migration background from 706 different neighborhoods showed that higher levels of authoritarianism have a dual effect on the relationship between objective diversity and negativity towards outgroups. In particular, authoritarianism (i) boosts the indirect relationship between objective diversity and greater outgroup negativity through perceived diversity, and (ii) curbs the direct association of objective diversity with reduced outgroup negativity. These findings shed light on how majority members with different levels of authoritarianism differentially perceive diversity in their neighborhood, and how this relates to their responses to ethnic minorities.

AB  - On the heels of recent police shootings of an unarmed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, and the death of Freddy Gray in Baltimore, Maryland, that stoked racial tensions, this article examines how beliefs about race and racial inequality influence whites' attitudes toward the use of force by the police since the mid-1980s. Our main dependent measure is a composite index ("Police Force Index") constructed from four survey items from the 1986-2012 National Opinion Research Center's General Social Survey (GSS). Results show that (1) beliefs about race do indeed significantly predict whites' attitudes toward police use of force, and more importantly, (2) this effect has remained constant since the mid-1980s. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of these findings and suggestions for future research.

AB  - Dimensions of stereotypes, warmth and competence, may respond differentially to perceivers' emotional involvement. Two studies tested the effect of being emotionally involved with a fictional immigrant target on stereotypic warmth but not competence dimension. Emotional involvement with a target affects the target's perceived trustworthiness, warmth-related attributes, but not competence. Emotional involvement was operationalized as a personal variable, fantasizing tendency (tendency to empathically engage with fictitious characters) and a situational variable (emotion-focused instructions to adopt the target's perspective). After reading an immigrant's blog, Study 1 participants with a strong tendency to become involved with characters, if also instructed to focus on targets' emotional reactions, rated an immigrant as warmer than did all other combinations, but perceived competence did not change. In Study 2, priming the perceived competitive intent of the immigrant's grotip (an anti-warmth predictor) impeded involvement with the target and decreased perceived warmth. Priming perceived cooperative intent (a warmth predictor) replicated Study 1's results. Together, the studies show preliminary support for a specific emotional involvement-warmth link.

AB  - 'Trolling' refers to a specific type of malicious online behaviour, intended to disrupt interactions, aggravate interactional partners and lure them into fruitless argumentation. However, as with other categories, both 'troll' and 'trolling' may have multiple, inconsistent and incompatible meanings, depending upon the context in which the term is used and the aims of the person using the term.
   Drawing data from 14 online fora and newspaper comment threads, this paper explores how online users mobilise and make use of the term 'troll'. Data was analysed from a discursive psychological perspective.
   Four repertoires describing trolls were identified in posters online messages: 1) that trolls are easily identifiable, 2) nostalgia, 3) vigilantism and 4) that trolls are nasty. Analysis also revealed that despite repertoire 01, identifying trolls is not a simple and straight-forward task.
   Similarly to any other rhetorical category, there are tensions inherent in posters accounts of nature and acceptability of trolling. Neither the category 'troll' nor the action of 'trolling' has a single, fixed meaning. Either action may be presented as desirable or undesirable, depending upon the aims of the poster at the time of posting. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Focusing on the 2011 Palestinian statehood bid at the United Nations and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, this article highlights the circular character of group-based emotional dynamics and stresses the importance of "emotional worldviews" and "emotional configurations." We subsequently provide an innovative, robust, and repeatable quantitative method for the direct measuring of these two components. This threefold contributiontheoretical, methodological, empiricalcompletes recent models (chiefly the appraisal-based framework) and unfolds new research avenues for the study of the role of individual and collective emotions in conflicts.

AB  - Perceivers achieve above chance accuracy judging others' sexual orientations, but they also exhibit a notable response bias by categorizing most targets as straight rather than gay. Although a straight categorization bias is evident in many published reports, it has never been the focus of systematic inquiry. The current studies therefore document this bias and test the mechanisms that produce it. Studies 1-3 revealed the straight categorization bias cannot be explained entirely by perceivers' attempts to match categorizations to the number of gay targets in a stimulus set. Although perceivers were somewhat sensitive to base rate information, their tendency to categorize targets as straight persisted when they believed each target had a 50% chance of being gay (Study 1), received explicit information about the base rate of gay targets in a stimulus set (Study 2), and encountered stimulus sets with varying base rates of gay targets (Study 3). The remaining studies tested an alternate mechanism for the bias based upon perceivers' use of gender heuristics when judging sexual orientation. Specifically, Study 4 revealed the range of gendered cues compelling gay judgments is smaller than the range of gendered cues compelling straight judgments despite participants' acknowledgment of equal base rates for gay and straight targets. Study 5 highlighted perceptual experience as a cause of this imbalance: Exposing perceivers to hyper-gendered faces (e.g., masculine men) expanded the range of gendered cues compelling gay categorizations. Study 6 linked this observation to our initial studies by demonstrating that visual exposure to hyper-gendered faces reduced the magnitude of the straight categorization bias. Collectively, these studies provide systematic evidence of a response bias in sexual orientation categorization and offer new insights into the mechanisms that produce it.

AB  - This study explores discourses about involvement in violent intergroup conflict and international crimes from the perspective of perpetrators. Through a critical discourse analysis of 12 personal interviews carried out with individuals accused by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) for crimes committed during the Yugoslav conflicts, we uncover how their discourse reveals conceptions of lacking agency and powerlessness during the conflict, how it reconstructs power relationships within and between ethnic groups, and how it reflects identity management strategies destined to elude blame and responsibility. Our findings demonstrate how discourses are tainted by the legitimizing framework in which the conflict unfolded but also how they are shaped by the particular context of the communicative situation. Findings are discussed in terms of their significance for international criminal justice and its stated objectives.

AB  - Certain groups (e.g., women, older adults, and the economically disadvantaged) are universally stigmatized. Numerous studies, however, have identified cross-cultural differences in the attitudes expressed toward stigmatized groups. These differences may potentially be due to existing cross-cultural dissimilarities in social status for some groups. The current study used fMRI to examine whether Chinese and Caucasian-American participants engage the same cognitive and affective mechanisms when perceiving stigmatized individuals with similarly low social status in both cultures (homeless individuals), but different cognitive and/or affective processes when evaluating stigmatized individuals whose status differs across cultures (older adults). Using a social neuroscience approach can provide unique insight into this question because the neural regions involved in cognitive and affective evaluations of stigmatized individuals have been well characterized. Results revealed that Chinese participants and Caucasian-American participants engaged similar patterns of negative affective processing associated with disgust (left anterior insula) when evaluating homeless individuals. Moreover, self-reported negative explicit attitudes toward homeless individuals were associated with increased activity in the insula. However, Chinese participants and Caucasian-American participants engaged increased activity in neural regions associated with status (ventral striatum) when they evaluated older adults. Moreover, self-reported attitudes toward older adults and ventral striatal activity were correlated with the extent to which participants reported being affiliated with their respective cultural traditions.

AB  - Although there is no consensus among educationalists as to the role schools play as drivers of hostilities in divided societies, there is broad agreement that they can facilitate more positive intergroup relations. In Northern Ireland the promotion of school based intergroup contact has been offered as a means through which this can happen. Until 2007, the approach was twofold, reflected on the one hand in short-term contact opportunities for pupils in predominantly Catholic and Protestant schools, and on the other, in support for integrated schools that educate Catholics and Protestants together. In 2007 the Shared Education Programme was introduced to 'bridge the gap' between short-term opportunities for contact, and 'full immersion' integrated schools. Informed by contact theory, shared education offers curriculum-based interaction between pupils attending all school types, aimed at promoting the type of contact likely to reduce negative social attitudes and ultimately contribute to social harmony. In this paper, we examine the impact of shared education thus far. Our analysis suggests that while shared education is generally effective in promoting positive assessments of other group members, there is a danger that programme impact may be inhibited by the foregrounding of educational over reconciliation priorities. Appreciating that the downplaying reconciliation objectives may have been necessary when the programme was established in order to maximise recruitment to it, we argue that if the full potential of shared education is to be realised, moving forward, it is important for schools to engage with issues of group differences.

AB  - In the present article we aimed at investigating the role of metastereotypes and gender on hearing people's attitudes towards people with deafness. Ninety-six Italian hearing adults participated in a 2 x 2 experimental study. Participants were presented with the results of a fictitious but apparently real survey concerning the opinions people with deafness have of hearing people. Metastereotypes (positive vs. negative) were manipulated through this presentation. Results showed that metastereotypes interacted with participants' gender in determining their attitudes towards people with deafness: when positive metastereotypes were activated, women's attitudes appeared more favorable toward people with deafness if compared to the negative metastereotypes condition. No effect of metastereotypes was observed among male participants. In conclusion, the activation of metastereotypes can be a useful means in intervening to improve attitudes toward people with deafness.

AB  - Lay understandings reflect the lived experience of racism, and our knowledge of these considerations assist with enhancing an appreciation of intergroup relations. Drawing on data from semi-structured interviews and focus groups with 30 school attendees from diverse backgrounds aged 14-22 years, conducted from December 2011 to January 2012 in Victoria, Australia, we critically examined their understandings of and experiences with racism. Data demonstrate the ambiguity of racism, while confirming that Australian youth from various racial, ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds consistently conceptualise, explain, and classify racism, whilst minimising some forms of racism, including racist humour. Participants described racism through three primary domains: (a) Group versus Individual: racism stems from perceived differences, with individuals stereotyped as belonging to larger groups; (b) Actions versus Beliefs: individuals are classified as racist or non-racist according to their actions and beliefs; and (c) Exceptions, Exclusions and Minimisation: racism is frequently excused and minimised. The present research highlights the need for additional exploration of the nuances of racism in Australia from lay perspectives and provides clear evidence of the need to address racism in Australian society. Further developing the evidence base to understand the lived experience of racism in Australia could inform and support the design and evaluation of anti-racism and pro-diversity initiatives. Moreover, we hope that the present data can be drawn upon to enlighten the development of instruments to more accurately measure racist attitudes in Australian youth. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this Internet age where computer classrooms, smart phones, and tablet devices are becoming the norm, it is timely that social and educational psychologists integrate such technologies within the field of intergroup relations to develop innovative, effective, and validated tools to promote intergroup harmony. This critical review article introduces a new online contact strategy-Electronic-or E-contact-that allows for physically segregated ingroup and outgroup members to synchronously interact online, in a prestructured format. The synchronous nature of the intergroup interaction allows for the engagement of self in the contact situation that in turn strengthens the effectiveness of E-contact in promoting intergroup harmony. Previous research investigating online contact is reviewed, and an evaluation of a best-practice E-contact framework is provided. This framework is based on the successful 9-week Dual Identity Electronic Contact (DIEC) program that has been shown to maintain reductions in intergroup bias between Muslim and Christian students at 3 time periods: 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months post-DIEC intervention. Limitations of the Internet with regard to potentially creating negative contact are also highlighted to offer a balanced critique. Finally, future research designs are proposed to further support and enhance the success of E-contact research to improve intergroup relations and promote peace.

AB  - Across two experimental studies, the purpose of this research project was to examine how Whites evaluate African Americans with a strong racial identity. In Study 1, participants evaluated applicants for an athletic director position. Relative to their weakly identified counterparts, applicants believed to possess a strong racial identity were rated as a poorer fit for the job. Results from Study 2, which was also set within the context of hiring an athletic director, show that participant social dominance orientation moderates the relationship between racial identity and subsequent evaluations. The authors discuss theoretical and practical implications, limitations, and future directions.

AB  - This article expands previous research on self-interested reactions and intergroup contact by showing that (1) intergroup contact constrains the impact of personal economic vulnerability on perceived out-group threat, (2) personal economic vulnerability has no influence on perceived out-group threat when contact is most intense, and (3) the ability of intergroup contact to reduce perceived out-group threat is strongest among the most economically vulnerable. These findings were generated by a fixed-effects regression of 21 countries and almost 34,000 respondents sampled in the European Social Survey (2002-2003). More generally, our findings suggest that self-interested reactions can be overpowered by the cognitive and affective components of intergroup contact. The concluding section expands on the theoretical implications of the results.

AB  - Based on the frameworks of dual-process theories, we examined the interplay between intuitive and controlled cognitive processes related to moral and social judgments. In a virtual reality (VR) setting we performed an experiment investigating the progression from fast, automatic decisions towards more controlled decisions over multiple trials in the context of a sacrificing scenario. We repeatedly exposed participants to a modified ten-to-one version and to three one versions of the trolley dilemma in VA and varied avatar properties, such as their gender and ethnicity, and their orientation in space. We also investigated the influence of arousing music on decisions. Our experiment replicated the behavioral pattern observed in studies using text versions of the trolley dilemma, thereby validating the use of virtual environments in research on moral judgments. Additionally, we found a general tendency towards sacrificing male individuals which correlated with socially desirable responding. As indicated by differences in response times, the ten-to-one version of the trolley dilemma seems to be faster to decide than decisions requiring comparisons based on specific avatar properties as a result of differing moral content. Building upon research on music based emotion induction, we used music to induce emotional arousal on a physiological level as measured by pupil diameter. We found a specific temporal signature displaying a peak in arousal around the moment of decision. This signature occurs independently of the overall arousal level. Furthermore, we found context dependent gaze durations during sacrificing decisions, leading participants to look prolonged at their victim if they had to choose between avatars differing in gender. Our study confirmed that moral decisions can be explained within the framework of dual-process theories and shows that pupillometric measurements are a promising tool for investigating affective responses in dilemma situations.

AB  - This study tested how source knowledge affects enjoyment of self-deprecating humor about a minority group. Participants made aware that the source of a message poking fun at people with disabilities was himself disabled had more positive evaluations of the cartoon and author than participants unaware of his disability. Participants initially given no source information judged the author more positively the second time when they were given follow-up source information. Finally, some effects were moderated by the disability status of the message receiver, such that having a disability or knowing someone who does predicted higher liking of the cartoons when the author is disabled but lower liking when he is not. The results suggest a role for self-deprecating humor in intergroup relations, and predict when such humor will be accepted by minority and non-minority group members.

AB  - Ultrastructural morphological injuries and maturation rates were investigated in equine oocytes exposed to vitrification solutions (VS) containing synthetic ice blockers (SIBs) during different exposure times. In experiment 1, compact cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs; n = 30) were randomly allocated to treatments: (1) fresh fixed (control); (2) VS-1 (1.4 M dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO] + 1.8 M ethylene glycol LEG] + 1% SIB) for 3 minutes of equilibrium time and VS-2 (2.8 M DMSO + 3.6 M EG + 0.6 M sucrose + 1% SIB) for 1 minute (Eq-long); and (3) VS-1 for 1.5 minutes and VS-2 for 30 seconds (Eq-short). In experiment 2, compact (n = 248) and expanded (n = 264) COCs were evenly distributed to the following treatments: (1) immediate maturation in vitro (control); (2) vitrification using the Eq-short protocol as in experiment 1; and (3) vitrification using a stock solution containing 2.8 M formamide, 2.8 M DMSO, 2.7 M EG, 7% polyvinylpyrrolidone, and 1% SIB (Eq-short-mod). More (P <.02) oocytes with normal ultrastructural morphology were seen in fresh control and Eq-short groups than in Eq-long group. Metaphase-II (MIL) rates were higher (P <.05) for oocytes with expanded cumulus than compact cumulus in the control group, and higher (P <.05) for oocytes with expanded cumulus than compact cumulus in Eq-short and Eq-short-mod groups. No difference in MII rates was detected among groups within each type of COC. In conclusion, reduction of exposure time to VS better preserved oocyte ultrastructural features, and MII rates were higher for vitrified oocytes with expanded cumulus. This study advances our knowledge on potential alternatives for vitrification of immature equine oocytes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The main objective of this research was examining the dynamics of stereotype activation in rock and hip-hop music, through the exposure of participants to priming (specific information of stereotypical nature, about the two music genres). The comparative experimental research was performed on a sample of 72 participants, aged between 19 and 21, using The Multidimensional Iowa Suggestibility Scale (short form) and The Lyrics Evaluation Scale. The research used a one-factorial experimental design with the two experimental conditions (absence or presence of priming) realized between groups. In the experiment, participants listened to eight songs belonging to the two music genres and evaluated the lyrics of the songs. The results have shown that stereotype activation occurs in the experimental group, through the more negative evaluation of the songs listened to, in comparison with the control group. The dynamics of stereotype activation is discussed in relation to theories postulated in the field. The implications of these results are discussed, pointing out the idea that the negative outcomes related to these music genres might owe more to the negative stereotypes associated with them than to the music itself.

AB  - Emerging research suggests that outgroup partner's anxiety can disrupt intergroup rapport-building. This study extends previous findings by investigating the interactive effects of anticipated outgroup partner's anxiety and perceived ethnic discrimination on self-anxiety and intergroup contact avoidance. A sample of immigrant adolescents belonging to different ethnic minorities in Italy (N=118) was considered. Results showed that when participants expected to interact with an anxious outgroup (Italian) versus in-group partner, self-anxiety increased and, as a consequence, their intentions to avoid future encounters. However, these effects were observed only for participants with higher (vs. lower) perceptions of being discriminated against. The implications of these results for interethnic communication and misunderstandings are discussed.

AB  - People (selectors) sometimes make choices both for themselves and for others (recipients). We propose that selectors worry about offending recipients with their choices when recipients are stigmatized group members and options in a choice set differ along a stigma-relevant dimension. Accordingly, selectors are more likely to make the same choices for themselves and stigmatized group member recipients Than non-stigmatized group member recipients. We conducted eight studies to study this hypothesis in different choice contexts (food, music, games, books) and with recipients from different stigmatized groups (the obese, Black-Americans, the elderly, students at lower-status schools). We use three different approaches to show that this effect is driven by people's desire to avoid offending stigmatized group members with their choices. Thus, although prior research shows that people often want to avoid being associated with dissociative groups, such as stigmatized groups, we demonstrate that people make the same choices for self and stigmatized other to minimize offense.

AB  - Two studies demonstrated that active efforts to appreciate a romantic partner's unique point of view (imagine-other perspective-taking) lead individuals lower in self-esteem (LSEs) to feel less loved by their partner and less satisfied with their relationship as a result. These effects were evident regardless of whether individuals' perspective-taking efforts involved reflecting specifically on a disagreement with their partner (Study 2) or not (Study 1). The studies thus identify a new path through which perspective-taking efforts can detract from relational well-being, one to which LSEs are uniquely vulnerable. Results from an open-ended thought-listing task administered in Study 2 confirmed that increased cognitive energy LSEs devoted to drawing (negative) metaperceptual inferences about their partner's evaluation of them contributed to the negative effect of imagine-other perspective-taking on their perceived regard. No such effects were evident for individuals higher in self-esteem, and imagine-self perspective-taking instead exerted a general positive influence on individuals' evaluations of their partner.

AB  - The present research examined the effects of one's national sports team defeats in international competitions on adolescents' out-group attitudes and the moderation of these effects by in-group identification. We conducted two longitudinal studies surveying German adolescents (Soccer World Championship 2006 and European Championship 2008). Both studies showed deterioration in adolescents' evaluations of people from the countries whose soccer teams defeated the German team (Italy and Spain). There was no generalization to other national groups. The deterioration in out-group evaluations was shown to be more pronounced for adolescents reporting a high in-group identification. The results are discussed in terms of macro-societal effects on adolescents' attitude development and the function that intergroup bias serves for social identity.

AB  - Cellular resistance to insulin caused by reduced glucose transport and metabolism is a primary defect leading to the development of metabolic disease. While the etiology of insulin resistance is multifactorial, reduced insulin action is associated with impaired activity of the glucose transporter GLUT4 in insulin-sensitive tissues. Yet, the role of adipose tissue GLUT4 deregulation in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance, obesity, and diabetes is still unclear. In this study, we assessed the relative GLUT4 level in human subcutaneous adipose tissue from obese, diabetic, and diabetic obese versus control subjects, using a real-time PCR method. GLUT4 mRNA levels were considerably decreased among type 2 diabetic patients compared with those of the controls (P < 0.01), whereas no such difference was found between obese and normal-weight controls. Multiple linear regressions analysis in both diabetic non-obese and diabetic obese groups showed a negative correlation between GLUT4 mRNA expression and both markers of obesity or insulin resistance (P < 0.01). However, in obese group, GLUT4 was inversely associated only with HOMA-IR (P < 0.01). Our findings showed that adipose GLUT4 gene expression changes were more related to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes rather than to obesity.

AB  - BRS-3 KO-mice developed obesity and unbalanced glucose metabolism, suggesting an important role of BRS-3 receptor in glucose homeostasis. We explored BRS-3 expression in skeletal muscle from normal, obese or type-2 diabetic (T2D) patients, and the effect of [D-Phe(6), beta-Ala(11), Phe(13), Nle(14)]bombesin(6-14) - BRS-3-agonist-peptide (BRS-3-AP) - on glucose-related effects, before or after BRS-3 gene silencing. In muscle tissue and primary cultured myocytes from altered metabolic states, BRS-3 gene/protein expressions were down-regulated. In normal, obese and T2D cells: A) BRS-3-AP as insulin enhanced BRS-3 and GLUT-4 mRNA/protein levels; improving glucotransporter translocation to plasma membrane, and B) BRS-3-AP caused a concentration-related-stimulation of glucose transport, being obese and T2D myocytes more sensitive to the ligand than normal. Wortmannin and PD98059, but not rapamycin, abolished the stimulatory action of BRS-3-AP on glucose transport. BRS-3 plays an important role in glucose metabolism, and could be use as a molecular target, and/or its ligand, as a therapeutic agent for obesity and diabetes treatments.

AB  - Combination with cabergoline may offer additional benefits to acromegalic patients on pegvisomant monotherapy. We evaluated the safety and efficacy profile of this combination and investigated the determinants of response. An observational, retrospective, cross-sectional study. Fourteen acromegalic patients (9 females), who were partially resistant to somatostatin analogs and on pegvisomant monotherapy. Cabergoline was added because of the presence of persistent mildly increased IGF-I. The mean follow-up time was 18.3 +/- A 10.4 months. The efficacy and safety profile was assessed. The influence of clinical and biochemical characteristics on treatment efficacy was studied. IGF-I levels returned to normal in 4 patients (28%) at the end of the study. In addition, some decline in IGF-I levels was observed in a further 5 patients. The % IGF-I decreased from 158 +/- A 64% to 124 +/- A 44% (p = 0.001). The average change in IGF-I was -18 +/- A 27% (range -67 to +24%). Lower baseline IGF-I (p = 0.007), female gender (p = 0.013), lower body weight (p = 0.031), and higher prolactin (PRL) levels (p = 0.007) were associated with a better response to combination therapy. There were no significant severe adverse events. Significant tumour shrinkage was observed in 1 patient. Combination therapy with pegvisomant and cabergoline could provide better control of IGF-I in some patients with acromegaly. Baseline IGF-I levels, female gender, body weight, and PRL levels affect the response to this combination therapy.

AB  - We investigated whether political print ads were able to moderate the influence of automatic affective gut reactions (i.e., implicit attitudes) on overtly expressed evaluations (i.e., explicit attitudes) of foreigners. In accordance with the feeling-as-information theory (Schwarz, 2012, In Van Lange et al. (Eds.), Handbook of Theories of Social Psychology, Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage), we assumed that political ads containing positive, calming stimuli (e.g., nature pictures) signal a benign environment and thus should lead to less-effortful processing in subsequent situations. Due to the fact that the implicit-explicit correspondence is assumed to be higher under less-effortful processing, we hypothesized that these political print ads are able to increase the implicit-explicit correspondence. We tested this in an experiment in which participants (N = 164) were exposed to three positively valenced, calming ads of a European right-wing party (treatment group 1), or three negatively valenced, arousing ads of the same party (treatment group 2), or bogus ads (control group). As predicted, implicit attitudes better predicted explicit attitudes in participants who watched the positively valenced, calming ads. Thus, these participants based their overtly expressed evaluation of foreigners more on their (mostly negative) automatic gut reactions. In contrast, we found that egalitarian-related nonprejudicial goals predicted explicit attitudes in participants who watched negatively valenced, arousing ads. Thus, the content of these ads seemed to be "too strong'' for participants and activated egalitarian-related values, which in turn predicted explicit attitudes. Taken together, our findings underline the importance of considering the relationship between explicit and implicit attitudes when studying the effects of political advertising.

AB  - Females are perceived to have less power than males. These differences in perceived power might render different self-regulatory strategies appropriate: Women should (as members of other low-power groups) care about security, whereas men should (as members of other high-power groups) strive for accomplishment. These regulatory implications of gender provide the basis for regulatory fit between individuals' gender and their regulatory focus. Higher fit should lead to stronger gender-based ingroup favoritism: Prevention-focused females and promotion-focused males were expected to show more ingroup favoritism than both sexes in the respective other regulatory focus. According to the regulatory fit hypothesis, this effect should occur for evaluative-but not for stereotype-based ingroup favoritism. Three studies supported these hypotheses.

AB  - Evaluations of individuals and social groups refer to two basic dimensions of social judgment: warmth and competence. Although previous research has explored the antecedents and consequences of these evaluations, there is a lack of understanding of the conditions under which warmth and competence information is used for social categorization in the first place. The present research developed a novel measure of individuals' tendencies to categorize persons in terms of competence versus warmth and tested whether these tendencies are predicted by chronic (Study 1, N = 301) and experimentally induced (Study 2, N = 69) social conformity and superiority goals. Social conformity goals predicted greater relative use of warmth information, while superiority goals predicted greater relative use of competence information in categorizing persons. These findings attest to the relevance of chronic as well as contextually induced goals at an early stage of social information processing related to social categorization.

AB  - Turkey's bid to join the European Union (EU) is more contentious than any previous enlargement of the EU. With the prospect of a predominantly Muslim country joining the Union, religious differences are often argued to be at the heart of public opposition to Turkish membership, whereas economic reasoning seems to dominate arguments in favour. Yet, public opinion on this issue is also highly volatile. This raises the question of the extent to which elite framing of the debate on Turkish accession can shape public opinion. Using a survey-embedded experimental study, we examine the differences in support between people exposed to positive and negative cultural and economic arguments. Our results show that the economic frames are persuasive across the board, whereas cultural (religious) frames are strongly conditioned by individual predispositions on religious diversity.

AB  - This study established the internal consistency of the SDO6 scale as a measure of Social Dominance Orientation in South Africa. The reliability was determined for its original English version and for newly developed Afrikaans and isiXhosa forms. Reliabilities were determined for various demographic sub-groups. The English and Afrikaans forms showed high internal consistencies throughout, which were comparable to those found in other societies. The isiXhosa version of the scale had low internal consistencies, except for participants who had completed their schooling. Deleting three items from the isiXhosa scale improved its reliability for high school students to an adequate level. It is suggested that future research establishes the scales' validity in the South African context.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to examine the role of right wing authoritarianism (RWA; Altemeyer, 1996) and social norms, or expectations of proper social conduct, in the repentance-forgiveness process. Two studies systematically revealed a negative relation between RWA and forgiveness, a positive effect of repentance on forgiveness, and a significant interaction between RWA and repentance on forgiveness. The interaction, in both studies, showed that there was a stronger positive relation between repentance and forgiveness for those who were high in RWA compared to those who were low in RWA. The results of Study 2 also showed that the interaction between RWA and repentance on forgiveness was explained by the victim's perception of the transgressor's response as proper. These results help to further establish the boundary conditions under which repentance influences forgiveness and the mechanisms underlying its effects.

AB  - Previous negotiation research predominantly focused on psychological factors that lead to suboptimal compromises as opposed to integrative agreements. Few studies systematically analyzed factors that impact the emergence of hurtful partial impasses (i.e., nonagreements on part of the issues). The present research investigates negotiators' egoistic motivation as a determinant for the emergence of partial impasses. In addition, the authors seek to demonstrate that perspective taking serves as a powerful tool to avoid impasses and to overcome egoistic impediments. Specifically, it was predicted that within an integrative context perspective-takers succeed to exchange concessions on low- versus high-preference issues (i.e., logroll), thereby increasing their individual profits without inflicting hurtful losses upon their counterparts. Three studies were conducted to test these predictions. Study 1 reveals that whereas negotiators' egoistic motivation increases the risk of partial impasses, perspective taking alleviates this risk. Study 2 demonstrates that this beneficial effect of a perspective-taking mindset is limited to integrative negotiations and does not emerge in a distributive context, in which negotiators are constrained to achieve selfish goals by inflicting hurtful losses on their counterparts. Study 3 confirms the assumption that in an integrative context egoistic perspective-takers overcome the risk of impasses by means of logrolling. The findings of the present studies are discussed with respect to their contribution to research on negotiations, social motivation, and perspective taking.

AB  - The paper uses insights from several Social Psychological theories to study the cultural artifacts of the Merry Cemetery (MC) of Sapanta (Romania). In the first study we have content analysed the epitaphs written on the painted crosses of the MC and the results show that the epitaphs reflect personal as well as social identity (in which individuals are described as members of both the family and the community) and play two important roles for the community members: they serve as a message to the dear ones and as an external memory of the community's social norms and shared worldview. The second study explored the social representation of the MC in the local community. The results show that the social representation of the MC clusters around three main themes: its symbolic, economic and local identity value. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: Adiponectin has emerged over the last decade as a key adipokine linking obesity, insulin resistance, and Type 2 diabetes. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling adiponectin expression in adipose tissue are not fully elucidated. Furthermore, increasing evidence indicates that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) plays an important, and beneficial, role in modulating adiponectin expression. Aim: The aim of the present study was to assess the separate role of obesity and Type 2 diabetes in the relationship between endogenous PPAR-gamma signaling and adiponectin expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Subjects and methods: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and real time quantitative PCR analysis were carried out in overweight, obese, and/or diabetic Tunisian patients who underwent an abdominal surgery. Results: These results collectively indicate that circulating levels of adiponectin were decreased in all over-weight, obese, and/or diabetic (p<0.001). However, the subcutaneous mRNA expression of adiponectin was reduced only in diabetics (p<0.01) but presents some discrepancies in obese individuals. Moreover, mRNA levels of adiponectin were positively correlated with levels of mRNA encoding PPAR gamma and its heterodimeric partner retinoid X receptor-alpha (RXR-alpha), in both obese and diabetic patients. Conclusion: Our study on Tunisian patients shows impaired regulation of circulating and mRNA adiponectin levels dependent of metabolic disorders in obesity and Type 2 diabetes. The data suggest that subcutaneous adipose tissue may play an important role in modulating adiponectin expression in diabetes and obesity. Moreover, adiponectin mRNA could be potentially regulated by endogenous PPAR gamma/RXR alpha-dependent pathways. (J. Endocrinol. Invest. 34: e16-e23, 2011) (C) 2011, Editrice Kurtis

AB  - CgA is a tumor marker in NET's (neuroendocrine tumors) but different ranges of sensitivity and specificity according to the commercial assay kits used have been reported. Our aim was to compare three commercial available assay kits that use three different methodologies (IRMA, RIA and ELISA) to determine CgA, in a clinical setting: 52 healthy people, 98 patients with benign diseases, 94 patients with non-NETA ' s malignancies, 20 SCLC and in 79 patients with NET's. Results: Using a cut-off with a 100% specificity in healthy people (6 nmol/L, 60 ng/ml, and 90 ng/ml, for RIA, ELISA and IRMA, respectively), abnormal serum concentrations of CgA were found in a high proportion of patients with renal failure (76.7% ,86,7% and 93.3% with ELISA; IRMA and RIA, respectively) other benign diseases (excluding patients with creatinine concentrations > 1.5 mg/dl)(40,3%, 50% and 53,2% with ELISA, IRMA and RIA, respectively) or in patients with non-NETA ' s malignancies (excluding SCLC and patients with renal failure) (59,8% ELISA, 55,4%% IRMA, 37% RIA). The highest CgA sensitivity in SCLC was obtained with ELISA (100%) and in NETA ' s with ELISA (83.3%) and IRMA (80.3%) (RIA 65.2%). ROC curves comparing healthy people and NETA ' s or NETA ' s- benigns showed a significantly higher area under the curve (AUC) with ELISA (0.964 and 0.774), or IRMA (0.955 and 0.785), and smaller with RIA (0,806 and 0.691). Conclusions: CgA is not a specific tumormarker and abnormal concentrations may be found in non-NETA ' s. The higher AUC, sensitivity and specificity obtained with the ELISA and IRMA indicates that these are the best techniques to determine CgA.

AB  - The involvement of protein oxidation in embryonic mortality (EM) has been poorly investigated in cows. Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) are markers of protein oxidation generated by activated neutrophils and involved in inflammation. The aim of this work was to study AOPP in cow plasma and their relationship with late EM. The outcomes of 158 artificial inseminations (AI) were examined in 72 cows, which were classified ex post on the basis of blood progesterone and pregnancy-associated glycoprotein concentrations and clinical confirmation of pregnancy into the following categories: (1) positive (AI+, resulted in pregnancy, n = 58), (2) negative (AI-, did not result in pregnancy, n 86) and (3) embryonic mortality (EM, n 14). Plasma protein fractions, malondialdehyde (MDA), total glutathione and AOPP were measured at AI (Day 0) and on Days 15, 28, 35, 45 and 60. MDA was significantly higher in EM than AI+ and AI- animals on Day 45, and than AI+ animals on Day 60 (P<0.05). Mean plasma AOPP concentrations were significantly higher in the EM group (P<0.01) and the ratio of AOPP : albumin was significantly higher in the EM group on Days 15, 28, 45 and 60 (P<0.05). Based on the temporal pattern of the AOPP : albumin ratio, we propose that oxidative stress is implicated in and may possibly be a cause of EM.

AB  - This study used three controlled experiments to investigate the effects of a story subject's race on the moral judgment of Asian American, Hispanic, and Black professional journalists by changing only the race of the news subjects in photographs. Contrary to what in-group and identification theories would predict, minority journalists did not show preference to story subjects of their own race, nor did they show bias toward story subjects of other races; instead they treated all races as equals. Empathy was also found to be positively and significantly related to moral judgment in two of the three samples; as compassion, caring, and putting oneself in the role of the other increased, so did moral judgment scores. Expansions to theory and improvements to journalistic practice are discussed.

AB  - Previous research has demonstrated that talk about immigration can function to produce, reproduce and stabilize racism (Capdevila & Callaghan, 2008). In New Zealand (NZ), changes in immigration policy have seen a rapid increase in diverse groups of migrants with varied cultural backgrounds entering the country in the past two decades. Given its unique colonial history and 'settler nationality in a bicultural nation' (Bell, 2009), we explored how young NZ adults talk about and produce meanings and understandings of immigration, immigrants and cultural diversity. Appealing to notions of NZ as 'one society', as English speaking, and as English looking participants constructed NZ, NZ national identity and the NZ economy in particular ways. This constituted a nationalist rhetoric that was taken up in common-sense ways by participants to legitimize racist talk whilst simultaneously acting to locate participants themselves as reasonable and moral individuals. It is concluded that nationalist discourses function to reinforce patterns of social dominance and perpetuate the notion of New Zealanders as largely white, European-looking and English-speaking.

AB  - Prior research suggests that people expect to be perceived negatively in interracial interactions but positively in intraracial interactions. The present research demonstrates that an interaction partner's racial network of friends can moderate these expectations in interracial interactions but not intraracial interactions. Across two experiments, we led Black and White college students to believe they would have conversation with a White student on campus. The results revealed that Black students expected to be perceived more positively and anticipated a less challenging conversation, when their interaction partner had a racially diverse network of friends compared to a racially homogeneous network of friends. In contrast, White students expected to be perceived positively and anticipated few challenges in the conversation, regardless of their interaction partner's racial network of friends. The implications of racial friendship diversity are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Adipocytokine resistin is a member of the newly discovered family of cysteine-rich protein. Recent data suggest that macrophages are a major source of human resistin. Given the obesity-breast cancer link and convergence of adipocyte and macrophage function, resistin may provide unique insight into links between obesity, inflammation, and breast cancer risk in humans. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study to evaluate whether plasma resistin levels were associated with breast cancer risk in women. We also examined the modification effect of estrogen exposures on the resistin-breast cancer link. Questionnaire information, anthropometric measures, and blood samples were taken before treatment from 380 incident cases with breast cancer and 760 controls admitted for health examination at the Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei between 2004 and 2008. Plasma levels of resistin were measured by enzyme immunoassay. Cumulative exposure to estrogens were estimated according to the age at menarche and age at enrollment for premenopausal women and age at menarche and age at menopause for postmenopausal women. Cases with breast cancer had significantly elevated resistin concentrations as compared with control subjects. Compared with those in the lowest quartile, the adjusted odds ratios of breast cancer for women in the second, third, and highest quartiles were 1.48 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.65-3.38], 1.76 (95% CI = 1.00-4.73), and 2.08 (95% CI = 1.04-3.85), respectively. Furthermore, the biological gradient of breast cancer risk by plasma resistin levels remained after adjustment for measurers of adiposity. The dose-dependent relationship of resistin levels with breast cancer risk was notably pronounced among women with excess exposure to estrogens. Adipocytokine resistin may have an adiposity-independent role in breast carcinogenesis. Mechanistic studies to fully elucidate the mechanisms underlying resistin's effects should be pursued in future investigations.

AB  - Numerous findings have documented the adverse effects of stereotypes on those negatively portrayed by the stereotypes. Less is known about the ramifications of stereotype exposure on those who are not the objects of the stereotypic depictions. Two studies examined the effect of exposure to an American Indian sports mascot on the stereotype endorsement of a different minority group. Study 1 used an unobtrusive prime, while Study 2 used a more engaged prime. Study 2 also investigated the effect among those unfamiliar with the controversy regarding American Indian sports mascots. Results from both studies show that participants primed with an American Indian sports mascot increased their stereotyping of a different ethnic minority group.

AB  - This paper considers the process by which individuals estimate the risk of adverse events, with particular attention to the social context in which risk estimates are formed. We compare subjective probability estimates of crime victimization to actual victimization experiences among respondents from the 1994 to 2002 waves of the Survey of Economic Expectations (Dominitz and Manski 2002). Using zip code identifiers, we then match these survey data to local area characteristics from the census. The results show that: (1) the risk of criminal victimization is significantly overestimated relative to actual rates of victimization or other negative events; (2) neighborhood racial composition is strongly associated with perceived risk of victimization, whereas actual victimization risk is driven by nonracial neighborhood characteristics; and (3) white respondents appear more strongly affected by racial composition than nonwhites in forming their estimates of risk. We argue these results support a model of stereotype amplification in the formation of risk estimates. Implications for persistent racial inequality are considered.

AB  - A relational model of spirituality and transformation (Shults & Sandage, 2006; Sandage & Shults, 2007) based on the dialectic of spiritual dwelling and seeking (Wuthnow, 1998) was tested in a sample of Christian graduate seminary students (N = 181). Spiritual dwelling was operationalized using a developmental measure of realistic acceptance (RA)(Hall & Edwards, 2002), and spiritual seeking was measured with the Quest Scale (Batson & Schoenrade, 1991a, 1991b). Results included modest positive correlations between Quest and Spiritual Instability, Spiritual Disappointment, and Mental Health Symptoms and modest negative correlations between both RA and Mental Health Symptoms. The report of a recent spiritual transformation moderated the curvilinear relationship between Quest and RA supporting the relational spirituality model. Implications are considered for future research on dialectical understandings of spiritual development and for training programs in the helping professions.

AB  - Despite a large literature on public views about crime, the racialization of crime, and the contact hypothesis, surprisingly little is known about how interracial friendships may influence Whites' fear of crime. At the same time, and perhaps because no counterpart stereotype to that of "Blacks as criminals" exists, there has been little exploration of how Such contact may influence Blacks' fear of crime. To address these research gaps, this study built on prior theory and research and used data from an ABC News and Washington Post poll to test competing hypotheses about the effect of interracial contact oil Whites' and Blacks' fear of crime, respectively. The analyses revealed that close interracial friendships are associated with increased fear of crime among Whites, decreased fear of crime among lower-income Blacks, and increased fear among higher-income Blacks. The implications for theory and research are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The articles in this issue provide an overview of recent research on intergroup relations in South Africa. Most of them focus on intergroup contact theory, and they replicate and advance the theory in a variety of ways. They also emphatically counter those critics who believe that the theory does not apply in parts of the world with long histories of intergroup discrimination and conflict. Earlier work in Northern Ireland reached the same conclusion. The mandate for future social psychological efforts in this research area is to place contact theory and other social psychological processes in their broader structural context. Only then can this essentially bottom-up approach to social change be made useful for broad social policy. The South African emphasis on the conditions needed to achieve intergroup contact after centuries of discrimination and separation offers a solid beginning for this needed new direction.
