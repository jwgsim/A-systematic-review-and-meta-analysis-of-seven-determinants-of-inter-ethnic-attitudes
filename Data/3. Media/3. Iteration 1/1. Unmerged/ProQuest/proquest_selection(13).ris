T1  - The imaginary friends of my friends: Imagined contact interventions which highlight supportive social norms reduce children’s antirefugee bias: GPIR
AN  - 2693010296
AB  - Fostering inclusive attitudes among children in host classrooms is key to integrating refugee children. A field experiment tests the prejudice reduction effects of a teacher-led activity integrating imagined intergroup contact and normative influence. To enhance the effectiveness of imagined contact, scenarios include supportive ingroup norms. In 29 classes, 545 children (Mage = 10.88, SD = 0.96) were randomly assigned to one of five conditions: standard imagined contact, imagined contact encouraged by family, class peers, or religious ingroups, or a control. Children in all norm-framed imagined contact conditions had significantly less antirefugee bias compared with the control. The class-peer norm frame significantly reduced affective and cognitive facets of bias. The family norm frame reduced affective bias, and the religious norm frame reduced cognitive bias. Standard imagined contact did not differ from the control. Potential mediating pathways are explored. These findings illustrate the utility of incorporating norms into imagined contact interventions to reduce antirefugee bias among schoolchildren.

T1  - The role of social psychological processes in journalist's war and peace journalism attitudes: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2681723638
AB  - Previous studies have shown factors including media ownership, socio-political censorship, ethnic division and, the lack of professional training as obstacles to practising Peace Journalism principles. This research explored how social psychological processes including intergroup contact and outgroup attitudes influence Peace Journalism attitudes. Turkish Cypriot (TC) and Greek Cypriot (GC) journalists living in the divided and conflicted island of Cyprus participated. Findings highlighted that quantity and quality of contact are positively correlated with positive feelings, common ingroup identity (CII) and Peace Journalism attitudes and negatively correlated with intergroup anxiety and War Journalism (WJ) attitudes. Results shed light on the benefits of positive and frequent contact among journalists and with outgroup members that enhance positive social psychological processes as well as Peace Journalism attitudes. By recognizing the importance of intergroup contact, Peace Journalism attitudes can be improved by decreasing social-psychological tensions and contribute to reconciliation, peace-building processes, and sustainable peace in conflicted societies.

T1  - The socio-psychological predictors of support for post-truth collective action
AN  - 2684795863
AB  - Politics in the current era are replete with unreliable media stories which lack evidence, sometimes disparagingly dubbed “fake news”. A survey on a sample of Muslims in Indonesia (N = 518) in this work found that participants’ endorsement of collective action in of support issues with little to no empirical evidence (i.e., post-truth collective action) increased as a function of their belief in fake news and prejudice against the outgroup (i.e., non-Muslims). Belief in fake news stemmed from participants’ generic and specific conspiratorial thinking, whereas prejudice was positively predicted by relative Muslim prototypicality, denoting how much Muslims in Indonesia view that their group is more representative than non-Muslims of the superordinate Indonesian identity that encompasses both groups. Additionally, our findings revealed that generic conspiratorial thinking and relative Muslim prototypicality were positively predicted by collective narcissism, which in turn spurred participants’ support for collective action by augmenting belief in fake news.

T1  - Perceived discrimination and psychological distress among immigrants to Canada: The mediating role of bicultural identity orientations: GPIR
AN  - 2669413200
AB  - Bicultural identity orientations have rarely been examined in relation to both perceived discrimination and psychological distress. Furthermore, these constructs have usually been studied in isolation, but their intersection is essential for understanding intercultural relations in multicultural societies. Using cross-sectional data from 1,143 Canadian undergraduate students from immigrant families, this study explored the relationship between perceived discrimination and psychological distress, and how bicultural identity orientations might mediate this relationship. The structural equation modeling results indicated that perceived discrimination was associated with higher levels of psychological distress and hybrid, monocultural, alternating, and conflicted orientations, but lower levels of complementary orientation. Alternating and conflicted orientations were related to higher psychological distress, whereas the other orientations were not. Alternating and conflicted orientations mediated the relationship between perceived discrimination and psychological distress, whereas the other orientations did not. The findings are discussed in light of theories on identity integration, rejection–identification, and acculturation.

T1  - Disrupting times in the wake of the pandemic: Dispositional time attitudes, time perception and temporal focus
AN  - 2649931756
AB  - Introduction  The COVID-19 pandemic has majorly disrupted many aspects of people’s lives, provoking psychosocial distress among students. People’s positive and negative attitudes towards the past, present and future were a dispositional pre–COVID-19 reality. Faced with a pandemic, people have reported disruptions in the speed of passing time. People can shift their attention more towards the past, present or future when major changes in society occur. These aspects of psychological time would be key to understanding the quality of psychosocial adjustment to the pandemic. We hypothesized that dispositional time attitudes impact psychosocial distress because they would trigger situational changes in our time perception and temporal focus.  Methods  One hundred and forty-four university students in Uruguay responded to self-report questionnaires online while in-person classes were cancelled. Students reported on shifts in temporal focus, changes in time awareness and dispositional time attitudes. Reactive psychological, social and learning environment distress were reported.  Results  Students reported substantial changes in time perception and temporal focus. A correlation matrix showed significant relationships between time attitudes, focus and awareness. For example, psychological distress was correlated with negative time attitudes, slower passage of time, boredom, blurred sense of time and shifting focus to the past. Mediation models were derived. The indirect effect of time attitudes on psychological distress was significant through past focus.  Discussion  Dispositional time attitudes would impact students’ capacity to cope with the pandemic. Situational shifts in temporal focus and perception were prevalent and can be viewed as temporal coping mechanisms in the wake of powerful societal change. Our mediation models showed that those with negative time attitudes experienced more psychological distress because they shifted their attention to the past. Future directions for research and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - White parents’ racial socialization and young adults’ racial attitudes: Moral reasoning and motivation to respond without prejudice as mediators: GPIR
AN  - 2609042692
AB  - This study examined relations between parental racial socialization messages (i.e., egalitarianism, racemute, and preparation for bias) and racial attitudes in a sample of 282 White young adults (ages 18–22) in the United States. Egalitarianism messages were positively related to warmth toward racial outgroup members, whereas preparation for bias was negatively related to warmth toward racial outgroup members. In both cases the relation between racial socialization and racial attitudes was mediated by internal motivation to respond without prejudice and fairness/reciprocity moral orientation. Contrary to our expectations, racemute socialization messages were not directly related to participants’ warmth toward racial outgroup members. However, racemute socialization predicted internal motivation to respond without prejudice and fairness/reciprocity moral orientation, which in turn predicted outgroup warmth. These findings suggest possible mechanisms by which parents’ messages about race and racism may shape youths’ racial attitudes.

T1  - “Welcome to our neighbourhood”: Collective confidence in contact facilitates successful mixing in residential settings: GPIR
AN  - 2609041513
AB  - Over the past decade, increasing attention has been paid to the antecedents of intergroup contact and, in particular, self-efficacy to engage in intergroup encounters. Contact self-efficacy has been shown to reduce intergroup anxiety and increase willingness to engage in future contact, and is influenced by the positive contact experiences of other group members. However, this work has neglected the collective nature of self-efficacy and, indeed, has typically counterposed the effects of contact and collective efficacy upon group behaviour. We highlight the potential role that collective efficacy can play in facilitating intergroup contact and propose a new concept to capture this phenomenon: collective confidence in contact (CCIC). Using data from two neighbourhood surveys in contrasting areas of Nottingham City, (UK), we show in our first survey (n = 124) that CCIC is predicted by group identity and that this, in turn, predicts intergroup contact and feelings. In a second survey (n = 232), we show that the effects of identity and support on CCIC are further mediated by a reduction in intergroup anxiety. We propose that the concept of CCIC returns the understanding of contact to the intergroup level, thereby allowing issues of group identity and the generalisation of contact effects to be investigated more directly.

T1  - The role of positive and negative contact of migrants with native people in affecting their future interactions. Evidence from Italy and Turkey
AN  - 2621590850
AB  - This research investigates the relationship between different valence contact of migrants with native people and their motivation to avoid further interactions with the majority group, as a preventing factor of adaptation by either side. Specifically, the joint and differential effects of positive and negative contact of migrants with natives on outgroup avoidance were addressed by examining also the mediating role of affective variables such as stereotype threat, symbolic threat and anxiety. Hypotheses were tested on two samples of African immigrants in Italy and Syrian immigrants in Turkey. Positive contact was not associated with outgroup avoidance and anxiety among African respondents who reported higher negative contact with natives. This evidence was not found among Syrian immigrants. In both samples, however, the moderating role of negative contact was found on stereotype threat. Across the two samples, anxiety was the strongest mediator of the relationship between negative contact of migrants on their avoidance of the majority group. Overall, the evidence we gathered furthers knowledge of the impact of negative intergroup contact on preventing migrant social integration.

T1  - Gamers on Gaming: A Research Note Comparing Behaviors and Beliefs of Gamers, Video Game Players, and Non‐Players
AN  - 2584318392
AB  - Research often conflates video game players and “gamers,” defining gamers by time spent playing or by type of game played. Such operationalization may be a matter of convention or, more problematically, based on stereotypical beliefs about gamers. With a survey of nearly 900 young adults, this study compared self‐identified gamers to other video game players and people who do not play video games. There were behavioral differences in terms of time played, but few attitudinal differences across the groups with regards perceptions of media violence. Non‐players, compared to players and gamers, tended to hold more negative attitudes about video games and their effects. Non‐players also tended to be more socially engaged and have more social support, but gamers were not socially isolated. Notably, hours played did not consistently correlate with beliefs and behaviors. Results demonstrate the importance of recognizing the theoretical, empirical, and practical distinctions among hours played, gamer stereotypes, and gamer identity.

T1  - Hostile Media Perception on Twitter: The Effect of Mediated Social Identity Cues on Biased Perception
AN  - 2614507494
AB  - Partisans tend to view the news as biased against them, an effect believed to be driven in part by social identity. As Twitter comments contain cues that signal group identity, this preregistered study examines the effects of comment identity on hostile media perception (HMP). Across two experiments comment identity was manipulated. Results were mixed. Outgroup comments amplified HMP, moderated by audience position; yet this finding was not replicated. Second, audience position accounted for differences in HMP, which runs counter to the original conceptualization. Results are discussed concerning self-categorization and biased perception of news media.

T1  - Ethnic outgroup aggression: A pilot study on the importance of emotion regulation, nationalism and susceptibility to persuasion
AN  - 2592349782
AB  - The current pilot study investigated the psychological mechanisms behind ethnic outgroup aggression, a significant outcome of intergroup conflicts. While previous research suggested several impactful predictors of ethnic outgroup aggression, such as intergroup contact and nationalism, no attempt has been made to synthesize all these constructs into a single cross-cultural study. Building on existing research, this pilot study is the first to assess a refined framework where we tested a proposed mediation model according to nationalism and emotion regulation mediate the relationship between intergroup contact, susceptibility to persuasion, and intergroup anxiety on the one hand and ethnic outgroup aggression on the other hand within a cross-cultural sample. An online questionnaire was distributed using convenience sampling among 2482 students with an ethnic majority background living and studying in ten (European) countries. Multigroup path analysis supported the larger part of the hypothesized model where we found that emotion regulation partially mediated the relationship between susceptibility to persuasion as a predictor and aggression as an outcome. As expected, we found that the higher the susceptibility to persuasion, the higher the emotion regulation, and the higher the regulation, the lower the aggression in all countries. Our pilot study provided preliminary evidence that emotion regulation, nationalism and susceptibility to persuasion are critical for the understanding of ethnic outgroup aggression in ethnically diverse societies. Future research needs to be carried out focusing on the development of an intergroup anxiety assessment in which possible gender differences in assessed constructs are considered.

T1  - The contact hypothesis during the European refugee crisis: Relating quality and quantity of (in)direct intergroup contact to attitudes towards refugees: GPIR
AN  - 2573356423
AB  - Research shows that direct and indirect intergroup contact reduces levels of prejudice towards immigrants. However, no research so far has explored the association of these different forms of contact with attitudes towards refugees. The present study analyses the relationship between the frequency and valence of direct intergroup contact with people with a migration background, the frequency of indirect contact with news on refugees, and the perception of realistic and symbolic threat, and attitudes towards refugees among adults in four European countries (Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Sweden). Data were collected in 2017 via online questionnaires (N = 6,000). Using structural equation modelling, findings indicate that interethnic contact is positively related to attitudes towards refugees. Moreover, valence of direct contact is found to be more important to attitude formation than its frequency. Regarding indirect contact, exposure to news on refugees and public news consumption are positively related to attitudes, while commercial news consumption is negatively related to attitudes.

T1  - Express acceptance or feel anxiety? The effects of trait-related information about foreign residents on endorsement of multiculturalism
AN  - 2559712952
AB  - Apart from direct contact, people also familiarize themselves with other groups through indirect information. For example, as previous studies have revealed, indirect information on personality traits of outgroup members have influences on intergroup attitudes. Extending existing work, the current study specifically examined the effects of such indirect information on people's endorsement of multiculturalism, a set of attitudes regarding the attainment of harmonious coexistence among diverse cultural groups. Based on the Stereotype Content Model, two experiments were conducted to investigate how media coverage and social consensus information about moral, social and competence-related traits of foreign residents in China would affect local people's endorsement of multiculturalism. In experiment 1, when participants learned from the news that foreigners in China possessed high competence, they expressed more appreciation towards the cultural diversity that foreigners brought to the local society, but less support for foreign residents maintaining their own cultural traditions. In experiment 2, participants who learned that other local people perceived foreign residents as having high sociability, morality or competence showed more appreciation towards cultural diversity and more support for maintaining such diversity. Furthermore, in both experiments, perceived anxiety played a mediating role in how indirect trait-related information affected local people's support for maintaining cultural diversity. Lastly, possible explanations for some unexpected findings and implications for future research are discussed.

T1  - A matter of flexibility: Changing outgroup attitudes through messages with negations
AN  - 2518431192
AB  - Attitudes toward outgroups are an important determinant of peaceful coexistence in diverse societies, but it is difficult to improve them. The current research studies the impact of messages with negations on outgroup attitudes, more specifically on outgroup trust. All studies were preregistered. Using different target groups, Studies 1 and 2 provide evidence for the prediction that communicating negations (e.g., "they are not deceptive") enhances outgroup trust (more so than affirmations, such as "they are reliable," and no messages) among people who are initially low in outgroup trust. Three additional studies (Studies 3a, 3b, and 4), using both a causal chain approach and (moderated) mediation analysis, demonstrate that negations promote cognitive flexibility which in turn enhances outgroup trust among those initially low in outgroup trust. One final study suggests that these findings generalize to outgroup attitude change per se by showing that communicating negations also results in more moderate attitudes when the dominant initial attitude is positive (Study 5: high warmth) rather than negative (Studies 1–4: low trustworthiness). As such, communication that negates people's initial outgroup attitudes could be an effective (previously discounted) intervention to reduce prejudice in intergroup settings.

T1  - Public university students' preferences for restrictionist or lenient immigration policies
AN  - 2549947973
AB  - Few attempts have been made to examine the effects of perceived threats that immigrants pose to host society on young people's preferences for restrictionist or lenient immigration policies. Moreover, the existing literature is scarce on whether such perceived threats mediate the relationship between previously identified demographic antecedents such as gender, race or age and preferences for certain immigration policies. To address these gaps, this study examines direct and mediating effects of perceived economic, cultural and security threats on preferences for lenient or restrictionist immigration policies. Using a sample college students' survey data (N = 604) on their attitudes towards immigration, our findings of logistic regression analysis show that the three dimensions of perceived threat were all positively associated with preference for hardline immigration policies. In addition, regardless of inclusion of perceived threats in the logistic model, being Republican was a consistent positive predictor of the hardline immigration agenda, while female was a consistent negative one. Finally, the results of path analysis of Structural Equation Modeling indicate mediating effects of cultural threat on the relationships between political affiliation (Republican and Independent) and race (Latino) and support for hardline immigration policies.

T1  - Is Sexual Objectification and Victimization of Females in Video Games Associated With Victim Blaming or Victim Empathy?
AN  - 2497685905
AB  - The goal of this study was to investigate whether the sexual objectification and virtual violence against females in video games increases negative attitudes toward females, when addressing a variety of noted methodological issues. Study participants were randomly assigned to a control group, where participants played Madden NFL 12, or an experimental group, where participants played Grand Theft Auto. In the experimental group, participants played the game with a confederate, who exposed participants to sexual objectification and violence against females. Study results indicated that both the experimental and control groups had equivalently low levels of rape myth acceptance prior to game play. Immediately after game play, there still was no statistically significant difference in rape myth acceptance between groups; however, there was a decrease in rape myth acceptance for the experimental group. The decrease in rape myth acceptance continued and magnified for the experimental group, over time, to the point of creating a statistically significant difference between the two groups for the follow-up measure at the end of the study.

T1  - Reducing Transgender Stigma via an E-contact Intervention
AN  - 2484413279
AB  - As a result of persisting stigma, transgender people experience vastly higher rates of harassment, violence, and mental health issues compared to cisgender people. The current study experimentally evaluated a computer-mediated intergroup contact strategy, called E-contact, to reduce transgender stigma. E-contact is a synchronous, cooperative, goal-directed online interaction which is informed by Allport’s intergroup contact theory. In total, 114 cisgender, heterosexual, Australian undergraduates and community members (83 women, 31 men) were randomly allocated to E-contact with an online confederate who either disclosed that they were a transgender woman or a cisgender woman. Following the online interaction, participants then completed measures assessing prior transgender contact and transgender stigma. The findings revealed that transgender E-contact reduced stigma for cisgender men whereas it had no impact on women’s already lower levels of stigma. These novel findings have important implications for researchers, policymakers and counsellors interested in developing transgender stigma reduction interventions by (a) highlighting the importance of transgender contact for those individuals with low or poor prior contact and (b) targeting prejudice-prone populations, such as men, who stand to gain the most from such cooperative, goal-directed interventions.

T1  - Policing Right-Wing Extremism in Canada: Threat Frames, Ideological Motivation, and Societal Implications
AN  - 2585486791
AB  - The rise in right-wing extremist activity in Canada is increasingly documented in academic literature, thinktank reports, and news media. Research highlights the rise in right-wing anti-immigrant sentiment, an increase in hate crimes, and the proliferation of online racist activity in Canada. The proliferation of hate groups is inevitable in societies built upon racist institutions of white supremacy and settler colonialism. Here, Crosby examines the rise of right-wing extremism as an object of security knowledge and analysis in Canada.

T1  - Fostering social change among advantaged and disadvantaged group members: Integrating intergroup contact and social identity perspectives on collective action: GPIR
AN  - 2473716332
AB  - Recent research on intergroup contact has shown how interactions with outgroup members may both decrease and increase motivations to achieve social equality. Similarly, social identity theory has identified the conditions that lead individuals to challenge unequal social systems. Integrating these two major theories, the current study examined the processes underlying the relationship between intergroup contact and participants’ willingness to engage in collective action to challenge social inequality. Specifically, we tested sociostructural variables (status legitimacy and stability, and permeability of group boundaries) as potential mediators of contact in a sample of both advantaged (Italian high school students, N = 392) and disadvantaged (immigrant high school students, N = 165) group members. We found that contact was positively associated with motivation for change, an effect mediated by decreased perceived legitimacy of status differences. Moreover, for the advantaged group, membership salience moderated the effects of quality (but not quantity) of contact. Indirect effects were instead not moderated by content of contact (an index considering the extent to which contact was characterized by a focus on differences vs. commonalities between groups). Theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed.

T1  - Intergroup contact and endorsement of social change motivations: The mediating role of intergroup trust, perspective-taking, and intergroup anxiety among three advantaged groups in Northern Cyprus, Romania, and Israel: GPIR
AN  - 2473715859
AB  - Three studies investigated the effect of intergroup contact and social identification on social change among three advantaged groups in Cyprus, Romania, and Israel. In Study 1 (n = 340, Turkish Cypriots), intergroup contact with disadvantaged immigrant Turks positively predicted endorsement of their social change motivations directly, and via intergroup trust and perspective-taking indirectly. In Study 2 (n = 200, Romanians), contact with the ethnic minority Hungarians positively predicted endorsement of their social change motivations via intergroup trust, perspective-taking, and intergroup anxiety, while ingroup identification negatively predicted endorsement of Hungarian ethnic minority’s collective action tendencies via perspective-taking and anxiety. In Study 3 (n = 240, Israeli Jews), intergroup contact positively predicted, while ingroup identification negatively predicted, endorsement of disadvantaged Israeli Palestinian citizens’ social change motivations via perspective-taking, anxiety, and trust. Across three studies, results show that intergroup contact led the advantaged groups to attitudinally support social change motivations of the disadvantaged outgroups through increased trust, perspective-taking, and reduced anxiety, whereas ingroup identification weakened their intention to support social change motivations via perspective-taking and intergroup anxiety in Study 2, and via intergroup trust, perspective-taking, and intergroup anxiety in Study 3.

T1  - Effects of online and direct contact on Chinese international students’ social capital in intercultural networks: testing moderation of direct contact and mediation of global competence
AN  - 2554500051
AB  - Chinese international students often face daunting challenges of building intercultural networks and receiving support from outgroup members. To facilitate their social integration, this study proposed a research model investigating the relationships of online and direct intergroup contact to social capital in intercultural networks (social support resource networks built among culturally different students). We also examined whether the three dimensions of global competence (global knowledge, attitudes, and skills) can mediate these relationships and whether direct contact can moderate the relationships of online contact to global competence and social capital. Data were collected from 210 Chinese students in Belgium. The results revealed that direct contact was positively related to both bonding and bridging social capital, through the mediators of global skills and attitudes. Online contact was related to the predicted variables in a more complex way. The moderation analyses revealed direct contact as an important moderator that modified effects of online contact. Specifically, online contact was positively related to global skills and bonding social capital at low, rather than high, levels of direct contact. Besides, online contact was negatively related to global attitudes at low, rather than high, levels of direct contact.

T1  - Outgroup morality perceptions mediate secondary transfer effects from direct and extended contact: Evidence from majority and minority group members: GPIR
AN  - 2451091727
AB  - The secondary transfer effect (STE), defined as contact with a primary outgroup improving attitudes towards a secondary outgroup uninvolved in contact, has mainly been studied with reference to direct contact and considering attitude generalization as the main mediating mechanism. Using a majority (422 Italians) and minority (130 immigrants) adolescent sample from high schools in Italy, we examined outgroup morality perceptions as a new mediating mechanism, and tested for the first time whether the STE emerges for extended contact. Results revealed that the STE emerged for direct contact among the majority group and for extended contact among the minority group, and it was sequentially mediated by perceptions of morality towards the primary outgroup, and by attitudes towards the primary outgroup and perceptions of morality towards the secondary outgroup. The STE also emerged for direct contact among the minority group, with morality perceptions towards the secondary outgroup and attitudes towards the primary outgroup being parallel mediators. We discuss the theoretical implications of the findings, arguing that it is important to identify the conditions and underlying processes of the STE in order to reduce prejudice in the case of both majority and minority groups.

T1  - Aggressive confrontation shapes perceptions and attitudes toward racist content online: GPIR
AN  - 2447808038
AB  - With more people using social media on a daily basis and the prevalence of racial discrimination online, it becomes imperative to understand what factors impact minority individuals’ perceptions of these transgressions in an online context. Confrontation to discrimination in the form of comments on social media may meaningfully shape perceptions of racism online. Across three studies, we examine how confrontation type (aggressive vs. passive) and confronter group membership (ingroup vs. outgroup) influence Asian Americans’ perceptions of online prejudice and attitudes towards the confronters. In Study 1, we find that aggressive confrontations alter perceptions of a racist online post to be more offensive as compared to passive confrontations. In Study 2, these findings extend to participants’ likelihood to report the content as offensive. Lastly, in Study 3, we find that aggressive confronters are evaluated more positively than passive confronters. These findings have important implications for understanding racial discrimination in an online context by demonstrating the impact of confrontation type on minority individuals’ perceptions and behaviors.

T1  - Male rape in context: measures of intolerance and support for male rape myths (MRMs)
AN  - 2439261944
AB  - Research on myths about male rape victims and offenders indicates that men and heterosexual individuals tend to believe myths about male rape (MRMs), as do individuals with negative attitudes toward gay men. Many who support male rape myths assume that both male victims of rape and offenders are usually gay, or that straight men cannot be raped. Studies on MRM have portrayed male rape in an ‘everyday life’ context, but myths about male rape are likely shaped by its portrayal in film, television and popular culture. For example, respondents may attribute more blame to victims who are incarcerated as opposed to a victim raped by a stranger near their home. In this study, we assess support for myths about male rape victims and whether the context of the situation and various indicators of intolerance play a role in their beliefs. Specifically, we present four fictional scenarios of male rape to respondents: prison, in the military, during a conflict situation, and on a college campus. We find that respondents are less likely to support MRMs in the context of the military, and that race and gender also explain support for MRMs. Measures of intolerance are positively related to support for MRMs, with sexism having the strongest relationship with support.

T1  - Don’t hurt my outgroup friend: A multifaceted form of imagined contact promotes intentions to counteract bullying: GPIR
AN  - 2429520944
AB  - A growing body of research has shown that imagined intergroup contact can improve outgroup attitudes. The aim of the present study was to examine the effectiveness of a multifaceted form of imagined contact in counteracting bullying in school children, and additionally to test the underlying processes of this effect. Two hundred and fifteen Italian elementary school children took part in a 3-week intervention, where they were asked to imagine a scenario in which they become friends with an unknown disabled child, interact in various social settings, and react to forms of discrimination toward the newly acquired friend. After each session, they discussed collectively what they had imagined. The dependent measures were administered 1 week after the last session. Results revealed that inclusion of an outgroup member in the self mediated the effect of imagined contact on intentions to counteract social exclusion and bullying of disabled children, as well as helping intentions. Imagined contact also promoted greater willingness for outgroup contact via more positive outgroup attitudes and empathy. Our findings are important in delineating new forms of imagined contact, and understanding ways to promote behaviors that defend victims of social exclusion and bullying in school environments.

T1  - A glorious warrior in war: Cross-cultural evidence of honor culture, social rewards for warriors, and intergroup conflict: GPIR
AN  - 2407985522
AB  - Previous research has shown that honor culture and honor ideology enhance interpersonal and intergroup aggressiveness at the individual level. This study aimed to examine collective-level relationships among honor culture, social rewards for warriors, and intergroup conflict. To demonstrate these relationships, I used the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, which contains data on 186 mainly preindustrial societies from all over the world. The analysis demonstrated that honor culture, which values males’ toughness and aggression, has a positive relationship with frequency of intergroup conflicts. In addition, social rewards (praise, prestige, and status) for warriors mediated the relationship between honor culture and frequency of intergroup conflict. These results imply that the collective-level processes of honor culture enhance intergroup conflicts through the social reputations of warriors who participate in war.

T1  - Female Video Game Players and the Protective Effect of Feminist Identity Against Internalized Misogyny
AN  - 2234287504
AB  - Video games often contain sexist content that may be connected to negative consequences for female video game players, such as internalizing negative attitudes and beliefs about women. However, aspects of feminist identification may prevent such negative outcomes from occurring. The present study investigated the relationships among time spent playing video games, internalized misogyny, and the synthesis dimension of feminist identity, which is characterized by embracing the positive aspects of being a woman and incorporating feminine attributes into one’s own unique personality. A total of 319 U.S. female video game players completed measures of media usage, internalized misogyny, and feminist identity. The authors tested a moderation model in which gaming predicted internalized misogyny and synthesis moderated this relationship. Gaming was positively associated with internalized misogyny at lower, but not higher, levels of synthesis. Thus, those who value the positive aspects of womanhood and have thoughtful and realistic perceptions of gender may be resistant to internalizing some harmful beliefs about women perpetuated in games. The present study provides evidence for the potential negative influence of cumulative video game exposure for some women and the protective effect of feminist identity synthesis. Counselors and activists should do work aimed at critically evaluating and challenging gendered messages in video games and affirming women’s gender identities and feminine attributes. Game developers must consider the impact of their content on players and strive to create female characters that are agentic, complex, and competent. Conversely, gamers should avoid supporting games with depthless depictions of women.

T1  - The mediating role of moral exclusion between authoritarianism and outgroup discrimination
AN  - 2445965188
AB  - It has been well-documented that right wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation as two facets of the authoritarian personality differentially account for a variety of negative intergroup behaviors. Integrating the Dual Process Model (Duckitt, 2001), with the literature on "Moral exclusion" (e.g., Opotow, 1990; Tileaga, 2007) we investigated whether or not moral exclusion would mediate such a relationship. Employing survey data (N = 1015), collected from a representative Hungarian sample, we found that moral exclusion mediated the effects of both RWA and SDO on the negative behavioral intentions against Roma as well as Jewish minorities in Hungary. Moreover, we argued that the concept of moral exclusion should be interpreted not as a generalized tendency, but as a mechanism which can be stemmed from distinct social cognitive motivations.

T1  - Bridging Narratives: Predictors of Jewish American and Arab American Support for a Two‐State Solution to the Israeli–Palestinian Conflict
AN  - 2323309443
AB  - In a survey study of Arab and Jewish Americans, we examined which beliefs best predicted support for a two‐state solution. We compared the role of a sense of collective victimhood, dehumanization of the outgroup, a zero‐sum view, and a monolithic narrative on the conflict. In both the Arab American and the Jewish American samples, framing the conflict in terms of a monolithic narrative played the strongest role in predicting rejection of a two‐state solution. On the other hand, when Jewish Americans agreed with the Palestinian narrative, that depicts the Palestinians as indigenous to the land but as dispossessed, they were more likely to support a two‐state solution. Similarly, when Arab Americans agreed with the Israeli narrative, in which Israelis want to live in peace but need to defend themselves, they were more likely to support a two‐state solution. In a second study, we examined if group values and concerns such as commitment to tikkun olam (commitment for justice for other minority groups) and concern with anti‐Semitism mediated between identification as Jewish and acceptance of the Palestinian narrative on the conflict. We found that concern with anti‐Semitism mediated between Jewish identity and rejection of the Palestinian narrative. On the other hand, grounding Jewish identity in values of tikkun olam mediated between Jewish identity and agreement with the Palestinian narrative. This research makes applied contributions by illuminating the key belief associated with support for peace among Arab and Jewish Americans. It also contributes to psychological theory on intergroup reconciliation by operationalizing and measuring the role of acknowledgement of the narrative of the other, group threat, and inclusive victimhood consciousness, in promoting peace.

T1  - Transcultural fandom of the Korean Wave in Latin America: through the lens of cultural intimacy and affinity space
AN  - 2250554164
AB  - This article has examined how the Hallyu phenomenon is integrated into a transnational global cultural landscape, focusing on Chilean reception of K-pop. It analyzed how Hallyu fans engage with a social media-saturated environment in Chile, mapping out transnational pop cultural flows within the digital media environment through which the participatory culture of media users is spread. What is interesting is that Chilean society, in general, shows negative attitudes toward K-pop fans. More importantly, while many Chileans consider K-pop fans weird and strange, often disparaging their family members and friends for liking such music, the marginalization of K-pop fans in Chile promotes a greater sense of bonding among them through the affinity spaces of social media. Under this circumstance, most of our interviewees explained that digital media plays a vital role in the dissemination of K-pop in Chile and Latin America. Unlike Hallyu fans in other regions, K-pop fans in Chile have developed cultural intimacy specific to digital site-media, primarily in the realm of social media, and K-pop generates the creation of affinity spaces via different social media platforms.

T1  - Negative stereotypes as motivated justifications for moral exclusion
AN  - 2224323275
AB  - We investigated the connection between moral exclusion of outgroups and on the one hand, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), and social dominance orientation (SDO) on the other. We assumed that both RWA and SDO would increase the tendency to place other groups out of the scope of justice. However, we also tested whether negative stereotypes about an outgroup's threatening and norm-violating misbehavior would serve as a justification for moral exclusion. These assumptions were tested in connection with Roma, Jewish, and Muslim people as target groups in the Hungarian context (N = 441). In line with our hypotheses, we found that both RWA and SDO had an indirect effect on moral exclusion mediated by negative stereotypes about the particular target group. Our findings suggested that negative stereotypes were more important legitimizing factors for RWA than for SDO. Our results highlight the benefits of interpreting the process of moral exclusion as an outcome of motivated social cognition.

T1  - Implicit Bias Predicts Liking of Ingroup Members Who Are Comfortable With Intergroup Interaction
AN  - 2188929009
AB  - We test a novel framework for how ingroup members are perceived during intergroup interaction. Across three experiments, we found that, above and beyond egalitarian attitudes and motivations, White observers’ automatic responses to Blacks (i.e., their implicit anti-Black bias) shaped their affiliation toward ingroup targets who appeared comfortable engaging in interracial versus same-race interaction. White observers’ implicit anti-Black bias negatively correlated with liking of White targets who were comfortable with Blacks (Experiments 1-3). The relationship between implicit bias and liking varied as a function of targets’ nonverbal comfort in interracial interactions (Experiment 1). Specifically, implicit bias negatively correlated with liking of targets when targets’ nonverbal behaviors revealed observers felt comfortable with interracial contact, irrespective of the nature of those behaviors (Experiment 2). Finally, the relationship between implicit bias and target liking was mediated by perceived similarity (Experiment 3). Theoretical implications for stigma-by-association, social network homogeneity, and extended contact are discussed.

T1  - When imagining intergroup contact mobilizes collective action: The perspective of disadvantaged and advantaged groups
AN  - 2216909697
AB  - The current studies aimed to reveal the potential role of imagined intergroup contact on collective action tendencies within a context of intergroup conflict. Study 1 (disadvantaged Kurds, N = 80) showed that imagined contact increased collective action tendencies and this effect was mediated by increased perceived discrimination and ethnic identification. Study 2 (advantaged Turks, N = 127) demonstrated that imagined contact also directly increased collective action tendencies, as well as perceived discrimination and relative deprivation among the advantaged group. No significant mediation emerged. At the same time, in line with literature, imagined contact led only the advantaged group members to display more positive outgroup attitudes. Findings suggest that in settings where ingroup identities and conflict are salient, imagined contact may not readily undermine motivation for social change among group members.

AN  - 2216903226
AB  - This study investigated the association between perceived parental positive and negative contact and adolescents’ own positive and negative contact experiences and tested perspective-taking, intergroup anxiety, outgroup attitudes, and approach behavioral tendencies as potential mediators.

Structural equation models demonstrated that percieved negative parental contact was directly and strongly associated with negative, but not positive, adolescent contact, whereas parental positive contact had a direct positive association with adolescent positive contact. We further found that perceived parental positive contact was related to higher perspective-taking and lower intergroup anxiety which promoted approach behavioral tendencies which was, in turn, related to more positive and less negative contact among adolescents. The study highlights the critical function of parental positive and negative contact on the formation of adolescents’ contact behaviors.

T1  - Through the Lens of Sexual Stigma: Attitudes Toward Lesbian and Gay Parenting
AN  - 2204269790
AB  - Drawing from the literature on sexual stigma, the principal aim of this study was to investigate predictors of heterosexual's internalization of negative attitudes regarding lesbian and gay parenting and the mediating role of beliefs in the controllability of homosexuality. A Portuguese sample of 1,430 heterosexual women and 502 heterosexual men responded to an online questionnaire about attitudes toward lesbian and gay parenting. Structural equation modeling was used to explore attitudinal predictors and mediation analysis. Mediation analyses revealed that sexual prejudice toward same-gender-parented families was predicted by gender, age, education, and religiosity, in that heterosexual men, those who were older, had less education, and were more religious held significantly more negative beliefs about lesbian and gay parenting, as well as lower perception of benefits associated with lesbian and gay parenting. Further, etiological beliefs mediated the effects of gender, age, and religiosity on sexual attitudes, highlighting the importance of the perception of controllability of homosexuality in justifying sexual prejudice.

T1  - Group-centric attitudes mediate the relationship between need for closure and intergroup hostility: GPIR
AN  - 2133222754
AB  - A model of the relationship between need for closure (NFC) and intergroup hostility was tested in four studies. According to the model, heightened NFC promotes glorification of the ingroup which fosters support for extreme measures against the group’s perceived enemies. In a parallel process, high level of NFC induces perceptions of ingroup victimhood, which also adds support for aggressive actions toward rival outgroups. In the first two studies, conducted in Palestine’s West Bank (Study 1) and in the United States (Study 2), NFC promoted a greater sense of moral entitlement to engage in violence against the outgroup, and this was mediated by perceived ingroup victimhood. The subsequent two studies tested the full hypothesized parallel mediation model among students in Northern Ireland (Study 3) and Jewish-Israelis (Study 4). Results largely supported the proposed model. Findings are discussed in relation to additional evidence linking NFC to phenomena of intergroup hostility.

T1  - Attitudes towards Muslims and fear of terrorism
AN  - 2117320047
AB  - This article looks at explanatory approaches of fear of terrorism. Until now, empirical studies looking at determinants of fear of terrorism have used the theoretical framework from the field of research regarding fear of crime. We argue that the cognitive link between terrorism and Islam is currently so strong that explanatory models should include measures of attitudes towards Muslims. On an argumentative level, the fear of crime theoretical framework is unconvincing. Our empirical analysis using structural equation modelling shows that fear of terrorism shares almost no determinants with the fear of violent crime. Negative attitudes towards Muslims are the strongest determinant of fear of terrorism and totally mediate all other effects. Discussions about tackling the issue of fear of terrorism should consider these findings as solutions may otherwise be inappropriate, at best. At worst, solutions based on an improper understanding of the determinants of fear of terrorism may serve only to exacerbate the problem.

T1  - Willingness to Falsely Take Blame among Friends: Closeness, Reporting Wrongdoing, and Identity
AN  - 2035225833
AB  - This study examined people's willingness to falsely take the blame for a friend's offense. We sought to identify whether friendship closeness and individual differences would predict false blame-taking. Participants were randomly assigned to think of either a close or casual friend engaging in driver negligence and indicated their willingness to falsely take responsibility. Although self-construal was unrelated to willingness, oneness mediated the relationship between friendship closeness and blame-taking willingness. Negative attitudes about reporting wrongdoing predicted a greater willingness, and men were more willing to take the blame than women. Results may help those in the legal system to better identify false confessions.

T1  - The impact of implicitly and explicitly primed ingroup–outgroup categorization on the evaluation of others pain: The case of the Jewish–Arab conflict
AN  - 2009236222
AB  - Despite the automaticity of affective sharing, many studies have documented the role of top-down effects, such as social categorization, on people’s empathic responses. An important question, largely ignored in previous research, concerns empathy to ingroup and outgroup members’ pain in the contexts of ongoing intergroup conflict. In the present study we examined how implicit and explicit ethnic social categorization of others affects empathy to pain in the context of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. To meet this aim, we assessed the evaluation of pain by Jewish and Arab participants who viewed a series of visual stimuli depicting painful and non-painful familiar situations. The stimuli were associated with explicitly or implicitly primed typical names depicting ingroup, neutral outgroup, and adversary outgroup members. Results demonstrate that pain ratings in the explicit priming condition provide support for the ingroup empathy hypothesis, positing that empathy is higher for ingroup than for outgroup members for both Jews and Palestinian Arabs. Conversely, when the targets’ categories are primed implicitly, results revealed difference in empathy by the two ethnic groups where an ingroup bias was detected only for Palestinian Arabs. This suggests that the activation of ingroup bias on the subliminal implicit level among Palestinian Arab participants might be mediated by the amount of conflict permeating in their daily lives and by deeply rooted cultural values and behavioural patterns.

T1  - The ironic impact of intergroup apologies on intergroup attitudes: Understanding the role of perceived power for post‐apology outgroup attitudes
AN  - 2084437556
AB  - The present research investigates how intergroup apologies, defined as apologies between two groups, affect perceived remorse and outgroup attitudes (e.g., explicit and implicit), in the context of power asymmetries. We recruited participants from two countries that differ in perceived power: South Korea and the United States. Participants read a vignette describing a violent act committed by an outgroup member (Korean or American), with or without an intergroup apology. Participants answered questions assessing perceived remorse and explicit attitudes toward the outgroup, followed by the Implicit Association Test (Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998). Results revealed that Koreans perceived less remorse following an intergroup apology from the United States, compared to when they did not read an intergroup apology. Further, a mediated moderation analysis indicated that perceived remorse mediated the relationship between apology and explicit attitudes towards the United States. However, an analogous effect for implicit attitudes was only marginally significant. In contrast, among American participants, no effect of the apology on perceived remorse, explicit attitudes, or implicit attitudes and no evidence for a mediation was found. We discuss the implications of these effects on understanding the effectiveness of intergroup apologies between countries that differ in perceived power.

T1  - Old-Fashioned Racism, Contemporary Islamophobia, and the Isolation of Muslim Americans in the Age of Trump
AN  - 2031051738
AB  - While extant research has documented the existence of negative attitudes toward Muslim Americans, it is unclear whether old-fashioned racism (OFR) is at the root of contemporary Islamophobia, and whether beliefs in the inherent inferiority of Muslims are linked to support for political actors and policies that aim to further isolate them. Bringing to bear a unique dataset of 1,044 white, black, Latino, and Asian participants, we demonstrate that a nontrivial portion of survey respondents make blatantly racist evaluations and rate Muslim Americans as the least "evolved" group. Next, we illustrate that these dehumanizing attitudes are strongly linked to modern objections of Muslim Americans, which we measure with a new Muslim American resentment scale (MAR). Our mediation analysis reveals that the relationship between OFR, support for President Trump, and various policy positions is powerfully mediated by MAR. These results suggest that the relevance of OFR in contemporary politics should not easily be dismissed, and that the literature on racial attitudes, which has predominantly focused on the Black-white dichotomy, should also be extended to appraisals of Muslim Americans.

T1  - “Pretty Pressure” From Peers, Parents, and the Media: A Longitudinal Study of Appearance‐Based Rejection Sensitivity
AN  - 2296041931
AB  - Drawing from the tripartite sociocultural model of body image, the researchers examined whether direct messages and modeling from peers, parents, and media were concurrently and prospectively associated with appearance‐based rejection sensitivity (appearance‐RS) in young adolescents (Mage = 12.0 years). Appearance‐RS was higher among those who concurrently reported more appearance‐related teasing and pressure by peers, more parent teasing, and greater acceptance of media appearance ideals. In prospective analyses, greater increases in appearance‐RS over 1 year were found for adolescents who perceived higher levels of parental appearance‐related teasing and negative attitudes about their own appearance. Moderation analyses indicated the positive prospective association between parental negative appearance attitudes and appearance‐RS was found in younger but not older participants. Gender did not moderate associations.

T1  - Religiosity, Cultural Values, and Attitudes Toward Seeking Psychological Services in Turkey
AN  - 1955238721
AB  - Most research with Muslim populations has been conducted with samples of immigrants living in the West as minority populations. This study investigates how the culture-related variables of family values and self-construal relate to religiosity and attitudes toward psychological services among Muslims living in Turkey, a country where over 99% of the population identifies as Muslim. To examine how these cultural variables may relate to attitudes toward psychological services, Muslim Turks completed a survey which included measures of religiosity, hierarchical and harmonious family values, cultural self-construal, and attitudes toward psychological services. Religiosity was associated with negative attitudes toward psychological services. The relationship between religiosity and attitudes toward psychological services was fully mediated by hierarchical family values such that when the variable hierarchical family values was added to the model, the relation between religiosity and attitudes toward psychological services was no longer significant. The mediation of hierarchical family values on the relation between religiosity and attitudes toward psychological services was moderated by independent self-construal, so that independent self-construal weakened the mediation while interdependent self-construal had no effect. The results of this study indicate that among Muslim Turks, the relation between religiosity and attitudes toward psychological services is more fully explained when culture-related variables are considered.

T1  - Majority members’ endorsement of the acculturation integrationist orientation improves their outgroup attitudes toward ethnic minority members: An electronic-contact experiment
AN  - 1939922414
AB  - An electronic intercultural contact intervention was deployed in the present study to enhance Israeli majority students' level of Integrationist endorsement toward Israeli Ethiopian minority members. The study intervention involved synchronous text-chat across three sessions administered online over three weeks, and required pairs of majority students (n = 44) and Ethiopian students (n = 44) to work collaboratively on planning a social-cultural trip and come up with a 'travel guide' that satisfies the needs of the interacting students' cultural groups (Integration). The study evaluated both short-term (one week) and long-term (six weeks) effects of the intervention on majority members' outgroup attitudes. The study findings revealed that, compared to majority controls (n = 41), participants in the intervention condition reported a greater decrease in intergroup bias and anxiety in the short- and long-terms. A mediation effect of intergroup anxiety was also found; the intervention reduced majority members' intergroup anxiety in the short-term which was related to reduced long-term intergroup bias. These encouraging findings highlight that carefully designed cooperative electronic-contact programs tailored to promote majority individuals' endorsement of the Integrationist orientation, can offer an efficacious route to acculturation researchers interested in promoting this strategy, improving in turn majority members' outgroup attitudes toward minorities.

T1  - Health Insurance, from a Child Language Broker's Perspective
AN  - 1938528227
AB  - In the midst of dramatic changes to American health care law there is need to understand the challenges that vulnerable populations encounter in obtaining and managing health insurance. Research has found that child language brokers, children who mediate language and culture for their immigrant families, assist with health-related matters. We report on focus groups with 17 language brokers living in Central Los Angeles. In this article we detail their experiences language brokering for health insurance and their knowledge of health insurance and policies that apply to their immigrant families. We illuminate some barriers immigrant families face as well as how they navigate them. We conclude with policy implications, particularly in relation to making health insurance more accessible to non-English speaking and immigrant populations.

T1  - 'Turkish, Dutch, gay and proud': Mapping out the contours of agency in homonationalist times
AN  - 1925619712
AB  - In 2012 Amsterdam Gay Pride Canal Parade hosted a Turkish Boat, organized by Dutch citizens of Turkish decent. The newspaper articles consistently emphasized what an advancement this was for the Turkish migrants, considering their 'cultural background.' Simultaneously, public opinion on the former immigrants from Turkey and Morocco as intolerant towards LGBTI people and how they are 'gay bashing on the streets' was still present. The scholarship on homonationalism and gay imperialism has been dealing with questions of Orientalism, islamophobia and racism since the 2000s. The question of agency within this scholarship, however, was not dealt with extensively. This paper will engage with this question by mapping out Dutch homonationalism and focusing on how this specific context produces historically contingent subject positions - such as gay, lesbian, Muslim, Turkish or Moroccan-Dutch - that are hierarchized within the Dutch public sphere. None of them is innocent of power or neutral, the power configurations among these subject positions lay the ground of agency upon which the subject can act.

T1  - Private Military and Security Labour Migration: The Case of Fiji
AN  - 1919933450
AB  - Private military and security companies (PMSCs) are a fast‐growing global industry. While the rise of PMSCs and their activities have attracted much media coverage and growing scholarly attention, little is known about their sourcing of masses of military labour from the global South. This exploratory study examines the case of Fiji, whose thousands of ex/current disciplinary force personnel and unemployed men have been contracted by PMSCs to provide security work in Iraq and other high‐conflict areas. The article shows this to be an instance of unequal core‐periphery military labour trade, outlining its scale, processes and impacts on the migrants. It also illuminates how the migrants’ collective agency is demonstrated even under powerful structural constraints.

T1  - Can digital skills raise occupational prestige among ethnic minorities?
AN  - 1880453424
AB  - Using data from a large-scale Annual Social Survey of Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, we investigate the correlation between digital skills and occupational prestige among veteran Jews and two minority groups, namely Arabs and immigrants to Israel from the Former Soviet Union (FSU). Our findings show that both minority groups have significant disadvantages in occupational prestige compared to veteran Jews. Although causation cannot be inferred because of the correlational design of our study, digital skills were found to contribute to occupational prestige among veteran Jews and FSU immigrants, beyond the classic socio-demographic factors. The occupational prestige gap between veteran Jews and FSU immigrants was eliminated after controlling for socio-demographic variables and before taking digital skills into consideration. The effect of digital skills on occupational prestige among Arabs was insignificant and after controlling for socio-demographic and digital skills, the gap in occupational prestige between veteran Jews and Arabs remained significant.

T1  - A multimodal discourse analytic approach to the articulation of Martini's "desire" positioning in filmic product placement
AN  - 1859439032
AB  - Product placement constitutes an amply used tactic in a marketer's Integrated Marketing Communications roster. Its merits in circumventing negative attitudes to advertising and in integrating brand values in sociocultural narratives in TV and cinematic filmic discourses have been repeatedly stressed. However, little attention has been placed thus far in the idiosyncratic mode that is scrutinized in this paper, that is product placement by leveraging uncertainty, surprise, postponement and displacement as defining characteristics of the discourse of desire. The analysis of the discourse of desire that unravels in a flirting sequence from the blockbuster movie "Hitch" demonstrates that although the concerned brand (Martini) is minimally visible in the analyzed scene, yet it attains to appropriate as part of its core DNA in "stealth" mode the above characteristics of desire by demarcating the cultural field of flirtation. The offered cultural analytic addresses this idiosyncratic product placement mode by drawing on Lacanian psychoanalysis and multimodal discourse analysis.

T1  - Welcoming Initiatives and Immigrant Attachment: The Case of Windsor
AN  - 1865256512
AB  - Welcoming Initiatives have been introduced across Canada together with federally funded local immigration partnerships to attract and foster long-term settlement of immigrants in smaller cities. This paper examines the context in which immigrant newcomers are welcomed to Windsor, Ontario. Through a multi-method approach that included interviews and focus groups with newcomer immigrants, interviews with key sector stakeholders, a local media analysis, and a survey of local organizations, we foreground the local ways in which immigrants are viewed as being part of the city and identify the social, cultural, and economic features that might support immigrant attachment. We argue that newcomers' capacity to engage in and attach to various spheres of urban life is non-linear and varied: newcomers formed shifting and precarious attachments relative to their social, economic, familial, and migratory experiences. We argue that welcoming initiatives can be enhanced by more organic connections that reach beyond the settlement sector. Our conclusion calls for a place-based lens to foreground the wider local context in which welcoming initiatives are instituted to cultivate immigrant ties.

T1  - Branding 'Canadian Experience' in Immigration Policy: Nation Building in a Neoliberal Era
AN  - 1865256387
AB  - This paper examines the branding of 'Canadian experience' in Canadian immigration policy as a rhetorical strategy for neoliberal nation-building. Since 2008, the Canadian government has introduced an unprecedented number of changes to immigration policy. While the bulk of these policies produce more temporary and precarious forms of migration, the Canadian government has mobilized the rhetoric of 'Canadian experience' as a means to identify immigrants who carry the promise of economic and social integration. Through a critical discourse analysis of Canadian print media and political discourse, we trace how the brand of Canadian experience taps into the affective value of national identity in an era of global economic insecurity. We also illustrate how the discourse of Canadian experience (CE) remains ideologically deracialized, such that the government's embrace of CE as an immigrant selection criterion dismisses the discriminatory effects that this discourse is shown to have for racialized immigrants in Canada.

T1  - ATTITUDE OF EDUCATED URBAN YOUTH TOWARDS RAPE MYTHS
AN  - 1916318067
AB  - Pakistan, being a signatory to almost all international conventions on human rights, stands committed to ending violence against women. Additionally, various national progressive legislation and policies for the protection of women' rights have been initiated during the last couple of years, but the statistics of cases of violence against women in Pakistan are bothersome. Women enduring this agony and mortifying experience may have to face all sorts of negative attitudes of people around them. This study investigated gender differences among university students in their perceptions towards rape myths about female rape victims. Students' perceptions were measured using the indigenous Rape Myth Scale by collecting data from 385 students from the three universities of Lahore. Additionally, information about the demographics of students regarding academic disciplines, residential areas and socio-economic backgrounds of families were also collected. Data was analyzed by using the t-test and ANOVA. The results revealed a significant gender difference in the perception of respondents, all of whom were educated about rape myths. Male students were found to believe more strongly that a woman's willingness is present in rape, women's strong character would prevent them from getting raped, and women's behaviour and dress attracted rapists. Furthermore, the results indicated that academic discipline, residential city and parental socioeconomic background of students were found to play an influential part in determining their perceptions towards rape myths. The findings imply a need to incorporate a gender-sensitive education programme as a part of the curriculum across disciplines at the university level, in order to nurture gender sensitization in society. In this regard, parents, teachers and media, along with policymakers, can play a meaningful role in curbing the incidence of rape by transforming the social mindset of blaming the rape sufferer.

T1  - Interethnic bridging social capital and the significance of ethnocentric interethnic interaction within Malaysian universities
AN  - 1963401115
AB  - This article explores the possible theoretical relationships of ethnocentrism (independent variable) and interethnic interaction (mediating variable) with interethnic bridging social capital (IBSC) (dependent variable). Interethnic bridging social capital is extremely noticeable that there is a lack of such investigation in specifically Malaysian public universities. In an attempt to clarify the current situation, a survey questionnaire was conducted with 343 undergraduate students from the three main ethnic groups. The findings reveal that not only ethnocentrism can effect directly and negatively on IBSC, but also its impact can be partially mediated through interethnic interaction as well. Overall, this article contributes to our understanding of how negative attitudes towards outsiders inhibit trust, reciprocity and cooperation in heterogeneous communities.

T1  - Racial Capitalism and the Crisis of Black Masculinity
AN  - 1826399255
AB  - In this article, I theorize "complicit masculinity" to examine how access to capital, in other words, making or spending money, mediates masculine identity for un- and underemployed black men. Arguing that hegemony operates around producer-provider norms of masculinity and through tropes of blackness within a system of racial capitalism, I show how complicity underscores the reality of differential aspirational models in the context of severe un- and underemployment and the failure of the classic breadwinner model for black men globally. I draw on participant observation fieldwork and interviews with men from Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire's informal sector from 2008 to 2009. I investigate two groups of men: political propagandists (orators) for former President Laurent Gbagbo and mobile street vendors. Rejecting racialized colonial narratives that positioned salaried workers as "evolved," orators used anti-French rhetoric and ties to the political regime to pursue entrepreneurial identities. Vendors, positioned as illegitimate workers and non-citizens, asserted consumerist models of masculinity from global black popular culture. I show how entrepreneurialism and consumerism, the two paradigmatic neoliberal identities, have become ways for black men to assert economic participation as alternatives to the producer-provider ideal.

T1  - Don't judge a living book by its cover: effectiveness of the living library intervention in reducing prejudice toward Roma and LGBT people
AN  - 1817003843
AB  - In Hungary, prejudices toward Roma and the LGBT community are highly salient and explicit in public opinion, the media, and in the political discourse. The present study examined the effectiveness of the Living Library prejudice reduction intervention--in which participants as "Readers" have engaging contact with living "Books" who are trained volunteers from the Roma and LGBT communities. In a pre-post intervention study with high school students (N=105), results suggest that the Living Library intervention reduced participants' scores on multiple measures of prejudice. The Living Library intervention appeared to be effective among both those participants whose friends endorsed prejudice or more tolerant attitudes toward Roma and LGBT people. In sum, Living Library appears to be a useful method for reducing prejudice in contexts which are characterized by strong negative attitudes toward these different groups.

T1  - Partisanship, Dysfunction, and Racial Fears: The New Normal in Health Care Policy?
AN  - 1818672624
AB  - Partisan politics snarled both the passage and the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This essay examines partisanship's effects on health policy and asks whether the ACA experience was an exception or the new political normal. Partisanship itself has been essential for American democracy, but American institutions were not designed to handle its current form -- ideologically pure, racially sorted, closely matched parties playing by "Gingrich rules" before a partisan media. The new partisanship injects three far-reaching changes into national health policy: an unprecedented lack of closure, a decline in the traditional political arts of compromise and bargaining, and a failure to define and debate alternative health policies. We can get a better sense of how far partisanship reaches by turning to state health policies. The highly charged national debate has migrated into some of the states; others retain the traditional politics of compromise and problem solving. There are preliminary indications that the difference lies in the dynamics of race and ethnicity. [web URL: http://jhppl.dukejournals.org/content/41/4/827.abstract]

T1  - Missing the Boat: Australia and Asylum Seeker Deterrence Messaging
AN  - 1802692379
AB  - Many of Australia's border protection policies have focused on attempts to deter the arrival of asylum seekers by boat. These include government 'messaging' in the hope this will influence the decision-making of would-be boat arrivals. This article outlines the findings of an exploratory study on the sources of information accessed by asylum seekers, prior to and during their boat journeys to Australia, about their destination country. The findings suggest that government media and Internet strategies focused on deterring asylum seekers are adopted without full regard to how information is sourced before and during these boat journeys.

T1  - The Enterprising Self and Prejudices toward Unemployed Persons: Analyses of Intergroup-mechanisms that Substantiate Neoliberal Inequalities
AN  - 2167841583
AB  - This research tries to build bridges between sociological and social psychological theoretical ideas for the study of social inequality in neoliberal societies. It adds to research on social inequality by examining amplifiers of prejudices toward unemployed persons. A conceptual model has been developed which draws upon social dominance theory and governmentality studies. The empirical analyses guided by this model assess the mediating effects of the enterprising self - a newly developed attitude measure based on sociological analyses of contemporary self-help literature - and the Protestant Work Ethic in the relationship between social dominance orientation and prejudices toward unemployed persons, both depending on social status. Conditional process models reveal the phenomenon of ideological asymmetry relevant for the enterprising self, indicating that this neoliberal guiding principle serves as a dominant driving force in reproducing social inequality through mechanisms at the intergroup-level.Alternate abstract:Dieser Artikel baut für die Untersuchung neoliberaler sozialer Ungleichheiten über die Soziale Dominanztheorie und eine Analyse von Verstärkern von Vorurteilen gegenüber arbeitslosen Personen Brücken zwischen soziologischen und sozialpsychologischen Theorietraditionen. Ein konzeptionelles Modell wurde entwickelt, worin mediierende Effekte von Einstellungen entlang des Leitbildes des unternehmerischen Selbst – eine neu entwickelte quantitative Einstellungsmessung die auf gouvernementalitätstheoretisch soziologischen Analysen gegenwärtiger Selbsthilfeliteratur basiert – unter Kontrolle der Protestantischen Arbeitsethik und des subjektiven Statusempfindens empirisch getestet wurden. Die Methode des Conditional Process Modeling ergab eine moderierte Wirkung des unternehmerischen Selbst auf die Abwertung von arbeitslosen Personen, die mit zunehmenden Status stark zunimmt, leicht in der Mittelschicht auftritt und in der (subjektiven) Underclass nicht vorliegt. Dieses Resultat wird in Anknüpfung an die gouvernementalitätstheoretische Literatur diskutiert.

AB  - In this paper, we analyzed the relationships among political identity, the perception of moral distance between the political ingroup and the political outgroup, and outgroup animalistic dehumanization. One correlational and one experimental study revealed a positive correlation of ingroup identification (Study 1, N = 99) and salience of ingroup membership (Study 2, N = 96) with the degree to which participants dehumanized the outgroup. This relationship was mediated by the perceived moral distance between the ingroup and the outgroup. The limitations, implications, and possible developments derived from the present findings are discussed. [web URL: http://gpi.sagepub.com/content/19/3/360.abstract]

T1  - Migration, Relative Deprivation, and Psychological Well-Being in China: PROD
AN  - 1784933251
AB  - This article investigates how rural-to-urban migration influences migrants' perception of relative deprivation, and how relative deprivation mediates the effects of migration on psychological well-being in China. During the past three decades, China has experienced large-scale rural-to-urban migration. Because of the institutional barriers to their permanent settlement in cities, Chinese migrants are often "sojourners" in cities and maintain close bonds with their sending communities; return migration is common. It is therefore unclear to what extent current and return migrants use an urban or rural frame of reference when they assess their social positions and how that assessment influences their psychological well-being. The data come from the 2012 China Labor Dynamics Survey, a nationally representative survey. The findings suggest that after moving to cities, migrants may have adopted an urban frame of reference and suffered institutional exclusion and personal discrimination. This study theorizes and provides evidence for a previously overlooked psychosocial pathway between migration and psychological well-being.

T1  - Immigrant Criminalization in Law and the Media: Effects on Latino Immigrant Workers' Identities in Arizona: PROD
AN  - 1784933161
AB  - This article examines the effects of two forces in the context of reception: the legal regime and enforcement practices and media portrayals of immigrants as they combine to shape the lives of immigrants, particularly Latinos, directly and indirectly. It focuses on the case of Latino immigrants living in Phoenix, Arizona. Although the context of reception is conceptualized as including laws and policies, the media contributes significantly, as media portrayals reinforce or fuel the effects of laws and policies. When laws are exclusionary and enforcement is expanded, negative media portrayals contribute to create a particularly hostile context at the level of formal institutions and at the level of public discourse. Immigrants respond in multiple ways, including shaping their identities to highlight their image as hard workers and to distance themselves from images of immigrants as criminals. These two forces shape immigrants' views about themselves and of their position in U.S. society. [web URL: http://abs.sagepub.com/content/60/5-6/597.abstract]

T1  - SWORN TO PROTECT: POLICE BRUTALITY - A DILEMMA FOR AMERICA'S POLICE
AN  - 1899014782
AB  - Police abuse is the purposeful practice of unwarranted coercion, frequently physical, but potentially in the form of verbal assaults and psychological intimidation, by police which, constitutes abuse and official misconduct. Police brutality is a grievous form of crime done by the police hired to be prevent the crime itself. The use of force may be judged necessary or excessive depending on whether it was determined to be legitimate under the circumstances to fulfill the police duty (Kania & Mackey, 1977). The media has focused like a laser on the racial divides in the U. S. sparked by the deaths of young African Americans (i.e., Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Eric Garner, NYC, Oscar Grant in California and Sandra Bland in Texas and many others at the hands of cops with dubious use of force. (Edwards, 2016; Khaleeli, 2016). These deaths lead ultimately to an activists group, 'Black Lives Matters'. According to FBI statistics, African-Americans represented 31 percent of all shooting victims by police while representing 13 percent of all U. S, inhabitants according to Grochowski & Gabrielson (2014, October 10). Approximately 50 percent of the 14,800 police agencies do not report police involved homicide statistics to the FBI - UCR. This is quite distributing considering that 175 Black males were shot and killed by police since January, 2015. Black's males represent six percent of the population and 40 percent of victims of police shooting incidents.

T1  - LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, BUT WHAT IF I'M BLACK?
AN  - 1867156485
AB  - Assembled on the foundation that all men being created equal, the United States Constitution was established to maintain a democratic government and prevent a dictatorial nation. However, the protection of natural born rights is not enforced and therefore racial injustices prevent human equality. The social injustices of African American men are common headlines for media coverages daily. It is believed that the Civil Rights Movement ended racism, however the legacy of segregation and racism continue to negatively influence the advancement of black men. The lives of Trayvon Martin, Mike Brown and Chavis Carter serve as a reminder of our justice system and its continued failure for the African American culture. Black men continue to struggle with the burden of high levels of unemployment and being the majority incarcerated; which is believed to stem from the disciplinary criminal justice policies. This research seeks to explore progressive ways to move toward racial equality.

T1  - Crisis Management: An Assessment of College and University Executive Communications Prior to the Darren Wilson Grand Jury Decision
AN  - 1812414290
AB  - In the fall of 2014, administrators at colleges and universities in the greater St. Louis, Missouri area prepared for the grand jury announcement regarding the potential indictment of police officer Darren Wilson. Weeks prior, Wilson had shot and killed Michael Brown, in the city of Ferguson, Missouri. In the wake of the shooting and subsequent grand jury proceedings the St. Louis area saw an onslaught of public debate, outraged citizens, and increased tensions between those who supported Wilson, and those who believed he should be indicted. During this time of unrest, area colleges and universities responded in a number of ways. Some were transparent in their communications, sending emails to their respective communities; others chose to abstain from sending out any formal communication about the matter. In light of the varying responses from area institutions, the purpose of this study is to analyze the major themes present in the communications sent by various administrators, and to examine how the various university officials handled the communication efforts in the weeks leading up to the grand jury decision. This analysis was done by implementing qualitative data analysis software throughout.

T1  - 'And the best essay is...': Extended contact and cross-group friendships at school
AN  - 1773421209
AB  - We conducted one experimental intervention based on extended contact principles aimed at fostering the formation of cross-group friendships within educational settings. Italian school children took part in a school competition for the best essay on personal experiences of cross-group friendships with immigrants, to be written in small groups. This manipulation was intended to favour the exchange of personal positive cross-group experiences, thus capitalizing on the benefits of extended contact. In the control condition, participants wrote an essay on friendship, without reference to cross-group relations. Results revealed that children who took part in the intervention reported a higher number of outgroup friends 3 months later. This indirect effect was sequentially mediated by pro-contact ingroup and outgroup norms and by outgroup contact behavioural intentions. This study provides experimental evidence that interventions based on extended contact can foster cross-group friendship formation. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.

T1  - Beyond Guilt and Stigma: Changing Attitudes among Israeli Migrants in Canada
AN  - 1755986822
AB  - Over 60 years ago, the Jewish nationalist movement known as Zionism culminated in the creation of the State of Israel. Millions of Jews immigrated to Israel over the twentieth century, a process known as aliya (literally, "going up"). Yet over the years, thousands of Israelis have also chosen to leave Israel in a movement termed yerida ("going down"). As the term suggests, this reverse migration has been highly stigmatized. During the 1960s and 1970s, emigrants were publicly disparaged in the Israeli media for having abandoned a struggling state. Consequently, Israeli migrants suffered strong feelings of guilt that often, hampered their integration process abroad, a phenomenon observed as late as the 1990s. This paper, however, reveals that feelings of stigmatization have greatly decreased among Israeli migrants in recent years. The study is based on research that I conducted in 2008-2009, involving nine months of participant observation in Vancouver's Israeli community and 34 in-depth interviews. Unlike in previous studies, most of my informants expressed no feelings of guilt over having left Israel. Of those who did, most framed their guilt as a longing for family and friends rather than the patriotic longing for the land as expressed by previous generations. Previous studies have also found that Israelis harbour a "myth of return"- a continuously expressed desire to return to Israel and a reluctance to accept their stay abroad as permanent. However, I have not found that the myth of return is still strong today, despite the continued prevalence of a strong sense of Israeli identity among Israelis abroad. I suggest that these changing attitudes are the product of shifting ideals in Israeli society that have developed as the state of Israel has matured. This paper thus serves to update the outdated image of Israeli migrants as it exists in the prevailing literature.

T1  - Sexualized Avatars Lead to Women's Self-Objectification and Acceptance of Rape Myths
AN  - 1752994178; 201601733
AB  - Research has indicated that many video games and virtual worlds are populated by unrealistic, hypersexualized representations of women, but the effects of using these representations remain understudied. Objectification theory suggests that women's exposure to sexualized media representations leads to self-objectification. Further, we anticipated this process would lead to increases in rape myth acceptance (RMA). Two experiments (Study 1, N = 87; Study 2, N = 81) examined the effects of avatar features on women's experiences of self-objectification. In both studies, college women exposed to sexualized avatars experienced higher levels of self-objectification after the virtual experience than those exposed to nonsexualized avatars. Furthermore, in Study 2, self-objectification mediated the relationship between controlling a sexualized avatar and subsequent levels of RMA. We discuss the implications of women using sexualized avatars in video games and virtual environments, which may lead to negative attitudes about the self and other women off-line due to heightened self-objectification.

T1  - Will I Ever Think I'm Thin Enough? A Moderated Mediation Study of Women's Contingent Self-Esteem, Body Image Discrepancies, and Disordered Eating
AN  - 1700673229; 201528212
AB  - Low levels of global self-esteem have been shown to be associated with disordered eating such that individuals who possess more negative attitudes about themselves tend to report more disordered eating symptoms. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether appearance-based contingent self-esteem (i.e., the degree to which individuals base their self-esteem on their physical appearance) and actual-ideal body image discrepancies influence this association. This goal was accomplished with a sample of 877 college women who completed measures of global self-esteem, body image, appearance-based contingent self-esteem, and eating behaviors. A moderated mediation analysis showed that actual-ideal body image discrepancies mediated the association between global self-esteem and disordered eating and that this simple mediation was further moderated by appearance-based contingent self-esteem. Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for the ways in which actual-ideal body image discrepancies and appearance-based contingent self-esteem influence the association between global self-esteem and disordered eating. Future research aimed at improving intervention and prevention of eating disorders should address the extent to which individuals base their self-worth on their appearance and consider whether reducing appearance-based contingencies of self-worth may protect individuals from developing patterns of disordered eating.

T1  - Perspective-taking mediates the imagined contact effect
AN  - 1735657006; 201536983
AB  - We investigated the potential for mental imagery to reduce intergroup bias in Cyprus, an island that has suffered from interethnic tension for over 40 years. Seventy-three Turkish Cypriots were asked to imagine a scenario in which they interacted with Greek Cypriots, compared to those imagining an outdoor scene. Subsequently, participants in the imagined contact condition reported more positive outgroup evaluations. Mediational analysis showed this relationship was explained by increased levels of perspective-taking. The findings highlight theoretical and practical possibilities for future imagined contact research. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - THE BRIEF IMPLICIT ASSOCIATION TEST IS VALID: EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE
AN  - 1692289882; 201521459
AB  - As a new variant of Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998), the Brief Implicit Association Test (BIAT; Sriram & Greenwald, 2009) has been shown to be useful in predicting various behaviors. This research aims to examine experimental validity of the BIAT. Two experiments were conducted. Experiment 1 demonstrated that the BIAT was sensitive to implicit favoritism toward and identification with a newly established ingroup by memorization procedure, a minimal group induction procedure (Pinter & Greenwald, 2011). Experiment 2 showed that the BIAT was responsive to the threat effect on intergroup attitudes and further predictive of resultant intention to boycott outgroup. Moreover, mediation analysis showed that the change in implicit favoritism revealed by BIAT partially explained changes in the intention to boycott. These findings suggest that BIAT is not only sensitive to newly formed associations but also to the change of an existing association. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Homohysteria: Useful Construct? Or an Unnecessary Splitting of Hairs?
AN  - 1680154409; 201517810
AB  - In this commentary to McCormack and Anderson (2014, this issue), I offer my reaction to a relatively new construct-homohysteria-that characterizes heterosexual men's negative attitudes and affective reactions toward gay men in the context of gendered (traditional) behaviors. I propose that similar to other forms of 'isms' used in both academia and the general community (e.g., racism, sexism), little is to be gained by continuing to splinter established terms such as heterosexism or homophobia. More specifically, I argue that by creating new terms for prejudice against gays and lesbians-terms that simply reflect either different degrees or motives of heterosexism-we risk muddling research findings and ultimately trivializing the pernicious phenomenon of prejudice and discrimination against the LGBT community. I also argue that in the absence of empirical support for the validity of homohysteria (as a distinct construct from heterosexism or homophobia), those embracing this new term are investigatively putting the cart before the horse.

T1  - Cultural Variation in the Minimal Group Effect
AN  - 1494750917; 201402244
AB  - The minimal group effect (MGE) is one of the most robust psychological findings in studies of intergroup conflict, yet there is little evidence comparing its magnitude across cultures. Recent evidence suggests that the MGE is due in part to a projection of one's own perceived characteristics onto the novel in-group. Because of cultural variability in self-enhancement motivations, we thus expected that those from East Asian cultures would exhibit a diminished MGE relative to Westerners. A large and diverse sample of Japanese and American participants completed a traditional minimal group study. American participants were more likely to show an in-group bias in group identification, perceived group intelligence, perceived group personality traits, and resource allocation. Furthermore, these cultural differences were partially mediated by self-esteem. We discuss the implication of these findings for theories of intergroup conflict and suggest multiple directions for future cross-cultural research on the MGE.

T1  - Benefits and barriers to sports participation for athletes with disabilities: the case of Malaysia
AN  - 2059577236
AB  - The purpose of this paper was to explore the benefits and barriers influencing participation for athletes with disabilities from a developing country (Malaysia). Two independent studies were undertaken: Study 1 included a sample of 123 athletes (95 males, 28 females) who participated in the 2006 Far East and South Pacific Games for the Disabled (FESPIC Games); Study 2 involved focus group discussions with 14 elite athletes. The athletes ranged in age from 15 to 59 years. Data were collected through a questionnaire (Study 1) and focus group discussions (Study 2). The primary reasons for participation in sport were achievement/challenge (58%) and competency/skill development (41%). The main barriers faced by the athletes were structural (facilities, equipment, funding) and the negative attitude from the government, public and media. However, despite these difficulties the majority of athletes were keen to continue to compete. Further work is required to ensure athletes with disabilities are provided with similar opportunities to athletes without disabilities.

T1  - Mortality salience and uncertainty: Similar effects but different processes
AN  - 1429629368; 201335604
AB  - Three experimental studies investigated whether death-thoughts avoidance as a consequence of mortality salience and need for certainty as a consequence of uncertainty are two different motivational states. The results suggest that although death-thought avoidance and need for certainty are different constructs, they share a great deal of variance (anxiety plays a pivotal mediational role in both). However, whereas the impact of uncertainty on negative attitudes towards an out-group with different worldviews (Arabs) was mediated only by anxiety (measured retrospectively), the effect of mortality salience was mediated by both retrospective anxiety and death-thought accessibility. These findings imply that similar effects that have been obtained by these two manipulations are, at least partly, the result of different processes. . [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - SANDRA WILLSON: A CASE STUDY IN LESBIAN IDENTITIES IN 1950S AND 1970S AUSTRALIA
AN  - 1700673908; 201524793
AB  - In 1959, a young Sydney lesbian, Sandra Willson, shot and killed a taxi driver as a form of protest against social attitudes toward lesbianism. She spent 18 years in prisons and psychiatric hospitals before her release in 1977. Taking Sandra Willson as a case study, this article will explore the ways in which social disapproval of lesbianism was expressed in 1950s Sydney and the impact this had on women's lives, relationships and identities. By the time of Willson's release in the late 1970s, Sydney represented a very different place in which to articulate a lesbian identity; a place in which same-sex desire was beginning to be acknowledged in the press and in cultural media, and where feminist and gay activists were challenging long-standing negative attitudes toward homosexuality. Sandra Willson's experience offers an opportunity to trace shifting notions of lesbianism between the 1950s and the 1970s in Sydney and to consider how these broader patterns of cultural change might have impacted on individual women.

T1  - The representation of migrants in the Italian press: A study on the Corriere della Sera (1992-2009)
AN  - 1492599423; 201400209
AB  - The research analyses media discourse on migration in Italy, regarded as a means of reproducing and maintaining a racist interpretation of inter-group relations. The theoretical framework is the Critical Discourse Analysis approach. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed on data consisting of headlines and articles from the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, published between 1992 and 2009. Overall, it emerged that discourse is built according to themes and discursive strategies already identified by similar research based on European media, indicating how this system of representations defines a common sense of cultural belonging and a shared construction of ethnic relations. The rather long time span considered in the study allowed us to focus on how the discourse on migration in Italy might have evolved over time, but also to identify any elements that may have remained unchanged.

T1  - Why are religious people happy? The effect of the social norm of religiosity across countries
AN  - 1429629644; 201337709
AB  - Drawing on social norms theories, we suggest that religiosity substantially increases subjective well-being if it is considered normative in a certain national context. In Study 1, we test this hypothesis using an indicator of a country's social norm of religiosity that includes both the national level of religiosity and the social desirability of religion. The results of a multilevel regression analysis suggest that religious individuals are on average happier and more satisfied with life than non-religious individuals. This effect is stronger in religious countries with dominant negative attitudes towards non-believers. In Study 2, we further examine whether the differences in social recognition of religious and non-religious individuals in countries where religiosity is normative account for this finding. The results of a moderated mediation analysis indicate that in religious countries, religious people report being treated with more respect, which partially explains their higher levels of happiness and life satisfaction.

T1  - Vindictive but vulnerable: Paradoxical representations of women as demonstrated in internet discourse surrounding an anti-rape technology
AN  - 1347782388; 201322549
AB  - Much media interest surrounded a campaign to raise funds to distribute 30,000 Rape-aXe condoms to women during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The barbed device is worn inside the vagina and attaches to a penis upon penetration. This paper presents an analysis of popular attitudes towards women and rape as identified from comments made upon online news websites and popular blogs in response to this technology. Two over-arching representations emerged; first, that the Rape-aXe would be employed as a weapon for vengeance and deceit, and second, that it was a means of helping women negotiate risk. We argue that such paradoxical representations of women as simultaneously vindictive and vulnerable make problematic the utility of such an anti-rape device. We suggest that the cultural entrenchment of stereotypical and negative attitudes towards women needs to be recognized and counter-acted upon before rape intervention measures, like the Rape-aXe, can have any positive effect.

T1  - "Coming Clean" on Duty of Care: Australian Print Media's Representation of Male Versus Female Sex Offenders in Institutional Contexts
AN  - 1081613903
AB  - Public opinion about sexual abuse of minors is greatly shaped by mass media and the way individual cases are reported. This paper examines Australian print media's representation of sex offenders, focussing particularly on the sex of the offenders and aiming to shed light on some of the misconceptions and deep-rooted prejudices within the population at large. Given the multi-faceted nature of sexual offences, this paper focuses on sexual offences committed by both males and females against minors in the context of a companion breach of duty of care. In order to explore the effect that linguistic tools can have in the Australian print media's way of reporting sexual abuse cases, twenty-nine newspaper articles published in Australian dailies were selected for analysis. The analysis of these articles reveals a marked bias in the manner in which sexual offences perpetrated by males, as opposed to females, are reported, suggesting a male monopoly on sexual abuse. We argue that this biased representation, which hinders adequate profiling of sexual offences against minors, may stem from an androcentric view of sexuality and from the systematic denial of female agency when it comes to sex.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Positive Female Role-Models Eliminate Negative Effects of Sexually Violent Media
AN  - 1650148285; 201503755
AB  - Much debate has focused on the potential negative role of sexualized violent media on viewer attitudes toward women. One potential issue in previous literature is that depictions of sexuality and violence were confounded with subordinate depictions of female characters. The current study addressed this by randomly assigning young adults to watch either neutral media or sexually violent media with either subordinate or strong female characters. Women who watched sexually violent media were more anxious, and males who watched sexually violent media had more negative attitudes toward women, but only when female characters were subordinate. Sexual and violent content had no influence on viewer attitudes when strong female characters were present, suggesting these are not the crucial influence variables. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Mothers Affected by Domestic Violence: Intersections and Opportunities with the Justice System
AN  - 1504422371; 201407823
AB  - Secondary analysis from two qualitative studies was used to explore the interactions of mothers exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) with the justice system. Results were categorized according to three key themes: (a) negative interactions within the justice system, (b) positive interactions within the justice system, and (c) recommendations for an improved justice system response to domestic violence. Overall, findings suggested that mothers affected by domestic violence are confronted with negative attitudes and ineffectual practices within convoluted bureaucratic criminal justice systems, leaving many feeling revictimized. Despite the negative aspects of the legal system, women in both studies cited positive examples of feeling comforted, validated, and even empowered by the actions of the specific service providers. The findings of both studies underscore the need for greater efficiencies within the justice system and mandatory training for service providers, making it easier for women who have left their abusers to access appropriate support services, as well as the importance of affirmational support particularly when it can be provided by a peer with shared experiences. Future research is needed to guide the development of interventions that will limit the impacts of IPV exposure on child developmental outcomes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Student and teacher perceptions of school involvement and their effect on multicultural education: a Catalonian survey
AN  - 1322718480; 201312385
AB  - In multilingual schools students have diverse identities, cultural backgrounds, perceptions, capacities and linguistic experiences. The space for teaching and learning is also mediated by stereotypes and prejudices associated with this diversity. Diversity, stereotypes and prejudices shape how teachers and learners operate in a world of complex social relationships. In this survey we explore the hidden attitudes of immigrant students and teachers in secondary education in Catalonia (Spain). The research uses the distinction between explicit and implicit attitudes to analyse immigrant students' perceptions and teachers' subconscious perceptions about school involvement. The sample includes 4078 immigrant students with more than six months of residence in the host country that were attending linguistic support classes in secondary schools of Catalonia during the year 2006-2007, and also their regular classroom teachers and support teachers. The survey aims to establish if is there any statistically significant associations between the attitudes of newcomer students and teachers, and the linguistic and geographical origins of the students. We wanted to know if teacher and student perceptions agreed or differed and to characterise stereotypes and prejudices affecting positive or negative attitudes about the organisation of teaching while learning. The results show how the teachers' perceptions about newcomer students' involvement differ in many cases from the views of the students, and how lower expectations and subjective manifestations of racism are evident with some groups, especially with students of African origin.

T1  - Symbolic Boundaries and Ideology in the Norwegian Multicultural Society: A Longitudinal Study of Public Discourse
AN  - 1023026791; 201223736
AB  - Group boundaries between immigrant minority and majority members are currently undergoing considerable and complex changes in European multicultural societies due to migration. In this paper, we present a descriptive, longitudinal investigation of the usage of linguistic expressions in Norwegian media discourse that describe symbolic boundary developments between immigrant minority and majority members, and their multicultural context. Seventy-two expressions are analyzed, and three temporal usage patterns are described (increasing, decreasing, and 'mountain') as central to understanding current symbolic boundaries and how they may both frame and be shaped by ideologies. Expressions describing immigrant minorities have increasingly focused on their establishment in the Norwegian multicultural society and have also shifted from general boundaries of outsiderness to increasingly specified boundaries of origins, visibility, and immigrant otherness. Norwegian majority expressions have mostly shifted toward a focus on origins. Our analysis suggests that symbolic boundaries in the Norwegian multicultural society have been changing rapidly. They seem to be shaped by complex ideological patterns constructing both similarities and differences, and which simultaneously seem to promote both inclusion and exclusion for certain immigrant minorities.

T1  - A Nationwide Study of Norwegian Beliefs About Same-sex Marriage and Lesbian and Gay Parenthood
AN  - 1221408406; 201245919
AB  - In Norway, a gender-neutral Marriage Law that secured equal marriage and parenting rights for lesbian, gay and heterosexual couples took effect in January 2009. The aim of the current study was to explore Norwegian beliefs about equal marriage and parenting rights for lesbian, gay and heterosexual couples and the welfare of children with lesbian and gay parents. A sample of 1,246 Norwegians participated in the study by filling out a questionnaire. The majority reported that they were supportive of equal marriage rights for lesbian, gay and heterosexual couples, whilst there was less support for granting gay and lesbian couples equal right to become parents. The negative attitudes towards equal parenting rights for lesbian, gay and heterosexual couples were explained mainly by concerns about the welfare of children growing up with gay and lesbian parents.

T1  - A multilevel test of Allport's contact conditions: GPIR
AN  - 1907331215
AB  - This study tests the relative predictive power of Allport's contact conditions in reducing intergroup bias with a multilevel model. In addition, it is argued that a fourth contact condition, cooperation, mediates the relationships between the first three contact conditions (authority support, equal status, goal interdependence) and intergroup bias, rather than being an independent predictor. A multilevel model with N = 266 individuals within k = 48 work groups in a larger mail order company shows that equal status and goal interdependence negatively predict intergroup bias, with goal interdependence as the stronger predictor. These effects are partially mediated by cooperation. However, while authority support is predictive of intergroup cooperation, no relationship with intergroup bias emerged. Theoretical and practical implications of the relative predictive power of contact conditions and the mediation by cooperation are discussed.

T1  - Racial Group Membership Is Associated to Gaze-Mediated Orienting in Italy
AN  - 1309096430
AB  - Viewing a face with averted gaze results in a spatial shift of attention in the corresponding direction, a phenomenon defined as gaze-mediated orienting. In the present paper, we investigated whether this effect is influenced by social factors. Across three experiments, White and Black participants were presented with faces of White and Black individuals. A modified spatial cueing paradigm was used in which a peripheral target stimulus requiring a discrimination response was preceded by a noninformative gaze cue. Results showed that Black participants shifted attention to the averted gaze of both ingroup and outgroup faces, whereas White participants selectively shifted attention only in response to individuals of their same group. Interestingly, the modulatory effect of social factors was context-dependent and emerged only when group membership was situationally salient to participants. It was hypothesized that differences in the relative social status of the two groups might account for the observed asymmetry between White and Black participants. A final experiment ruled out an alternative explanation based on differences in perceptual familiarity with the face stimuli. Overall, these findings strengthen the idea that gaze-mediated orienting is a socially-connoted phenomenon.

T1  - Categorization and Communication in the Face of Prejudice: When Describing Perceptions Changes What Is Perceived
AN  - 925714254; 201204087
AB  - In the face of prejudice against an ingroup, common ground for communication exists when people use similar social categories to understand the situation. Three studies tested the hypothesis that describing perceptions of prejudice can fundamentally change those perceptions because communicators account for the common ground in line with conversational norms. When women (Study 1), African Americans (Study 2), and Americans (Study 3) simply thought about suspected prejudice against their ingroup, categorization guided their perceptions: Participants assimilated their views of the prejudiced event toward the perceptions of ingroup members but contrasted away from the perceptions of outgroup members. Conversely, when participants described their perceptions, they contrasted away from the given category information and actually arrived at the opposite perceptions as those who merely thought about the prejudiced event. Study 3 identified an important qualification of these effects by showing that they were obtained only when participants could assume their audience was familiar with the common ground. Implications are discussed for understanding the role of communication in facilitating and inhibiting collective action about prejudice. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Inclusive Altruism Born of Suffering: The Relationship Between Adversity and Prosocial Attitudes and Behavior Toward Disadvantaged Outgroups
AN  - 1081869214; 201235393
AB  - This article reports the results of 2 studies examining altruism born of suffering (E. Staub & J. R. Vollhardt, 2008). More specifically, we examined inclusive altruism born of suffering, which is directed toward members of disadvantaged outgroups. Drawing on and integrating clinical and social psychological theories, we hypothesized that individuals who had suffered from adverse life events would be more likely to help the outgroups in need than those who had not suffered. This was demonstrated for helpers who had experienced various forms of suffering (interpersonal and group-based harm, natural disasters) and for 2 distinct types of prosocial behavior and attitudes (long-term volunteering and disaster aid) benefiting outgroups within society and from other countries. We also found that prosocial attitudes toward tsunami victims were highest among those who had suffered in a similar way (from natural disasters). Additionally, we examined the underlying social psychological processes and found that empathy and reduced ingroup bias (but not personal distress) mediated the effect (Study 2). Implications for social justice and an empowering view of victims as potential helpers in society are discussed. [Copyright American Psychological Association]

T1  - Rating the You Tube Indian: Viewer Ratings of Native American Portrayals on a Viral Video Site
AN  - 907927783; 201125080
AB  - The results of this study suggest that audiences responded favorably to the videos showing positive, counterstereotypical characteristics of Native Americans. It is conceivable that such videos could serve as significant points of vicarious intergroup contact and be instrumental in improving societal perceptions of Native Americans. Through content resulting in favorable assessments of vicarious contact, UGVs may be helpful in strategically reducing stereotyping and marginalization of Native Americans in the United States. If the audience appreciates such depictions, they may also be used to increase the overall appeal of media products. Subsequent research would contribute greatly to the understanding of this prosocial role of UGVs by exploring such effects. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Opening Closed Minds: The Combined Effects of Intergroup Contact and Need for Closure on Prejudice
AN  - 881466441; 201116367
AB  - Five studies tested whether need for closure (NFC) moderates the relation between intergroup contact and prejudice toward immigrants. The results consistently showed that intergroup contact was more strongly associated with reduced levels of prejudice among people high in NFC compared to people low in NFC. Studies 1 (N = 138 students) and 2 (N = 294 adults) demonstrated this moderator effect on subtle, modern, and blatant racism. Study 2 also replicated the moderator effect for extended contact. An experimental field study (Study 3; N = 60 students) provided evidence of the causal direction of the moderator effect. Finally, Studies 4 (N = 125 students) and 5 (N = 135 adults) identified intergroup anxiety as the mediator through which the moderator effect influences modern and blatant racism as well as hostile tendencies toward immigrants. The role of motivated cognition in the relation between intergroup contact and prejudice is discussed.

T1  - Decisions for Others Are More Creative Than Decisions for the Self
AN  - 1928274987
AB  - Four studies investigate whether decisions for others produce more creative solutions than do decisions for the self and if construal level explains this relation. In Study 1, participants carried out a structured imagination task by drawing an alien for a story that they would write, or alternatively for a story that someone else would write. As expected, drawing an alien for someone else produced a more creative alien. In Studies 2a and 2b, construal level (i.e., psychological distance) was independently manipulated. Participants generated more creative ideas on behalf of distant others than on behalf of either close others or themselves. Finally, in Study 3, a classic insight problem was investigated. Participants deciding for others were more likely to solve the problem; furthermore, this result was mediated by psychological distance. These findings demonstrate that people are more creative for others than for themselves and shed light on differences in self--other decision making.

T1  - Too Close for Comfort: Exploring Gender Differences in Inmate Attitudes Toward Homosexuality in Prison
AN  - 852897769; 201105249
AB  - Since the inception of the Prison Rape Elimination Act in 2003, there has been increased interest in not only sexual victimization among incarcerated populations, but all aspects of prison sexuality. Correctional policies have focused on the homosexual population in attempts to protect these individuals from victimization and in attempts to decrease sexual relationships between inmates. While recent research has focused on the prevalence of homosexual behavior and the prevalence of sexual victimization among incarcerated populations, there has been little research on inmate attitudes toward homosexuality and same-sex sexual encounters in prison. The present study adds to the literature base by examining gender differences in attitudes toward inmate homosexuality among a sample of male and female inmates in a large Southern prison system. Findings revealed that male inmates, older inmates, and heterosexual inmates had significantly more negative attitudes toward homosexual inmates. Implications based on these findings are discussed.

T1  - Prejudice against Muslims: anxiety as a mediator between intergroup contact and attitudes, perceived group variability and behavioural intentions
AN  - 856403312; 201106889
AB  - Numerous studies have reported an increase in prejudice against Muslims in recent years. Less research has investigated how this increase might be stemmed and relations between non-Muslims and Muslims improved. In this article, we address prejudice against Muslims from the perspective of intergroup contact theory. We conducted two cross-sectional studies to examine the relationship between non-Muslim students' experiences of contact with Muslims and their intergroup anxiety, outgroup attitudes, perceptions of outgroup variability and intergroup behavioural intentions. Study 1 (N=58) showed that frequent high-quality contact with Muslims predicted more positive outgroup attitudes, more perceived outgroup variability and more positive behavioural intentions. These associations were mediated by intergroup anxiety. Study 2 (N=60) replicated these effects and additionally showed that anxiety mediates the influence of extended contact on the same outcome measures. Discussion focuses on the implications of the results for strategies aimed at improving relations between non-Muslims and Muslims. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Child Abuse in a Disciplinary Context: A Typology of Violent Family Environments
AN  - 1037880849; 201234112
AB  - The objectives of this study were to identify and validate types of violent family environments based on child abuse in a disciplinary context. The study is original in that it simultaneously takes into account the cognitive and behavioral dimensions of the parental role as it relates to the degree of family violence in a child's life. Cluster analyses were performed on a representative sample of 3,148 families. The Abusive profile applied to families who reported at least one severe assault on a child within the past year. This profile also had the highest levels of domestic violence, psychological aggression, and corporal punishment. The Harsh profile is nevertheless similar to the Abusive profile, despite the fact that these families reported no severe assault. The key difference is the lower score levels: the attributes are the same, but less intense. The Nonabusive profile accounted for the families with the lowest rates of domestic and parental violence, together with a negative attitude towards corporal punishment and a heightened awareness of the consequences of violence. Although the families who matched the Paradoxical profile reported very little violence, they are the least aware of the consequences of violence and the most in favor of corporal punishment. The four profiles were replicated with another cluster analysis performed on an independent representative sample of 2,465 families. Then the profiles were compared with regard to the variables used to create the clusters and other variables theoretically associated with the appearance of maltreatment. These validation methods enhance the credibility of the proposed typology. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Role of Shame as a Mediator Between Anti-Black Racial Identity Attitudes and Negative Affect in a Sample of African American College Students
AN  - 1018353954; 201212773
AB  - A sample of 168 African American undergraduates was surveyed to clarify past findings demonstrating a consistent relationship between endorsing negative attitudes about being African American and experiencing negative affect. Specifically, shame was tested as a mediator between participants' endorsement of preencounter attitudes (i.e., anti-Black attitudes) and both feelings of depression and global self-esteem, respectively. As predicted, shame acted as a complete mediator in both equations. Limitations and implications are also discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Prejudice among Peruvians and Chileans as a Function of Identity, Intergroup Contact, Acculturation Preferences, and Intergroup Emotions
AN  - 835111548; 201100491
AB  - A special Latin American acculturative context is currently developing in Chile in which native Chileans have contact with several immigrant groups, particularly newcomers from Peru. This study examines several intergroup variables including contact, national and Latino American identities, group distinctiveness, realistic threat, intergroup anxiety, and acculturation preferences as predictors of prejudice on the part of both Chilean natives and Peruvian immigrants. Three hundred Peruvian immigrants (194 females and 106 males) and 300 Chileans (199 females and 101 males) participated in the study. Acculturation preferences, perceived group distinctiveness, and especially intergroup contact were shown to be important predictors of prejudice toward out-group members. Intergroup anxiety and realistic threat mediated some of these effects. The pattern of these results also varied as a function of nationality. Theoretical as well as practical implications for further research are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Intergroup contact and the projection of positivity
AN  - 822522022; 201072903
AB  - Three studies investigated whether intergroup contact reduces prejudice, in part, via the extension of positive attributes that define the self to the outgroup. Study 1 found that positive intergroup contact predicted self-outgroup overlap, and this overlap mediated the contact-attitude relationship. This mediational path was specific to outgroup, but not ingroup, attitudes. In Study 2 we found that it was the attribution of specifically positive, as opposed to negative, traits that mediated the contact-attitude relationship in a model that also included intergroup anxiety. In Study 3 an elaborated model was supported, in which perceived self-other similarity mediated the effects of positive contact on the attribution of positive self-traits. We discuss the findings in the context of recent advances in Intergroup Contact Theory. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Stacked Deck: An Effective, School-Based Program for the Prevention of Problem Gambling
AN  - 902082256; 201123890
AB  - School-based prevention programs are an important component of problem gambling prevention, but empirically effective programs are lacking. Stacked Deck is a set of 5-6 interactive lessons that teach about the history of gambling; the true odds and "house edge"; gambling fallacies; signs, risk factors, and causes of problem gambling; and skills for good decision making and problem solving. An overriding theme of the program is to approach life as a "smart gambler" by determining the odds and weighing the pros versus cons of your actions. A total of 949 grade 9-12 students in 10 schools throughout southern Alberta received the program and completed baseline and follow-up measures. These students were compared to 291 students in 4 control schools. Four months after receiving the program, students in the intervention group had significantly more negative attitudes toward gambling, improved knowledge about gambling and problem gambling, improved resistance to gambling fallacies, improved decision making and problem solving, decreased gambling frequency, and decreased rates of problem gambling. There was no change in involvement in high risk activities or money lost gambling. These results indicate that Stacked Deck is a promising curriculum for the prevention of problem gambling.

T1  - The Impact of Crossgroup Friendships in South Africa: Affective Mediators and Multigroup Comparisons
AN  - 743067027; 201043371
AB  - Two cross-sectional survey studies among majority-status White and minority-status Coloured high school students in South Africa explored the effects of crossgroup friendships on prejudice, and the affective processes (intergroup anxiety in Study 1, and intergroup anxiety and affective empathy in Study 2) underlying these effects with respect to two target groups for each sample. Crossgroup friendships were negatively associated with negative action tendencies, and positively associated with positive outgroup attitudes and greater perceived outgroup variability for both samples, irrespective of the target group. The importance of intergroup anxiety and affective empathy as mediators of these effects was also confirmed. Multigroup comparisons showed significant differences in the structural models across the two samples in both studies, and confirmed prior findings in the contact literature that contact effects are stronger for majority than minority groups. These findings are the first of their kind within the South African context. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Points of View, Social Positioning and Intercultural Relations
AN  - 60338641; 201017645
AB  - The challenge of intercultural relations has become an important issue in many societies. In spite of the claimed value of intercultural diversity, successful outcomes as predicted by the contact hypothesis are but one possibility; on occasions intercultural contact leads to intolerance and hostility. Research has documented that one key mediator of contact is perspective taking. Differences in perspective are significant in shaping perceptions of contact and reactions to it. The ability to take the perspective of the other and to understand it in its own terms is a necessary condition for successful intergroup outcomes. This paper sheds light on the processes involved in intercultural perspective taking by elaborating the notion of the point of view based on social representations theory. The point of view provides a theory of social positioning that can analyse cultural encounters between social actors, and identify the conditions for positive relations. Insights are drawn from a study of public views on the relative merits of science and religion, following a documentary by Richard Dawkins in which it was suggested that religion is a source of evil. The findings demonstrate that the point of view may be categorised according to a three-way taxonomy according to the extent to which it is open to another perspective. A point of view may be monological--closed to another's perspective entirely, dialogical--open to the possibility of another perspective while maintaining some percepts as unchallengeable, or metalogical--open to another's perspective based on the other's frame of reference.
