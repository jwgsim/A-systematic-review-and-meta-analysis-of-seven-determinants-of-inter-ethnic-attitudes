T1  - Constructed Attitudes toward the Roma: A French Case
AN  - 2492561893
AB  - Forty per cent of Europeans refuse to have Roma as their neighbours, while 80 per cent of these do not even have direct contact with them. Using these statistics as a point of departure, this study analyzes how attitudes toward Roma are constructed. It proposes to investigate this process in two similar environments but where local integration policies directed toward Roma differ, resulting in disparate forms of intergroup contact. The analysis is premised on two theoretical assumptions: that the integration of migrants is a local public policy issue and that intergroup contact frames attitudes between majority and minority groups. From semi-structured interviews in the French municipalities of La Courneuve and Ivry-sur-Seine, four theories are empirically tested: the contact theory, the halo effect, the impact of local immigrant integration policies and media influence. This study demonstrates that the implementation of municipal policies in favour of Roma integration can improve their living conditions and thus deconstruct prejudices attributable to their precarious situation. In addition, it illustrates how the media activate, maintain or solidify the way Roma are perceived.

T1  - Driven by Context? The Interrelated Effects of Parents, Peers, Classrooms on Development of Prejudice Among Swedish Majority Adolescents
AN  - 2309792151
AB  - Prejudice is one of the major threats to the cohesion of multicultural societies and adolescent years play a key role in its development. How social contexts contribute to adolescent prejudice is, however, not yet well-known. This 3-wave study of Swedish majority adolescents (N = 659; MageT1 = 13.41; MageT3 = 17.33) examined the effects of parents' and peers' attitudes on changes in youth attitudes toward immigrants as well as an interplay between parent, peer, and school context. The results of multilevel analyses revealed that within-person fluctuations in youth attitudes were positively related to fluctuations in peers' but not parents' attitudes. Both parents' and peers' attitudes, however, significantly predicted the differences in level and rate of change in attitudes between adolescents. In addition to these direct effects, mediation analysis showed that parents' attitudes predicted youth attitudes indirectly, via the attitudes of the peers youth associate with, suggesting an overall greater importance of parental bias. Peers' attitudes did not moderate the effects of parents but youth from ethnically diverse classrooms were less affected by their parents' prejudice than youth from less diverse classrooms. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of social context in the development of prejudice. They suggest that while parents set the stage, peers explain the day-to-day variation in prejudice, and that classroom diversity offsets some of the negative effects of parental bias.

T1  - The effect of intergroup contact on solidarity‐based collective action is mediated by reductions in SDO
AN  - 2334619978
AB  - This paper explores the impact of positive and negative intergroup contact on advantaged group members’ willingness to engage in collective action on behalf of disadvantaged outgroups, and the mediational role of social dominance orientation (SDO) in this process. SDO captures an individual’s ideological support for inequality. If contact is going to promote collective action to reduce inequality among the advantaged group, it must be expected to influence their ideological beliefs about hierarchy. In Study 1, only positive, and not negative contact was found to be associated with Whites’ support for the Black Lives Matter movement, mediated by reductions in SDO. In Study 2, both positive and negative contact were associated, respectively, with more or less support for collective action to protect the rights of European immigrants during Brexit negotiations. While positive contact was associated with reduced SDO and more support for collective action among British nationals, negative contact was associated with increased SDO and lower support for collective action.

T1  - Four voices of refugee solidarity along the Balkan Route: An exploratory pilot study on motivations for mobilisation
AN  - 2148529954
AB  - Scathing critiques of the European response to what has been widely called a 'refugee crisis' are not in short supply. However, as many activist mobilisations and solidarities emerged along the Balkan Route, this is only one facet of the European response to forced migration. Having interviewed four migration activists from four countries along this route - Greece, Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary - this exploratory pilot study sought to investigate possible motivational factors for mobilisation in light of the fact that the participants had no prior experience in activism nor interest in the politics of migration prior to the European migration crisis. Through content analysis of interview transcripts, two factors emerged as having potential implications for mobilisation: media coverage and visibility of refugees. Hence, theories about the media effect and intergroup contact are used to explicate the findings. Possible future research avenues are proposed.

T1  - Marriage and Social Boundaries among British Pakistanis
AN  - 2114224179
AB  - A cosmopolitan environment offers challenges for cultural groups that seek to reproduce themselves in the next generation. British Pakistanis have not seen the kind of breakdown in marriage boundaries that characterizes other post-war migrants to Britain. The article examines how this pattern is linked to commitments to transnational marriage, which promise a source of future remittances to Pakistan. However, the need to maintain these links has exaggerated the importance of religious and moral display for British Pakistanis, and these have wider effects in the policing of social contact with outsiders and the negative portrayal of the sexual morality of non-Pakistanis.

T1  - A Flâneur in the Erotic City: Prince and the Urban Imaginary
AN  - 1945566291
AB  - In September of 1986, megastar Prince journeyed across the Atlantic to France to begin filming his second motion picture Under the Cherry Moon. Having captured the US imagination in the commercially successful Purple Rain (1984), “The Kid” (Prince’s Purple Rain alias) was eager to begin shooting his idea for a wry comedy in black and white in “homage to the B films of the 1940’s” (Goodman, 1986 ). Prince’s artistic, transcontinental trek was already on display with his 1985 Around the World in a Day, an album that at once pushed him forward musically by looking backward to 1960s psychedelic, Beatles-esque pop. An avant-garde experimentalist, Prince was seemingly constructing a new musical paradigm that linked past and present in kaleidoscopic fashion. The title song might have Prince playing the melodious wanderer: “Open your heart, open your mind, A train is leaving all day, A wonderful trip through our time, And laughter is all U pay.” Parade: Music from The Motion Picture “Under the Cherry Moon” continued the sauntering theme as the diminutive Prince declares in the title track, “The little 1 will escort U, 2 places within your mind.” In this manner, the wanderings of Prince’s character Christopher Tracy took him “more often to the strange corners of Paris than to its historic centre, to the strongholds of multiculturalism rather than to the classic headquarters of the Gallic tradition” (White, 2001 ). The purpose of the article is to present Prince as a postmodern flâneur. Beyond notions of his dandyism, most directly observed in his use of signifiers that convey gender ambiguity/bending, Prince’s urban representations, traveling imagery, solitary character, social commentary, contradictory relationships with women, and transformative creativity mark a new take on the flâneur.

T1  - “We Are in the Feminine Aspect Now”: Women Artists, Prince, and Visions of Utopia
AN  - 1945565925
AB  - Prince’s 1978 debut album For You credits the artist with production, arrangement, composition, and performance. This signaled not only his inimitable musical mastery but also his singular clarity of vision. Central to this vision were Prince’s unique aspirations to Utopia—a thread that would run throughout his musical career. This imagined society was rooted in nonconformity and, among many other things, granted men and women, Black and white, rich and poor equal access to love, sexuality, success, and peace. Utopian aspirations existed within the creative production of Prince’s earliest incarnation as an artist until his untimely death. A fictitious and very real Paisley Park, backing bands such as The Revolution, and record titles such as The Rainbow Children all point to his reach for a different more egalitarian world. This utopia would include significant challenges to constructions of race, gender, and the composition of Blackness. Prince’s singular vision of utopia cast women as essential to its creation. This paper specifically explores Prince’s unwavering support of women artists as well as their function in building and sustaining this vision. This discussion confronts the media focus on women in Prince’s musical life as simply paramours/muses and reinterrogates his commitment to female artistry and, above all, a utopian world.

T1  - The source of a movement: making the case for social media as an informational source using Black Lives Matter
AN  - 1934041340
AB  - Social media is growing as a technological and social phenomenon, with billions of people using it every day around the world. Given its increasing ubiquity, researchers continue to seek to understand social media and its implications for the social world. Part of the growing body of scholarship on social media includes uncovering the most effective methodologies for exploration that appropriately consider differences between the technology of social media and the ways in which people use them. New directions for social media research include the use of big data and analysing the socio-technical nature of social media. Using data from an ongoing study on college Millennials that includes questions about their thoughts on the Black Lives Matter movement, the author suggests another direction for future research: studying the implications of social media as an informational source.

It shows the intersection of the personal life, public biography, creative work, and critical reception of a public intellectual negotiating his ethnic and racial-identity for six decades. Informed by work in Race and Ethnic Studies, Critical Whiteness Studies, and Critical Rhetoric Studies, this essay uses this story as a case study of the ideological power of white ethnic-identity and white racial-identity in the racial formation of post-civil rights America. I show how the public story of one of the most popular and critically acclaimed American artists over the last half-century transcribed the conversion of an 'unmeltable' Italian-American of the late 1960s Ethnic Revival to a White-Ethnic American of an end-of-the-century Hyphen-Nationalism. I demonstrate the power embedded in the institutional and cultural regime of Hyphen-Nationalism in the United States that acts to erase in personal memory, creative imagination, and art the power and legacy of white privilege.

T1  - The social and pragmatic function of English in weak contact situations: Ingroup and outgroup marking in the Dutch reality TV show Expeditie Robinson
AN  - 2061520804
AB  - The world-wide spread of English is one of the most visible symptoms of globalization. In weak contact settings such as Western Europe, where contact with English is usually indirect, remote and asymmetrical, a paradigm shift has occurred. Where, previously, Anglicism research has mainly adopted a structuralist perspective, inventorying the number of English loanwords found according to the degree of morphological and phonological adaptation to the receptor language, the focus has recently been shifted to the pragmatic and social function of Anglicisms in discourse. This article aims to add to this new perspective by means of an interactional analysis of the use of English insertions in one season of the Dutch reality TV show Expeditie Robinson. Specifically, we focus on the three participants that use English most frequently on the island. It is shown how two of these participants form an ingroup with its own discursive norms, including the regular use of English items. Next, the analysis focuses on an interesting opposite: another participant who also uses English frequently, but who does not attain any notable social prestige on the island. The two contrasting cases illustrate the locally emergent and highly fluid nature of the social meaning of English elements in the spontaneous conversations of these Dutch-speaking interlocutors.

T1  - How positive and negative contact relate to attitudes towards Roma: Comparing majority and high-status minority perspectives
AN  - 1945135051
AB  - Intergroup contact scholars have recently called for analyzing the effects of negative intergroup contact. In response to this call, we examined the correlates of positive and negative contact with one of the most stigmatized ethnic minorities, that is, Roma. We conducted a study in Bulgaria considering the point of view of the ethnic Bulgarian majority (n = 516) and of Bulgarian Turks (n = 274), an ethnic minority with higher status compared to Roma. Regression analyses showed that positive contact was associated with reduced prejudice and more support for pro-Roma policies, while negative contact revealed the opposite pattern. These associations did not differ between ethnic Bulgarians and Bulgarian Turks. Moreover, positive and negative intergroup emotions mediated the relationships between positive and negative contact on the one hand and prejudice and policy support on the other. Our study highlights the importance of emotional processes involved in positive and negative intergroup contact experiences and encourages future research to analyze how absolute versus relative status differences shape the effects of positive and negative contact in complex hierarchical societies.

T1  - Does Closeness to Someone Who Is Gay, Lesbian, or Bisexual Influence Etiology Beliefs About Homosexuality?
AN  - 1831273196
AB  - Research suggests that contact with sexual minorities and etiology beliefs regarding the origins of homosexuality are associated with antigay bias; however, factors related to etiology beliefs have received little empirical attention. Our primary research question is: Does closeness to someone who is gay, lesbian, or bisexual influence etiology beliefs? Students (n = 851) from four U.S. universities completed an anonymous survey, and regression results indicated that contact and closeness were not significantly associated with etiology beliefs. Because both contact and relationship closeness were associated with antigay attitudes, and closeness demonstrated the largest effect, we tested three alternative structural equation models to determine if contact and closeness mediated etiology beliefs. Results suggested that contact and the degree of closeness are indirectly associated with students' etiology beliefs through antigay bias.

T1  - Germany: neo-Nazis and the market in asylum reception
AN  - 1824746321
AB  - Attacks on and abuses within asylum reception centres are increasing across Germany; even those that attract widespread media attention seem to garner little effective action from the German criminal justice system. Germany's booming private security industry, which operates with sparse legislative oversight or accountability, is attracting large numbers of neo-Nazis to its ranks. It is estimated that one in ten neo-Nazis known to the intelligence services works in private security. And it is private security companies, operating for profit, that are largely contracted to guard and manage Germany's refugee centres. Thus, those who are most hostile to refugees and asylum seekers are those who, increasingly, are being put in positions of direct access to and authority over them.

T1  - Ethnic media, conflict, and the nation-state: Kurdish broadcasting in Turkey and Europe and mediated nationhood
AN  - 1854828817
AB  - Drawing on fieldwork among Kurdish broadcasters in Turkey and Europe, this article shows how ethnic media mediate nationhood in a conflict context. Despite rising interest in the media-nationhood nexus, and the expansion of studies on ethnic media, little is known about ethnic media in conflicts involving state and non-state actors. This study investigates three Kurdish broadcasters, Roj-TV, Gün-TV, and TRT-6. The collected data include expert interviews and informal conversations with employees. Through a grounded theory approach, a model is developed that proposes four modes of mediated nationhood, in which the relation to the state and the role of ethnicity are key elements. Next, it is demonstrated how mediated nationhood in conflicts is characterized by multiple constraints, and how this affects the perceived roles and ethnic belongings among media professionals.

T1  - The Nouvelle Droite in Portugal: a new strategy for the radical right in the transition from authoritarianism to democracy
AN  - 1807164657
AB  - Marchi examines how the French Nouvelle Droite (ND) was introduced into Portugal at the end of the Salazarist regime and during the transition to democracy. The relevance of the Portuguese case lies in the fact that the early diffusion of the ND in Europe coincided with the profound crisis of the radical right in Portugal as it faced the liberalization of the authoritarian regime and repression during the revolutionary transition. For that reason the far right in Portugal, in comparative terms, can be seen to have been subject to historical constraints quite different from those in Spain and other Western European democracies. Marchi describes the groups on the Portuguese radical right, and certain figures who were inspired by the ND and disseminated its ideas in Portugal. His analysis of their main publications, their statements and the media campaign to promote the ND from the end of the 1960s to the beginning of the 1980s highlights the different reasons for and ways in which Portuguese radicals engaged and dealt with the ND. Marchi also looks at the reactions of the national right-wing milieu to the spread of ND ideas. As part of his paper's contribution to comparative studies on the transnational radical right, it also provides new evidence, derived from the Portuguese case, of the way in which one of the most important schools of right-wing thought at the end of the twentieth century has influenced extreme-right milieux all over Europe. In light of Tamir Bar-On's analysis of the ND's cultural and pan-European impact, the findings presented here confirm its transnational character while drawing on this and other cases from southern Europe to question the French movement's long-term effectiveness in reorienting the culture of the right-wing milieu.

T1  - Prevalence and Correlates of Lifetime Suicide Attempts Among Transgender Persons in Argentina
AN  - 1794901743
AB  - This study examined the lifetime prevalence and correlates of attempted suicide among transgender persons in Argentina. Data were derived from a nation-wide, cross-sectional survey conducted in 2013. We assessed individual, social, and structural correlates of reporting a history of attempting suicide using logistic regression. Among 482 participants, the median age was 30, 91% identified as transwomen, and 32% resided in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area. A lifetime suicide attempt was reported by 159 (33%), among whom the median age at first attempt was 17. In a multivariate model, internalized stigma was positively associated with a history of suicidal behavior, while participants with stable housing had reduced odds of prior suicide attempt(s). These findings suggest that reducing stigma and mitigating structural vulnerabilities (through, for example, the enactment and enforcement of laws that prohibit discrimination based on gender identity to ensure equitable access to housing) could be effective targets for intervention to reduce suicide attempts among transgender individuals in Argentina.

T1  - Debating LGBT Workplace Protections in the Bible Belt: Social Identities in Legislative and Media Discourse
AN  - 1794901714
AB  - This article reports a case study of the legislative and media discourse surrounding the addition of sexual orientation and gender identity language to the employment nondiscrimination ordinance of a city in the heart of the Bible Belt. The purpose of the study is to uncover how different identities were constructed and contested at city council meetings and in the news media on the way to passing legal protection for LGBT city employees in a region that is often characterized by anti-gay prejudice. This debate over the nondiscrimination ordinance centered on the question of whether LGBT identities are equivalent to identity categories based on race, gender, or religious belief, and it was shaped by various intergroup communication dynamics, specifically between members of the LGBT minority and the straight majority, between LGBT and Christian identities, and between "true" and "false" Christian identities.

T1  - Transnational communication practices of unaccompanied young Korean students in the United States
AN  - 1907272965
AB  - Based on a study of unaccompanied Korean student migrants, this article investigates how transnational communication helped the students continue their transnational journey for educational success. Although suffering perennial loneliness, the students continued with their studies because they still believed acquiring education in the United States would be advantageous in securing their success. They became actively involved in transnational communication to cope with stresses and to gain emotional support. Transnational communication played an important role in mediating between their pursuit of education and desired cultural capital on the one hand, and the loneliness and isolation as migrants on their own on the other.

T1  - 'Negative credentials,' 'foreign-earned' capital, and call centers: Guatemalan deportees' precarious reintegration
AN  - 1792351801
AB  - This article explores the precarious conditions deported Guatemalans encounter in their country of birth, alongside a consideration of how Guatemalan deportees' agency is structured by precarity yet mediated by individual factors such as foreign-earned capital and negative credentials. Previous research has found that deportees are often criminalized, stigmatized, and blamed for social problems. Researchers have also found that deportees can be well-suited for work in the transnational call center sector when they have adequate English skills. This raises the question of how deportees' individual characteristics and the local context of reception influence their (re)incorporation. This study, based on interviews with 34 Guatemalan deportees, reveals that deportees have varied trajectories, yet that the availability of call center jobs combined with deportees' capacity and agency creates a bifurcation in labor market outcomes between deportees who secure jobs in call centers and those who do not.

T1  - Black youths, joblessness, and the other side of 'Black Lives Matter'
AN  - 1789067579
AB  - When income segregation is coupled with racial segregation, low-income blacks cluster in neighbourhoods that feature disadvantages along several dimensions including joblessness. Residents of these neighbourhoods are often innocent victims of crime, including violent crime, which frequently goes unnoticed or unreported in the media. They represent the other side of 'Black Lives Matter', which suggests the need for a broader vision that also highlights the plight of innocent victims of violent crimes in the inner city, and that recognizes the close association between such crimes and joblessness. I therefore call for a policy prescription that would enhance the employment prospects of jobless youth, who are disproportionally involved in criminal offenses, especially those stigmatized by prison records. In making the case for this public policy prescription, I challenge Orlando Patterson's assumptions, based largely on the research of Roger Waldinger, that young black males are reluctant to take low-wage employment by highlighting the important research of Stephen Petterson on reservation wages.

T1  - Mediating the family imaginary: Young people negotiating absence in transnational refugee families
AN  - 1769607467
AB  - Although transnational families regularly experience extended periods of physical separation and dispersal, the emergence of new media means that most are now practised at sustaining forms of 'connected presence' and 'mediated co-presence' across time and space. Thus, migration no longer disrupts all family networks, for many continue to function as sites of support across national borders. However, refugee transnational families are a clear exception, with both physical and mediated contact between kin living in refugee camps or in transit remaining limited, if not impossible. Nevertheless, it is arguable that digital communication technologies have transformed even this experience of family dispersal. In this article, we demonstrate how young people from refugee backgrounds living in Melbourne respond to the absence of their family members by using digital media to construct a family imaginary that serves to sustain a sense of familyhood in contexts of ongoing separation.

AN  - 1768022737
AB  - Undertaking an examination of the precarious places of the movies and movie theaters in queer lives in the 20th century, this article takes up a series of anecdotal episodes and feature-length films to consider how the space-related stakes of LGBT health have been best understood in literal cinema houses and the narrative cinema projections inside of them. The author argues for an appreciation of LGBT-themed motion pictures as oscillating between perpetuator of queer pathology and its potential solution.

AB  - For this contribution to the "Cartographies" section of the special issue on "Mapping Queer Bioethics," the author focuses on the terrains of digital media, geosocial networking, and sexually based social media in LGBT communities. Addressing the communal potentials and ethical complications of geosocial connections made possible by such sexually based social media, the author asks whether digital forms of cartography via applications such as Grindr and Scruff simplify, complicate, or merely expose historically longstanding notions of queer interconnectivity.

Drawing on in-depth interviews conducted in Toronto and Vancouver, the study examines how transnational cultural flow is articulated with social media and ethnic sociality. In the study, while the transnational flow of Korean media content was largely reliant on social media, it was renegotiated by the users' subject positions as ethnic minorities and by their ethnic networks in the Canadian cities.

T1  - 'How do you Say "Stop that!" in Slovakian?': A8 Immigration and Scotland's Race and Ethnic Diversity Narrative
AN  - 1808418382
AB  - 'How do you Say "Stop that!" in Slovakian': A8 Immigration and Scotland's Race and Ethnic Diversity Narrative. In 2004 8 Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries (Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia) joined the EU in an expansion popularly known as the Accession, or A8. As part of this arrangement the Slovakian Roma community settled in Govanhill, a neighborhood in the South-Side of Glasgow, Scotland. Immediately, there was widespread outcry, followed by public debate, on the numbers involved and the impact on local services. One of the claims made was that, because of a 'unique' history of 'self-isolation', the Roma had altered local policing needs. There were widespread media anecdotes of anti-social behavior but also racist victimization. Using material available post-A8 Govanhill, this synthesizes the debate on Roma settlement against the wider canvass of Scottish reception and assimilation of immigrants. I claim that post-A8 phobia of the Roma is part of an unsustainable ideology of Scotland as a post-racial 'welcoming country' which has occluded a nuanced interrogation of the capacity of the country to welcome and successfully integrate immigrants.

T1  - The Minstrel Legacy: African American English and the Historical Construction of "Black" Identities in Entertainment
AN  - 1929870302
AB  - Linguists have long been aware that the language scripted for "ethnic" roles in the media has been manipulated for a variety of purposes ranging from the construction of character "authenticity" to flagrant ridicule. This paper provides a brief overview of the history of African American roles in the entertainment industry from minstrel shows to present-day films. I am particularly interested in looking at the practice of distorting African American English as an historical artifact which is commonplace in the entertainment industry today. Dialogue which is clearly meant as an imitation of African American English still results in the construction of an ethnic stereotype that serves as a reflection of European American attitudes regarding African Americans. As a result, such depictions provide non-Black acculturated people with a perception of Blackness that is founded in inaccuracies and derision but has been portrayed as authentic, leaving Black life open to continual mimicry.

T1  - Media, Racial Identity, and Mainstream American Values
AN  - 1784145824
AB  - A survey of 499 Black, Asian, and White American college students assessed their endorsement of "mainstream" American values, uncovering a 6-factor values structure, with some notable significant differences between the races. As expected, White respondents' own personal value orientations most closely matched their assessments of mainstream American values, and stronger racial identity (from a social identity perspective) corresponded to an even closer match. A variety of media consumption measures correlated with personal/mainstream American values congruence, with greater media exposure predicting greater endorsement of mainstream values, but most relationships were eclipsed when controlling for demographics, race, and racial identity. Predictors that maintained under controls included music TV and sports programming exposure, pointing to the potential importance of such particular media forms in the process of value-based cultural assimilation and reinforcement.

T1  - 'Gay Enclaves Face Prospect of Being PassÉ': How Assimilation Affects the Spatial Expressions of Sexuality in the United States
AN  - 1757508041
AB  - Journalists, activists and academics alike predict that gay neighborhoods in the United States will disappear, yet many of their claims are unsubstantiated or overly determined by economic factors. This article examines 40 years of media accounts to identify the mechanisms that explain why these urban areas are changing. I begin with the observation that the rate of assimilation of sexual minorities into mainstream society has accelerated in today's so-called 'post-gay' era. Assimilation expands the residential imagination of gays and lesbians beyond the boundaries of a specific neighborhood to the entire city itself. Furthermore, as sexual orientation recedes in centrality in everyday life, residents opine that few care if a person self-identifies as gay or straight. These two respective mechanisms of expansion and cultural sameness bring existing economic wisdom into dialogue with a cultural and political perspective about how our shifting understandings of sexuality also affect the decisions we make about where to live and socialize.

T1  - Cultural Inclusiveness Contributing to International Students' Intercultural Attitudes: Mediating Role of Intergroup Contact Variables
AN  - 1728660634; 201533989
AB  - This study sought to examine the relationships among Asian-born international students' perceived cultural inclusiveness and intercultural contact, along with the contributions these variables made to the students' attitudes towards culturally different domestic students. Based on Pettigrew's (1998) intergroup contact theory and previous research on educational cultural climate, we hypothesised that more positive intercultural attitudes would be associated with perceptions of a culturally inclusive educational environment and higher levels of intergroup contact as indicated by quantity of contact, quality of contact, and extent of intercultural friendships. Anonymous survey participants were 190 (76 male and 113 female) Asian-born international university students at an Australian university. Results showed small to moderate relationships among perceived cultural inclusiveness, all the dimensions of intercultural contact, and intercultural attitudes, except for an unexpected insignificant association between intercultural friendship and attitudes. Hierarchical regression analysis showed that cultural inclusiveness and quality of contact were the only significant predictors of intercultural attitudes. Mediation analysis indicated that quality of contact partially mediated the relationship between cultural inclusiveness and intercultural attitudes. The importance of an inclusive educational environment on intergroup contact and attitudes, from international students' viewpoint, is discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Women's Land Claims in the Acholi Region of Northern Uganda: What Can Be Learned from What Is Contested
AN  - 1855326631
AB  - Women are often understood to be highly marginalised in typical African customary land regimes. The research presented in this article found that in the Acholi region of northern Uganda this is not the case. The crisis of land conflict that followed the twenty-year lra insurgency and mass rural displacement has seemingly passed, notwithstanding a minimal contribution from the formal justice, law and order sector: local state actors as well as clan elders are mediating and adjudicating disputes on the basis of custom. However some social institutions, in particular traditional marriage, have been deeply affected by displacement and the consequent poverty. In this context, custom appears to be becoming more responsive to the needs of women, including those who are divorced or separated. While women's customary land claims are often challenged, they appear to be generally respected and supported by communities and those with responsibilities for settling disputes.

T1  - Necrophagy at the Lynching Block: Gay Lesbian Quarterly
AN  - 1683449520
AB  - In this bocado, I explore a key moment in the constitution of racialized bodily being in US lynching culture: the incorporation of incendiary scenes of torture and death into circulating occasions of normalcy—black sufferance, white enjoyment, whatever—through the symbolics of food. As we well know, people flocked in large numbers between the 1890s and the turn of the century to large-scale spectacle lynchings, often traveling by train or newly acquired automobiles to see the bodies of African Americans dragged, flayed, shot, photographed, burned, and otherwise dis-integrated in the name of white supremacist justice. Various sensationalizing tropes rendered this violence legible, rational, and necessary in the eyes of a South threatened by postbellum economic blight and the menace to the social that black “freedom” was thought to portend. Chief among these was the helpless torpor of white ladyhood and its mediating subjection to the “bestial” claims of black desire. The recourse to animal metaphors in white supremacist literature and media reports of lynchings was thick, inescapable, and telling in its ability to render a political divide between the rightful lives of white citizens and the mere lives of the postemancipated undead. Violence so extreme and so random as to prompt mass black migration to the North was accepted by many as a necessary foil to the threat of a freedom figured away into biological contagion—into a cryptic contradiction at the hungry heart of white liberalism.

T1  - Where Kinsey, Christ, and Tila Tequila Meet: Discourse and the Sexual (Non)-Binary
AN  - 1660021284; 201505571
AB  - Drawing on 80 interviews and 17 months of participant observation in Lexington, Kentucky, this article details how individuals drew on three areas of national and local discourse to conceptualize sexuality. Media, popular science, and religious discourses can be viewed as portraying sexuality bifocally-as both a binary of heterosexual/homosexual and as a non-binary that encompasses fluidity. However, individuals in Lexington drew on each of these areas of discourse differently. Religion was thought to produce a binary vision of sexuality, whereas popular science accounts were understood as both binary and not. The media was understood as portraying non-binary identities that were not viable, thus strengthening the sexual binary. These differing points of view led identities such as bisexual and queer to lack cultural intelligibility. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Loneliness and Suicidal Ideation in Drug-Using College Students
AN  - 1700675671; 201525251
AB  - The college years are marked by social changes and behavioral experimentation which may increase risk of suicidal ideation. We propose a novel pathway for the development of suicidal thoughts between two established suicide risk factors, loneliness and drug use, which have not been examined in a nonclinical sample. Data were collected from 207 undergraduate drug-using students at a large southeastern university. As hypothesized, suicidal ideation was positively correlated with both loneliness (r = .40) and drug use (r = .29). After controlling for several demographic variables, social desirability, and anxiety sensitivity, drug use was tested as a potential mediator in the loneliness-suicidal ideation link using a single-mediator model. Results indicated a significant indirect (mediated) effect of loneliness on suicidal ideation via drug use (ab = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.02-0.18), suggesting that loneliness may contribute to suicidal ideation through increased drug use among college students. Identification of and intervention with students reporting loneliness and drug use may be a promising suicide prevention strategy on college campuses. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - How to Describe It? Why the Term Coming Out Means Different Things in the United States and France
AN  - 1667953677; 201509634
AB  - Drawing on 30 in-depth interviews with U.S. and French lesbians, gay men, and bisexuals, we find important similarities in how U.S. and French respondents strategically managed the visibility of their sexual identities but differences in the vocabulary used to discuss those experiences. Specifically, all of the Americans used the expression coming out spontaneously while only five French respondents did so. Instead, French respondents typically rejected coming out in favor of other words or expressions. Rather than simple effects of speaking different languages, these differences stemmed from distinct connotations given to the same-widely diffused-expressions within each local context. Unlike their American peers, who saw the expression's origin in their own history and used in everyday lives, most French respondents resisted what they perceived to be an American cultural object imported by the French media. We also find evidence that the meaning of coming out is changing in both contexts such that in the future, the French and Americans may perceive and use it more similarly. This research contributes to our understanding of the intersection between language, meaning, and political context, within a cross-national setting. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Romanian Roma migration: the interplay between structures and agency
AN  - 1667950687; 201509657
AB  - Prior studies on Roma migration put much emphasis on either structural factors or networks that become key elements for explaining the growing migration flows of a population lacking economic resources and characterized by poor education. Although very relevant for explaining the perpetuation of migration, these studies posit the limit of downplaying migrants' agency and the role of identity markers mediating the influence of structural conditions in both destination and origin countries. Drawing on quantitative data from the Roma Inclusion Barometer (2006) as well as on in-depth interviews with Roma migrants from Eastern Romania, the paper provides a more comprehensive account of contemporary Romanian Roma migration towards Western European countries. The paper challenges the portrayal of the Roma migrant population, as conveyed by many scholars, as a rather passive one and argues that gender, religion and subgroup identities constitute key elements in explaining Roma migrants' agency.

T1  - 'Prostitutes' and 'Defectors': How the Ukrainian State Constructs Women Emigrants to Italy and the USA
AN  - 1667951861; 201509632
AB  - Scholars of sending countries emphasise the role of economics in shaping state policies towards emigration. They argue sending states are converging around a set of discursive strategies that aim to facilitate the influx of remittances from emigrants. One such strategy uses discourses of cultural nationalism to celebrate emigrants as 'heroes' of the nation. Drawing on a state-sponsored media campaign and ethnographic data, I found the Ukrainian state does the opposite. It stigmatises its emigrants to both Italy and the USA as 'prostitutes' and 'defectors', respectively. However emigrants are differentially stigmatised. Emigrants to the USA are simply dismissed, but the Ukrainian state constructs migration to Italy as a shameful social problem. It does this even though emigrants to Italy send back significantly more remittances. Economic interests cannot explain Ukrainian state practices towards emigration. Instead, in the context of post-Soviet transformation, I suggest the Ukrainian state has prioritised the construction of a national identity. The state then constructs policy with an eye to cultural rather than economic outcomes. I argue the Ukrainian state actively stigmatises the migration to Italy because it poses challenges to the nation-building process, whereas the migration to the USA is peripheral to this key state concern.

T1  - To Know You is Not Necessarily to Love You: The Partisan Mediators of Intergroup Contact
AN  - 1680150718; 201514634
AB  - We propose the contact-cue interaction approach to studying political contact-that cues from trusted political elites can moderate the effect of contact on the formation of public policy opinions. Allport's initial formulation of the contact effect noted that it relies on authority support. In a highly polarized political era, authoritative voices for individuals vary based on party identification. Social experiences may affect public policy, but they must also be considered in light of partisan filters. Using data from the 2006 CCES, we examine the manner in which straight respondents with gay family members, friends, co-workers and acquaintances view same-sex marriage policy, finding a strong contact effect among Democrats, but no contact effect among the strongest Republican identifiers. Our data and analyses strongly support the perspective that social interactions (and their effect on policy) are understood through the lens of partisanship and elite cues.

T1  - Politics, Religion, Attribution Theory, and Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Unions
AN  - 1650148191; 201502304
AB  - The relationship between beliefs about the cause of homosexuality, political and religious ideology, and attitudes toward same-sex unions in the United States is unclear. This study aims to examine the mediating influence and socially embedded nature of attribution beliefs at a time when attitudes toward same-sex unions are undergoing substantial changes in the American public. This study employs simultaneous equation path models and a recent national, random sample of American adults (Baylor Religion Survey 2010) to test each hypothesis. Results reveal that constructed opinions about the origin and controllability of homosexuality significantly influence support for same-sex unions. However, these opinions are socially embedded, especially within particular political and religious ideologies. These findings highlight that while widespread changes in beliefs about the cause of homosexuality may presage shifts in support for same-sex unions, many will be able to resist those shifts toward support, possibly leading to their further marginalization within society.

T1  - Ethnic diversity, trust, and the mediating role of positive and negative interethnic contact: A priming experiment
AN  - 1559006725; 201431979
AB  - This study not only shows that the empirically well-established negative relationship between residential diversity and trust in neighbors holds for the case of Germany, but goes beyond existing research by providing experimental evidence on the causal nature of the diversity effect. Respondents exposed to experimental stimuli that made salient the ethnic or religious heterogeneity of their neighborhoods display significantly lower levels of trust in their neighbors than do respondents in the control group. Further, we explore the role of interethnic contact in mediating the relationship between diversity and trust in a degree of detail unmatched by earlier studies. We consider not only positive forms of interethnic contact such as friendships, but also neutral and negative encounters between people of native and immigrant origin. We find that interethnic contacts mediate negative diversity effects on trust in different ways for both groups. For natives, distant encounters and negative experiences with immigrants in diverse contexts reduce trust, whereas for people of immigrant origin trust in neighbors suffers from the relatively small number of native acquaintances in diverse neighborhoods.

T1  - Risk and Utopia: A Dialogue on Pornography: Gay Lesbian Quarterly
AN  - 1560647264
AB  - The utopian promise of porn is one of carnal intensity, sexual abundance, and pleasure. Building on Richard Dyer's discussion of the utopian aspects of entertainment, this article expands his conceptualization to contemporary pornography and the gay bareback subculture in particular. Structured as a dialogue between a gay bareback porn producer and a media studies scholar, it explores the sexual politics of barebacking, the notion of risk in gay sex, the mediation of intensity and sensation within pornography, the role of online porn distribution, and the uses of music in porn. These strands of dialogue are tied to a conceptualization of utopian sensibility within bareback pornography as an issue of transparency, community, abundance, energy, and intensity. The authors argue for the centrality of fleshiness and viscerality in pornography as well as the necessity to account for such carnal intensity, or resonance, in studies of the genre.

T1  - Stereotypes Can 'Get Under the Skin': Testing a Self-Stereotyping and Psychological Resource Model of Overweight and Obesity
AN  - 1559006628; 201432012
AB  - The authors draw upon social, personality, and health psychology to propose and test a self-stereotyping and psychological resource model of overweight and obesity. The model contends that self-stereotyping depletes psychological resources, namely self-esteem, that help to prevent overweight and obesity. In support of the model, mediation analysis demonstrates that adult Hispanics who highly self-stereotype had lower levels of self-esteem than those who self-stereotype less, which in turn predicted higher levels of body mass index (overweight and obesity levels). Furthermore, the model did not hold for the referent sample, White participants, and an alternative mediation model was not supported. These data are the first to theoretically and empirically link self-stereotyping and self-esteem (a psychological resource) with a strong physiological risk factor for morbidity and short life expectancy in stigmatized individuals. Thus, this research contributes to understanding ethnic-racial health disparities in the United States and beyond. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Effects of Self-Esteem and Ethnic Identity: Acculturative Stress and Psychological Well-Being Among Mexican Immigrants
AN  - 1748865272; 201600242
AB  - We examined whether self-esteem and ethnic identity moderated or mediated the relationship between two types of acculturative stress (American-based and Mexican-based) and psychological well-being among 171 first-generation Mexican immigrant adults. American-based acculturative stress (ABAS) was defined as the stress related to the pressure from Anglo-Americans to improve English and adopt their cultural practices, while Mexican-based acculturative stress (MBAS) was related to the pressure from Mexican immigrants to improve Spanish and retain Mexican cultural practices. The findings suggested that self-esteem was negatively affected by acculturative stress, which, in turn, led to decreased psychological well-being. However, having high self-esteem alleviated the debilitating effects of acculturative stress against psychological well-being. In contrast to self-esteem, ethnic identity exacerbated the negative effect of acculturative stress on psychological well-being. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

AN  - 1551000600; 201428946
AB  - Recent theorizations of trans embodiment have brought attention to the ways neoliberalism limits the productivity of nonnormatively gendered bodies. This article deals with the discursive framing of embodiment and sexual desirability among trans men and other transmasculine persons negotiating Internet-mediated homoerotic spaces. Micro-level analysis of discourse structure and macro-level analysis of socio-political context together show how trans men navigate homonormative sexual economies by linguistically recuperating their bodies' sexually productivity. Instead of undermining claims of embodied masculinity and homoerotic value, potential sites of exclusion-i.e., trans genitals-become sites of flexible accumulation that enhance rather than detract from their bearers' desirability.

T1  - The Ethnographic Machine: Experimenting with Context and Comparison in Strathernian Ethnography
AN  - 1622295978; 201438408
AB  - Context holds a significant place mediating the conceptual and the empirical in ethnography. This modality of knowledge has also become a significant part of science and technology studies since the rise of laboratory studies. However, conventional modes of contextualization that locate the object of study within a whole-such as within a society or culture-have become a target of suspicion and criticism since the 1980s. This led to the radical alteration of the contextualizing strategies of actor-network theory (ANT) and multisited ethnography. Anthropologist Marilyn Strathern is also responding to this crisis by renovating the practice of ethnography in a way significantly different from both strategies. Since contextualization occupies a significant place in the formation of ethnography as a representation of a larger 'out there' reality, her alternative contextualization requires a new characterization of ethnography other than representation. This article tries to expound the complicated, and often perplexing, ethnography of Strathern by making an analogy with objects familiar to most science, technology, and society scholars, namely, machines. By doing so, this article argues that Strathern is opening up a new way of dealing with context that is radically different both from ANT and from multisited ethnography.

T1  - What Makes a Young Assertive Bystander? The Effect of Intergroup Contact, Empathy, Cultural Openness, and In-Group Bias on Assertive Bystander Intervention Intentions
AN  - 1559005085; 201433440
AB  - The present research tests the indirect effects of intergroup contact on adolescents' bystander intervention intentions via four potential mediators: 'empathy,' 'cultural openness,' 'in-group bias,' and 'intergroup anxiety.' British adolescents (N = 855), aged 11-13 years, completed measures of intergroup (interethnic) contact and the identified indirect variables. Intended bystander behavior was measured by presenting participants with an intergroup (immigrant) name-calling scenario. Participants rated the extent to which they would behave assertively. The findings extend previous intergroup contact research by showing a significant indirect effect of intergroup contact on assertive bystander intentions via empathy, cultural openness and in-group bias (but not via intergroup anxiety). Theoretical implications and practical suggestions for future prejudice-reduction interventions are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - When ideology matters: Moral conviction and the association between ideology and policy preferences in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict
AN  - 1531933999; 201423141
AB  - Do people's policy preferences toward outgroups in intractable conflict consistently correspond with political ideology? To what extent are policy-related cleavages between the political right and left in such contexts fueled by moral conviction and emotions? Analyses of a survey of Jewish-Israelis (N = 119) conducted immediately after a war between Israelis and Palestinians revealed little to no ideological differences in acceptance of 'collateral damage,' support for retribution, or support for compromise when positions about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were devoid of moral fervor. Those on the left and right endorsed polarized policy preferences only when their positions about the conflict were held with moral conviction. Presence or absence of guilt about harm to Palestinians mediated the effects of moral conviction on policy preferences in this context. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - 'A person with some sort of learning disability': the aetiological narrative and public construction of Susan Boyle
AN  - 1531932703; 201423246
AB  - Susan Boyle's audition for the television talent competition Britain's Got Talent attracted global attention and widespread media discourse. In this article, I would like to examine this discourse to consider how Boyle's success troubles conventional constructions of both learning disability and celebrity. I extend Ciara Evans's recognition that learning disability is invisible to reflect on the media responses to Boyle's impairment. This reflection notes that even within Boyle's own discourse, she is loosely positioned as having 'some sort of learning disability'. Detailed attention is given to the aetiological account of the 'brain damage' Boyle 'suffered' at birth. The analysis will consider the correlation with scientific discourse, trauma theory and the imposed biography to suggest that the construction of Boyle as both contained and unpredictable is already implicit in the aetiological narrative.

T1  - HOW DID OBAMA WIN HIS SECOND TERM? MINORITY STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS AND REACTIONS TO 2012 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS
AN  - 1767327778; 201606080
AB  - The day after the 2012 presidential election results were declared that Pres Barack Obama won his second term with 332 electoral votes and 51% of the popular vote, political pundits and media analysts began focusing on how the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, lost the election. Romney himself responded, in light of his defeat, that Pres Obama followed the old playbook of using targeted initiatives to woo specific interest groups, especially the African-American community, the Hispanic community and young people. He further asserted that the President painted him (Romney) as anti-immigrant. Some Republicans like Bobby Jindal (Governor of Louisiana) denounced Romney's comment by saying that he was absolutely wrong. The question remains: How did Obama win? Would minority students perceive and react differently from those of the media political analysts and/or voters polled at the time of the election? This paper aims to answer this question.

T1  - Blood Ties: Interpretive Communities and Popular (Gendered) Genres
AN  - 1750223578
AB  - The aim of this paper is to reflect on interpretive communities and their impact on the cultural production and consumption of literary and media texts. Focusing on the case of Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire Mysteries paranormal romantic saga and its TV adaptation, True Blood, it focuses on the circulation of Sookie Stackhouse's novels from a gendered genre and a gendered community of romance readers to a wide audience. It also considers the concept of community as a main topic of the literary proposal that can be understood in meta-fictional terms: Sookie, the main character, embodies a prototype of young, uneducated and working class woman that matches the romance reader prototype. Thus, Sookie's identity negotiations within the different-even antagonistic-communities that come together in the novels can be read as an acute and ironical reflection about the minoritised identity of the original interpretive community of the saga: female romance novel readers. The fact that True Blood erases this aspect, that it reveals the gendered genre of the original text, is also meaningful.

T1  - Cumulative Inequality and Racial Disparities in Health: Private Insurance Coverage and Black/White Differences in Functional Limitations
AN  - 1728662088; 201534134
AB  - Objectives. To test different forms of private insurance coverage as mediators for racial disparities in onset, persistent level, and acceleration of functional limitations among Medicare age-eligible Americans. Method. Data come from 7 waves of the Health and Retirement Study (1996-2008). Onset and progression latent growth models were used to estimate racial differences in onset, level, and growth of functional limitations among a sample of 5,755 people aged 65 and older in 1996. Employer-provided insurance, spousal insurance, and market insurance were next added to the model to test how differences in private insurance mediated the racial gap in physical limitations. Results. In baseline models, African Americans had larger persistent level of limitations over time. Although employer-provided, spousal provided, and market insurances were directly associated with lower persistent levels of limitation, only differences in market insurance accounted for the racial disparities in persistent level of limitations. Discussion. Results suggest private insurance is important for reducing functional limitations, but market insurance is an important mediator of the persistently larger level of limitations observed among African Americans.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Intergroup Conflict
AN  - 1692288605; 201522391
AB  - Intergroup contact theory is enjoying a renaissance; positive contact does reduce intergroup prejudice, but intergroup contact has generally been studied in relatively benign settings. With a number of countries either still experiencing or having just emerged from periods of pervasive intergroup animosity, contact theory is, nowadays, being put to its most stringent test as contact theorists try to uncover ways in which intergroup conflict can be reduced and reconciliation fostered. This article draws on research conducted at the Oxford Centre for the Study of Intergroup Conflict in countries including South Africa, Northern Ireland, Cyprus, and Bosnia. We report on our efforts to add to the emerging body of literature by (a) exploring the possible roles that direct and extended contact play in (post-) conflict societies; (b) asking when we might-or might not-expect contact to positively affect more demanding outcomes (such as intergroup trust and forgiveness); and (c) by investigating the processes by which contact achieves these outcomes. We then outline a research program that aims to further study both the benefits and limitations of intergroup contact in societies that are immersed in or emerging from protracted intergroup conflict.

T1  - Seeking Equality in Broadcasting: The Case for Third Sector Broadcasting
AN  - 1684424337; 201518528
AB  - Members of groups which are traditionally economically or socially disadvantaged tend to also suffer from additional barriers in relation to their ability to establish and control mass media outlets and from insufficiency of media output which represents them and addresses their specific needs. These inequalities in the field of mass media can help perpetuate and aggravate a situation of marginalization and are especially notable in relation to broadcasting due to the higher barriers of entry associated with the medium. The present article makes a case for the state promotion and support of third sector broadcasting as an affirmative measure which can be used to combat inequalities in broadcasting while discussing its advantages and disadvantages in comparison to alternative measures. The aim is not to negate the need for other ty pes of measures but to ex plain why aiding the development of third sector broadcasting outlets is an option which warrants serious consideration by every state seeking to address situations in which specific groups have been disadvantaged in the field of mass media and broadcasting in specific.

T1  - Sexual Citizenship in Private and Public Space: Parents of Gay Men and Lesbians Discuss Their Experiences of Pride Parades
AN  - 1559005995; 201431934
AB  - This article explores how the boundaries of lesbian and gay citizenship are set by parents in relation to the public/private dimensions of space. We analysed 46 in-depth interviews carried out in Italy in the period 2006-2008 with mothers and fathers who described themselves as accepting their sons' and daughters' gay and lesbian identity. We show that parents tend to fight for rights confined to the private dimension whereas both the public dimension and the dividing lines between public and private represent problematic areas. Parents do not expect having to deal with the issue of sexual orientation in the public sphere, implicitly supporting its characterisation as a heteronormative space. Pride parades are a case in point. As emerged in the interviews, most of the parents do not see their participation in parades as undermining the heteronormative family model, but rather as a way of legitimising it. Through the mediation of heterosexual parents, there is a process of familisation of citizenship rights for gay and lesbian people, which is reinforced by parents who belong to parents of gay and lesbian associations. Though discourses on normalisation prevail, the Pride parade is a setting of potential tensions allowing debate on sexual citizenship to enter the public arena. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Editor, the Publisher, and His Mother: The Representation of Lesbians and Gays in the New York Times
AN  - 1567048116; 201435083
AB  - The attention and prominence given to issues in media outlets may affect the importance citizens attribute to them, so the actors who influence mass media coverage decisions may have political power in society generally. This article seeks to measure the relative influence of journalists, social trends, events, government officials, editors, and owners on the New York Times coverage of lesbians and gays from 1960 to 1995. Although many factors affected the nature and frequency of such coverage, the findings of this article show that the owners of the Times exerted decisive influence. Documentary evidence reveals that the Times' owners actively intervened to suppress coverage of lesbians and gays until 1987, even as reporters and editors recognized that increased social visibility made them newsworthy. Statistical analysis confirms that, although some actual events and statements of officials attracted attention from the newspaper throughout the period, they were more likely to generate prominent coverage after 1987 when the stories were consistent with the enthusiasms of the owners.

T1  - Combating the mental health stigma with nostalgia
AN  - 1448995371; 201342739
AB  - We report research implicating nostalgia as an intrapersonal means of warding off the stigmatization of persons with mental illness. We hypothesized and found that nostalgia about an encounter with a person with mental illness improves attitudes toward the mentally ill. In Experiment 1, undergraduates who recalled an encounter with a mentally ill person while focusing on central (vs. peripheral) features of the nostalgia prototype reported a more positive outgroup attitude. This beneficial effect of nostalgia was mediated by greater inclusion of the outgroup in the self (IOGS). In Experiment 2, undergraduates who recalled a nostalgic (vs. ordinary) interaction with a mentally ill person subsequently showed a more positive outgroup attitude. Results supported a serial mediation model whereby nostalgia increased social connectedness, which predicted greater IOGS and outgroup trust. IOGS and outgroup trust, in turn, predicted more positive outgroup attitudes. We ruled out alternative explanations for the results (i.e., mood, perceived positivity, and typicality of the recalled outgroup member). The findings speak to the intricate psychological processes underlying the prejudice-reduction function of nostalgia and their interventional potential. . [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Jewish spaces and Gypsy spaces in the cultural topographies of a New Europe: heritage re-enactment as political folklore
AN  - 1448995006; 201342928
AB  - The European phenomenon of Jewish spaces was first described in the mid-1990s. They were then defined as themed environments initiated and operated by non-Jews, often located in historical Jewish neighbourhoods. Since then Jewish spaces have become a well-established concept in the media and among academics. This article explores Gypsy spaces as analogous to Jewish spaces. The paper compares two cases, the Gypsy pilgrimage to Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer in southern France and the Jewish Culture Festival in the Polish town of Krakow. There are striking parallels between the thriving Gypsy music festivals, Gypsy horse fairs and Gypsy pilgrimages on the one side, and Jewish Culture Festivals on the other. The author formulates some hypotheses as to why Gypsy spaces have not yet been recognised and dealt with more extensively. To conclude, the Jewish and Gypsy spaces are situated in a European landscape of remembrance and interpreted as heritage re-enactment within the framework of European integration.

T1  - Like Everest: defamiliarization and uncanniness in media representations of inaccessibility
AN  - 1438555015; 201340248
AB  - This paper uses phenomenology to explore recent representations of inaccessible architectural environment featured on major Bulgarian television channels. It is argued that by exposing the environmental restrictions faced by disabled people in their everyday activities, Bulgarian media unwittingly engage in an operation described by formalist literary critics as 'defamiliarization'. As a result, familiar elements of the everyday, lived world are illuminated as strange. In phenomenological terms, this brings about the experience of 'uncanniness'. The paper concludes by highlighting the transformative potential inherent in this experience; that is, its power to illuminate as artificial and oppressive the taken-for-granted aspects of the world we inhabit.

T1  - African American Students' Responses to Racial Discrimination: How Race-Based Rejection Sensitivity and Social Constraints are Related to Psychological Reactions
AN  - 1417523734; 201331939
AB  - We examined the association between two individual differences (race-based rejection sensitivity and social constraints in talking about racism with family, friends, and/or intimate partners) and psychological reactions to an incident of racial discrimination. Participants were 551 African American undergraduates from either a predominantly white university (PWU) or a historically black university (HBU). Race-based rejection sensitivity (RS-Race) predicted higher negative affect and lower forgiveness for the perpetrator. Social constraints predicted higher negative affect and (marginally) lower forgiveness. There was also an interaction between social constraints and RS-Race: RS-Race was strongly negatively related to positive affect and forgiveness among participants with low social constraints but essentially unrelated among those with high social constraints. Thought intrusions (that might prolong the memory of the prejudicial event) also mediated the effects of RS-Race and social constraints on negative affect and forgiveness. The results document how individual differences are associated with reactions to being the target of racial discrimination in day-to-day interactions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Discursive framing and the reproduction of integration in the public sphere: A comparative analysis of France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Germany
AN  - 1448998010; 201342869
AB  - In this article we present a cross-national comparison of the discursive framing of political claims on Muslims and Islam in four European countries. We explore these issues empirically and relate the cross-national differences found in the data to a diverging logic in the different integration debates. We argue that persistent variations in discursive framing can be understood by looking at the unique conceptualisation of group categorisation and distinction used in the national integration debates. It is, furthermore, argued that these discursive and symbolic trends do not relate directly to observed differences in integration policies.

T1  - POSTCOLONIAL GIRL
AN  - 1364702212; 201323606
AB  - In October 2010, Gamu Nhengu, a Zimbabwean teenager, was ejected from the popular British reality TV talent show, The X Factor, on which she was a contestant. There was a public backlash to what many perceived as an unjust eviction. Within days, however, Gamu became the emblem of a contrasting kind of eviction campaign, when it was revealed that she and her family were living illegally in Britain. 'Gamu-gate', as the case was named in the press, animated a wave of public anger and resistance, as the stakes were raised from eviction from a TV talent show to deportation from the United Kingdom. In this essay we explore Gamu-gate as a way of thinking about postcolonial intimacies. We do this by setting out three key notions: mediated intimacy, postcolonial girlhood and migrant audibility. Our aim is to explore the political possibilities of the 'affective surplus' produced by 'postcolonial girls' -- that is, how as 'manufactured intimates' they potentially create avenues for new forms of postcolonial migrant audibility, forms which might trouble the 'current emergencies' and neocolonial logic of neoliberal capitalism.

T1  - The Influence of Family Dynamics on Ethnic Identity Among Adult Latinas
AN  - 1448997168; 201342883
AB  - The literature on the development of ethnic identity within the young adult years and during childhood is plentiful. There is less research that examines how this development continues beyond young adult or college years. Research suggests that major life events experienced in adulthood could cause individuals to enter a period of identity reconstruction, yet little is known about this process. Because family and/or familism has been established as an important aspect of Latinos' identities and lived experiences, this study seeks to examine the dimensions around family dynamics and their potential influences on ethnic identity development processes among adult Latinas. Findings indicate that Latinas often make sense of their ethnic identity when major life events associated with family dynamics occur; such as marriage, childbearing, and negotiating relationships with family members as culture is being transmitted across several generations. These findings have implications for understanding adult education students as well as considering the influence of education on the family dynamics of Latinas. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Studying Migrants with the Help of the Internet: Methods from Psychology
AN  - 1347781077; 201318881
AB  - The article describes how the Internet can be used for research both with migrants and on the psychological impressions others have of migrants. Internet-based research methods are currently one of the hot fields in methodology. Though Internet-based research has only a brief history -- around 15 years -- the field has seen a massive increase in the number of studies conducted on the Internet, and the collection of tools with which to conduct Internet-based research. This development demonstrates a grass-roots change in how research in the behavioural and social sciences is often conducted. In our paper, we use the example of examining social networking Web pages (in terms both of its quantitative and its qualitative aspects) for markers of biculturalism in migrants to illustrate how this type of investigation can be a fruitful avenue for researchers in the area.

T1  - CONTESTING THE RACIAL DIVISION OF LABOR FROM BELOW
AN  - 1551000462; 201429074
AB  - Popular discourse and academic scholarship both accent divisions between African American and immigrant workers. These debates most often focus on the question of job competition, positioning African Americans and immigrant workers as a priori adversaries in the labor market. We take a different tack. Drawing upon a case study of hotel workers in Chicago, we identify ways in which workers themselves challenge and bridge these divisions. Specifically, we reveal how union organizing activities, such as diverse committee representation and inclusion of diversity language in contracts, counter notions of intergroup competition in an effort to build common cause that affirms rather than denies differences. We argue that these activities represent political efforts on the part of workers to contest and even reshape the racial and ethnic division of labor, thereby revealing competition as a socially contingent and politically mediated process.

T1  - Ismail Besikci as a Discomforting Intellectual
AN  - 1504422333; 201405548
AB  - The Turkish sociologist Ismail Besikci is one of the most prominent and exceptional intellectuals of the twentieth century. Although being ethnically Turkish, he is the first and foremost social scientist who studied the Kurdish Question of modern Turkey. During the 1960s, when the Turkish state, popular media, and universities denied systematically even the existence of Kurdish identities, cultures, and languages, Besikci spoke out about their existence. Since then, he has been persistently speaking truths about the Kurdish reality to Turkish authorities and defending the collective as well as individual rights of Kurds. For Besikci, the Kurdish Question is an ethnic question. Kurds have been oppressed, massacred, and subjected to forced migrations from their homelands, all because of their resistance to various efforts of forced assimilation. The Turkish Kurds did not accept becoming Turks (meaning, to accept being a 'Turk', to speak Turkish fluently and conversely, not to speak Kurdish -- plus being proud of all these things). In regards to the Kurdish Question, most Turkish intellectuals and social scientists have sided with the Turkish state and have supported its official ideology, which has been built upon official lies and fictional history. The impact of Kemalist ideology on the Turkish literate is so deeply rooted that even the 'Turkish left generally sides with the state during various critical moments'. They have generally considered the Kurdish uprisings to represent a reflection of feudal remains, reactionary-Islamist ideas, or deceitful traps of imperialist world powers trying to divide the Turkish Republic. In this kind of environment where the official ideology has been protected by laws, armed forces, and the intellectual establishment, Besikci made public some simple and fundamental ontological truths concerning the existence of the Kurds and of Kurdish identities rooted in a customary and communal tradition. Against the enclosure of this basic information and the axiomatic truths articulated by the state, he made these issues into more common knowledge through his writings, teachings, and public speeches. Not surprisingly, the state and the political and intellectual establishment made him pay a tremendous cost for his life's work. Over the course of his lifetime, he was not only fired from various university posts, but has spent more than seventeen years in prison. This article analyzes Besikci's intellectual formation in the context of Turkish social sciences and political thought and of Turkish state policies towards the Kurds.

T1  - Intergroup contact, attitudes toward homosexuality, and the role of acceptance of gender non-conformity in young adolescents
AN  - 1492601233; 201400989
AB  - This study explored how contact with gay and lesbian persons affects adolescents' attitudes toward them, and whether this association is mediated or moderated by one's acceptance of gender non-conformity. We analyzed survey responses from 456 Dutch adolescents aged 12-15 who reported having no same-sex attractions. Data were collected in 2008 at 8 schools in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Preliminary analyses showed that contact with lesbian/gay persons outside of school was positively associated with attitudes toward lesbians and gay men. Multilevel analyses showed that acceptance of gender non-conformity mediated rather than moderated the relationship between intergroup contact and sexual prejudice in males. The effect of intergroup contact on females' attitudes toward lesbian women was no longer significant in multilevel analyses. The findings suggest that attention to both intergroup contact and acceptance of gender non-conformity would enhance our understanding of attitudes toward homosexuality in adolescents.

T1  - The Iconic Ghetto
AN  - 1023026619; 201223768
AB  - In the minds of many Americans, the ghetto is where "the black people live," symbolizing an impoverished, crime-prone, drug-infested, and violent area of the city. Aided by the mass media and popular culture, this image of the ghetto has achieved an iconic status, and serves as a powerful source of stereotype, prejudice, and discrimination. The history of racism in America, along with the ascription of "ghetto" to anonymous blacks, has burdened blacks with a negative presumption they must disprove before they can establish mutually trusting relationships with others. The poorest blacks occupy a caste-like status, and for the black middle class, contradictions and dilemmas of status are common, underscoring the racial divide and exacerbating racial tensions.

T1  - Minority Influence in Virtual Groups: A Comparison of Four Theories of Minority Influence
AN  - 1023030898; 201223784
AB  - This study examined minority influence within virtual groups and how members' geographic dispersion and argument consistency affect group decisions. Competing predictions were derived from several theories that were applicable but untested in the domain of online interaction: a double minority effect, the black sheep effect, congruity theory applied to groups, and the minority leniency contract framework. Online groups were created that had 4 collocated members or 4 geographically distributed members, or 2 collocated and 2 isolated members. Group members were provided biased distributions of information resembling a hidden profile to facilitate majority and minority positions resulting in 24 groups with a minority opinion holder geographically isolated or in proximity with one or more other members. The patterns of minority members' influence on majority members' decisions lent greatest support to the black sheep effect, congruity, and minority leniency approaches, depending on the respective location of the minority opinion holders and the consistency with which they argued their positions.

T1  - The erosive effects of racism: Reduced self-control mediates the relation between perceived racial discrimination and substance use in African American adolescents
AN  - 1347786105; 201318743
AB  - Perceived racial discrimination, self-control, anger, and either substance use or use cognitions were assessed in 2 studies conducted with samples of African American adolescents. The primary goal was to examine the relation between discrimination and self-control over time; a 2nd goal was to determine whether that relation mediates the link between discrimination and substance use found in previous research. Study 1, which included a latent growth curve analysis with 3 waves of data, indicated that experience with discrimination (from age 10 years to age 18 years) was associated with reduced self-control, which then predicted increased substance use. Additional analyses indicated anger was also a mediator of this discrimination to use relation. Study 2, which was experimental, showed that envisioning an experience involving discrimination was associated with an increase in substance-related responses to double entendre words (e.g., pot, roach) in a word association task, especially for participants who were low in dispositional self-control. The effect was again mediated by reports of anger. Thus, the "double mediation" pattern was discrimination -- more anger and reduced self-control -- increased substance use and/or substance cognitions. Results are discussed in terms of the long-term impact of discrimination on self-control and health behavior. Implications for interventions aimed at ameliorating the negative effects of discrimination and low self-control on health are also discussed. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Education and Cultural Integration among Ethnic Minorities and Natives in The Netherlands: A Test of the Integration Paradox
AN  - 1347781758; 201318927
AB  - This contribution sets out to identify the main determinants of two attitudinal indicators of cultural integration that figure in the construction of acculturation strategies: opposition toward ethnically mixed relationships and identification with the origin country. We derive our expectations from Social Identity Theory on the direct and indirect effects of education. To test our hypotheses we use data from the Survey on the Integration of Minorities 2006 (SIM 2006) and apply multiple mediator models. SIM 2006 covers random samples from the four largest ethnic-minority groups in the Netherlands-Turks, Moroccans, Surinamese and Antilleans-and a native Dutch comparison group. We do not consistently observe the presumed negative effect of education on opposition toward ethnically mixed relationships and identification with the origin country among ethnic minorities. On the contrary, the presumed beneficial impact of education on cultural integration is absent for second-generation migrants, which is considered to be evidence of an integration paradox.

T1  - Network Resources and the Political Engagement of Migrant Organisations in Milan
AN  - 1347781364; 201318870
AB  - This article analyses the political engagement of immigrant organisations in Milan. Theoretically, I discuss three types of resource which may affect this engagement: institutional, group-related and network resources. By using data on 46 immigrant organisations, I examine the role of network resources and how they affect the contacts that immigrant organisations build with Italian political institutions. The study shows that networks among organisations increase the number of political contacts organisations build. However, not all links are significant. While links with autochthonous organisations are relevant, links with immigrant ones are not. Comparing my results with the literature developed in other contexts, I suggest that the political context may affect the type of organisational structure which develops and the network resources with which immigrant organisations are endowed. In contexts where ethnic differences are recognised, immigrant organisations seem to have enough resources to organise and act autonomously in the political sphere. In contrast, where social organisation around ethnicity is not encouraged, immigrant organisations' possibilities for mobilisation seem to derive from resources mediated by autochthonous organisations which largely prevail in the field of immigration.

T1  - Bright Minds and Dark Attitudes: Lower Cognitive Ability Predicts Greater Prejudice Through Right-Wing Ideology and Low Intergroup Contact
AN  - 1322721284; 201310693
AB  - Despite their important implications for interpersonal behaviors and relations, cognitive abilities have been largely ignored as explanations of prejudice. We proposed and tested mediation models in which lower cognitive ability predicts greater prejudice, an effect mediated through the endorsement of right-wing ideologies (social conservatism, right-wing authoritarianism) and low levels of contact with out-groups. In an analysis of two large-scale, nationally representative United Kingdom data sets (N = 15,874), we found that lower general intelligence (g) in childhood predicts greater racism in adulthood, and this effect was largely mediated via conservative ideology. A secondary analysis of a U.S. data set confirmed a predictive effect of poor abstract-reasoning skills on antihomosexual prejudice, a relation partially mediated by both authoritarianism and low levels of intergroup contact. All analyses controlled for education and socioeconomic status. Our results suggest that cognitive abilities play a critical, albeit underappreciated, role in prejudice. Consequently, we recommend a heightened focus on cognitive ability in research on prejudice and a better integration of cognitive ability into prejudice models. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Australia, the Feminist Nation? Discourses of Gender, 'Culture' and Nation in the 'K Brothers' Gang Rapes
AN  - 1364705092; 201323416
AB  - This paper examines the discourses of gender and nation that circulated in relation to a series of highly mediatised Australian gang rapes. The rapes, which took place in the suburbs of Sydney in the early 2000s, were widely reported as involving 'young Muslim men' raping 'Australian girls'. These rapes and the legal trials that followed created two dominant responses. First, there was a generalised debate about the need for greater protection of women's rights within the Australian legal system. Second, there was an intense questioning of the merits of multiculturalism. Bizarrely the two issues frequently became intertwined within popular discourses, with the language of 'women's rights' pitted against the rhetoric of 'cultural tolerance'. Focusing on the final set of rapes (and trials) involving the 'K Brothers', this paper explores the reasons for this intertwining. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Pearly Whites: Minstrelsy's Connection To Contemporary Rap Music
AN  - 1221406526; 201244107
AB  - When North Carolina-based rap group Little Brother released "The Minstrel Show" in 2005, it served for many as an appropriate metaphor to what many felt rap music was becoming. Or was it metaphor at all? Perhaps the most important implication taken from Little Brother's work is that minstrelsy of hip-hop is not an arbitrary process, but is something done to maintain white supremacy by America's corporate media elite. Additionally, in using minstrelsy as the frame of reference, Little Brother positions this as a historical continuum of how blacks have been portrayed in other moments of time in America. My work explores what quantitative and qualitative evidence exists to make the connections that Little Brother suggests with "The Minstrel Show?" The question at the center of this research project is: What are the ways that contemporary rap music mirrors historical patterns of minstrel performance in America? My examination found that modern rap music not only shared many historical parallels with minstrel performance, but perhaps should be dc-categorized as separate from hip-hop music altogether. I support this analysis by studying the content from video selections on Black Entertainment Television's "Rap City." "Rap City" airs from 4-5 pm central standard time, Monday through Friday. My work contains analysis of 40 episodes from September and November of 2006. Video is my medium of choice because its visual signifiers can provide for a more sound analysis than music on the radio alone. Additionally, these shows can speak more to national trends than local radio can. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Global capitalism and twenty-first century fascism: a US case study
AN  - 1010632186; 201210589
AB  - This seminal article analyses the current structural crisis and instability in an ever more polarised world in relation to earlier systemic crises that were resolved through fascism or through Fordist-Keynesian 'class compromise' (the 1930s) and the emergence of capitalist globalisation (the 1970s). The authors identify three basic responses to the crisis: popular insurgency from below; reformist stabilisation from above; and, a twenty-first century neo-fascism. Looking specifically at the US, they analyse political and economic developments that demonstrate fascistic characteristics. While no simple replication of the past, the emergence of a Christian Right since the mid-1980s, the growth of certain currents within the Tea Party movement, the sharp increase in violent hate groups, the spread of a vicious anti-immigrant movement, the psychopathology of white decline, sharp militarisation and pervasive policing give some indications of the rise of fascist tendencies. But what is crucial today is the sophistication of such a project, made possible by the ideological domination of media together with new surveillance and social control technologies that allow it to rely more on selective than generalised repression. In calling for a co-ordinated fightback, both in the US and beyond, the authors see the only viable solution to the crisis of global capitalism as a massive redistribution of wealth and power downward towards the poor majority of humanity, along the lines of a twenty-first century democratic socialism.

T1  - Rapping to Represent and Resist: Language, Lyrics, and Young Haitian Males in Early Quebec Hip-Hop
AN  - 1283639640; 201303419
AB  - This article analyzes lyrical language use that was employed as a means of resistance in early Quebecois hip-hop, focusing on to what extent young Haitians and others used rapped language in order to resist, represent, and empower themselves. Our analysis examines a few brief lyrical examples from popular songs that highlighted the daily social realities of Haitian and other ethnocultural youth during the late 1990s and early 2000s, when hip-hop music first grew in prestige and importance in Quebec. We chose to look at a few songs and groups that received massive airplay and recognition on Musique Plus (a music television station that is immensely popular in the province) and by music critics, as these sorts of mass exposure provided hip-hop artists an enormous platform in which to introduce and discuss issues that would otherwise remain ignored by the majority culture. To commence this investigation, we must first consider how hip-hop music has been used in the past as a medium in which to reflect upon and voice the many complexities and challenges of urban life.

T1  - The relationship between neighborhood racial concentration and verbal ability: An investigation using the institutional resources model
AN  - 887496667; 201118079
AB  - Relatively few studies examine the relationship between racial residential segregation and educational or cognitive outcomes. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and the institutional resources model of neighborhood effects, I investigate one account of how macrostructural arrangements between race, neighborhood segregation, and school quality interact to produce inequalities in test scores. Consistent with the institutional resources model, results suggest that school quality varies across neighborhoods based, in part, on their degree of racial concentration. Indeed, school quality and other school characteristics mediate the relationship between racial concentration and verbal skills, particularly among black males. These findings have implications not only for inequalities in cognitive skills among blacks across residential space, but also between blacks and whites given high levels of residential segregation in the United States. In sum, findings illustrate yet another way in which residential segregation contributes to, and not merely reflects, racial inequalities. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Daily Encounters Between Hans and Uyghurs in Xinjiang: Sinicization, Integration or Segregation?
AN  - 887499780; 201118086
AB  - In September 2009, the Information Office of the State Council of the People's Republic of China claimed that Xinjiang benefits from respect and harmony between the ethnic groups. This rhetoric is faithfully propagated by national media: they uniformly praise the unity amongst the Han and Uyghurs through the common slogans of minzu tuanjie (ethnic unity) and hexie guanxi (harmonious relations). Going beyond the official documents and propaganda, my purpose is to explore the relations between these two ethnic groups. I will focus on the ideas, words and actions of Han and Uyghur young people living in Urumqi who are often under-represented in official sources, or other forms of written and scholarly discourse. While comparing their behaviour, I argue that ethnic disharmony between Hans and Uyghurs exists, but it is simplistic to blame only the Chinese government or one of the ethnic groups, and naive to ask what China can do to solve the problem. Instead, by exploring what the social agents in the young educated society in Xinjiang truly think of ethnic relations between them and the "other," this paper presents a comprehensive picture of the issue. My ethnographic research interprets how people remember, interpret and sometimes exaggerate their ethnic traditions and cultural practices in daily life in relation to the other ethnic group. The findings demonstrate how young people are determining the course of ethnic relations by constructing movable social barriers that result in segregation between them, raising doubts about the future possibilities for ethnic harmony.

T1  - Black Mega-Churches in the Internet Age: Exploring Theological Teachings and Social Outreach Efforts
AN  - 1364699985; 201323483
AB  - The research on Black mega-churches has been limited at best. To date, little is known about theological teachings of Black mega-churches. Other primary characteristics of Black mega-churches are even less understood, e.g., how these institutions promote their theological teachings online. Consequently, in this study, Black mega-church websites constitute a data source for examining links between theological teachings and community needs. Specifically, this qualitative study of Internet-mediated research examines the websites of 12 Black mega-churches via content analyses of sermons and information regarding various outreach programs found on their web pages. Results indicate four broad theological themes: honoring the Holy Spirit, heavenly minded, Biblical principles, and social legacy. The findings reveal that these themes were related to the social outreach efforts of the 12 Black mega-churches. Research implications for future studies of Black mega-churches are discussed.

T1  - Mobile phone parenting: Reconfiguring relationships between Filipina migrant mothers and their left-behind children
AN  - 907927901; 201124725
AB  - The Philippines is an intensely migrant society with an annual migration of one million people, leading to over a tenth of the population working abroad. Many of these emigrants are mothers who often have children left behind. Family separation is now recognized as one of the social costs of migration affecting the global south. Relationships within such transnational families depend on long-distance communication and there is an increasing optimism among Filipino government agencies and telecommunications companies about the consequences of mobile phones for transnational families. This article draws on comparative research with UK-based Filipina migrants -- mainly domestic workers and nurses -- and their left-behind children in the Philippines. Our methodology allowed us to directly compare the experience of mothers and their children. The article concludes that while mothers feel empowered that the phone has allowed them to partially reconstruct their role as parents, their children are significantly more ambivalent about the consequences of transnational communication.

T1  - Social Stigma, Social Capital Reconstruction, and Rural Migrants in Urban China: A Population Health Perspective
AN  - 875717043; 201115283
AB  - In this study, we examine migrant stigma and its effect on social capital reconstruction among rural migrants who possess legal rural residence but live and work in urban China. After a review of the concepts of stigma and social capital, we report data collected through in-depth interviews with 40 rural migrant workers and 38 urban residents recruited from Beijing, China. Findings from this study indicate that social stigma against rural migrants is common in urban China and is reinforced through media, social institutions and their representatives, and day-to-day interactions. As an important part of discrimination, stigma against migrant workers creates inequality, undermines trust, and reduces opportunities for interpersonal interactions between migrants and urban residents. Through these social processes, social stigma interferes with the reconstruction of social capital (including bonding, bridging, and linking social capital) for individual rural migrants as well as for their communities. The interaction between stigma and social capital reconstruction may present as a mechanism by which migration leads to negative health consequences. Results from this study underscore the need for taking measures against migrant stigma and alternatively work toward social capital reconstruction for health promotion and disease prevention among this population.

T1  - Socio-Demographic Determinants of Language Transition among the Children of French- and Spanish-Caribbean Immigrants in the US
AN  - 870432579; 201114317
AB  - In this study, language transition among the children of Caribbean immigrants in the US is examined from two main perspectives. First, speeds of language transition among children in French- and Spanish-Caribbean immigrant families are compared. Second, the mediating roles of socio-demographic factors and sibling characteristics in language transition are also examined. The results reveal that, with increasing assimilation, children in French-Caribbean families experience a faster transition to English monolingualism than their counterparts with Spanish-Caribbean parents. Transition to English monolingualism is also negatively associated with the number of first-generation siblings within a household. However, increases in the number of second- and first-generation monolingual-English siblings significantly shift children's language use towards complete Anglicisation. Instructively, this impact offsets the influence which ethnically endogamous parents have on the retention of the mother-tongue within immigrant families. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Race, Racial Resentment, Attentiveness to the News Media, and Public Opinion Toward the Jena Six
AN  - 862596171; 201109644
AB  - Objective. We outline the role of race, racial resentment, and attentiveness to news in structuring public opinion toward the prosecution of the Jena Six, the name given to six African-American high school students who beat a white student, five of whom were subsequently charged with attempted second-degree murder. Method. We rely on a telephone survey of 428 registered voters collected in the aftermath of the protests in Jena, Louisiana. Results. Public reactions were heavily filtered by race and associated with measures of racial resentment. African Americans followed news about the protests more closely, believed race was the most important consideration in the decision to prosecute, and believed the decision to prosecute was the wrong decision. Racially conservative white respondents were less likely to believe race was the most important consideration in the decision to prosecute and were more likely to believe that the decision to prosecute was the right decision. Consistent with theories of agenda setting and framing, attentiveness to the news influenced perceptions regarding the importance of race in the decision to prosecute but not whether the decision was the right decision. Conclusions. At least within the context of the Deep South, race and racial attitudes continue to be an important predictor of public reactions to racially charged events. Attentiveness to the news influenced the lens through which events were interpreted, but not perceptions of whether the outcome was the right decision. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Unpacking Multiculturalism in the Classroom: Using Current Events to Explore the Politics of Difference
AN  - 1429627393; 201335723
AB  - The content of this paper stems from an interactive workshop conducted by its authors at the 2nd Joint Annual Conference of the Association for Canadian Studies and the Canadian Ethnic Studies Association in the fall of 2011. As the conference theme was "Revisiting 40 Years of Multicultural Policy in Canada," the goal of the workshop was to bridge the gap between theory and practice by demonstrating how to bring multiculturalism into the classroom through discussion of current events documented in the media; despite the recognition of multiculturalism as the foundation of national identity in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the greatest challenge for teachers remains how to incorporate the concept into their teaching practice. In examining how multiculturalism has evolved to become more inclusive since its implementation as federal policy-having been broadened from focusing only on race and ethnicity to a range of human differences, all of which have political and pedagogical ramifications in the classroom and beyond-participants in the workshop were encouraged to question how the privileges enjoyed by groups that represent the norm in society factored into recent Canadian and American news events. Six recent media reports were selected in order to facilitate a discussion that allowed for the "unpacking" of a particular component of identity, in relation to either race, gender, class, sexual orientation, (dis)ability, or religion.

T1  - Ethnic Minorities in the Mass Media: How Migrants Perceive Their Representation in Swiss Public Television
AN  - 964199354; 201207514
AB  - Communication research highlights deficiencies in the media's representation of migrants. The study at hand analyzes these deficiencies from the perspective of the migrants concerned: How do they perceive their representation in the media, especially on television? And how do they assess the perceived situation with regard to immigrant integration? This topic has been examined in a qualitative pilot study based on six group discussions amongst migrants and Swiss citizens with an immigration background in the German-, French-, and Italian-speaking parts of Switzerland. The results show a high discrepancy between the desire for more presence and participation on the one hand, and the wish to stand in the spotlight less often, on the other hand.

T1  - The construction of the image of immigrants and ethnic minorities in two Portuguese daily newspapers
AN  - 925712457; 201204093
AB  - This article summarises a research project in communication, culture and information technologies, the object of study being the construction of the image of immigrants and ethnic minorities in the Portuguese press. A comparative analysis between two newspapers -- Publico and Correio da Manh -- was conducted, with each newspaper representing a different kind of journalism: one viewed as serious, the other as popular. We found that while immigration and ethnicity phenomena are important realities of Portuguese society, they are still perceived as threats by the popular press, while in the serious press we observed a greater interest in the social and political contextualisation of these phenomena and a more elaborate discourse.

T1  - Blackness, Animation, and the Politics of Black Fatherhood in The Cleveland Show
AN  - 758121992; 201056891
AB  - In 2008, presidential candidate Barack Obama gave a Father's Day speech in which he called for fathers to actively participate in their family's lives. Obama's remarks were taken by civil rights leader Jesse Jackson to be a moral chastisement of African Americans. Following Obama's speech, Jackson was filmed making inappropriate remarks about Obama's supposed intent and his desire to castrate the presidential hopeful. In the midst of the media firestorm surrounding Jackson's remarks, African American animator Layron DeJarnette took the occasion to lampoon Jackson. Foregrounding this debacle is a mass-mediated negotiation of what it means to depict and negotiate representations of the black family in popular culture. In this paper, I examine connections between blackface minstrelsy, animation, and televised representations of the black family. I look specifically at The Cleveland Show, the Fox Network's animated series depicting an African American family. I argue that the show lampoons blackness through a racial discourse while troubling black fatherhood through a sexual discourse. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Multilingual Cosmopolitanism and Monolingual Commodification: Language Ideologies in Transnational Salsa Communities
AN  - 852900546; 201103384
AB  - Salsa, a global urban music and dance phenomenon, is an interesting example for the emergence of transnational cultural spheres. Salsa has its roots in the Americas and in many Salsa communities outside of Latin America, the Spanish language is seen as the authentic means of expression. However, attitudes to multilingualism can differ strongly from Salsa community to Salsa community. In this paper, the Salsa-scene of Sydney is introduced with its various stances towards multilingualism. These are connected to different styles of the dance, where one style is practiced in English only, while dancers of another style are often bilingual speakers of Spanish and English. Monolingualism and multilingualism here mediate the affiliation to different local scenes. Simultaneously, both language ideologies relate to different global discourses of competitive and cosmopolitan culture. It will be asked whether the introduced language ideologies challenge traditional frameworks of society and reified discursive concepts of language.

T1  - Thinking Globally, Acting Locally: Northern Ugandan Women and The Open Cage
AN  - 862596290; 201109666
AB  - As conflicts across and within national borders persist, so does violence against women as a tool of war. Transnational efforts to promote peace received a momentous boost when the United Nations Security Council passed resolutions 1325 and 1820, in 2000 and 2008 respectively. UNSCR 1325 called for women to have a fuller pretence in decision making processes related to conflict and peace, while UNSCR 1820 categorized violence against women as a war crime. In 2008 the International Women's Tribune Centre (IWTC) collaborated with women and women's organizations in northern Uganda to write a radio drama entitled The Open Cage to demonstrate the presence of violence against women and to position UNSCRs 1325 and 1820 as global resources for local resistance. Using theories of transnational feminism, globalization from below, and dialogue, I explore gendered connections the radio drama constructs between transnational issues and local phenomena. Situated in the context of conflict and peace-building, the radio dramas and UNSCRs 1325 and 1820 contribute to a gendered orthodoxy. From this analysis, future directions for moving beyond gendered assumptions and promoting dialogue are proposed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Media and the Israeli disability rights legislation: Progress or mixed and contradictory images
AN  - 758124374; 201057085
AB  - This article reviews and analyzes disability rights conceptualization and policy as reflected in the Israeli media after the enactment of the Equal Rights for Persons with Disabilities Law of 1998. Media coverage is examined through review of studies conducted on the subject in Israel. A comprehensive review of the research literature reveals a discrepancy between the purposes of anti-discrimination legislation and policy and media reflections of disability, in which portrayal is primarily via a deviance lens. The discussion is based on the analysis of universal genesis of negative perceptions of disability, as well as on particularized culture bound meaning of disability within the Israeli symbolic framework.

T1  - Vixen Resistin': Redefining Black Womanhood in Hip-Hop Music Videos
AN  - 818800143; 201071579
AB  - In recent years, scholarship on Black womanhood has become more closely connected to postmodern discourses on identity and resistance, following in the footsteps of Audre Lorde's claim that identity and sexuality have emancipatory potential. However, in the post-hip-hop era, feminists and media critics have once again brought up the idea of who controls the image. The purpose of this study is to describe possible sites of self-definition by Black women in music videos while accounting for the cultural industries that reproduce and exploit Black women's sexuality. Using textual analysis and the perspective of a noted music video performer, Melyssa Ford, this study articulates the expanse of ambiguity that lies between the images of Black womanhood that bombard consumers of BET and MTV and the self-conceptualization of the women who play those roles.

T1  - The Role of Historical Knowledge in Perception of Race-Based Conspiracies
AN  - 868013659; 201112974
AB  - We test the hypothesis that knowledge of historically documented, anti-black conspiracies affects perceived plausibility of new, anti-black conspiracies. In Experiment 1 (N = 78), African Americans and European Americans read about a current conspiracy aimed at undermining either African American or European American elected officials. African Americans perceived the anti-black conspiracy as more plausible and the conspiracy informant as more credible than did European Americans. The difference in perception of informant credibility was mediated by recognition of historically documented, anti-black conspiracies. In Experiment 2, we manipulated European Americans (N = 105) exposure to information about historically documented, anti-black conspiracies. European Americans who learned about actual, past anti-black conspiracies perceived new anti-black conspiracies as more plausible than did European Americans who learned about race-silent conspiracies or who did not learn about conspiracies. To the extent that European Americans lack awareness of incidents of racism in US history, they are likely to underestimate the possibility that racism impacts contemporary events.

T1  - Investigating Differences in Public Support for Gay Rights Issues
AN  - 754039630; 201049791
AB  - Public opinion surrounding two of the most well-known gay rights issues--same-sex marriage and adoption by gays and lesbians--varies widely: About 30% of the public favors same-sex marriage, while about 50% favors adoption. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the demographic variables that predict attitudes toward same-sex marriage and adoption by gays and lesbians. Political ideology and attendance at religious services emerged as the strongest predictors. However, a close examination of the two issues shows that there were important differences between them. These differences may aid gay rights advocates in crafting media campaigns designed to increase support for same-sex marriage. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Does a common ingroup identity reduce intergroup threat?
AN  - 754037940; 201049577
AB  - Intergroup threat is regarded as a cause of negative outgroup attitudes; however, little research has attempted to examine ways of reducing intergroup threat. Two studies examine the effectiveness of a superordinate identity for reducing intergroup threat. It was predicted that when two groups were aware of a shared identity, intergroup threat would be lowered and attitudes would become more positive. In Study 1, perceptions of common identities among Black and White students were related to decreases in intergroup threat and increases in positive outgroup attitudes. In Study 2, when their shared identity as Americans was made salient, Democrats and Republicans experienced less threat and more positive outgroup attitudes compared to when political party identities alone were salient. In both studies, intergroup threat acted as a mediator of the relationship between common identity and outgroup attitudes, suggesting that a common identity increases positive outgroup attitudes by first reducing intergroup threat.

T1  - 'Many Nice People': the nation-state, post-Fordism, and the policy norm of flexible ethnic relations in Estonia
AN  - 743055515; 201043245
AB  - This article uses historical research and ethnographic fieldwork to ask how policymakers interpret historical, political, and economic factors to construct inter-ethnic communities that would bring security and economic growth to an enlarged European Union (EU). Focusing on post-Soviet Estonia's ethnic integration policy, the article argues that 'flexibility' applies not only to post-Fordist, individualized subjects, but also to relations between subjects of different nationalities that policymakers want to form organically in service sector employment. The article explains how this policy construction emerged in light of Estonia's historical trajectory from 1991 to 2001 and demonstrates how it conceptually resolved the fundamental tension between the territorialized nation-state and deterritorialized global capitalism. A visual media campaign entitled 'Many Nice People: Integrating Estonia' captured the essence of this construction, which obscured how the Estonian nation-state marginalized minorities while integrating into the EU.

T1  - From running amok to eating dogs: a century of misrepresenting Filipino Americans in Hawai'i
AN  - 743049542; 201031755
AB  - This article reviews and analyses historical and contemporary processes of the racist representation of Filipino Americans in Hawai'i. Historically, it discusses the causes and consequences of the extreme over-representation of Filipino men among those executed from 1900 until 1944. In contemporary terms, it examines how the news media, ethnic joke telling and the 'local literature' of Hawai'i reinforce stigmatizing stereotypes of Filipino Americans. While some of these stereotypes are new, others have been revived from the pre-Second World War era. The factors that explain why Filipino Americans have been subject to extremely denigrating stereotypes include their continuing subordinate status and the considerable proportion of immigrants among them, which result in their being associated with especially perverse and 'barbaric' activities, such as running amok and eating dogs, that are common in the Philippines as a seemingly culturally underdeveloped nation.

T1  - Ethnic Environment During Childhood and the Educational Attainment of Immigrant Children in Sweden
AN  - 743045979; 201031584
AB  - We ask whether ethnic residential segregation influences the future educational careers of children of immigrants in Sweden. We use a dataset comprising a cohort of children who finished compulsory school in 1995 (n = 6,560). We follow these children retrospectively to 1990 to measure neighborhood characteristics during late childhood, and prospectively through 2003 to measure the number of years of education attained thus far. The largest immigrant groups came from Finland, Turkey, former Yugoslavia, Iran and Chile. Our empirical analysis reveals that immigrant children who grow up in neighborhoods with many young co-ethnics who have limited educational resources, obtain relatively low average grades from compulsory school, and on average, do not attain the same levels of education as do immigrant children who grow up elsewhere. For a minority of immigrant children who lived in neighborhoods with educationally successful young co-ethnics, we find a positive effect of growing up in an ethnic enclave. Also in this case, the effect of the ethnic environment on future educational attainment is mediated by school results in compulsory school. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'The Others Don't Want ...'. Small-Scale Segregation: Hegemonic Public Discourses and Racial Boundaries in German Neighbourhoods
AN  - 60335974; 201011921
AB  - This paper examines the interplay between hegemonic discourses on segregation and small-scale segregation in neighbourhoods. In the German mass media, segregation is mainly discussed in the context of so-called 'problematic neighbourhoods'. Thereby the discourse concentrates on cultural differences and blames immigrants for building parallel societies instead of integrating into German society. However, boundaries in neighbourhoods are often due to racialised stereotypes rather than differences in cultural practice. Small-scale segregation is not necessarily related to migration or cultural differences but corresponds to racialised images of who is perceived as German and who is not. Qualitative interviews with White German residents of three neighbourhoods in Berlin indicate that the discourse about 'problematic neighbourhoods' in itself furthers small-scale segregation and racialised stereotypes in neighbourhoods. Instead of interpreting small-scale segregation as immigrants' lack of will to integrate into German society, I suggest Bourdieu's concept of Habitus and social space as an explanation for boundaries in neighbourhoods.
