T1  - Professional preference for mental illness: The role of contact, empathy, and stigma in Spanish Social Work undergraduates
AN  - 2673562969
AB  - The treatment of the mentally ill people is a challenge across the world, and different professionals, such as doctors, social workers, psychologists, or nurses, take care of this group. Nonetheless, mental health is not a vocational sector preferred by students and professionals of many of these careers. Research has proposed that professional preference for a patient group would be positively influenced by intergroup contact (quantity and quality) and empathy (perspective‐taking), and negatively associated with intergroup anxiety and social distance. However, the evidence testing this proposal was partial and mainly referring to other patient groups such as minorities or immigrants. The major aim of this cross‐sectional study was to clarify two research questions referring to mentally ill persons: Do contact and empathy protect undergraduates from intergroup anxiety and social distance and promote professional preference? Do intergroup anxiety and social distance predict professional preference and mediate the influence of contact and empathy in professional preference? A convenience sample of 409 Social Work undergraduates (81% females) from three Spanish universities completed a questionnaire between February and June 2020. Concerning direct relationships, the structural equation model showed that the quantity of contact only predicted intergroup anxiety negatively; quality of contact and empathy negatively predicted intergroup anxiety and social distance; intergroup anxiety positively predicted social distance; intergroup anxiety and social distance negatively predicted professional preference. Concerning mediated relationships, the influence of quality of contact and empathy on social distance was mediated by intergroup anxiety; social distance mediated the relationship of intergroup anxiety with professional preference; both anxiety and distance mediated the influence of quality of contact and empathy in professional preference. These results encourage interventions aimed at enhancing professional preference for mental illness by improving contact, knowledge, and empathy and reducing stigma in students and workers from diverse mental health careers.

T1  - Older adults’ experiences of social distancing and the role of the community center during COVID-19
AN  - 2680176424
AB  - Purpose>Although very much needed from an infection control perspective, there is deep concern about the impact of social distancing during COVID-19, particularly on older adults.Design/methodology/approach>A phenomenological design was used to gain insight into older adults’ experiences of living with social distancing during the first wave of COVID-19. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight older adults.Findings>Six themes were identified: a smaller life, feelings of unease, resilience, connection to the community centre, technology: a boon, but one with limitations, and the way through social distancing.Originality/value>This study captures older adults’ experiences early in COVID-19. Findings indicate that there is much we can learn from these older adults regarding social isolation that could apply to other older adults and potentially other age groups during the time of pandemic and beyond.

T1  - Reducing social distance caused by weight stigma: Nostalgia changes behavior toward overweight individuals
AN  - 2673616621
AB  - Weight stigma, a negative attitude toward the overweight, can lead to discriminatory practices, as well as increase overweight individuals' vulnerability to depression, anxiety, and low self‐esteem. We propose that a nostalgia induction can attenuate weight stigma. Participants identified an overweight individual, before writing about an interpersonal encounter with that individual, characterized by either central (e.g., “keepsakes” and “childhood”) or peripheral (e.g., “wishing” and “daydreaming”) features of the construct “nostalgia.” Participants who recalled a central (vs. peripheral) nostalgic encounter reported more positive feelings and beliefs toward overweight individuals in general. Moreover, nostalgia influenced behavior: Nostalgic (vs. control) participants reduced their social distance when anticipating an interaction with an overweight individual. The effect of nostalgia on all three outcomes (i.e., positive feelings, beliefs, and behavior) was mediated by greater social connectedness, which in turn was associated with higher inclusion of the outgroup in the self and increased outgroup trust.

T1  - Black cultural projection: an analysis of major daily news coverage of successful black mayoral campaigns in major US Cities
AN  - 2675833336
AB  - Newspapers often play a significant role in providing knowledge about political matters and may shape public opinion about political figures. However, a focus on newspaper coverage of some of the first Black mayors of major US cities and themes related to racial identity and policy is under-examined. The current investigation adopts an ethnographic content analysis and examines 30 days of major daily newspaper coverage of Black mayoral campaigns in Los Angeles, Detroit, New Orleans, Newark, and Chicago before each mayoral election. Findings reveal that news coverage draws attention to overt racial narratives and emphasizes racial stereotypes. However, news coverage of the candidates’ policy proposals was present and often nonracialized. The outcomes suggest that the inclusion of racial identity and policies, while not entirely favorable, may increase awareness of each candidate’s policies, potentially contributing to their electability.

T1  - An analysis of the relationships between religious orientation, authoritarianism, cross‐cultural interactions, and political views
AN  - 2650002289
AB  - This study investigated the connections between religious ideology, authoritarianism, intergroup relations, and political orientation. Building from the psychological literature on religious belief, the current study sought to explore the extent of these relationships using a university sample from the American South. The Diverse Learning Environments survey was administered to undergraduate students, with 2582 responding. Variables of interest were religious belief, authoritarianism, intergroup relation views, diversity‐related actions, and political views. Results suggest that while general religious orientation did not correlate positively with authoritarianism, Christians, specifically those associated with Evangelical groups, displayed greater authoritarianism than non‐believers and reported fewer diversity‐related interactions. While results indicated that more salient religious identity was associated with right‐leaning political beliefs, an unexpected finding was that non‐belief was associated with greater political involvement. These results suggest patterns of ingroup favoritism among conservative Christians which may lead to outgroup derogation and influence voting patterns.

T1  - Social dominance orientation, right‐wing authoritarianism, and political attitudes toward governmental performance during the COVID‐19 pandemic
AN  - 2650002132
AB  - This research examined the association of social dominance orientation (SDO) and right‐wing authoritarianism (RWA) with the evaluations of the government's anti‐coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) policies and performance. In Study 1 (N = 261), we found that SDO and RWA were positively associated with resistance to criticism about the government's anti‐COVID‐19 measures. In addition, SDO was positively associated with favorable evaluations of the government's performance in handling the crisis. Support for lockdown policies mediated these attitudes. In Study 2 (N = 438), the results show that SDO and RWA had indirect associations with beliefs in the superiority of China's political system through three mediation variables. Evaluations of the US government's performance in handling the COVID‐19 pandemic were negatively associated with beliefs in the superiority of China's political system, and there was a negative relationship between evaluations of the Chinese and US governments’ performances.

T1  - Framing Syrian refugees: US local news and the politics of immigration: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2623665546
AB  - The article investigates news coverage and media framing of the Syrian refugee debate as a public opinion issue in US local news in 2015. The sheer number of refugees created an unprecedented humanitarian crisis as millions of civilians settled in neighboring countries, and a significant number of them embarked on a perilous journey to seek refuge in European countries. The political response to the Syrian refugee crisis was divided, but public attitudes shifted after the terrorist attacks on Paris in November 2015 with calls for more restrictive immigration policies and smaller refugee quotas. In the US, GOP leaders demanded “extreme vetting” and “screening” of refugees and many opposed resettling the modest number of refugees the Obama administration promised to let in. The study analyzes local news coverage variation across the States that welcomed, not welcomed or did not commit to accepting Syrian refugees at the height of the Syrian refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016. The findings of the study demonstrate that the editorial framing of the Syrian refugee crisis downplayed the global responsibility and international commitment of the US, highlighted the administrative costs and framed them as security threats. The implications of these frames are discussed.

T1  - Knowledge and perceptions of the genetic counseling profession among a national cross‐sectional sample of U.S. adults
AN  - 2625584563
AB  - Awareness of the genetic counseling (GC) profession may influence access to genetic services, yet awareness among the U.S. population is unknown. A survey of U.S. adults was conducted using age‐ and sex‐based quotas. Participants were asked if they had heard of the GC profession and to describe what genetic counselors (GCs) do. After reading a brief description of what GCs do, participants were asked the likelihood they would request to see a genetic counselor if they were concerned about a genetic condition. We used descriptive statistics to characterize the population, logistic regression to determine factors related to awareness of the GC profession, and ordinary least squares regression to identify which factors correlated with likelihood of seeking GC services. Thematic analysis was used to code open‐ended responses. Among the final sample of 543, the majority were White individuals (79.7%) with an average age of 46.5 and median income between $60,000 and $69,999. Although 20% indicated they had heard of the GC profession, further analysis of the qualitative follow‐up question suggested only 13.4% understood the role of GCs (CI 10.6%–16.3%). Factors positively and significantly correlated with knowledge of the GC profession included identifying as White or female and having higher educational attainment or higher science knowledge after controlling for income, age, and political views. Approximately 45% of respondents indicated they would likely or very likely seek GC if concerned about a genetic condition. Biological sex, age, religious affiliation, science knowledge, and awareness of the GC profession were significantly correlated with likelihood of seeking GC services while controlling for race, income, educational attainment, and political views. Curiosity/interest, the perception of benefits, and trust in GCs were all major themes that emerged to explain reasons for seeking an appointment with GCs. Lack of awareness, lack of perceived benefit, and lack of trust in GCs or greater trust in other healthcare providers were reasons for not wanting a GC appointment. Despite the 50‐year existence of the GC profession, awareness remains low and negative attitudes exist.

T1  - How Human-like Behavior of Service Robot Affects Social Distance: A Mediation Model and Cross-Cultural Comparison
AN  - 2693885182
AB  - Previous studies on the human likeness of service robots have focused mainly on their human-like appearance and used psychological constructs to measure the outcomes of human likeness. Unlike previous studies, this study focused on the human-like behavior of the service robot and used a sociological construct, social distance, to measure the outcome of human likeness. We constructed a conceptual model, with perceived competence and warmth as mediators, based on social-identity theory. The hypotheses were tested through online experiments with 219 participants from China and 180 participants from the US. Similar results emerged for Chinese and American participants in that the high (vs. low) human-like behavior of the service robot caused the participants to have stronger perceptions of competence and warmth, both of which contributed to a smaller social distance between humans and service robots. Perceptions of competence and warmth completely mediated the positive effect of the human-like behavior of the service robot on social distance. Furthermore, Chinese participants showed higher anthropomorphism (perceived human-like behavior) and a stronger perception of warmth and smaller social distance. The perception of competence did not differ across cultures. This study provides suggestions for the human-likeness design of service robots to promote natural interaction between humans and service robots and increase human acceptance of service robots.

T1  - What goes with what and for whom? How political sophistication shapes the structuring of economic and cultural beliefs
AN  - 2551806272
AB  - Recent studies have acknowledged the heterogeneity in the way citizens make sense of their economic and cultural beliefs, thus calling to question the conventional assumption that political views are organized along a single liberal-conservative dimension and connected accordingly with left–right identifications. Our article contributes to this stream of research. Primarily highlighting the influence of political sophistication on attitude consistency, we show that only the most interested in politics associate their economic and cultural attitudes in accordance with the liberal-conservative continuum and are able to combine them in a coherent fashion with their ideological identifications. In contrast, large segments of the French public do not respond to the dominant framing of the political debate.

T1  - Three clusters of content-audience associations in expression of racial prejudice while consuming online television news
AN  - 2554597182
AB  - It is well investigated that the expression of racial prejudice is often induced by news coverage on the internet, and the exposure to media contributes to the cultivation of long-term prejudice. However, there is a lack of information regarding the immediate effects of news delivered through television or television-like media on the expression of racial prejudice. This study provides a framework for understanding such effects by focusing on content-audience associations using the logs of an “online television” service, which provides television-like content and user experiences. With these logs, we found an association between the news-watching and comment-posting behaviors. Consequently, logs relevant to two distinct forms of racism, modern and old-fashioned racism, were extracted. Using mathematical modeling, which considers the different levels of program inducements to racist expression, personal inclinations of audiences to racism, and certainty of prediction of audience behaviors, we found three associative patterns between the news programs and audiences. The relevance of the topics covered to the basic beliefs of each form of racism was characterized into three clusters: expression as a reaction to news that is directly relevant to the basic beliefs of racism with weak inducements by non-bigots, minority abuse by distorting the meanings of news content indirectly relevant to the beliefs but with strong inducements by audiences with a strong bias, and racial toxic opinions independent of the news content by clear bigots. Our findings provide implications for inhibiting the expression of online prejudice based on the characteristics of these patterns.

T1  - What Predicts Selective Exposure Online: Testing Political Attitudes, Credibility, and Social Identity
AN  - 2540700015
AB  - The online environment offers nearly unlimited sources and information, giving people unprecedented agency over selection. This article offers a test of three factors predicting selective exposure to opinionated news online—prior political attitudes, source credibility, and individual social identity based on race (Study 1) and gender (Study 2)—testing their independent and interactive effects. Two original selection studies on samples of adult Americans offered articles that were (1) pro- or counter-attitudinal with regard to individual attitudes on two political issues, (2) from high- versus low-credibility sources conceptualized in two different ways, and (3) featuring participants’ social in-group or out-group. Unobtrusively logged behavioral selection data suggest that prior political attitudes, and their strength and importance in Study 1, more strongly predict pro-attitudinal exposure than both source credibility and the demographically based social identity. Both studies additionally reveal nuanced interactions between the tested factors.

T1  - (De)humanization and (dis)trust: Representations of Muslims in the UK newspapers following the 7/7 London bombings
AN  - 2547612300
AB  - Dehumanization and distrust can have devastating consequences for intergroup relations. Until now, few studies have examined the ways in which both (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful discourse are presented in popular media. Recognizing the detrimental effects of terrorism on intergroup attitudes and the power of media in influencing social and political attitudes, the present research examined the frequency of (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful statements in newspaper coverage of the July 7, 2005, London bombings in the aftermath and at the 10-year anniversary of the attack. Drawing from theoretical work on dehumanization, it was expected that (de)humanizing content in media coverage about a stereotyped outgroup would be linked to (dis)trust of that group, and would also be linked to political orientation of the media source. Primary analyses were conducted using an existing manual coding framework for frequency of (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful statements. Results from the coding show that dehumanizing and distrusting discourse was more frequent than humanizing and trusting discourse. Whereas dehumanization was significantly correlated with distrust only in the right-wing source, humanization was significantly correlated with trust only in the left-wing source. The findings advance theoretical understandings of (de)humanization and humanization as they manifest in media discourse following a terrorist event, and how these relate to outgroup (dis)trust.

T1  - Public support for harm reduction: A population survey of Canadian adults
AN  - 2529225448
AB  - [...]CHARPP analyses of 17 years of Canadian newspaper coverage concluded that harm reduction was rarely portrayed negatively or from a criminal perspective.

When opponents of harm reduction services adopt this position, they essentially view PWUD as a stigmatized outgroup, unworthy of receiving effective interventions.

[...]we hypothesize that stigmatized attitudes toward PWUD will be inversely associated with public support for harm reduction–a prediction that has been supported in two recent US studies [19, 23].

From this perspective, harm reduction services are problematic because they ‘enable’ substance use and perpetuate the disease.

[...]we hypothesize that disease model beliefs will be positively associated with stigma toward PWUD and inversely associated with support for harm reduction.

[...]cultivation theory proposes that exposure to media shapes peoples’ views on policy responses to contentious social issues [33].

T1  - Online Social Endorsement and Covid-19 Vaccine Hesitancy in the United Kingdom
AN  - 2547874813
AB  - We explore the implications of online social endorsement for the Covid-19 vaccination program in the United Kingdom. Vaccine hesitancy is a long-standing problem, but it has assumed great urgency due to the pandemic. By early 2021, the United Kingdom had the world’s highest Covid-19 mortality per million of population. Our survey of a nationally representative sample of UK adults (N = 5,114) measured socio-demographics, social and political attitudes, media diet for getting news about Covid-19, and intention to use social media and personal messaging apps to encourage or discourage vaccination against Covid-19. Cluster analysis identified six distinct media diet groups: news avoiders, mainstream/official news samplers, super seekers, omnivores, the social media dependent, and the TV dependent. We assessed whether these media diets, together with key attitudes, including Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy, conspiracy mentality, and the news-finds-me attitude (meaning giving less priority to active monitoring of news and relying more on one’s online networks of friends for information), predict the intention to encourage or discourage vaccination. Overall, super-seeker and omnivorous media diets are more likely than other media diets to be associated with the online encouragement of vaccination. Combinations of (a) news avoidance and high levels of the news-finds-me attitude and (b) social media dependence and high levels of conspiracy mentality are most likely to be associated with online discouragement of vaccination. In the direct statistical model, a TV-dependent media diet is more likely to be associated with online discouragement of vaccination, but the moderation model shows that a TV-dependent diet most strongly attenuates the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and discouraging vaccination. Our findings support public health communication based on four main methods. First, direct contact, through the post, workplace, or community structures, and through phone counseling via local health services, could reach the news avoiders. Second, TV public information advertisements should point to authoritative information sources, such as National Health Service (NHS) and other public health websites, which should then feature clear and simple ways for people to share material among their online social networks. Third, informative social media campaigns will provide super seekers with good resources to share, while also encouraging the social media dependent to browse away from social media platforms and visit reliable and authoritative online sources. Fourth, social media companies should expand and intensify their removal of vaccine disinformation and anti-vax accounts, and such efforts should be monitored by well-resourced, independent organizations.

T1  - Receptive or Restrictive: A Comparative Analysis of Local Refugee News Coverage in the United States
AN  - 2512968480
AB  - In 2015 and 2016, the word, “refugee,” filled newspaper headlines. While refugees have received considerable media attention, few recent scholarly works address local level news coverage in the United States. Using quantitative and qualitative analysis, we find that local news coverage of both local stories and national/international news is largely receptive toward refugees. However, we find variation across local contexts that receive the most and the fewest refugees, lending support to the role that intergroup contact plays in media reporting.

T1  - Asynchrony Between Individual and Government Actions Accounts for Disproportionate Impact of COVID-19 on Vulnerable Communities
AN  - 2503454703
AB  - Introduction Previously estimated effects of social distancing do not account for changes in individual behavior before the implementation of stay-at-home policies or model this behavior in relation to the burden of disease. This study aims to assess the asynchrony between individual behavior and government stay-at-home orders, quantify the true impact of social distancing using mobility data, and explore the sociodemographic variables linked to variation in social distancing practices. Methods This study was a retrospective investigation that leveraged mobility data to quantify the time to behavioral change in relation to the initial presence of COVID-19 and the implementation of government stay-at-home orders. The impact of social distancing that accounts for both individual behavior and testing data was calculated using generalized mixed models. The role of sociodemographics in accounting for variation in social distancing behavior was modeled using a 10-fold cross-validated elastic net (linear machine learning model). Analysis was conducted in April‒July 2020. Results Across all the 1,124 counties included in this analysis, individuals began to socially distance at a median of 5 days (IQR=3−8) after 10 cumulative cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in their state, with state governments taking a median of 15 days (IQR=12−19) to enact stay-at-home orders. Overall, people began social distancing at a median of 12 days (IQR=8−17) before their state enacted stay-at-home orders. Of the 16 studies included in the review, 13 exclusively used government dates as a proxy for social distancing behavior, and none accounted for both testing and mobility. Using government stay-at-home dates as a proxy for social distancing (10.2% decrease in the number of daily cases) accounted for only 55% of the true impact of the intervention when compared with estimates using mobility (18.6% reduction). Using 10-fold cross-validation, 23 of 43 sociodemographic variables were significantly and independently predictive of variation in individual social distancing, with delays corresponding to an increase in a county's proportion of people without a high school diploma and proportion of racial and ethnic minorities. Conclusions This retrospective analysis of mobility patterns found that social distancing behavior occurred well before the onset of government stay-at-home dates. This asynchrony leads to the underestimation of the impact of social distancing. Sociodemographic characteristics associated with delays in social distancing can help explain the disproportionate case burden and mortality among vulnerable communities.

T1  - Public attitudes concerning Intra-EU immigration in Germany: The role of government and press
AN  - 2570350314
AB  - Prejudice and negative attitudes concerning immigration is an omnipresent phenomenon in many modern societies around the world. This study has investigated the relationship between Germans’ trust in their government and the press and its association with their attitudes concerning the immigration of people from other EU member states. This study is first of its kind that has investigated the public attitudes concerning Intra-EU Immigration. On the one hand, the results of the study have identified two determinants of people’s attitudes concerning immigration. On the other hand, it has reconfirmed the overall positive attitudes of Germans concerning immigration. The findings are consistent with the observation that distrust of the press and government seems to be a strong characteristic of those with negative views of immigrants and immigration. The study provides essential insights that should be taken into consideration in future immigration studies.

T1  - Elite stigmatization of the unemployed: The association between framing and public attitudes
AN  - 2495956832
AB  - This paper uses a multi‐methods approach to explore the social psychological construction of stigma towards the unemployed. Study 1a uses thematic analysis to explore frames used by political elites in speeches at U.K. national party conferences between 1996 and 2016 (n = 43); in study 1b, we track the usage of these frames in six national newspapers (n = 167,723 articles) over the same period showing an increase in the use of negative frames. Study 1c shows that these are associated with national attitudes towards welfare recipients using the British Social Attitude Survey. We find the ‘Othering’ frame is correlated with negative attitudes towards the unemployed, even when controlling for the unemployment rate. This finding supports the claim that social attitudes are related to frames produced in the political and media spheres. We provide theoretical integration between social representations theory and framing which affords development in both domains.

T1  - A semantic network approach to measuring sentiment
AN  - 2486883778
AB  - Sentiment research is dominated by studies that assign texts to positive and negative categories. This classification is often based on a bag-of-words approach that counts the frequencies of sentiment terms from a predefined vocabulary, ignoring the contexts for these words. We test an aspect-based network analysis model that computes sentiment about an entity from the shortest paths between the sentiment words and the target word across a corpus. Two ground-truth datasets in which human annotators judged whether tweets were positive or negative enabled testing the internal and external validity of the automated network-based method, evaluating the extent to which this approach’s scoring corresponds to the annotations. We found that tweets annotated as negative had an automated negativity score that was nearly twice as strong than positivity, while positively annotated tweets were six times stronger in positivity than negativity. To assess the predictive validity of the approach, we analyzed sentiment associated with coronavirus coverage in television news from January 1 to March 25, 2020. Support was found for the four hypotheses tested, demonstrating the utility of the approach. H1: broadcast news expresses less sentiment about coronavirus, panic, and social distancing than non-broadcast news outlets. H2: there is a negative bias in the news across channels. H3: sentiment increases are associated with an increased volume of news stories. H4: sentiment is associated with uncertainty in news coverage of coronavirus over time. We also found that as the type of channel moved from broadcast network news to 24-h business, general, and foreign news sentiment increased for coronavirus, panic, and social distancing.

T1  - Does Intercultural Contact Increase Anti-Racist Behavior on Social Network Sites?
AN  - 2544936062
AB  - Empirical attention on online intercultural contact and prejudice reduction are increasing. Nevertheless, still little is known on processes that could influence the contact–prejudice relation as well as the relation between online contact and anti-racist behavior. Based on literature on intergroup contact, the present study aims to fill these gaps, focusing on online intergroup relationships between people from different countries. Specifically, it examines whether and to what extent empathic feelings and online community commitment mediate the relationship between online intergroup contact and both perceived ethnic discrimination and anti-racist behavior on Facebook. We collected data from a predominantly Italian sample of 1018 Facebook users (Mage = 30.03, SDage = 11.09; females: 80.01%); participants filled in an online questionnaire. A semi-full Structural Equation Modeling was used to test hypotheses. The results confirmed that when intergroup contact was established, such contact was able to increase the sense of being committed to the online community, which increased the perception of online discrimination towards ethnic and racial minorities, which in turn was able to increase the anti-racist behavior. The ambivalent role of the empathy in online contexts will be discussed.

T1  - Virtual Reality and Political Outgroup Contact: Can Avatar Customization and Common Ingroup Identity Reduce Social Distance?
AN  - 2507921931
AB  - This study (N = 217) explores the potential for virtual reality to decrease social distance toward outgroup members among women. Raising the salience of individuals’ real physical identity through avatar customization and common ingroup identity manipulations was theorized to influence social distance. Participants who customized an avatar to resemble their real selves showed increased social distance. However, avatar customization also increased user identifiability, which was linked to reduced social distance. Priming a common ingroup identity increased identity salience but did not influence social distance. In examining heterogeneous effects by prior levels of issue involvement, participants with high and moderate involvement with immigration showed increased social distance after customizing an avatar to resemble their real selves, thus implying boomerang effects. The study discusses how avatar customization, identifiability, and common ingroup primes in virtual encounters may influence outgroup attitudes and intergroup relations.

T1  - I (dis)like the way you (dis)like them: The role of extended contact on social distance and attitudes towards the ingroup
AN  - 2474519535
AB  - While extended intergroup contact has been commonly studied in the context of prejudice reduction, less is known about its implications for processes related to the ingroup. Through three correlational and one experimental studies (total N = 897) conducted in two different intergroup contexts (Turkey and United Kingdom), we investigated whether extended intergroup contact relates to social distance and attitudes towards ingroup members as a function of outgroup attitudes. We also investigated ingroup identification and perceived ingroup morality as potential mediators in these associations. Correlational studies demonstrated that especially when outgroup attitudes were more negative, participants’ positive (but not negative) extended contact was related to a more negative evaluation of the ingroup; whereas when outgroup attitudes were more positive, extended contact was associated with positive attitudes towards the ingroup. We found experimental evidence for the suggested relationships in relation to ingroup social distance. Findings are discussed in the light of vicarious dissonance theory and deprovincialization hypothesis.

T1  - Shades of Privilege: The Relationship Between Skin Color and Political Attitudes Among White Americans
AN  - 2471471143
AB  - Shifting racial dynamics in the U.S. have heightened the salience of White racial identity, and a sense that Whites’ social status and resources are no longer secure. At the same time, the growing size of non-White populations has also renewed attention to skin color-based stratification and the potential blurring of racial boundaries. We theorize that Whites with darker skin will be motivated to protect the boundaries of Whiteness due to the loss of status they would face from blurring racial boundaries. Consistent with growing evidence of skin color’s importance for Whites, we demonstrate that darker-skinned Whites—measured via a light-reflectance spectrophotometer—identify more strongly with their White racial identity and are more likely to hold conservative political views on racialized issues than lighter-skinned Whites. Together, these findings offer new insights into the evolving meaning of race and color in American politics.

T1  - Perceiving demographic diversity as a threat: Divergent effects of multiculturalism and polyculturalism: GPIR
AN  - 2451091565
AB  - The growing racial/ethnic diversity in the United States can be perceived as threatening to White Americans. The present work examines how interethnic ideologies—different ways of framing ethnic diversity—moderate perceptions of threat and political conservatism among White Americans exposed to a passage about the US becoming a “majority-minority” nation. Across 3 studies, we found divergent effects of multiculturalism and polyculturalism within the context of growing diversity. Priming multiculturalism increased perceived threats to the ingroup’s power and status, which in turn led to greater endorsement of conservative political views (Studies 1 and 3) and warmer feelings toward a conservative political figure (i.e., Donald Trump; Studies 2 and 3); however, these relationships were attenuated and sometimes reversed among participants primed with polyculturalism. We discuss implications for how interethnic ideologies influence White Americans’ threatened responses to increasing diversity.

T1  - Political correctness and the alt-right: The development of extreme political attitudes
AN  - 2449154186
AB  - Recent studies have documented a shift from moderate political attitudes to more extreme attitudes at the ends of the political spectrum. This can be seen in Political Correctness (PC) on the left, and white identitarian (WI) attitudes on the ‘Alt-Right’ (AR). While highly covered in mainstream media, limited academic research has investigated their possible antecedents and psychological correlates. The current study investigated the prevalence and psychological predictors of these attitudes. Utilising a quota-based sample of 512 U.S. participants, we found that extreme political attitudes were associated with various personality traits, social media use, and upbringing. PC attitudes were associated with agreeableness, black-white thinking, social-media use, and perceived overprotective parenting. WI attitudes were associated with low agreeableness and openness, and high black-white thinking. Our results show that extreme left and right attitudes are separated by individual differences, and that authoritarianism can be seen on both the left and the right.

T1  - The evaluation of pre-hospital emergency care providers' attitudes towards refugees in Turkey
AN  - 2476173341
AB  - Background Health for all is one of the fundamental rights for eliminating inequalites. Within the scope of Sustainable Development Goals, health services should be provided to everyone without any discrimination regardlass of race, religion, political view, gender, economic and social status. The increase of violence in their home country caused about 3 million 666 thousand 59 people to flee to Turkey and they've been experiencing economic, social and cultural problems as well as a problem of acceptance and adaptation. We aimed to evaluate the attitudes of emergency healthcare providers towards refugees and their perception of social distance. Methods This is a methodological study conducted between January-February 2020. The study group consisted of 372 (77.5%) out of 480 healthcare professionals. Attitude towards refugees was evaluated with the Health Providers' Attitude Towards Refugees Scale (HPATRS) developed by the researchers. Questionnaire form included HPATRS and Social Distance Scale(SDS). The Cronbach's alpha value of HPATRS was 0.694. Multiple linear regression was used for multivariate analysis. Results The ages of the study group ranged between 18-60 while the mean age was 32.15 ± 7.50 and 55.1% were female. Of the study group, 50.8% scored below the mean score from HPATRS. Multivariate analysis showed that, having language difficulties, having a master's degree and above and having high social distance was related to negative attitude towards refugees. (F: 7.567 p < 0.001 R²: 0.195). The social distance level was found to be the most important determinant in attitude (β: 0.343). Conclusions The attitude towards refugees in emergency care providers were thought to be not positive enough to eliminate the inequalities. It was concluded that; having a master's degree and above, having more social distance and having language difficulties were risk factors for a negative attitude towards refugees. Key messages    As the first responders, emergency workers’ attitudes towards refugees is an important issue to be addressed in eliminating health inequalities.   Mass media campaigns should be used to reduce social distance and trainings should be planned in order to develop positive attitudes towards refugees.

T1  - The challenge of heritability: genetic determinants of beliefs and their implications
AN  - 2451517013
AB  - Ethical and political attitudes are not randomly distributed in a population. Attitudes of family members, for example, tend to be more similar than those of a random sample of the same size. In the fields of social psychology and political science, the historically standard explanation for these attitude distribution patterns was that social and political attitudes are (at least partially) a function of environmental factors like parental socialization and prevailing social norms. This received view is, however, complicated by more recent work in behavioral genetics, which consistently and repeatedly demonstrates that certain ethical and political attitudes dealing with issues like censorship, abortion, capital punishment, and immigration policy have a significant heritability coefficient, to wit, a substantial percentage of attitude variance in a population can be attributed to genetic variance, independent of environmental factors. In this paper, I argue that the genetic influence on our ethical and political attitudes is mediated by what we can agree to be irrelevant and distorting factors that can lead moral reasoning astray. Further, I argue that we should significantly lower our credences in ethical and political attitudes that fall within the domains of belief that involve significant genetic influence.

T1  - “What’s going on” in Ferguson? Online news frames of protest at the police killing of Michael Brown: GPIR
AN  - 2447808016
AB  - Public reactions to protests are often divided, with some viewing the protest as a legitimate response to injustice and others perceiving the protest as illegitimate. We examine how online news sources oriented to different audiences frame protest, potentially encouraging these divergent reactions. We focus on online news coverage following the 2014 police shooting of a Black teenager, Michael Brown. Preregistered analyses of headlines and images and their captions showed that sources oriented toward African Americans were more likely to include content conveying racial injustice and legitimacy of the subsequent protests than sources oriented toward a general audience. In contrast, general audience sources emphasized conflict between protesters and police, making fewer references to the protesters’ cause. Whereas much work on media segregation addresses the propensity of audiences to consume different sources, our work suggests that news sources may also contribute to information fragmentation by differentially framing the same events.

T1  - The China-Pakistan economic corridor: The Pakistani media attitudes perspective
AN  - 2462673891
AB  - The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative. How Pakistani media coverage shapes the CPEC is related to public attitudes towards the project and may even affect the success or failure of the initiative in Pakistan. This paper examines Pakistani media coverage on the CPEC by constructing and analyzing semantic networks of the news from the top three English media from 2015 to 2018. We detect the sentimental polarity of news coverage on the CPEC, focusing on the words used in the news and determining how the media frames the CPEC in Pakistan. Then, we construct semantic networks of the negative, neutral and positive documents. Network analysis is used to determine the characteristics of the different sentiment networks, which words hold significant positions, and how the negative central concepts are associated with describing the apprehension towards and obstacles related to the CPEC. The results show that most coverage exhibits a positive attitude towards the CPEC. Negative sentiment towards the CPEC is illustrated through more diverse messaging, demonstrating greater cohesiveness than the larger, less-connected positive network. The identified negative central topics are India, security, region, parties, issues, Afghanistan, Kashmir, debt, loans, situation, disputes, cost, opposition and peace, which are framed around apprehension and skepticism regarding the CPEC and the stability of the environment of its construction. In contrast, the most significant words in the positive network are progress, important, support, benefit, prosperity, enhance, improve, and boost, highlighting the potential economic returns and political guarantees. Semantic network analysis of the sentiments expressed in the Pakistani media regarding the CPEC can improve our understanding of Pakistani attitudes towards the CPEC. Our research combines quantitative and qualitative evidence to study media coverage in Pakistan, which can provide insights regarding the communications used to improve confidence in the CPEC and can also improve our understanding of the Belt and Road Initiative.

T1  - The impact of social stratification on morbidity during the COVID-19 pandemic
TT  - Impact of social stratification on morbidity
AN  - 2465952208
AB  - PurposeSocioeconomic status (SES) has been known to be associated with many aspects of social life such as health. We argue that social stratification remains relevant in understanding differentials in health during a pandemic, as countries globally have encouraged or enforced social distancing and remote work measures.Design/methodology/approachBy examining data sources and news reports on the COVID-19 pandemic, we aim to highlight the relationship between SES and morbidity, through the ability to adopt social distancing measures and work remotely. Utilizing publicly available data from the Maryland Transport Institute and the US Census, we performed linear regressions on median income, social distancing index and percentage of individuals working from home.FindingsIndividuals with higher SES are more likely to have jobs that provide opportunities for remote work to be performed, which allows for social distancing. Comparatively, individuals with lower SES are more likely to be involved in jobs that cannot be performed remotely. The linear regression models suggest a positive moderate and significant correlation between median income and social distancing index (R2 = 0.4981, p-value < 0.001), and a positive weak and significant correlation between median income and remote work (R2 = 0.2460, p-value < 0.001).Research limitations/implicationsGovernments need to account for SES in policymaking to reduce inequalities in health.Originality/valueThe paper aims to improve the understanding of social stratification and morbidity through examining data on the COVID-19 pandemic.

T1  - The Biopolitics of Social Distancing
AN  - 2447804032
AB  - As COVID-19 spreads across the globe, new technologies are being leveraged to enforce social distancing requirements. I explore social distancing through the theoretical lens of Michel Foucault’s biopolitics, with an emphasis on recognizing unauthorized movement and controlling circulation. Although reporting and widely shared data visualizations about COVID-19 have made many people newly aware that their movements are being tracked and surveilled, governments are already implementing new measures such as geofencing and artificial intelligence (AI)–based facial recognition to facilitate the enforcement of social distancing. The tracking of COVID-19 spread and social distancing behaviors of the public has made more visible the practices of biopolitics but also generated new opportunities for even greater surveillance and control. The current moment offers an opportunity to shift public perceptions about data surveillance, technological control, and the racial disparities of biopower, much in the same way that public perceptions around social media shifted during and after the Arab Spring. How we collectively respond to these biopolitical processes will, in part, determine how such power relations are articulated in the future.

T1  - “Distant Participation” and Youth Political Attitudes: Evidence from a Natural Experiment
AN  - 2427515795
AB  - ObjectiveIn this article, we explore the seldom studied concept of “distant participation,” defined as the experience of social movements (such as receiving information from online media) from overseas. Online media may affect people's political attitudes, but how people use online media is also contingent upon their political attitudes.MethodWe take advantage of a natural experiment to deal with this endogenous selection problem. Our treatment group consists of college students who happened to join a short‐term overseas exchange program during the Umbrella Movement, which had an unexpectedly large turnout in Hong Kong. These students had a different mode of participation in the event from their peers physically in Hong Kong. The experience, including intensive exposure to online media, changed their media consumption habits, and hence their political attitudes.ResultsWe find that the treatment group is more likely to report using online media to obtain news. They also have a stronger sense of political efficacy and significantly weaker national identity. We, however, find no significant difference between the treatment and control groups regarding civic and political participation.ConclusionThis study provides a rare contribution to the study of the effect of online media by tackling the problem of selection. The concept of distant participation should also be given more attention given the ease of population flow and technological advancement nowadays.

T1  - Genetic and environmental variation in political orientation in adolescence and early adulthood: A Nuclear Twin Family analysis
AN  - 2389726196
AB  - Political orientation is often assumed to be shaped by socialization processes; however, previous studies have shown substantial genetic variance components in party affiliation, political attitudes and behaviors, or closely related personality traits. The majority of these studies have relied on the Classical Twin Design, which comes with restrictive assumptions, some of which are easily violated. Moreover, most analyses lack a perspective of age-group differences. In this study, we investigated political orientation in adolescents (age: 16–18) and young adults (age: 21–25) in a cross-sectional Nuclear Twin Family Design. We used data of the German TwinLife project, including data from same-sex twins reared together, their biological parents, and nontwin full siblings. We found genetic variation in political orientation, which was significant in the older cohort, possibly indicating an increasing importance of active gene-environment correlation from adolescence to adulthood. Individual differences in political orientation because of passive gene-environment correlation and shared environmental effects were larger in the younger cohort, substantiating the same theoretical consideration and the importance of shared socialization contexts for adolescents' political views. By running Nuclear Twin Family model analyses, and considering age-group differences, as well as the relationship of political orientation with the Big Five personality traits, our study extended previous work, and resulted in more robust and fine-grained estimates of genetic and environmental sources of variance in political orientation. Therefore, it contributed to a better understanding of the complex nature–nurture interplay that forms political orientation in emerging adulthood.

T1  - Gluten aversion is not limited to the political left
AN  - 2243882409
AB  - Despite a heightened political discourse surrounding food choices, few studies have identified connections between political beliefs and consumer perceptions. Using gluten as an example, this article identifies how political opinions relate to opinions of food products. If an avoidance of gluten is a biological condition and not a social construct, there should be no correlation between political opinions and gluten avoidance. Our study uncovers a complex relationship between the social construction of gluten avoidance and the potential role of political views. Perhaps most surprising, we find that supporters of Donald Trump are more likely to identify as avoiding gluten, relative to non-supporters. Findings suggest that future research might benefit from considering the political beliefs of consumers when estimating models of food demand.

T1  - Is Subjective Ill-Being Related to Islamophobia in Germany? In Search for Moderators
AN  - 2154455524
AB  - Is subjective ill-being, defined as the inverse of subjective well-being, related to Islamophobia in Germany? We conducted a study guided by two goals to answer this question. The first goal was to test the hypothesis that subjective ill-being is associated with Islamophobia. The second goal, contingent on the results of testing for the association between subjective ill-being and Islamophobia, was to test a set of variables presumed to moderate this relationship—positive and negative contact with Muslims, right-wing political views, political participation, the importance of political life, and cultural diversity orientation. Data from the GESIS Panel, a probability-based panel representative of the German-speaking population aged between 18 and 70 years permanently residing in Germany, were used to test the study hypotheses. The data provided support for the hypothesis that subjective ill-being is indeed associated with Islamophobia in Germany (r = .12, p < .01). The data provided support for only one of the moderator hypothesis, namely cultural diversity orientation. Specifically, the data showed that the relationship between subjective ill-being and Islamophobia is stronger for those who have low (rather than high) cultural diversity orientation.

T1  - Numbers, Narratives, and Nation: Mainstream News Coverage of U.S. Latino Population Growth, 1990–2010
AN  - 2406941440
AB  - Ideologies that support racial domination and White supremacy remain foundational in U.S. society, even as the nation becomes increasingly diverse and progressively focused on quantitative measurement. This study explores how a prominent mainstream news outlet represents the growth of the nation’s second largest population, Latinos, within this changing demographic and numeric environment. Drawing from two frameworks, the Latino Threat Narrative and Color-Blind Racism, quantitative and qualitative analyses are conducted with 174 Los Angeles Times (LAT) articles about 2000 and 2010 census results. Reporters for the LAT, located in the single most important U.S. location for Latinos, frame Latinos and their population dynamics in line with the overtly racist narrative of Latino threat and the covertly racist ideology of color-blind racism. Moreover, the analyses reveal that quantitative logics circulating in the present evaluative climate further the view that Latinos pose cultural-demographic threats to the nation. Quantification also enhances color-blind frames and rhetorical strategies justifying present-day racial stratification and the subordinate locations of non-White groups. This suggests how White supremacy retains its power as the populations and metrics of evaluation change. Finally, given recent research linking demographic trends and media representations with attitudes, policy positions, and political partisanship, these representations have implications for the well-being of Latinos, other populations, and the nation.

T1  - Cyber-Routines, Political Attitudes, and Exposure to Violence-Advocating Online Extremism
AN  - 2447241820
AB  - The Internet’s relatively unfettered transmission of information risks exposing individuals to extremist content. Using online survey data (N = 768) of American youth and young adults, we examine factors that bring individuals into contact with online material advocating violence. Combining aspects of social structure-social learning theory with insights from routine activity theory, we find that exposure to violence-advocating materials is positively correlated with online behaviors, including the use of social media platforms and the virtual spaces individuals frequent. Target antagonism is also correlated with exposure to violence-advocating materials, but guardianship and online and offline associations are not. Finally, feelings of dissatisfaction with major social institutions and economic disengagement are associated with exposure to violent materials online.

T1  - Impacts of Internet on Openness to Change in China: Millennials Versus Pre‐Millennials
AN  - 2259659515
AB  - ObjectiveThis article explores whether there are different consequences from Internet use—in the form of changed political attitudes—for older Chinese as compared to their younger counterparts.MethodsUsing data from a nationwide representative survey of Chinese adults, analyses include both cross‐tabulation and multiple regression.ResultsIt is found that millennials are more open to political change than are older Chinese, that older Internet users—as compared to older nonusers—have attitudes more similar to those of millennials, and that differences in attitudes are greater between older users and nonusers than between millennial users and nonusers.ConclusionThe findings support the conclusion that Internet use has had greater consequences for changed political attitudes for older Chinese than for their younger counterparts.

T1  - Anti-immigration sentiment and public opinion on human trafficking
AN  - 2215418416
AB  - Prior research shows that anti-immigration sentiment affects public opinion about criminal justice problems and solutions. However, we know little about how these sentiments affect public opinion about human trafficking. This paper attempts to fill this gap by examining the role of anti-immigration sentiment in shaping public support for anti-trafficking efforts in the United States. Specifically, this research examines the effect of anti-immigration sentiment on the public’s understanding about vulnerabilities for human trafficking among migrant populations and corresponding support for policies directed at the protection of migrant trafficked persons. This is particularly important because public policies that safeguard migrant trafficked persons have been among the most difficult to pass despite strong support for the governmental prioritization of anti-trafficking efforts overall. Utilizing public opinion data from an original, nationally representative survey experiment of 2000 Americans, this study finds that anti-immigration sentiment (1) is associated with greater recognition of the vulnerability of immigrants to human trafficking victimization; (2) does not impact public support for a general governmental prioritization of human trafficking policies; yet (3) creates less public support for victim services for non-citizen trafficked persons; and (4) stems from differences in political views impacting support for services for immigrant victims. These findings contribute to an understanding of the role of anti-immigration sentiment in public opinion about crime and have implications for policies aimed at improving the identification of and outcomes for migrant trafficked persons.

T1  - Examining the effects of news coverage linking undocumented immigrants with criminality: Policy and punitive implications
AN  - 2185851746
AB  - Although research suggests that there is no meaningful real-world connection between crime rates and undocumented immigrants, media coverage of this group almost exclusively portrays them as criminals. The present two-study investigation experimentally tests the effects of exposure to crime news depicting undocumented immigrant suspects on White viewers' social judgments. To this end, assumptions from social identity theory were applied to research and theorizing on mediated intergroup threat and compound penalties for immigrant criminality. Results from Study 1 and Study 2 indicate that when White viewers are exposed to threatening crime news featuring undocumented immigrants, out-group bias emerges in the form of harsher sentencing. In Study 1, when exposed to highly threatening coverage, attitudes toward immigration and in-group identification partially mediated and moderated this relationship, respectively.

T1  - Family Communication Problems, Psychosocial Adjustment and Cyberbullying
AN  - 2329436297
AB  - [...]since cyberbullying occurs through technological means, the authors consider it worthwhile to explore other variables relating to PUSNS [41,42,43].

PUSNS is defined as an individual being overly concerned about social networking sites (SNSs), to be driven by a strong motivation to log on or use SNSs, and to devote so much time and effort to SNSs that it impairs other social activities, studies or work, interpersonal relationships, and physical and mental health and wellbeing [44,45,46].

In terms of gender, previous studies have also indicated that gender is a relevant variable when problematic online behaviors and cyberbullying are considered.

[...]girls more often use social networking sites that allow them to communicate with their peers [51,52] whereas boys spend more time on other activities such as video games or visiting web pages [53].

Regarding attitude towards institutional authority, previous authors have observed that adolescent boys have a positive attitude towards the transgression of social norms, unlike girls, who show higher levels of positive attitude towards institutional authority [35].

T1  - Social dominance orientation and stereotype influence perception of social distance between classes
AN  - 2230835141
AB  - Social dominance orientation (SDO) and stereotypes about out-groups can influence social distance significantly. We tested the effects of these 2 factors on social distance and a probable mediation effect of upper class stereotype with participants from lower class groups of Chinese people in 3 studies (N = 105 in Study 1; N = 102 in Study 2; N = 112 in Study 3). The results in Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated that higher SDO and a more positive stereotype elicited less social distance between lower class and upper class members. In Study 3, the mediation effect of stereotype was also significant. These results provide insight into the mechanism of the perceived social distance between social classes, which is meaningful for social harmony in China.

T1  - Leave or remain? European identification, legitimacy of European integration, and political attitudes towards the EU
AN  - 2169524197
AB  - In this paper, we look at the relationship between European identification and political support for (or opposition to) EU membership. First, we argue that conceptualizing political attitudes towards the EU as a direct product of European identification (a) neglects the distinction between the social reality of Europe and the political reality of the EU and (b) leads to psychological reductionism. We propose that the relationship should instead be conceptualized as mediated by legitimacy perceptions and as moderated by social‐level variables. Second, we look at three spheres of European integration and propose that their perceived legitimacy is appraised through the following principles: (a) normative solidarity for wealth sharing, (b) political authority for sharing political decisions, and (c) collective self‐realization for the sharing of practices. We illustrate the key mediating role of those principles by drawing on data from a survey ran across five European countries. Third, we argue that these meditational relationships are in turn moderated by social, political, and ideological realities and illustrate this point by looking at the case of United Kingdom in the context of the EU membership referendum. We point to an ideological assumption in the U.K. political landscape about the illegitimacy of EU supranational decision making and argue that this contributed to shape both the debate of the referendum campaign and its result.

T1  - Identity and coalitions in a multiracial era: how state legislators navigate race and ethnicity
AN  - 2571083478
AB  - Research on descriptive representatives provides mixed evidence that race informs legislators’ political views. However, past work conflates racial categorization with racial identity, and often lacks variation in race as the key variable. Additionally, few studies examine how diversity within groups may impact intergroup relations within the legislature. The presence of multiracial elected officials prompts us to revisit the linkages descriptive representatives draw between their race and their political outlooks, and to explore the consequences of multiracial legislators’ presence for intergroup relations within the legislature. Interviews with a diverse set of legislators were conducted. For multiracial legislators, questions about phenotypic ambiguity were salient, and narratives suggest their racial identities were consciously chosen, which in turn shaped their politics. The interviews also suggest that some multiracial legislators may encounter challenges to their minority caucus memberships. The findings suggest that as legislatures become more diverse, phenotype and identity choices may complicate intergroup relations in the legislature and how scholars understand what constitutes a descriptive representative.

This paper aims to understand the antecedents of negative attitudes toward a large refugee group currently garnering a great deal of attention—Syrian refugees, and experimentally test ways to ameliorate negative attitudes. In Study 1 (N = 122), we investigated predictors of social distance—as a proxy for prejudice—and found right‐wing authoritarianism and intergroup anxiety to be significant predictors. In Study 2 (N = 162), we tested whether perceived acculturation orientation would predict social distance and found that Americans were less prejudiced toward Syrians who preferred to assimilate rather than integrate. Finally, in Study 3 (N = 153), we tested if a form of vicarious contact could reduce social distance via reduced intergroup anxiety; we found initial evidence for this mediation link. We discussed the potential for the vicarious contact intervention to foster positive intergroup relations and contribute to refugee wellbeing.

T1  - Just a Show? Effects of Televised Debates on Political Attitudes and Preferences in Slovakia
AN  - 2121026395
AB  - The popularity of televised political debates is growing, attracting millions of viewers. However, evidence that such debates can shift voters’ attitudes is mixed and the impact on voters’ preference is also mixed. In addition, the evidence comes mostly from presidential elections in the United States and almost exclusively from established democracies. A call for comparative research in new democracies has been made several times. Our research answers the call and contributes to this debate by comparing two experimental studies based on first-order national elections and second-order European Parliament elections in Slovakia. To our knowledge, this is the first time such a study has been performed in a post-communist EU country. We employed a pre-test/post-test experimental design in a controlled environment with participants randomly assigned to both groups. The results show that debate exposure has a stronger effect on opinions about candidates’ leadership skills, credibility, and economic competence if the candidates were previously unknown. Familiarity with the candidates and pre-existing preferences also function as a block to preference change. Almost all of our findings are in line with previous research originating from Western contexts. Therefore, we conclude that the causal mechanism linking debate exposure to voters’ preference and attitudes in the post-communist context is similar to that in Western countries with long-term democratic traditions.

T1  - The three facets of national identity: Identity dynamics and attitudes toward immigrants in Russia
AN  - 2154944731
AB  - This study contributes to the discussion on individual-level determinants of anti-immigrant prejudice by applying a multi-dimensional model of manifestations of national identity in Russia. This context is particularly interesting as anti-immigrant sentiments are widespread across all social strata and thus, socioeconomic indicators and political views are weak predictors of such sentiments. We use cross-sectional data from 1995, 2003, and 2013 ISSP National Identity module to assess the dynamics of three facets of national identity in Russia, namely nationalism, political patriotism, and cultural patriotism, and their relations with attitudes toward immigrants. We find nationalism, political patriotism, and anti-immigrant attitudes to increase over time. More importantly, our findings support the theoretical distinction between the facets of national identity: nationalism is linked to anti-immigrant attitudes, political patriotism is linked to more positive attitudes, and cultural patriotism is largely unrelated to attitudes toward immigrants. We show that these facets of national identity have much higher predictive power than sociodemographic indicators or political views. Our findings underscore the utility of a nuanced assessment of national identity in explaining attitudes toward immigrants in non-Western contexts.

T1  - Who Is the Muslim? Discursive Representations of the Muslims and Islam in Indian Prime-Time News
AN  - 2124319108
AB  - A cursory look at Indian prime-time news tells us much about the tone and tenor of the people associated with it. Exaggerations, hyperbole, and tempers run wild, and news anchors flail in theatrical rage. News channels and news editors display their ideological affiliations subliminally. These affiliations—a factor of personal political stances, funding bodies, and investors—lead to partisan bias in the framing of news and, in some cases, can easily translate into racial prejudice. In this paper, I examine news coverage related to Muslims in India. I study the coverage of two issues specifically—love jihad and triple talaq—in prime-time English news of two channels: Times Now and Republic TV. Love jihad is a term used to describe alleged campaigns carried out by Muslim men targeting non-Muslim women for conversion to Islam by feigning love. Triple talaq is a form of divorce that has been interpreted to allow Muslim men to legally divorce their wives by stating the word “talaq” three times. My analysis of the content, tone, and tenor of their coverage shows that these channels propagate associations between Islam and backwardness, ignorance, and violence through consistent employment of the following tropes: “Muslim women need to be saved from Muslim men”; “Hindu women need to be saved from Muslim men”; and, “Muslims are not fully Indian—they are anti-national”. I place this study of news media within the current political climate in India and briefly touch on the conversations it guides and provokes. This is a first step in detailing a problem. It is also a call for further analysis on this subject to examine and evaluate if and how discourse manipulates public conversations and policy decisions.

T1  - Facebook news and (de)polarization: reinforcing spirals in the 2016 US election
AN  - 2019372483
AB  - The rise of social media, and specifically Facebook, as a dominant force in the flow of news in the United States has led to concern that people incur greater isolation from diverse perspectives through filter bubbles (from algorithmic filtering) and echo chambers (from an information environment populated by social recommendations coming from overwhelmingly like-minded others). This evolution in news diffusion comes at a time when Americans report increased affective partisan polarization. In particular, evidence shows increasingly negative attitudes about out-party members. Based on selective exposure and reinforcing spirals model perspectives, we examined the reciprocal relationship between Facebook news use and polarization using national 3-wave panel data collected during the 2016 US Presidential Election. Over the course of the campaign, we found media use and attitudes remained relatively stable. Our results also showed that Facebook news use was related to a modest over-time spiral of depolarization. Furthermore, we found that people who use Facebook for news were more likely to view both pro- and counter-attitudinal news in each wave. Our results indicated that counter-attitudinal news exposure increased over time, which resulted in depolarization. We found no evidence of a parallel model, where pro-attitudinal exposure stemming from Facebook news use resulted in greater affective polarization.

T1  - Can Elites Shape Public Attitudes Toward Immigrants?: Evidence from the 2016 US Presidential Election
AN  - 2430650735
AB  - It is well known that political elites can shape public attitudes toward policies and values. Less is known, however, about whether elites can also influence public perceptions of social groups they praise or denounce. I test this by analyzing the attitudinal effects of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign announcement speech, in which he referred to Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and “criminals.” First, to provide causal estimates, I analyze survey data using a counterfactual approach. I find evidence that Trump’s statements negatively affected public opinion toward immigrants particularly among groups with restrictionist tendencies. Second, using a panel survey experiment, I corroborate this causal relationship but find that these effects are short-lived. This explains why restrictionist politicians like Trump constantly prod natives to keep their messages’ effects from dissipating. I also find that only negative messages are consequential and find no evidence that elite statements are more impactful than those from non-elites, suggesting that the power of elite rhetoric lies primarily in its capacity to reach the masses via the news media.

T1  - The role of national identity, religious identity, and intergroup contact on social distance across multiple social divides in Turkey
AN  - 2098784177
AB  - Using a nationally representative dataset from Turkey, we examined the effects of national identity, religious identity, religious practice, and intergroup contact on social distance towards disliked groups along ethnic (Turks vs. Kurds), religious (Sunnis vs. Alevis) and ideological divides (supporters vs. opponents of the Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi, AKP). We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine two mechanisms (via perceived threat and empathy) through which ingroup identification and intergroup contact influence social distance toward disliked groups. Perceived threat, but not empathy, mediated the effect of national identification on higher social distance towards Kurds, AKP supporters and AKP opponents. Both perceived threat and empathy mediated the effects of religious practice on distance towards Alevis. Intergroup contact had both direct and indirect effects (via threat and empathy) on social distance. Multigroup SEM showed that contact’s effects did not vary across outgroup targets. By contrast, the effects of national and religious identity on social distance varied depending on the outgroup target. The findings highlight the importance of considering identity content and meaning attached to social categories in making predictions about the influence of identification with different social categories.

T1  - "Celebrity 2.0 and beyond!" Effects of Facebook profile sources on social networking advertising
AN  - 1984837039
AB  - Two experiments examined the effects of different sources (celebrity versus peer consumer) of celebrity-brand-related user-generated content (UGC) embedded in a social networking site (SNS). Consistent with the basic premises of warranting theory (stronger effects of other-endorsement than self-endorsement) and social identity theory (more positive effects of ingroup than outgroup), Experiment 1 demonstrated more positive effects of celebrity brand endorsements posted on a peer consumer's (other; in-group identity) Facebook profile page on source credibility perception and parasocial interaction with the celebrity than celebrity brand endorsements posted on the celebrity's own (self; out-group identity) Facebook profile page. Social identification mediated the effects of the Facebook profile source on parasocial interaction with the celebrity. Experiment 2 indicated that a movie star's Facebook presence contributed to a more positive attitude toward the celebrity. A peer Facebook user's movie endorsement UGC resulted in greater advertising believability, more positive attitude toward, and more positive emotional reactions toward system-generated content (SGC) sponsored Facebook advertising than the movie star's self-promotion on his own Facebook page. In addition, movie involvement moderated the relationship between the Facebook profile source and advertising effectiveness.

T1  - Colorblind Individualism, Color Consciousness, and the Indian Child Welfare Act: Representations of Adoptee Best Interest in Newspaper Coverage of the Baby Veronica Case
AN  - 2558485227
AB  - Transracial adoption debates revolve around adoptee best interest with support focusing on individual rights and opposition emphasizing identity. How the media portrayed the Baby Veronica case highlights tensions between colorblind individualism and collective color consciousness central to the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). Content analysis of 262 mainstream and Native American newspaper articles illustrates the complex use of both frameworks with Native American sources more often noting the importance of tribal ties and drawing from a more diverse range of authorities. Findings have implications for public attitudes regarding tribal rights, adoption and foster care policies and practices, and the future of ICWA.

T1  - Online Influence? Social Media Use, Opinion Leadership, and Political Persuasion
AN  - 2502810092
AB  - Opinion leaders can be influential in persuading their peers about news and politics, yet their potential influence has been questioned in the social media era. This study tests a theoretical model of attempts at political persuasion within social media in which highly active users (“prosumers”) consider themselves opinion leaders, which subsequently increases efforts to try and change others’ political attitudes and behaviors. Using two-wave U.S. panel survey data (W1 = 1,816; W2 = 1,024), we find prosumers believe they are highly influential in their social networks and are both directly and indirectly more likely to try to persuade others. Our results highlight one theoretical mechanism through which engaged social media users attempt to persuade others and suggest personal influence remains viable within social media.

T1  - Beyond social relationships: Investigating positive and negative attitudes towards violent protest within the same social movement
AN  - 1910298162
AB  - Social relationships play a vitally important role in enabling political mobilization because they link people into networks of trusted others and they provide a sense of belonging, affirmation and sense of purpose. It is much less clear, however, why some individuals who are socially connected with individuals with positive attitudes towards violence, and who experience the same structural conditions, do not themselves have the same attitudes. This article investigates this research question by presenting original data from two networks of individuals with positive and negative attitudes towards violence in Italy, exploring the factors that might explain why some individuals reject violent protest despite having crucial bonds (i.e. friendship, kinship or romantic relationship) with individuals who have positive attitudes towards violence and despite belonging to the same social movement. The findings suggest that individuals with positive attitudes towards violence tend to have narrower and less sophisticated political views, are less professionally engaged, and are more driven by the search for meaning in life than individuals who reject violence.

T1  - Patterns of criminal threat in television news coverage of ethnic minorities in Flanders (2003-2013)
AN  - 2076970393
AB  - Despite a strong cognitive association in the minds of native citizens between ethnic minority presence and crime, compelling evidence demonstrating a real-world relationship between crime and ethnic diversity is limited. This study adopts a media-based approach to contribute to the debate on the origin of the perception of criminal threats. By means of a content analysis of 11 years of crime news (2003-2013) in Flanders (the northern, Dutch-speaking part of Belgium), portrayals of ethnic minority and majority perpetrators are systematically compared to assess whether ethnic minorities are portrayed in a significantly more threatening way. Moreover, building on ethnic hierarchy theories, comparisons are made between various outgroups. Findings demonstrate that ethnic minority perpetrators are depicted in a more threatening manner: they are more likely to be associated with violent, property, and gang-related crime. Additionally, they are more likely to be anonymised and to be associated with explicit manifestations of threat. Group differences exist, however, as the most distant outgroup (i.e. North Africans) is covered in a more threatening way than the other outgroups. Implications for intergroup relations are discussed.

T1  - Justice Concerns Can Feed Nationalistic Concerns and Impede Solidarity in the Euro Crisis: How Victim Sensitivity Translates into Political Attitudes
AN  - 1877051943
AB  - We investigated how victim sensitivity and news media exposure conjointly contribute to the formation of political attitudes in the context of the euro crisis. Study 1 (N = 208) showed that observer-sensitive individuals were more likely and victim-sensitive individuals were less likely to support solidarity with countries in need of financial support. These correlations were mediated by affective components of political attitudes, namely nationalistic concerns, resentment about and empathic concerns with debtor countries. In Study 2 (N = 51), using a pre-post within-subjects design, we showed that framing the euro crisis in an 'exploitation frame" (compared to a 'solidarity frame') in news media reports was more likely to trigger nationalistic concerns and, consequently, decrease support of solidarity in victim-sensitive individuals compared to their less victim-sensitive counterparts. These results are in line with the SeMI model and previous findings that victim sensitivity is linked to fear of being exploited in intergroup relations.

T1  - Evolving Opinions: Evidence on Marriage Equality Attitudes from Panel Data
AN  - 1871873507
AB  - Objective 
In the wake of a massive shift in public opinion on same-sex marriage, scholars have examined the factors that predict support of marriage equality. This research, largely from cross-sectional or trend data, leaves questionable evidence for causality. In this research note, we use newly available panel data to predict attitudes toward marriage equality. 
Methods 
We use three three-wave panels of survey data from the General Social Survey (2006-2014) to estimate the effects of both time-variant and nonvariant characteristics on attitudes toward marriage equality. 
Results 
Using time-variant factors, we support prior research, finding evidence for the causal effect of political views and time period on attitudes. Unlike earlier research, we find no significant effect of church attendance or marital or parental status. Among invariant characteristics, we largely support prior research on the effect of demographic characteristics on attitudes. 
Conclusion 
This analysis underscores the importance of using longitudinal data to support causal inferences and augment cross-sectional research on political attitudes.

T1  - Racial equality in France and the United States: media coverage of professional tennis players
AN  - 1864677581
AB  - I engage debates about racial media bias by analysing newspaper coverage of professional tennis players in France and the United States. Tennis is an elite sport that typically does not have many non-white players and may be especially sensitive to racial boundaries. Tennis also offers a new solution to the methodological challenge of establishing that any difference in newspaper coverage across racial groups is due to bias and not actual differences across the groups. I use the professional tennis ranking system, which assigns an objective marker of how good a player is (and therefore the media coverage that s/he should receive) at any point in time. I explore two types of bias (the amount and tone of media coverage) and uncover no systematic racial differences in the relationship between ranking and media coverage. My findings have several implications for our understanding of racial boundaries and the media.

T1  - The Komagata Through a Media Lens: Racial, Economic, and Political Threat in Newspaper Coverage of the 1914 Komagata Maru Affair
AN  - 1897672802
AB  - As part of its 'white Canada' policy, Canadian officials denied entry to 376 Indian immigrants who arrived aboard the Komagata Maru in 1914. Although the Komagata Maru affair was among the first Canadian immigration controversies to generate international media coverage, little is known about the nature of this coverage. In this paper, we examine the extent to which media coverage of the event reflected a range of racial (Orientalism; Canada's white destiny), political (the British Empire and Indian nationalism), and economic threat (economic depression, wage competition) ideologies. Our analysis of 193 newspaper articles published between May 5th and July 30th, 1914 finds that most articles emphasize the political implications, followed by race, and then by economic competition. By portraying the passengers not only as radicals but also as threats to the very fabric of the British Empire, the media delegitimized the migrants' claims to move freely within it. Alternate abstract:Dans le cadre de sa politique sur le ''Canada Blanc'', les fonctionnaires canadiens ont refusé l'entrée de 376 immigrants indiens arrivés à bord de Komagata Maru en 1914. Bien que l'affaire Komagata Maru fût l'une des premières controverses de l'immigration canadienne à susciter la couverture médiatique internationale, on connait peu dans la nature de cette couverture. Dans cet article, nous examinons comment la couverture médiatique d'un évènement peut avoir des retombées idéologiques d'ordre raciale (orientalisme, destinée du Canada blanc) ; politique (l'empire britannique et nationalisme indien) ; et menaces économiques (dépression économique, compétition salariale). Notre analyse de 193 articles de journaux publiés entre le 5 mai et le 30 juillet 1914, démontre que la majorité des articles insiste sur les implications politiques, suivies par la race et puis par la compétition économique. En représentant les passagers non seulement comme des radicaux, mais aussi comme des menaces pour le très construit empire britannique, les media délégitiment les revendications des migrants de circuler librement dans le pays.

T1  - Social Network Sites and Political Engagement: Exploring the Impact of Facebook Connections and Uses on Political Protest and Participation
AN  - 1806575515
AB  - Past studies have shown positive relationships between use of social network sites (SNSs) and political engagement, but an understanding of the mechanisms underlying the relationship is limited because the studies often did not take into account the diverse affordances of SNSs that can influence participation in different ways. Adopting the O-S-R-O-R (Orientation-Stimulus-Reasoning-Orientation-Response) model of political communication effects, this study examined the roles of Facebook network size, connections with public political actors, use for news, and political expression on political attitudes, protest, and participation. Structural equation analyses were conducted based on data from a national sample in Hong Kong, a city-state with one of the world's highest Facebook penetration rates. Results showed that Facebook network size and connections with public political actors exhibit both direct and indirect effects on participation through Facebook news, expression, and efficacy. Facebook news exhibited indirect effects primarily though political expression. A discriminant function analysis also showed that age, education, and online news exposure were the most influential variables for distinguishing Facebook users and nonusers. Implications of the findings are discussed.

T1  - Does media coverage influence public attitudes towards welfare recipients? The impact of the 2011 English riots
AN  - 1795388644
AB  - Following the shooting of Mark Duggan by police on 4 August 2011, there were riots in many large cities in the UK. As the rioting was widely perceived to be perpetrated by the urban poor, links were quickly made with Britain's welfare policies. In this paper, we examine whether the riots, and the subsequent media coverage, influenced attitudes toward welfare recipients. Using the British Social Attitudes survey, we use multivariate difference-in-differences regression models to compare attitudes toward welfare recipients among those interviewed before (pre-intervention: i.e. prior to 6 August) and after (post-intervention: 10 August-10 September) the riots occurred (N=3,311). We use variation in exposure to the media coverage to test theories of media persuasion in the context of attitudes toward welfare recipients. Before the riots, there were no significant differences between newspaper readers and non-readers in their attitudes towards welfare recipients. However, after the riots, attitudes diverged. Newspaper readers became more likely than non-readers to believe that those on welfare did not really deserve help, that the unemployed could find a job if they wanted to and that those on the dole were being dishonest in claiming benefits. Although the divergence was clearest between right-leaning newspaper and non-newspaper readers, we do not a find statistically significant difference between right- and left-leaning newspapers. These results suggest that media coverage of the riots influenced attitudes towards welfare recipients; specifically, newspaper coverage of the riots increased the likelihood that readers of the print media expressed negative attitudes towards welfare recipients when compared with the rest of the population.

T1  - Do Amoral Familism and Political Distrust Really Affect North-South Differences in Italy?
AN  - 1789786343
AB  - Especially in southern Italy, Banfield's amoral familism is considered an obstacle to the formation of associations and growth of political participation. This article discusses Banfield's concept, showing that it has been vulgarized merely as familism and, in particular, demonstrates that Banfield intended amoral familism to be understood in terms of political distrust. We investigated whether amoral familism or political distrust, operationalized as an individual difference variable, mediated the relationships between personality traits, personal values, and conventional and unconventional political acts, controlling for differences in political attitude. We recruited 405 participants, distributed across north, central, and southern Italy, to complete a questionnaire on political participation that also assessed Big Five personality factors, values, sociability and political attitude (expertise, interest, self-efficacy), and a new scale assessing amoral familism as a form of political distrust. Regression analyses were used to identify the best predictors of political acts, then structural equation modeling was used to test a model of political participation. Like political attitudes, familism mediated the relationships between personality traits, especially "openness to experience" and "taking conventional and unconventional political acts." However, our data do not confirm the stereotype that northern and southern Italians differ in their tendency to amoral familism as defined by Banfield.

T1  - The Scary World of Online News? Internet News Exposure and Public Attitudes Toward Crime and Justice
AN  - 1787236885
AB  - Objectives
 A substantial body of literature indicates that certain forms of media consumption may increase anxiety about crime and support for social controls. However, few studies have examined whether Internet news consumption is positively associated with such attitudes. The void is significant given the public's increasing use of online news sources. This study addresses this research gap.
Methods
We draw on data from four national surveys conducted between 2007 and 2013, which collectively include interviews with more than 13,000 Americans. Using OLS and logistic regression, we assess the relationships between exposure to traditional and online media and perceptions of victimization risk, support for punitive crime policies, and views about police powers.
Results
Consistent with prior work, we find positive relationships between exposure to traditional forms of media--television news and crime programming--and anxiety about victimization and support for harsh crime policies. In contrast, Internet news exposure is generally not associated with anxieties about crime or support for getting tough on criminals. However, there is evidence of an interactive relationship between political ideology and Internet news exposure.
Conclusions
The results provide little support for cultivation theory in the context of Internet news consumption. We discuss the import of our findings, and suggest new lines of research to explore the correlates and the effects of exposure to online news sources.

T1  - Muslim neighbors or an Islamic threat? A constructionist framing analysis of newspaper coverage of mosque controversies
AN  - 1791353920
AB  - In recent years, growing communities of Muslim-Americans have faced tension in a series of debates over the construction of Islamic prayer spaces in American cities. Islamic community members have found themselves fighting for representation within the political process and for their philosophical right to exist within American society. This study presents a framing analysis of the debate in five US newspapers between 2010 and 2013 as a way of examining the position of Muslims within contemporary American society. The study examines five frames: Local Regulation, Legal Authority, Political Debate, Muslim Neighbors, and Islamic Threat. The first three were episodic frames, while the other two were thematic. Some of the discourse showed evidence of Islamophobia, or indiscriminate negative attitudes or emotions directed at Islam or Muslims. Other stories showed evidence of Islamophilia, which is the stereotypical presentation of 'good Muslims' who are model citizens in contrast to the 'bad Muslims' who serve as rhetorical enemies.

T1  - Constructing Immigrants: Portrayals of Migrant Groups in British National Newspapers, 2010-2012: IMR
AN  - 1774373704
AB  - Public opposition to immigration in Britain reflects perceptions of immigrants that focus disproportionately on "illegal" immigration and asylum seekers, rather than more numerous workers, students, and family members. This study examines coverage of immigration in the British national press, to see whether press portrayals of migrants provide a basis for these images of immigration underlying public attitudes. We use corpus linguistic methods to analyze 43 million words of news from 2010 to 2012. Among other findings, we show that press portrayals match public perceptions of migrants, with "illegal immigrants" and "failed asylum seekers" as predominant depictions in broadsheet and tabloid newspapers.

T1  - It's The Sun Wot Won It': Evidence of media influence on political attitudes and voting from a UK quasi-natural experiment
AN  - 1770928594
AB  - Do print media significantly impact political attitudes and party identification? To examine this question, we draw on a rare quasi-natural experiment that occurred when The Sun, a right-leaning UK tabloid, shifted its support to the Labour party in 1997 and back to the Conservative party in 2010. We compared changes in party identification and political attitudes among Sun readers with non-readers and other newspaper readerships. We find that The Sun's endorsements were associated with a significant increase in readers' support for Labour in 1997, approximately 525,000 votes, and its switch back was associated with about 550,000 extra votes for the Conservatives in 2010. Although we observed changes in readers' party preference, there was no effect on underlying political preferences. The magnitude of these changes, about 2% of the popular vote, would have been unable to alter the outcome of the 1997 General Election, but may have affected the 2010 Election.

T1  - Social networking in an academic conference context: insights from a case study
AN  - 2093342813
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to propose a conference-based online social network (OSN) for academics’ knowledge sharing and collaboration around and beyond a conference, while exploring the entanglement of the social and technical aspects of the system. Design/methodology/approach – Following an exploratory study, an OSN prototype was developed and implemented in ECIS 2014. The usage of the OSN platform was monitored and in-depth interviews were conducted with seven of its active users. Findings – Academic researchers have positive attitudes toward using conference-based OSN. However, there is a gap between academics’ perceptions and their actual behavior. Several barriers for engagement were identified, leading to technical and social recommendations, including the following needs: integrating the OSN platform with other conference information systems; addressing privacy concerns; allowing on-going collaboration; increasing OSN vitality; using the wisdom of the crowd; and promotion and its timing. Research limitations/implications – The case study highlighted existing benefits, and identified potential future benefits from implementing a conference-based OSN. Future research is required to generalize the findings and evaluate the proposed strategies for enhancing user engagement. Practical implications – This study revealed the set of considerations that should be taken upon launching a new academic OSN, which are beyond the technical issues per se. Social implications – The paper presents the expected benefits from, and existing barriers to using a conference-based OSN, and suggests recommendations for encouraging academics to engage in such OSN, in order to enhance long-term social interactions, knowledge sharing and collaboration among conference participants. Originality/value – This is a first study to examine a conference-based OSN.

T1  - Citizen attitudes towards China's maritime territorial disputes: traditional media and Internet usage as distinctive conduits of political views in China
AN  - 1730766634
AB  - This paper examines the differential impact of Chinese citizens' use of traditional media and Internet sources on their political views about the country's territorial dispute with Japan over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. Chinese citizens can utilize a variety of conduits of information that allow varying degrees of government control over the way foreign affairs and other controversies are presented. Those who rely on mainstream, state-controlled television, radio, and printed media for information on the disputes, and those who turn to less-prescriptive sources on the Internet, can be expected to have distinctive political attitudes. We use original 2013 Chinese survey data to explore patterns of media consumption and citizens' attention levels towards the Sino-Japanese island dispute, and views regarding the government's performance in handling the issue and appropriate policy responses. Those who derive their information from traditional media tend to view the government's performance more positively, and are more likely both to favour compromise and to oppose the use of military force. By comparison, information from Internet sources, which is more user self-selective, sustains a wider range of attitudes about the Sino-Japanese island dispute and the appropriate policies for dealing with it, including both militaristic and moderate stances. All told, we find that Chinese citizens bring distinctive predispositions to their consumption of media information on this issue, but our results also clearly reflect an ongoing, pervasive influence for China's state-run traditional media. These findings have important implications for considering the resilience of authoritarian systems in the Internet era.

T1  - Race and attitudes toward police: the mediating effect of social distance
AN  - 1752994925; 201601142
AB  - Purpose - Given the consistent finding in the literature that members of minority groups hold less favorable views of the police than white citizens, social distance may be an important, yet untested, mediator. The purpose of this paper is to examine the mediating effect of social distance net of other established correlates. Design/methodology/approach - A sample of students attending a university in the northeastern USA completed an online survey in 2013. The survey was about their contact with the police, attitudes toward the police, and lifestyles, among others. Findings - Race, along with other predictors, significantly influenced confidence in police. However, race is the only factor that turns nonsignificant when social distance is included in the model. Mediation tests confirmed that social distance mediates the relationship between race and confidence in the police. Research limitations/implications - To maximize confidence in the police, administrators should focus on closing the social distance between the public and the police through initiatives like community policing. Originality/value - While there is extensive research on public attitudes toward the police, social distance has been neglected as a determinant, despite movements like community policing that promote citizens' relational closeness to the police - that is, to decrease the social distance between police and the public. The current study would be an exploratory study and reference for future studies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Moving Pictures? Experimental Evidence of Cinematic Influence on Political Attitudes
AN  - 1667953640; 201510697
AB  - Objectives Media effects research has generally ignored the possibility that popular films can affect political attitudes. This omission is puzzling for two reasons. First, research on public opinion finds the potential for persuasion is highest when respondents are unaware that political messages are being communicated. Second, multiple studies have found that entertainment media can alter public opinion. Together, this suggests that popular films containing political messages should possess the potential to influence attitudes. Methods We develop a laboratory experiment where subjects were randomly assigned to watch a control movie with no political messages, a movie with subtle political messages, or a movie with strong and explicit political messages. Results We find that popular movies possess the ability to change political attitudes, especially on issues that are unframed by the media. Furthermore, we show such influence persists over time and is not moderated by partisanship, ideology, or political knowledge. Conclusions Our key findings suggest that a renewed scholarly interest in the political influence of popular movies is clearly warranted. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The rejection of science frames in the news coverage of the golden rice experiment in Hunan, China
AN  - 1660023517; 201508075
AB  - In this article, we examine the ways in which media frames and rhetorical devices in the Chinese media shaped the representation of the genetically modified (GM) golden rice. We draw on a study of Chinese media representations of an experiment designed to test the efficacy of golden rice as a source of Vitamin A using school children in China's Hunan province as subjects. The study analysed Chinese web news stories about the Hunan experiment posted between 30 August 2012 (when Greenpeace first reported on the issue) and 30 October 2012. This experiment resulted in allegations of breaches in scientific protocols and created a hostile public reaction. The incident fuelled the long-standing debate about the risks and benefits of GM crops in China. In this article, we analyse 25 online news reports, examining the attitudinal orientation of the articles, the readers' comments on the articles and GM crops, the writing style and rhetorical devices employed, the emotions provoked and the frames manifest and embedded in these articles and comments. We found that although only one-third of the articles manifested an obviously negative attitude towards golden rice and GM foods, their use of strident metaphors and analogies were designed to arouse readers' fear and concerns about GM crops. In the anti-golden rice articles, we identified conspiracy frames, including the view that the West was using genetic engineering to establish global control over agriculture and that GM products were instruments for genocide. The pro-golden rice articles emphasised the scientific humanitarian progress, but it appears to be less attractive to the readers. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Funny, Ha-Ha: The Impact of User-Generated Political Satire on Political Attitudes
AN  - 1494749542; 201403176
AB  - The 2012 election season provided increased opportunities for the collaboration among citizens, new media, and democracy. The 'social media election' saw a rise in online user-generated political content posted to YouTube. These videos, often satirical in nature, were viewed by millions, making the potential impacts from this new form of political communication deserving of inquiry. Using experimental design, this study explored the relationship between user-generated political satire and 'normative' political attitudes. The results revealed that viewing satirical representations of political candidates did not affect individuals' level of political cynicism or political information efficacy; however, perceptions of candidate credibility and favorability were altered.

T1  - Two Sides of the Coin: Assessing the Influence of Social Network Site Use During the 2012 U.S. Presidential Campaign
AN  - 1512218759; 201408398
AB  - The increasing popularity of social network sites (SNSs) in election campaigns provides a unique climate for scholarly inquiry. The study reported here builds upon Zhang, Johnson, Seltzer, and Bichard and investigates the impact of different types of SNS use on voters' attitudes and behavior during the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign. Sites such as Facebook, Google Plus, Twitter, and YouTube are included to offer a robust assessment of distinct relationships. A national online panel of Internet users was utilized to examine reliance on SNSs and the multiple consequences on political attitudes and behavior such as political participation, political interest, selective exposure, selective avoidance, and strength of party affiliation. The findings are evaluated for theoretical and practical implications on democratic governance. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - HIV/AIDS, Social Capital, and Online Social Networks
AN  - 1463013101; 201345783
AB  - The prospects for online social networks as sites of information-gathering and affiliation for persons with AIDS and others concerned about HIV/AIDS not only represent the latest development in a trend toward circumventing traditional media and official information sources, but also may offer hope for a revitalization of HIV/AIDS discourse in the public sphere. This article provides an overview of three decades of information-seeking on the pandemic and its social and personal implications, as well as case studies of three examples of social networking surrounding HIV/AIDS. It finds preliminary evidence of the formation of strong and weak ties as described in Social Network Theory and suggests that the online accumulation of social capital by opinion leaders could facilitate dissemination of messages on HIV/AIDS awareness and testing.

T1  - ICTs changing youths' political attitudes and behaviors in Bangladesh
AN  - 1364702240; 201324741
AB  - This article explains political activism among educated youths in Bangladesh and how information and communication technologies (ICTs) change their political attitudes and behaviors. The findings identify motivations and psychological factors that affect patterns of new media use in political participation. Data from 23 interviewees, alongside those of 69 focus group participants, reveal that Bangladeshi youths increasingly favor forward-looking agendas by rejecting traditional ideology-based party politics. They have a passion for shaping their opinions through social networking instead of processions, party meetings, and political violence. This study finds that youth engagement through virtual communication has no direct impact on political decision-making but may play a pivotal role in some policy-making processes in Bangladesh.

T1  - Media Framing and Public Attitudes Toward Biofuels
AN  - 1347784272; 201319766
AB  - This study investigates the relationship between media framing and public opinion on the issue of biofuels-transportation fuels made from plants, animal products, or organic waste. First, the paper investigates how media framing of biofuels has changed since the issue regained national prominence in the early 2000s. Through a detailed content analysis of newspaper coverage, the paper documents an increase in negative frames between 1999 and 2008, especially frames focusing on the negative economic effects of biofuels on consumers. Second, using data from a 2010 Internet survey of a random sample of the U.S. public, the paper analyzes the relative influence of these new media frames on public attitudes toward biofuels compared with other common predictors of public opinion, such as party ID, regional economic interests, and personal identity as an environmentalist. In general, the results confirm that public attitudes toward biofuels appear to be shaped by these new media frames, especially among those who indicate a high degree of attention to the media, suggesting the relative importance of framing effects on policy attitudes for environmental and energy policies in general.

T1  - Black, Greek, and read all over: newspaper coverage of African-American fraternities and sororities, 1980-2009
AN  - 1322723566; 201310769
AB  - Moving out of the shadows of their secret roots, African-American fraternities and sororities or 'Black Greek-Letter Organizations' (BGLOs) have recently witnessed an explosion of attention. From Hollywood depictions to academic scholarship, BGLOs' form and function, in a world increasingly hailed as 'post-racial', is increasingly interrogated. Activists, members, and scholars commonly argue that BGLOs suffer from a dearth of quality media representation; they are propelled into mainstream discourse only in relation to tales of violent hazing or coverage of stepping. Yet, no empirical work to date has considered this topic. Moreover, given current theoretical debates over either the one-sided framing or the fragmented state of racial media representations, we examine a random sample of the last thirty years of US newspaper articles on BGLOs (N = 1,917). While findings are mixed, we illuminate clear patterns that simultaneously constrain and enable the representation of BGLOs and African-American civic participation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Can Emotion Regulation Change Political Attitudes in Intractable Conflicts? From the Laboratory to the Field
AN  - 1448995463; 201343617
AB  - We hypothesized that an adaptive form of emotion regulation -- cognitive reappraisal -- would decrease negative emotion and increase support for conflict-resolution policies. In Study 1, Israeli participants were invited to a laboratory session in which they were randomly assigned to either a cognitive-reappraisal condition or a control condition; they were then presented with anger-inducing information related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Participants in the reappraisal condition were more supportive of conciliatory policies and less supportive of aggressive policies compared with participants in the control condition. In Study 2, we replicated these findings in responses to a real political event (the recent Palestinian bid for United Nations recognition). When assessed 1 week after training, participants trained in cognitive reappraisal showed greater support for conciliatory policies and less support for aggressive policies toward Palestinians compared with participants in a control condition. These effects persisted when participants were reassessed 5 months after training, and at both time points, negative emotion mediated the effects of reappraisal. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Diaspora Basques and Online Social Networks: An Analysis of Users of Basque Institutional Diaspora Groups on Facebook
AN  - 1347781107; 201318850
AB  - This paper presents the results of original user-based research regarding the Basque diaspora presence on social network sites (SNSs). It is the first academic investigation on the users of Basque diaspora-association groups on Facebook, the largest SNS on the Web. It focuses on the online and offline dimensions of the Basque institutional diaspora presence on the World Wide Web. By concentrating on the Basque diaspora case, I draw attention to the implications that information and communication technologies (ICTs) have on international migrant diasporas, with particular emphasis on how migrant associations and their members perform in a bid to accomplish their activities and goals. The present work opens new venues for future multi- and interdisciplinary analysis as well as comparative and longitudinal studies that could clearly be of interest to researchers, scholars and students of migration and ICTs.

T1  - How Conservative Are Evolutionary Anthropologists?
AN  - 1266146091; 201300070
AB  - The application of evolutionary theory to human behavior has elicited a variety of critiques, some of which charge that this approach expresses or encourages conservative or reactionary political agendas. In a survey of graduate students in psychology, Tybur, Miller, and Gangestad (Human Nature, 18, 313-328, 2007) found that the political attitudes of those who use an evolutionary approach did not differ from those of other psychology grad students. Here, we present results from a directed online survey of a broad sample of graduate students in anthropology that assays political views. We found that evolutionary anthropology graduate students were very liberal in their political beliefs, overwhelmingly voted for a liberal U.S. presidential candidate in the 2008 election, and identified with liberal political parties; in this, they were almost indistinguishable from non-evolutionary anthropology students. Our results contradict the view that evolutionary anthropologists hold conservative or reactionary political views. We discuss some possible reasons for the persistence of this view in terms of the sociology of science. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - News Framing and Public Opinion: A Mediation Analysis of Framing Effects on Political Attitudes
AN  - 1567046877; 201435894
AB  - There is no satisfactory account of the psychological processes that mediate a news framing effect. Based on an experimental study (N = 1,537), this article presents a mediation analysis of a news framing effect on opinion, testing for two important mediation processes: belief importance and belief content change. Results show that framing is mediated by both belief importance and belief content, with belief content being the more prominent variable. The extent to which each process takes effect depends on a person's level of political knowledge. Knowledgeable individuals are affected to a greater extent via both belief content and belief importance change. . Adapted from the source document.

AB  - This article examines the narrative discourses that shape representations of disability in newspapers in postsocialist Ukraine, arguing that narratives about disability are linked to a meta-discourse of 'transition' that emphasizes disorder. Further, newspaper coverage prescribes competing and contradictory models of citizenship and personhood for postsocialist subjects living with disabilities. The article offers recommendations for improving press coverage of disability issues. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'The Shame Games': a textual analysis of Western press coverage of the Commonwealth Games in India
AN  - 1283639849; 201304136
AB  - This study examines the news coverage of the Commonwealth Games in India in major newspapers in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. Textual analysis of news articles reveals a heavy focus on issues of mismanagement and deficiencies in game preparations, and the use of negative stereotypes of India. The article draws attention to the bias in coverage of events in developing countries and calls attention to the hegemonic function of the Western press in perpetuating old social attitudes and prejudices that undermine the success and achievements of events in developing countries like India.

T1  - Rebuilding or Intruding? Media Coverage and Public Opinion on Latino Immigration in Post-Katrina Louisiana
AN  - 1283639664; 201304253
AB  - Objectives: Few studies fully integrate the interactive effects of political, geographic, and media contexts into studies of public opinion on immigration. We rectify this by utilizing the post-Katrina Latino immigrant migration to Louisiana as an opportunity for study of these relationships. Methods: We utilize survey data and content analysis of news coverage to examine the influence of news exposure on attitudes toward immigrants and immigration. Results: Exposure to immigration news influences the relative importance of immigration to other issues, self-reported personal contact with Spanish-speaking populations, and perceptions of the legal status of immigrant populations. Conclusions: Local news coverage of immigration increases awareness and concern about immigration and heightened news exposure increases perceptions about personal interactions with Spanish-speaking populations. Additionally, local news coverage of immigration influences the importance of key characteristics of immigrant populations, particularly whether immigrants are here illegally. Tone of coverage, as opposed to amount, exerts the more consistent effect on immigration-related attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Covering the crisis: Media coverage of the economic crisis and citizens' economic expectations
AN  - 919905066; 201202004
AB  - The 2008-2009 worldwide economic crisis serves as a backdrop to this study of the dynamics of citizens' economic expectations. Economic expectations are identified as crucial for a range of political attitudes. This study is the first to consider how information affects evaluations in times of a severe crisis, as prior research of information effects on economic evaluations took place in more stable economic times. It links citizens' news exposure and the content of economic news coverage with changes in prospective economic assessments. Drawing on a three-wave panel study and on a media content analysis between the panel waves, we thus provide a dynamic assessment of media influences on changes in economic evaluations. The results demonstrate that media exposure strongly affected expectations regarding the future development of the national economic situation, while being largely unrelated to personal economic expectations. We furthermore show that media dependency increases the magnitude of the media effect. We discuss the disconnect between personal and national economic evaluations with regard to mass-mediated economic information. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Personality traits, political attitudes and the propensity to vote
AN  - 857515437
AB  - Abstract

              
This article examines the link between personality traits, political attitudes and the propensity to vote in elections, using an Internet panel survey conducted in two Canadian provinces at the time of the 2008 federal election and the subsequent provincial elections. It first establishes that the two most proximate attitudes that shape one's propensity to vote are political interest and sense of civic duty. The article then look at specific personality traits (altruism, shyness, efficacy and conflict avoidance) that could affect level of political interest, civic duty and the propensity to vote in elections. In the last part of the analysis, a model is proposed and tested, according to which the impact of personality traits is indirect, being mediated by interest and duty. The article shows that the data are consistent with such an interpretation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Perceived Threats and Latino Immigrant Attitudes: How White and African American College Students Respond to News Coverage of Latino Immigrants
AN  - 870433272; 201114491
AB  - A survey of 326 White and African American college respondents examined the relationship among perceptions of news coverage of Latino immigrants, perceived threats, and attitudes toward Latino immigrants. Perceived negative news images of Latino immigrants were associated with greater perceived threats, which were related to White and African American respondents' negative immigrant attitudes. Negative news perception also predicted unfavorable Latino immigrant attitudes. The study also suggested that perceived accuracy of negative immigrant news affected perceived threats. There was no racial difference in these response patterns. Findings are discussed in light of intergroup threat and social identity theory. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A multidimensional approach to identity: Religious and cultural identity in young Jewish Canadians
AN  - 852897996; 201103082
AB  - This study used an online questionnaire to explore the relations among different dimensions of religious and cultural Jewish identity in young Canadian adults (N = 258). We investigated the extent to which three aspects of Jewish identity-religious identity, cultural identity, and identity salience- predicted openness to interfaith relationships and sociopolitical attitudes related to Israel. Results showed that compared to participants who self-identified as cultural Jews, those who self-identified as religious Jews or as both religious and cultural Jews scored higher on measures of cultural and religious identification. Moreover, relative to culturally identified Jews, religious and religious/cultural Jews were less open to interfaith relationships, endorsed more right-wing political attitudes with respect to Israel's foreign policy, and reported that their Jewish identity was more salient than their Canadian identity in identity-relevant situations. Similarly, relative to Jews of other denominations, Orthodox Jews reported higher levels of Jewish identification, greater salience of their Jewish identity, and advocated more right-wing political views.

T1  - 'Newsworthy' Victims? : Exploring differences in Canadian local press coverage of missing/murdered Aboriginal and White women
AN  - 852898599; 201103243
AB  - More than 500 Aboriginal women have gone missing or been murdered in Canada since the 1980s yet press attention to this violence is relatively minimal. This paper compares local press coverage of matched cases: three missing/murdered Aboriginal women from Saskatchewan and three missing/murdered White women from Ontario. Quantitative and qualitative content analyses indicate stark disparities in the amount and content of coverage between groups. The Aboriginal women received three and a half times less coverage; their articles were shorter and less likely to appear on the front page. Depictions of the Aboriginal women were also more detached in tone and scant in detail in contrast to the more intimate portraits of the White women. Drawing on feminist media studies and theories of intersectionality, this paper argues that the simultaneous devaluation of Aboriginal womanhood and idealization of middle-class White womanhood contributes to broader systemic inequalities which re/produce racism, sexism, classism, and colonialism. This paper raises concerns about the broader implications of the relative invisibility of missing/murdered Aboriginal women in the press, and their symbolic annihilation from the Canadian social landscape.

T1  - Different Meanings of the Social Dominance Orientation Concept: Predicting Political Attitudes Over Time
AN  - 754040781; 201049623
AB  - We examined predictors of political attitude change by assessing the independent and interactive effect of social dominance orientation (SDO) as a context-dependent versus an individual difference construct. In a longitudinal study, British students' political orientation was assessed before entering university (T1) and after being at university for 2 months (T2) and 6 months (T3; N=109). Results showed that initial SDO (T1) did not predict political attitudes change nor did it predict self-selected entry into course with hierarchy enhancing or hierarchy-attenuating ideologies. More support was obtained for a contextually determined model whereby SDO (T2) mediated the relationship between social class (T1) and political attitude change (T3). We also found support for mediated moderation in accounting for effects of initial SDO on political attitude change. Findings suggest that SDO as a concept that is sensitive to group dynamics is best suited to explain shifts in political attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Not Necessarily the News: Does Fictional Television Influence Real-World Policy Preferences?
AN  - 743067373; 201027635
AB  - Scholarly studies of the impact of TV on political attitudes have focused almost exclusively on news & political talk shows. The assumption that political perceptions & policy positions are not affected by fictional programs is challenged. It is noted that many TV dramas draw their plots from real-life events. In addition, those who primarily watch fictional programming tend not to be as informed, partisan, or politically involved as heavy viewers of news/political shows. An experimental design was used to test the hypothesis that narratives suggesting a favorable/unfavorable depiction of some target will influence political attitudes in a certain direction. Data were obtained between January 12, 2005 & January 11, 2006 from questionnaires completed by 86 adults (not students) before & after watching one of two episodes of "Law & Order" that presented a positive & a negative portrayal of the criminal justice system respectively. The methodology is described. The results confirmed that fictional content affect a viewer's political attitude & policy positions. Suggestions are made for future research. Figures, References. J.

T1  - The Revolution Will be Networked: The Influence of Social Networking Sites on Political Attitudes and Behavior
AN  - 60349482; 201012772
AB  - Social networking is a phenomenon of interest to many scholars. While most of the recent research on social networking sites has focused on user characteristics, very few studies have examined their roles in engaging people in the democratic process. This paper relies on a telephone survey of Southwest residents to examine the extent to which reliance on social networking sites such as Facebook, MySpace and YouTube has engaged citizens in civic and political activities. More specifically, this study looks at the extent to which social networking sites influence political attitudes and democratic participation after controlling for demographic variables and the role of interpersonal political discussion in stimulating citizen participation. The findings indicate that reliance on social networking sites is significantly related to increased civic participation, but not political participation. Interpersonal discussion fosters both civic participation and political activity. Implications of the results for democratic governance will be discussed.
