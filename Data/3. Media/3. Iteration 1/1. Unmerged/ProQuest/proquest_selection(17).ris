T1  - ‘Swamped by Muslims’ and facing an ‘African gang’ problem: racialized and religious media representations in Australia: Journal of Media & Cultural Studies
AN  - 2574124522
AB  - Despite the implementation of multicultural policies since the 1970s, anxiety over cultural and religious ‘others’ continue to challenge Australia’s diversifying national identity. Problematic media representations of racial and religious minorities persist in Australia and continue to shape public perceptions and political discourses on issues of migration and intercultural relations. This paper examines how Muslims and Africans are contemporary scapegoats of Australian anxieties. These fears continue to be present in racialized rhetoric and attacks on Chinese Australians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Applying discourse analysis on two recent case studies as illustrative examples – the 2018 Bourke Street attack and the so-called ‘African gangs’ – this paper argues that despite substantial research and critique, mainstream media continue to rely on familiar and problematic tropes for framing racial and religious minorities that dehumanize them based on essentialized characteristics of crime, violence and anti-social behaviour. These characteristics tend to be exploited for political gain, with Muslims and Africans portrayed as a disruption to social cohesion and national security. A critique of the role of media and political discourses is presented, as they remain critical instruments in the pursuit of a new ethics of openness, respect and mutual understanding, which are fundamental to living well with difference.

T1  - Technological and analytical advancements in intergroup contact research
AN  - 2509236494
AB  - The prolific expansion of intergroup contact research has established that intergroup interactions are tightly linked to social integration. In this review, recent technological and statistical innovations with the potential to advance this body of research are presented. First, concerns over the validity of longitudinal models are discussed before innovative analytical techniques are introduced that explore change over time. Next, intensive repeated measure designs, such as experience sampling approaches, are introduced as opportunities to investigate the day‐to‐day lives of individuals. Virtual reality technology is then presented as another means to examine naturalistic contact experiences in the laboratory, offering researchers an unrivaled capacity to induce uncommon contact experiences. Finally, we propose that additional sources of contextual data, such as competing media messages, could extend these models in innovative ways by accounting for the time and place surrounding intergroup contact. Similarly, longitudinal social network analysis can provide additional contextual information by considering the broader network environment in which contact occurs. We describe these innovations with the intention of spurring future research that will advance our understanding of how intergroup contact can be used to improve our societies. Thus, we conclude with a discussion on how to bridge divides between researchers and practitioners.

T1  - Intergroup contact moderates the influence of social norms on prejudice: GPIR
AN  - 2390112262
AB  - While previous research has examined social norms and intergroup contact as predictors of prejudice, there is limited research on their interplay in shaping intergroup attitudes. The results of five studies using correlational and experimental methods in different intergroup contexts consistently showed that the influence of intolerant (vs. tolerant) social norms on prejudice is reduced for people who have contacts with outgroup members. Studies 4–5 further showed that threat perceptions mediate the interaction effects between norms and contact on prejudice. Overall, the research program suggests that intergroup contact is a potent tool for reducing conformity to intolerant and antiegalitarian norms.

T1  - Economic Vulnerability, Cultural Decline, and Nativism: Contingent and Indirect Effects
AN  - 2190948013
AB  - ObjectiveNativism, or anti‐immigrant preferences, is increasingly evident within democratic mass publics. In this article, we explore whether economic concerns, perceptions of social decline, or some combination of the two shape these attitudes.MethodOur data are comprised of more than 8,000 survey respondents from nine Western, industrial democracies (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Sweden, and the United States). Using mediation analysis, we test for the extent to which economic anxiety and perceptions of cultural decline exert direct and indirect effects on nativism.ResultsOn balance, the effect of economic anxiety—concern regarding job loss and negative economic assessments—on nativism is mostly indirect, affecting nativism by influencing perceptions of cultural decline.ConclusionGiven the strong association between perceptions of social decline and nativism, it appears as though anti‐immigrant sentiments draw from cultural rather than economic concerns. The story, however, does not end there. Perceptions of societal decline are strongly influenced by economic anxiety.

T1  - Space and personal contacts: Cross-group interaction between mainland and local university students in Hong Kong
AN  - 2154580823
AB  - Despite sharing physical space that supports contact with out-group members and institutional arrangements that encourage cross-group interaction, many university students still congregate within their own groups. To explain this phenomenon, this study examines the micro-level social processes that prevent or facilitate intergroup interaction. A qualitative study of Mainland Chinese and local university students in Hong Kong reveals that students lack opportunities for mutually engaging experiences across multiple points in time due to fragmented daily living space, defended interpersonal space, and politicized online space, which contribute to the absence of cross-group interactions. Cross-group friendships depend on external forces to remove inhibitions, which then allow emotional bonding. This study contributes to the understanding of cross-group interaction by pointing out the importance of daily routine activities and mutually engaging experiences in influencing cross-group interaction among students.

T1  - A Rose by Any Other Name? A Subtle Linguistic Cue Impacts Anger and Corresponding Policy Support in Intractable Conflict
AN  - 2052688577
AB  - Given the central role of anger in shaping adversarial policy preferences in the context of intergroup conflict, its reduction may promote conflict resolution. In the current work, we drew on psycholinguistic research on the role of language in generating emotions to explore a novel, extremely subtle means of intervention. Specifically, we hypothesized that phrasing conflict-relevant policies in noun form (vs. verb form) would reduce anger and impact policy support correspondingly. Results across three experimental studies in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict supported these expectations for both support for concessions (Studies 1–3) and retaliatory policies (Study 3), with reduction in anger mediating the salutary impact of noun form (vs. verb form) on policy support. These results expand our understanding of the influence of language on emotions and policies in the context of conflict and have applied relevance for conflict-resolution efforts.

T1  - Moral foundations of positive and negative intergroup behavior: Moral exclusion fills the gap
AN  - 2085137949
AB  - Personal criteria about the morally appropriate forms of behavior can be crucial when coming into contact with members of culturally different outgroups. In our study, we investigated whether moral exclusion mediates the relationship between moral foundations and positive and negative behavioral intentions toward Muslim people. Our aim was to identify the psychological mechanism that explains why particular people intend to harm (or not harm), and help (or not help) members of particular outgroups. Using survey data from an online questionnaire, structural equation modeling and mediation analysis showed that individualizing moral foundations had a negative relationship with negative behavioral intentions and a positive relationship with positive intentions towards Muslim people. Binding moral foundations showed the opposite connection with behavioral intentions. The relationship between moral foundations and intergroup behavioral intentions was mediated by moral exclusion. These results imply that moral intuitions form the basis of behavioral intentions toward a culturally different outgroup both directly and by influencing whether or not the outgroup is worthy of moral concern.

T1  - Ferguson and the death of Michael Brown on Twitter: #BlackLivesMatter, #TCOT, and the evolution of collective identities
AN  - 1916702433
AB  - Recent events related to police brutality and the evolution of #BlackLivesMatter provides an empirical case to explore the vitality of social media data for social movements and the evolution of collective identities. Social media data provide a portal into how organizing and communicating generate narratives that survive over time. We analyse 31.65 million tweets about Ferguson across four meaningful time periods: the death of Michael Brown, the non-indictment of police officer Darren Wilson, the Department of Justice report on Ferguson, and the one year aftermath of Brown's death. Our analysis shows that #BlackLivesMatter evolved in concert with protests opposing police brutality occurring on the ground. We also show how #TCOT (Top Conservatives on Twitter) has operated as the primary counter narrative to #BlackLivesMatter. We conclude by discussing the implications our research has for the #BlackLivesMatter movement and increased political polarization following the election of Donald Trump.

T1  - A history of white violence tells us attacks on black academics are not ending (I know because it happened to me)
AN  - 1916702201
AB  - This article examines attacks on black academics as an analytical apparatus for connecting histories of U.S. racial violence to the current state of white backlash against black advancement. Through an anatomy of these attacks - of which the author herself was targeted - this essay explores two processes: First, what these attacks do to blackness and, second, what this violence does for whiteness. In the former, this work explains that attacks on black academics are first and foremost anti-black attacks, not dissimilar to attacks on visible African- Americans in other arenas. The intention is to terrorize black progress on the whole. In the latter process, the generative nature of these attacks reproduces collective white identities across region, age, and newly digitized spaces. In the current political moment this digitized mob violence ritualistically reaffirms white hegemony. This essay concludes with an explanation for why the author believes these attacks will continue with regularity.

T1  - Inducing similarities and differences in imagined contact: A mutual intergroup differentiation approach: GPIR
AN  - 1912608992
AB  - To enhance the prejudice-reducing effects of imagined contact we investigated a novel form of imagined contact ("balanced similarity") which emphasized both similarities and differences between the ingroup(er) and the outgroup(er). Experiment 1 compared balanced similarity with conditions inducing only differences or only similarities. "Balanced similarity" led to more positive outgroup attitudes; its differences with the "high similarity" condition were mediated by reduced distinctiveness threat, whereas its differences with the "low" similarity condition were mediated by higher perceived intergroup similarity. Experiment 2 compared the "balanced similarity" imagined contact scenario with the "standard" (positive) imagined contact scenario (Crisp, Stathi, Turner, & Husnu, 2008), and found that both conditions promoted equally favourable attitudes that were significantly more positive than in the control condition. However, only the "balanced similarity" imagined contact condition differed from the control condition on intergroup anxiety and contact self-efficacy. The "balanced similarity" condition also had an indirect effect (via self-efficacy) on positive action tendencies towards the outgroup. We discuss the utility of "balanced similarity" imagined contact, especially where contact is limited and conflict is present.

T1  - Tu Casa, Mi Casa: Naturalization and Belonging among Latino Immigrants: IMR
AN  - 1911516807
AB  - Previous studies reach contradictory conclusions regarding the relationship between residential concentration and naturalization. This paper tackles the impasse by exploring the pathways through which immigrant communities influence individual naturalization. Specifically, this study examines naturalization among Latino immigrants using the 2006 Latino National Survey linked to county data. Multilevel model results indicate that the county concentration of naturalized co-ethnics positively predicts individual naturalization, and this relationship operates through two channels: information dissemination and perceived belonging. Regarding the latter, Latino immigrants who live among naturalized co-ethnics identify more strongly as "American," and strength of American identification mediates nearly one-half of the relationship between concentration and naturalization.

T1  - Identifying Cities or Countries at Risk for Police Violence
AN  - 1929868658
AB  - Police violence is a persistent epidemic plaguing many parts of America for a couple centuries. Police violence is a public health problem. The main principles of public health are to prevent, promote, and protect which is quite similar to the goals of the police. This article analyzes how we can mathematically identify cities and countries at risk for police violence. Analysis of eight selected countries show Brazil with the highest risk and Iceland with the lowest. As for six selected US cities, Chicago had the highest risk while Boise had the lowest. The results of the analysis can push stakeholders to proactively begin interventions for such departments and cities to prevent both systemic structural violence and major incidents of police violence, which when they reach the media bring negative attention to a city and police department.

T1  - Infrastructures for ethnicity: understanding the diversification of contemporary Indonesia
AN  - 1883577267
AB  - Social categories need to be replicated to endure. Commentaries about social practices drive replication. Commentaries increase the number of signs emblematic of this category. In contemporary nation-states, mass education, bureaucratic processes, and mass media create large participation frameworks that facilitate replication. I term these participation frameworks 'infrastructures for ethnicity'. This paper examines two types of infrastructures that have facilitated replication of emblems of ethnicity in Indonesia. My data is drawn from a soap opera, Internet commentaries about this soap, and news stories about clothing and culture. In looking at this data, I examine how old elements that point to 'ethnicity' are combined with new elements, how this new combination invites commentaries, how this process increases the semiotic density of these categories, and how all of this engenders diversity in Indonesia.

T1  - Irish Dancing in Sydney: Global Patterns, Local Practices
AN  - 1923055398
AB  - Irish dancing has undergone global dissemination in a pattern which mirrors the dissipation of Irish citizens to multiple diasporic locations. As was the case in Ireland itself, practices of Irish dancing are grounded in localised contexts: historical, political, economic and social. In Australia, Irish immigrants have a long settlement history, were eventually absorbed into the white majority population, and currently enjoy economic comfort. Irish step dancing became enfranchised through fusion with other genres and the global influence of electronic media. The effects of this positional change were felt not only in Ireland but throughout the world, including Sydney Australia. This paper draws on ethnographic data collected in Sydney to contextualise current Irish dancing practices there. Irish dancing is prominent in the amateur performance arena and is valued by its practitioners for the personal and social benefits it provides. Yet it is firmly situated within the majority populace of white Australians. Studies of Irish dancing practices reflect the social situation of both the dancing itself and the participants who dance it and thus engage with discourses concerning diaspora, community and performance studies.

T1  - Introduction to Special Issue: We March Lest We Forget
AN  - 1892345155
AB  - This timely volume entitled “We March Lest We Forget” not only explores why marching and other forms of social protest matter, but also provides a close look at contemporary race-related commemorations for social justice and/or human rights in the United States. As the essays here investigate contemporary symbolic acts of resistance and their relationship to civil rights commemoration they also explore the degree to which remembering and forgetting civil rights struggles of the past reframes, restates, and re-examines the fight for social justice today. For example, during the week leading up to March 8, 2015 more than 100,000 people gathered to commemorate Bloody Sunday, and the sacrifices people made to ensure that African Americans were permitted voting rights already promised to them via previous legislation. Yet the march was linked in media and popular culture to Ferguson and recent young, Black, male deaths. Present day civil rights activism is in fact an amalgam of struggles for social justice. This special issue is not just about civil rights as an indicator of a 1960s' freedom struggle, but also about all struggles for basic citizen rights since the 1960s.

T1  - Digital belongings: The intersections of social cohesion, connectivity and digital media
AN  - 1871585235
AB  - The rapid proliferation and ongoing transformation of digital technologies and social media platforms have had a substantial influence on the participatory cultures of young people and their associated social connections. This social/digital nexus raises important questions of social cohesion, with digital technologies at once augmenting social interaction whilst simultaneously creating an uneven landscape of access for participation. To address this interface of the digital and the social, this paper presents a qualitative study of 24 tertiary students from ethnic minority backgrounds living in Auckland, New Zealand, who use social media. Incorporating a pre-screening questionnaire, a one-week social media diary and semi-structured interviews, this study presents the ways in which digital belongings influence participants' practices of friendship and family. The ways that connective media influence, and even constrain interaction alongside the politics of belongings, are theorised to further examine the meanings and experiences behind participants' social media usage and social contact. By integrating these ideas, this paper presents the ways in which young university students use social media and the extent to which digital interaction and networking influence social participation and social cohesion.

T1  - Ethnicity, education attainment, media exposure, and prenatal care in Vietnam
AN  - 1840854655
AB  - Objective. Prenatal care coverage in Vietnam has been improving, but ethnic minority women still lag behind in receiving adequate level and type of care. This paper examines ethnic disparities in prenatal care utilization by comparing two groups of ethnic minority and majority women.
Design. We examine the roots of ethnic disparity in prenatal care utilization, focusing on how education and media exposure change health behaviours and lessen disparities. We rely on the 2002 Vietnam Demographic and Health Survey to draw our sample, predictors and the three dimensions of prenatal care, including timing of onset, frequency of visits, and type of provider.
Results. Results from multinomial-, and binary-logistic regression provide evidence that ethnic minority women are less likely to obtain frequent prenatal care and seek care from professional providers than their majority counterparts. However, we find that ethnic minority women are more likely to obtain early care compared to ethnic majority women. Results for predicted probabilities suggest that education and media exposure positively influenced prenatal care behaviours with higher level of education and media exposure associating with accelerated probability of meeting prenatal care requirements.
Conclusion. Our results imply the needs for expansion of media access and schools as well as positive health messages being broadcasted in culturally competent ways.

The present study addresses this issue using data from the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey to examine differences in depression and anxiety among IPV victims in LGB and heterosexual partnerships. The findings indicate LGB IPV victims are much more likely to have a history of depression (OR 1.70, p < .05) and anxiety (OR 1.70, p < .05) than heterosexual victims. These differences are slightly mediated by the victim's perceived emotional support but not the type of abuse experienced. Our findings accentuate the need for greater inclusion of LGB persons in the IPV and mental health discourse, as well as the importance of social support for IPV victims. Policy implications for members of the LGB community are discussed.

T1  - Supporting the democratic political organisation of Muslim immigrants: the perspective of Muslims in the Netherlands and Germany
AN  - 1855096743
AB  - Using data from three survey studies, this paper examines the support for the democratic political organisation of Muslims among Muslim immigrants in the Netherlands (Studies 1, 2, and 3) and Germany (Study 3). Using a social psychological perspective, support is examined in relation to religious group identification, Muslim linked fate, perceived discrimination, fundamentalist religious belief, and host national identification. The findings in all three studies show support for the political organisation of Muslims. Furthermore, higher religious group identification and higher linked fate were associated with stronger support. More discrimination and more fundamentalist beliefs were also associated with stronger support, and part of these associations was mediated by linked fate. National identification was not associated with support for the political organisation of Muslims.

T1  - The Experiences and Meanings That Shape Heterosexual Fathers' Relationships With Their Gay Sons in South Africa
AN  - 1831272779
AB  - Gay men's relationships with their mothers are likely to be more positive than their relationships with their fathers, and fathers are less likely to be told, less likely to be told first, and more likely to react negatively to disclosure than mothers. Drawing on an interpretivist approach, an individual in-depth interview strategy was adopted in the study as a means of gathering data from six Afrikaans-speaking White fathers, between the ages of 53 and 61 years (median: 55.5 years), residing in Gauteng, South Africa. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed for later coding and analysis. Through thematic network analysis, eight organizing themes emerged and were explored. For the purpose of this article only three organizing themes are discussed, namely "subliminal awareness prior to coming out," "epistemic rupture of internal systems of ideas/beliefs," and "acceptance as a complex and ongoing dialectical and reconciliatory process." The themes support the view that most parents are neither totally rejecting nor fully accepting of their gay sons. Although the fathers may have attained a level of "loving denial" in the relationships with their gay sons, most continue to struggle with the meaning and expression of same-sex sexuality. Despite these challenges, it is recognized that the fathers are adapting to changing circumstances and are trying to find ways to tolerate, accommodate, and in some ways accept their gay sons.

T1  - System Justification's Opposite Effects on Psychological Wellbeing: Testing a Moderated Mediation Model in a Gay Men and Lesbian Sample in Chile
AN  - 1827659552
AB  - Those who adhere to system-justifying beliefs benefit from a palliative function that buffers negative effects on psychological wellbeing. This has been consistently observed for high-status groups, whereas for members of low-status groups, it remains rather unclear whether system justification exerts a positive or a negative effect. This study tested the palliative effect of system justification on symptoms of anxiety-depression in a gay men and lesbian sample (N = 467) in Chile. Results from moderated mediation analyses revealed that system justification beliefs buffer symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, system justification enhances anxious and depressive symptoms through internalized homonegativity; this mediation effect was significant for gay men. We pose that justifying the social order comprises two contradictory functions: system justification as a coping source and, otherwise, as a source of distress under conditions of in-group derogation, posing a threat to wellbeing among members of low-status groups (as observed in gay and lesbian individuals). Implications of the opposing effects and gender differences are further discussed in this study.

T1  - 'It's a part of me, I feel naked without it': choice, agency and identity for Muslim women who wear the niqab
AN  - 1801901923
AB  - In the context of heightened suspicion and anti-Muslim stereotypes in a post-9/11 and 7/7 era, Muslim women who wear the niqab (face veil) are stigmatized, criminalized and marked as 'dangerous' to British/Western values. While the wearing of the niqab has elicited a good deal of media, political and public debates, little attention has been paid to the opinions of Muslim women who wear it. Drawing on individual and focus group interviews with Muslim women who wear the niqab in the UK, this article places at the centre of the debate the voices of those women who do wear it, and explores their reasons for adopting it. The findings show that the wearing of the niqab emerges as a personal choice, an expression of religious piety, public modesty and belonging to the 'ummah'. It is also perceived as a form of agency, and non-conformity to Western consumerist culture and lifestyle.

T1  - Constructing interpretive ethnicity in between two nations: television and diasporic discourses of identity in Malaysia
AN  - 1801900875
AB  - This article discusses the interpretation of television in relation to ethnic identity embraced by the female members of Javanese diaspora in Malaysia. The Javanese diaspora in this context refers to the descendants of the colonial Javanese migrants from Indonesia. In contemporary Malaysia, they are considered as Malays, but essentially they retain some cultural identifications of Javanese ethnicity, especially the language. As Malaysia becomes one of the destinations for Indonesian migrant labour and popular culture, the Javanese diaspora are certainly exposed to manifold images of their ethnic origin. Through the audience ethnography in a Javanese community of Selangor, this article reveals that the Malaysian Javanese women negotiate both representative and distant images of Javanese identity on television. Their interpretation of ethnic identity from television represents the notion of 'interpretive ethnicity'.

T1  - Wanting to See People Like Me? Racial and Gender Diversity in Popular Adolescent Television
AN  - 1795436309
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue: Understanding Diversity and Inequality: Dimensions Ranging from Race, Ethnicity, Immigration and Sexual Identity to Social Class 
Media are one source for adolescent identity development and social identity gratifications. Nielsen viewing data across the 2014-2015 television season for adolescents ages 14-17 was used to examine racial and gender diversity in adolescent television exposure. Compared to US Census data, mainstream shows under represent women, but the proportion of Black characters is roughly representative. Black adolescents watch more television than non-Black adolescents and, after taking this into account, shows popular with Black adolescents are more likely than shows popular with non-Black adolescents to exhibit racial diversity. In addition, shows popular with female adolescents are more likely than shows popular with males to exhibit gender diversity. These results support the idea that adolescents seek out media messages with characters that are members of their identity groups, possibly because the characters serve as tools for identity development and social identity gratifications.

T1  - Learning From Philadelphia: Topographies of HIV/AIDS Media Assemblages
AN  - 1768022939
AB  - For this contribution to the special issue on "Mapping Queer Bioethics," the author employs an array of public health and popular media texts (especially Jonathan Demme's film Philadelphia) to challenge the construction and reconstruction of HIV-positive bodies as sites of bioethical concern. In outlining notions of "digital restoration," the author argues that there has been of late a remapping of the first decade of the HIV/AIDS pandemic through media projects assembled from archived materials. Accordingly, the author suggests that in the first decades of the 2000s, we have witnessed a media-archaeological turn, whereby old materials have been reassembled for commemorative purposes that oftentimes perform a reshaping of the topography of the first decade of the AIDS pandemic.

T1  - Dealing with dislocation
AN  - 1791235018
AB  - This article addresses two questions: first, how do communities facing protracted displacement deal with the experience of migration and place-making? Second, how do notions of home mediate this relationship? I approach these questions by taking the case of Kashmiri Pandits, the upper caste Hindu minority of the Kashmir valley, who were displaced due to the outbreak of conflict in Jammu and Kashmir in 1989-90 and a significant section of whom were located in displaced persons' camps during 1990-2011. The article draws upon discussions with Pandits who contrast nostalgia for life in Kashmir with experiences of re-establishing social and political relationships after displacement. Place and migration here are both treated as contexts and products of social activity that involve considerations of objects, physical environment and communal relationships. The article will argue that discussions of place and home are marked by a tension between desires for reclaiming home and security, and the condition of uncertainty faced by groups like Kashmiri Pandits in the present.

T1  - Muslims in Western Media: New Zealand Newspapers' Construction of 2006 Terror Plot at Heathrow Airport and Beyond
AN  - 1752271680
AB  - This study critically examines the representation of the 2006 "suspected aircraft terror plot" at Heathrow Airport in London by three mainstream newspapers in New Zealand -- the Otago Daily Times, the Press (Press) and the New Zealand Herald. It seeks to illustrate how these newspapers espoused an Orientalist view of "Islamic Other" in framing the issue by representing Islam and Muslims as a threat to "the West" as well as to New Zealand. It is argued that in reporting the issue, these newspapers provided extraordinary emphasis on Islamic terrorism that was extrapolated from the event but they maintained their categorical silence when the initial sensationalizing representations were found to be questionable, as evidence did not fully support the scale of the Orientalist representation. In trying to explain this media frenzy, we point to the existential fear of New Zealand society about Islam and Muslims both globally and locally. We argue that this typical media representation aimed at controlling discourses and discursive formations about Islam and Muslims in society by overfeeding media consumers with ideologies so that they do not have an opportunity to internalize alternative discourses.

T1  - Mobilising for Immigrant Rights Online: Performing 'American' National Identity through Symbols of Civic-Economic Participation
AN  - 1784151163
AB  - Increasingly, social movement organisations (SMOs) within the immigrant rights movement mobilise online. Although this seems an unlikely tactic for a movement whose constituents are often on the wrong side of the digital divide, the increasingly frequent use of various communications technologies works to enable communication with other activists and raise awareness among the general public. Utilising a cultural sociological perspective, this article examines the ways in which the immigrant rights movement uses various symbols to perform national identity online. The goal is to put meaning and the process of meaning making squarely at the centre of analytical attention. Building on the multiple traditions perspective on American national identity, the article explores how several national-level SMOs engage symbols to perform immigrants' belonging to the USA.

T1  - Techno-cultural opportunities: The anti-immigration movement in the Finnish mediascape
AN  - 1784145190
AB  - Horsti's article analyses how transformations in the media environment shaped the political success of the anti-immigration movement in Finland from 2003 to 2013. The qualitative textual analysis of blogs and mainstream media debates that relate to racism and the national populist Finns Party demonstrates how changes in the mediascape in general and in new media technology in particular have provided opportunities for the emerging anti-immigration movement. These changes facilitated the earlier development of the Finns Party but the fragmentation of online space later hindered the internal coherence of the movement and its integration into the populist party political family. In order to regain unity, the Finns Party performed the public scapegoating of individuals for racist speech, thus distancing itself from racism. Horsti shows that, rather than being isolated and marginal, the anti-immigration movement and the 'uncivil' public sphere overlap with traditional politics and the mainstream media.

T1  - Ideologies of language and race in US media discourse about the Trayvon Martin shooting
AN  - 1735658528; 201536876
AB  - This article examines the discourse about race and racism that ensued in the US media after the shooting death of an African American youth, Trayvon Martin, by a neighborhood watch volunteer, George Zimmerman, in February 2012. The analysis examines news programs from the three major cable television channels in the United States: CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC. The theoretical framework builds upon Hill's (2008) discussion of the 'folk theory of race and racism' in contrast to critical race theory, and asks, to what extent does the mainstream media's discourse about race remain embedded in folk ideas and to what extent (if at all) does the conversation move beyond those ideas? The paper aims to unpack the ideologies of race and language that underpin talk about race and racism in an effort to expose the hidden assumptions in the discourse that hinder more productive dialogue on the topic.

T1  - 'The Bedoun': Kuwaitis without an Identity
AN  - 1667946906; 201509406
AB  - The Bedoun (stateless/without nationality) in Kuwait constitute a controversial concurrent social, political and legal issue, which was and still is the subject of heated political debate, a vivid example of social conflict, and a platform of extensive legal deliberation concerning its thorny dimensions. The problem of Bedoun is not only politically and socially complex, but it has its problematic legal dimensions, which have made it, since the 1950s, a complex and chronic problem. The recent growing interest in addressing the issue and the extensive strife to determine its degree of complexity and entanglement could be ascribed to the margin of freedom enjoyed in Kuwait more than the rest of the Arabian Gulf states, since active social and political participation constitute the pillars of the democratic system in Kuwait, in light of the growing political and media freedoms and the focus on the Bedoun as a marginalized community legally, politically and socially. Therefore, the current problem of Bedoun constitutes the strongest internal concern for the Kuwaiti authorities and people after the external threats, especially because it has always been ignored or treated as a security issue at times. This study seeks to shed light on the issue of Bedoun to decipher its causes and its historical development until it became a pressing issue at government and community levels in the State of Kuwait. The study will avoid the complex legal and social complexities of the issue. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cossacks and Indians? Métissage in Action
AN  - 1749279459
AB  - In 1914 a sojourner in Winnipeg commented on the city's "Ukrainian Indians" to underline its seeming lack of European sophistication. Some decades later, however, that pejorative connotation was no longer operational: the notion of a "Ukrainian Indian" living in Canada was now something to be celebrated. This dramatic turnabout came with the release in 2012 of a blockbuster "bio-pic" produced in Ukraine. The film ("Fire Crosser") depicts the career of a Soviet Ukrainian hero-fighter pilot, allegedly killed in action during World War Two, but discovered years later alive and well as the Ukrainian-speaking chief of a band of Iroquois not far from Montreal. The decades that separated these two polarities offered many opportunities for ethno-cultural interaction, primarily on the Prairies where the harsh realities of pioneering forced Ukrainian settlers to borrow survival techniques from nearby Aborigines, who were invariably highly attuned to the vicissitudes of the very wilderness that the Ukrainians had come to conquer. Life stories from this initial period of Ukrainian settlement generally describe such early encounters as positive, amiable experiences. A rare exception is the deadly skirmish imagined by the Canadian poet Yar Slavutych. In some instances, however, their proximity to Ukrainian settlements worked against the Aborigines, who unwittingly became convenient scapegoats for criminal acts and missing children. After World War Two, with the "success" of Canada's Ukrainian pioneering experience firmly acknowledged, a new factor surfaced: a Ukrainian empathy for the perceived stagnation and plight of Canada's Aborigines. In actuality, this awareness had been initiated earlier by sojourning writers from Soviet Ukraine; their stories in Ukrainian dramatized the tragic fate of Canada's downtrodden Aboriginal peoples.

T1  - J. Dreby, Divided by Borders: Mexican Migrants and Their Children
AN  - 1680152432; 201514051
AB  - An influential earlier ethnographic study of the gender in the Mexico-US migration process (Hondagneu-Sotelo 1994) included a telling footnote following that author's discovery of the importance of migrants' children in their decisions to return to Mexico or stay in the USA: As I approached the completion of fieldwork for this study, I realized that by not including interviews with children and adolescents, I had overlooked their participation in the migration and resettlement process (p. 226). In contrast, children are at the center of Joanna Dreby's book on the effects of migration on children left behind, on their custodial caregivers (typically the maternal grandmother), and on their migrant fathers and migrant and nonmigrant mothers. Her book offers rich insights into the gender and intergenerational roles and relationships that facilitate and mediate migrations resulting in parent-child separation and reunification.

T1  - How heterogeneous community engage newcomers? The effect of community diversity on newcomers' perception of inclusion: An empirical study in social media service
AN  - 1692289687; 201521416
AB  - Online communities that provide social media services need to engage newcomers so as to not lose them to competitors. This study examines the role of community diversity (in terms of perceived visible dissimilarity, perceived informational dissimilarity and perceived value dissimilarity) in influencing perceived inclusion of newcomers in the online community and the influence of such perception on newcomers' engagement intention. The theoretical background on perceived inclusion is obtained from the optimal distinctiveness theory, which comprises of two dimensions, namely, social identification and perceived uniqueness. The results support the multiple roles of community diversity on a newcomer's perceived inclusion. The findings of this study contribute to a better understanding of the effect of community diversity on newcomers' engagement behavior, and provide recommendations on designing a personalized community diversity environment.

T1  - 'Horse tripping': animal welfare laws and the production of ethnic Mexican illegality
AN  - 1660021343; 201505544
AB  - Conflicts over animal practices have long been used to construct dynamics of power. This essay examines how debates over immigrant animal practices contribute to the production of immigrant 'illegality' in the contemporary USA. I examine laws banning the 'horse tripping' events of the Mexican rodeo enacted in California (1994) and Arizona (2009), situating these laws and related media coverage within the broader landscape of exclusionary anti-immigrant politics. While the activists (including Latinos) who supported the bills were primarily concerned with animal welfare, their concerns were marshalled, out of context and against their will, by nativists who demand border militarization, exclusion and deportation. This essay shows that a range of actors - not just notoriously nativist groups but also Latinos themselves, as well as progressive people and organizations - participate, indirectly and inadvertently, in the production of immigrant illegality.

T1  - 'Why this story over a hundred others of the day?' Five journalists' backstories about writing disability in Toronto
AN  - 1667949921; 201509541
AB  - This interview-based study explores the stories behind current disability-based journalism based on the intersubjective experiences of five Toronto journalists whose lives and work intersect with disability. These discussions are divided into salient categories of attitudes, representation, language, framing, gate-keeping, and communication, followed by a list of recommendations on how to pitch disability-based stories to news media. This study uses a dual lens of disability theory and journalism to open a discussion toward further areas of consideration of this apparent gap between journalists and disability-invested organizations/individuals, and to communicate strategies for researchers, allies, and journalists who seek to learn more about how cultural representations of journalism come to exist as they do. Ultimately, participants encourage a shift from dialogue about disability and journalism to a realization that this dialogue is far from oppositional and players in both fields wish to contribute.

T1  - The Other Brazilians: Community Ambivalences among Brazilians in Sydney
AN  - 1660021155; 201505838
AB  - The migration of Brazilians to Australia is a relatively new phenomenon, and has been increasing since the 1990s. Although an imagined Brazilian community is part of everyday discourses of Brazilians, receiving society and media, this concept is ambivalent. I address the limitations of multiculturalism and its correlated notion of diasporic community to point to other alternatives for understanding communal feelings, nostalgia and homebuilding. This perspective unveils disjunctions between the multiculturalist view of community and the lived experience of communities. I demonstrate the existence of shunning behaviour among Brazilians, and argue that such trend is due to their desire to recover their whiteness, cosmopolitanism and Western ethos in Australia. I also show that Brazilians use identity in a strategic way to work out their integration, such as the uses of a cosmopolitan identity and a pan-Latin American identity. These distinctions show that Brazilians have different degrees of affective investment in the Brazilian culture, belonging and integration strategies. In this light, we ought to think in terms of networking in order to deconstruct simplifications of a migrant community through culturalist explanations. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Between conflict and recognition: The construction of Chilean indigenous policy in the Araucania region
AN  - 1735657713; 201537044
AB  - Since 1990, differentiated policies have been formulated to address the needs of the indigenous population in Chile. These policies pay particular attention to the Araucania Region, a portion of the Mapuche indigenous people's historical territory. The various programmes created as a part of indigenous policy have generated spaces for recognition at the local level. They favour a 'culturalist' vision of Mapuche society and consider any aspect of 'being Mapuche' a value in itself, as well as a source of regional identity and development. Simultaneously, the media has described the Araucania Region as the 'Mapuche conflict' zone because of tensions generated by demands for land, as well as the presence of mega-projects that affect Mapuche communities. This article discusses and analyses the two apparently contradictory factors that constitute a type of complementary policy that has become more entrenched during President Pinera's administration. This policy sets the tone and pace for intercultural relations in the Araucania Region. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - The password is praise: Content of feedback affects categorization of feedback sources
AN  - 1660023683; 201505474
AB  - In three experimental studies, we investigated the effect of the content of group-directed feedback on categorization of the feedback source as an ingroup or an outgroup member. In all studies, feedback valence (criticism vs. praise) and the attributional content of feedback (attributing outcomes to internal properties of the group vs. external circumstances) were experimentally manipulated. The results demonstrated that anonymous (Study 1) and ambiguous (Studies 2 and 3) sources of feedback are more likely to be seen as (typical) ingroup members when they provide praise rather than criticism. In addition, in all studies there was a significant interaction between valence and the attributional content of feedback, such that sources of praise were more likely to be seen as ingroup members when they attributed the group's success to internal (rather than external) causes, while the opposite was observed for critics. These effects were mediated by perceived group image threat. Implications for research on group-based feedback and social categorization are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Secondary transfer effects of intergroup contact via social identity complexity
AN  - 1660023305; 201505477
AB  - Secondary transfer effects (STEs) of intergroup contact refer to the generalization of contact effects from a primary encountered outgroup to attitudes towards secondary outgroups (Pettigrew, 2009). Using two large, cross-sectional data sets from Germany (N = 1,381) and Northern Ireland (N = 1,948), this article examined the extent to which STEs of intergroup contact on attitudes towards a range of secondary outgroups occur via a previously unexplored psychological construct, social identity complexity (operationalized as similarity complexity and overlap complexity). Study 1 found primary outgroup contact to be associated with greater similarity complexity, but no indirect effects on secondary outgroup attitudes via complexity emerged. Study 2, however, revealed indirect positive relationships between primary outgroup contact and secondary outgroup attitudes via increased similarity complexity and overlap complexity. These relationships were obtained while controlling for two previously tested mediating mechanisms, attitude generalization (operationalized as primary outgroup attitude) and deprovincialization (operationalized as ingroup attitude and identification). We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings and the contribution of social identity complexity to understanding processes underlying STEs of contact. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Feeding the Beast: Nourishing Nativist Appeals in Sweden and in Denmark
AN  - 1680152178; 201513957
AB  - Sweden and Denmark share a similar socio-political structure, yet these two countries demonstrate two distinct discourses on immigration. This article focuses on the tone of the debate in Denmark and Sweden concerning immigration and national identity. If the tone of debate is shaped by a language of fear, we argue, this predisposes people to vote for anti-immigration parties. Our analysis highlights the position of anti-immigration parties; hence, the Sweden Democrats (SD) in Sweden and the Danish People's Party (DPP) in Denmark. We use frame analysis to detect recurrent frames in the media debate concerning the SD and the DPP in the political competition over votes. Our material concentrates on the run-up to the European Parliamentary (EP) elections of 2004 and 2009, in total 573 articles in ten major Danish and Swedish newspapers. We show that the harsh tone of the debate and the negative dialogue risks leading to the construction of beasts that are impossible to negotiate with. In the Swedish political debate, the SD is highly stigmatized as the beast (the extreme other) in Swedish politics and this stigma is used by the SD in the mobilization of votes. In Denmark the religion of Islam as such plays a similar role and provides the DPP with an identity. We conclude that we are confronted with a two-faced beast that feeds on perceptions of the people as ultimately afraid of what are not recognized as native goods. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - COPS AND THE PERFORMANCE OF WHITE MASCULINE DECLINE
AN  - 1751968672
AB  - Examining the interconnection of gender, race, and social class in the representation of white female domestic violence complainants on the popular television series Cops, this analysis illustrates how roles in the performance of the criminal justice system can be used to address the crisis in white masculinity. Central to this examination is the crisis in white masculinity and the felt social, cultural and political marginalization of white men brought about by radical social and cultural changes since the civil rights movement. In this article, I examine Cops as the manifestation of this crisis-as a place where individuals manage and exorcise their anxieties and fears in relation to this crisis in identity. Utilizing thirty-five domestic violence vignettes from the series, I argue that the series portrays white male police officers as 'victims' of marginalized others, in this case lower class white women, in order to mark and exorcise the transition of white masculinity in the modern US.

T1  - Using the Historical Society of Pennsylvania's 'Irish Immigrant Letters Home' to Teach Nineteenth-Century Irish Immigrant History
AN  - 1684423493; 201518534
AB  - AS ANY FACULTY MEMBER who teaches American immigration history knows well, Irish Catholic famine-era immigrants command enormous attention in both the popular media and in scholarly literature. Popular and documentary films, popular and scholarly histories, as well as a host of memoirs and novels all tell various facets of their immigrant story; the Irish, it seems, are everywhere. Consequently, many students arrive in our classrooms with some understanding-sometimes even what they think is a reasonably comprehensive understanding-of the Irish Catholic immigrant experience. Yet as we, their teachers, quickly discover, their knowledge is often limited and romanticized, having been shaped more by popular and sometimes even fictional sources, as well as the values of a popularized Irish ethnic pride derived from a cultivated American Catholic identity, than by a more nuanced, historically based knowledge of these immigrants and their experiences in Ireland and America. As teachers, then, our first and primary task is to deconstruct the understandings students bring with them and substitute a richer, more complicated picture of this immigrant experience.

T1  - Exposure to Outgroup Members Criticizing Their Own Group Facilitates Intergroup Openness
AN  - 1708527559; 201530141
AB  - A major barrier to conflict resolution is group members' tendency to hold on to the ingroup's narrative of the conflict and reject the outgroup's perspective. In the current research, we propose that voicing internal criticism to an outgroup crowd can undermine such orientations and foster intergroup openness. Across four experiments, Israeli Jews who were exposed to a Palestinian criticizing Palestinians were more open to the Palestinians' perspective of the conflict, than those not exposed to the criticism. This effect was obtained when the criticism was related (Study 1) and unrelated (Study 2) to the conflict, and was consistently mediated by increased hope about the future relations between the groups. Study 3 showed that the effect is more pronounced among those who believe that groups can change. Study 4 established that perceptions about the outgroup as open-minded underlie the effect of ingroup criticism on hope, and further demonstrated downstream effects of openness.

T1  - The Impact of Migration on Children's Psychological and Academic Functioning in the Republic of Moldova
AN  - 1559005692; 201432013
AB  - After the fall of communism, many Eastern Europeans sought work abroad, leaving their children with relatives. Eastern European migrants represent a target group with unstudied immigration patterns. The goal of this study was to examine how parental migration and economic pressure impact children outcomes in the Republic of Moldova. I examined a model of the impact of parental migration on children (13-15 years old), using a survey with 388 children who have migrant and non-migrant parents. The conceptual model of migration, economic pressure, family relations and child outcomes integrated within the family stress perspective allows these pathways to be incorporated within a broader Moldovan context. I conducted quantitative data analysis using structural equation modelling. The results indicated that higher economic pressure was associated with children's lower psychological functioning, academic achievement and satisfaction with life. Parenting behaviours, especially parental support and monitoring, mediated the impact of satisfaction with migration and economic pressure on children's outcomes. I underline the importance of using a family perspective in the migration policymaking process, and provide specific recommendations for migration policies and programmes.

T1  - The theme of indivisibility in the post-war struggle against prejudice in the United States
AN  - 1660024003; 201505829
AB  - Whitfield's essay seeks to identify and explain a tendency that emerged in the United States in the 1940s and extended through the 1950s. It was then that a notion became commonplace, especially among liberals, that the victims of prejudice were interchangeable and that bigotry was undifferentiated. Before the 1940s, the problem of prejudice was not widely believed to be urgent; but the war against the Third Reich heightened awareness of the price of an irrational hostility to minorities. American liberals in particular came to the understanding that bigotry was indivisible; and, for its objects, the cards of identity could easily be shuffled. Whether the victims were Jews or Negroes or homosexuals, the hatred that they elicited appeared to be formed without making any distinctions among them. Evidence can be found in the culture of those two decades, in novels, plays and films. The unitary view of the character of prejudice had some support in social science, including in the authoritative volume The Authoritarian Personality. The theory would also be reflected in a major shift in the agenda of Jewish civil rights organizations, which redefined their mission as promoting the democratic rights of all minorities rather than the particular interests of American Jews. This distinctive tendency vanished in the 1960s, however. One reason for the change was a fuller appreciation of the hostility that minorities could harbour towards other minorities. The realization also deepened of the singular vulnerability of black Americans under the pressure of racism, which demonstrated a tenacity as well as a proclivity for violence that had been largely absent from other forms of bigotry. Finally, a broader legitimation of difference itself emerged in the 1960s to bury the notion that minorities were fungible. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Why Do Members of Disadvantaged Groups Strike Back at Perceived Negativity Towards the In-group?
AN  - 1541997641; 201426814
AB  - Against the background of riots in communities across London in 2011, this paper examines the implications of negative meta-stereotypes on stigmatized group members' reactions towards members of privileged out-groups within their communities. We hypothesized that concerns over negative opinions that the dominant out-group is expected to hold of the in-group (i.e. meta-stereotypes) would be negatively associated with group members' perceptions of societal fairness and that this relationship would be mediated by members' recall of personal experiences with discrimination. We further hypothesized that views about societal fairness that are challenged in this way would lower an inclination to express discontent with the status quo via normative means while at the same time, increase nonnormative expressions. Results from two surveys (study 1, N = 50; study 2, N = 132) provided support for these hypotheses and are discussed in terms of their meaning for community relations.

T1  - Bringing Race Relations Into the Restorative Justice Debate: An Alternative and Personalized Vision of 'the Other'
AN  - 1550999614; 201428973
AB  - Restorative justice was reborn in the 1970s with a promise to provide a better sense and experience of justice, especially for those who are let down the most by the criminal justice system. And yet, despite well-evidenced disproportionality and race inequality issues within criminal justice institutions, restorative justice research and practice within the context of race are almost nonexistent. This article aims to unravel this paradox while looking at the scant extant literature to explore the alternative and more personalized restorative justice vision of 'the other' and cultural differences. An expansive conceptual model that is aligned with the integrative nature of restorative justice is then posited for further pilots and research. The article warns that if restorative justice continues to ignore the challenges raised within a race equality context, the power structures inherent within our current structural framework of criminal justice will lead to its demise.

T1  - Everyday Restriction: Central American Women and the State in the Mexico-Guatemala Border City of Tapachula
AN  - 1531932736; 201423248
AB  - Media coverage and emerging scholarship have brought increasing international attention to the urgent humanitarian crisis facing Central American transmigrants as they navigate landscapes of violence in Mexico. While stories of Central American immigrants who remain in Mexico are largely absent from this coverage, there is arguably a 'Central Americanization' occurring on the southern border through this permanent settlement. Central Americans choosing to establish themselves in the border state of Chiapas do so in a socio-spatial and political context defined by the introduction of 'progressive' state- and national-level migration policies on the one hand and the persistence of discrimination and violence on the other. We know little about the implementation of these policies on the ground, namely how they are applied and the impacts they have on the immigrant experience in Mexico. To begin to fill this gap, this paper focuses on the experiences of Central American immigrant women living in the Mexico-Guatemala border city of Tapachula. Employing a feminist geopolitical lens, which encourages conducting research and analysis at diverse scales, it examines their everyday interactions with low- to mid-level representatives of the Mexican state as they seek to avail themselves of their legal and social citizenship rights, and the impacts of these interactions on their livelihoods. This article argues that low- to mid-level officials' actions reveal the importance of a form of extra-official, subtle, yet pervasive regulation through which immigrant women are denied rights they are entitled to, inducing negative impacts to their livelihoods, which I term everyday restriction.

T1  - The Rape of Harriet Tubman
AN  - 1767328574; 201605978
AB  - This year marked the 100th anniversary of the passing of Harriet Tubman. The author had the opportunity to celebrate that fact when she organized a special symposium on Mar 8, 2013, resulting in some thought-provoking critical papers on Tubman's legacy of resistance. One of the more interesting conversations that came out of this event questioned why, on the anniversary of her death, they have yet to experience an epic cinematic treatment of her life. Recently, in an Internet launch of his new YouTube channel, All Def Digital, rap media mogul Russell Simmons featured a failed comedic video titled Harriet Tubman Sex Tape -- the first in the line-up of this new series. Most of Tubman's biographers have argued that there is no documentation that Tubman experienced sexual abuse while enslaved. The sex tape invoked her spirit, and as with unleashed spirits, she possessed us with the power to rage, to protest, and to find the collective voice. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'What If I Write Circuses': Revisiting Novel Writing and Neo-Hoodoo Aesthetics in Ishmael Reed's Yellow Back Radio Broke-Down
AN  - 1550999665; 201428997
AB  - The New Western and/or Post-Western of the 1960s distorted and parodied the patterns of characterization of the classic western aiming at reaching atypical and more revealing truths about the western experience. Likewise, Ishmael Reed's Yellow Back Radio Broke-Down (1969) undertakes to serve a similar purpose and beyond. It breaths fresh air into the so-called 'exhausted' genre by providing more intriguing western histories, on the one hand, and revitalizes novel writing at a time when the novel is pronounced 'dead,' on the other hand. What's more, written at the height of the 'counter-culture revolution,' it both undertakes to question and uproot preconceived absolutes and media-based realities regarding race, religion, and indigenous cultures by reviving the resourcefulness of Afro-American heritage. As such, it highlights Voodoo turned Hoodoo aesthetics as the best embodiment of this age-old culture and undermines the preeminence of popular culture, thus paving the way toward more experimental representations. Therefore, Loop Garoo Kid's words while arguing with Bo Shmo, the neo-realist gang leader: 'What's the beef with me Bo Shmo, What if I write circuses?' reign supreme, as they depict the spirit of an era worth revisiting.

T1  - Muslim communities attitudes towards and recruitment into the British police service
AN  - 1465009595
AB  - Recent UK media reports have often portrayed Muslim communities in a negative light (Allen, 2010). Indeed, the frequent media focus of Muslim's being arrested for counter-terrorism offences have been reported in great length. Yet the Muslim community remains diverse and is one of the longest established UK communities within Britain. However, previous studies show that there remains a tense relationship with the police and Muslim communities (Awan, 2011) with negative attitudes held by many young British Muslims towards the police (Kundnani, 2009), and indeed negativity remains stronger from young people from minority ethnic communities. The focus and aim of this research was to gather perceptions from the Muslim community in Birmingham as regards whether they would choose or recommend a career within the police service. Thus the objective for the study was to try and get a better understanding of Muslim perceptions about police recruitment. This article reports on the findings and implications of a small-scale study conducted in 2011 comprising of interviews with two Muslim groups namely the Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities from Birmingham (in the UK), where 20 people were interviewed in four groups consisting of (5) participants. The categories included Young People (aged between 15 years and 18 years); Community Leaders; Mosque Representatives and Female Groups (aged between 18 years and 30 years) which aimed to identify and gather the views of Muslim communities in respect to their views about choosing a career with the police service. Analysis revealed that the Muslim community responded in a fairly homogeneous way: they had a lack of trust towards the police and also issues were raised about the legality of counter-terrorism policing operations; a perception that the police service were a racist organisation and that the police had failed to engage with the Muslim community in Birmingham which had left a negative experience of Muslim communities and the police. Recommendations to improve the image and recruitment into the police service include more pro-active work with local communities and the use of community policing as a means to reach out to otherwise 'hard to reach groups'.

T1  - Between Colorblind and Colorconscious: Contemporary Hollywood Films and Struggles Over Racial Representation
AN  - 1551001412; 201429104
AB  - Hollywood films reflect the racial order in which they are made. The sociological significance of understanding racial representations within films is highlighted in this study as it recognizes that films offer a useful site for contentious views of the racial order-colorblind and colorconscious-to be played out. Focusing on films with an African American actor and/or actress, this study will highlight how actors and actresses in these films demonstrate the pervasiveness of racial inequality, as well as how the films still maintain a colorblind framework. Although the colorblind framework persists, acknowledging the presence of colorconscious themes is a new perspective that can help challenge the colorblind framework.

T1  - Hormones and Silk. Gay Men in the Spanish Film Comedies of the Transition to Democracy (1976-1981)
AN  - 1567048009; 201435168
AB  - This article studies the representation of gay men in Spanish comedies of the 1970s. It analyzes how cinema used the stereotypical image of gay men projected by the dictatorship and how, once it ended, this image endured in the comedy genre. It introduces film theories on the construction of humor taken from relevant authors, such as Jordan, Charney, Voitylla, and Petri. Afterward, it focuses on the works of Ozores as a filmmaker who encapsulates the main characteristics of the so-called comedia de mariquitas (sissy comedy). It analyzes how the construction of humor was based on the Francoist conception of gay men, and questions why the figure of the gay man was so effective in the production of comedy. Finally, this article refers to Dyer's theories around stereotyping, and develops them to study the Spanish context. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Why Refugees Rebel: Towards a Comprehensive Theory of Refugee Militarization
AN  - 1494300279; 201402071
AB  - Militarization by refugees can have problematic outcomes. It can undermine the sovereignty and stability of the host state, perpetuate a transnational conflict and obstruct international efforts to resolve it, and present difficulties in the provision of humanitarian assistance to needy populations. Existing literature privileges structural explanations for militarization while neglecting the agency, interests and internal politics of refugee groups. In this paper, I offer a comprehensive theory of refugee militarization that emphasizes the importance of endogenous factors, including political and economic motivations, in the context of broader structural factors, including political opportunities and resource mobilization, mediated by the presence of militancy entrepreneurs. This theory helps integrate the motivation of refugees, and the discursive framing used by militancy entrepreneurs to mobilize them, with capacity for militant activity. The need for case studies and specific policy recommendations for host states, non-governmental organizations and international stakeholders are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Leisure-time Physical Activity in California: Patterns and Mechanisms
AN  - 1494750582; 201402075
AB  - Evidence has shown that racial/ethnic minorities in the United States are less likely than whites to engage in leisure-time physical activity (LTPA); yet few studies to date have included Asian subgroups in the analyses and mechanisms underlying these disparities are not well known. This study uses data from the 2007 California Health Interview Survey (N = 37,164) to examine racial/ethnic disparities in self-reported adherence to LTPA recommendations and to explore the mediating roles of socioeconomic status (SES), acculturation, and neighborhood perceptions. Nine racial/ethnic groups were included: non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexicans, and six largest Asian subgroups. Results confirm that racial/ethnic minorities are, in general, less likely than whites to meet LTPA recommendations, whereas heterogeneity is also evident across Asian subgroups. No significant disparity is revealed for the Japanese and Filipinos but whites are advantaged compared to all other Asian groups. Educational attainment, percent of lifetime spent in the United States and access to park, playground, or open space are significantly associated with meeting LTPA recommendations. SES and acculturation play differential roles in explaining group disparities for blacks, Mexicans, and some Asian subgroups. Perceived neighborhood environment does not mediate LTPA disparities by race/ethnicity. Net of these mediators, the advantages of whites in meeting LTPA recommendations persist for blacks, Mexicans, the Chinese, and Koreans. Future research should theorize and operationalize additional multilevel pathways linking race/ethnicity and LTPA while assessing measurement errors in the existing constructs.

T1  - Identifying stylizations in ethnically salient talk among disc jockeys
AN  - 1429630035; 201335693
AB  - Before accepting claims of the function of linguistic stylization, it is imperative that we are certain of what we are examining. Mikhail Bakhtin's widely cited definition that stylization is an "artistic representation of another's linguistic style" (1986:362) leaves unclear what counts as "artistic," making identifying stylizations simultaneously intuitively obvious and empirically illusive. Drawing from 270 hours of data from a radio program, the current study uses interactional discourse and acoustic analyses to compare one disc jockey's exaggerations of ethnically salient accents (stylizations) with his mundane use of reported speech. The analyses demonstrate that in both types of talk he uses a similar bundle of interactional and acoustic resources to design his talk as belonging to someone else. The link between reported and stylized speech places stylizations in an analytical category distinct from that of crossing and its issues of language ownership. The pertinent questions are those of speaker responsibility. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Bollywood in Israel: Multi-Sensual Milieus, Cultural Appropriation and the Aesthetics of Diaspora Transnational Audiences
AN  - 1417524825; 201332062
AB  - Research on Bollywood cinema's increasingly global presence identifies the genre as a significant cultural domain for the articulation of diasporic Indian identity and its constitution. Focusing on the appropriation of Bollywood cinema and its filmi song and dance, regarded as a multi-sensual media, the article investigates Bollywood's popularity among Bene Israel immigrants in Israel and explores the aesthetics of diaspora, understood as a politics of consumption, embodied performance of identity and claims to ownership of tradition shaped by commercialized popular culture imported into Israeli society. I suggest that a sentient anthropology may provide insights into cultural identity as emerging out of material, social and aesthetic practices. The participatory culture and multi-sensual milieus inspired by Bollywood's sensorium are constitutive, the paper argues, of diasporic identity and community through their potential to evoke shared emotions and a sense of place and subjectivity, mediated by the qualities of objects, performance styles and etiquette.

T1  - Collective narcissism moderates the effect of in-group image threat on intergroup hostility
AN  - 1417522485; 201331719
AB  - Results of 4 experiments demonstrated that under in-group image threat collective narcissism predicts retaliatory intergroup hostility. Under in-group criticism (vs. praise) collective narcissists expressed intention to harm the offending out-group but not other, nonoffending out-groups. This effect was specific to collective narcissism and was replicated in studies that accounted for the overlap between collective narcissism and individual narcissism, in-group positivity (in-group identification, blind and constructive patriotism), social dominance orientation, and right wing authoritarianism. The link between collective narcissism and retaliatory intergroup hostility under in-group image threat was found in the context of national identity and international relations and in the context of a social identity defined by university affiliation. Study 4 demonstrated that the relationship between collective narcissism and intergroup hostility was mediated by the perception of in-group criticism as personally threatening. The results advance our understanding of the mechanism driving the link between collective narcissism and intergroup hostility. They indicate that threatened egotism theory can be extended into the intergroup domain. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Dehumanization, Retributive and Restorative Justice, and Aggressive Versus Diplomatic Intergroup Conflict Resolution Strategies
AN  - 1909378347
AB  - The desire for justice can escalate or facilitate resolution of intergroup conflicts. Two studies investigated retributive and restorative notions of justice as the mediating factor of the effect of perceived outgroup sentience--an aspect of (mechanistic) dehumanization referring to the emotional depth attributed to others--on intergroup conflict resolution. Study 1 showed that for Palestinians, who see themselves as victims, perceived sentience of Israelis decreased retributive but increased restorative notions of justice, which, ultimately, increased support for conflict resolution by negotiation rather than political violence. Study 2 partially replicated Study 1's findings with Jewish Israelis. The role of perceived sentience and its relationship to retributive and restorative notions of justice in protracted and nonprotracted conflicts and their resolution is discussed.

T1  - 'Generation Emigration': the politics of (trans)national social reproduction in twenty-first-century Ireland
AN  - 1429623825; 201335731
AB  - Placing social reproduction at the heart of the experience of migration, this article attempts to move beyond regulatory discourses of emigration as tragedy, lifestyle choice or 'the Skype generation'. Following a review of feminist literature on social reproduction, the article returns to research with Irish women migrants and non-migrants in the 1990s to demonstrate how technologically mediated 'time-space compression' and its promise of transnational proximity actually gave rise to the experience of gendered 'time-space expansion'. The Irish Times' 'Generation Emigration' (GE) project is then introduced as a site in which similar gendered dynamics emerge as contemporary technologically mediated connections between emigrants and the homeland are celebrated through a compensatory (trans)nationalist discourse that competes with but also compensates for framings of emigration as national tragedy. The article suggests that discourses of emigration as tragedy, lifestyle choice, or new globalised practice serve to bring emigration into being in circumscribed ways and to produce emigrants as particular kinds of 'recognisable' subjects. It asks how the work of social reproduction in the context of emigration might be posed anew in ways that challenge dominant assumptions regarding the location and composition of the population to be reproduced. By moving beyond these regulatory discourses of emigration, and by emphasising the dynamics of technologically mediated transnational social reproduction, the article identifies the racialised heteronormative assumptions that intersect with national and global projects of economic production and social reproduction to produce uneven gendered effects.

T1  - "Too Asian?" or the Invisible Citizen on the Other Side of the Nation
AN  - 1322723690; 201310739
AB  - In November 2010, Maclean's magazine published a provocative article "Too Asian?" which aroused hot debate and critique from various social groups. However, its racist nature and the role of media in reinforcing racial stereotypes, manufacturing consent, and naturalizing unequal power relations has not been examined in a systematic way. Using critical discourse analysis, this paper aims to reveal its ideological and hegemonic function in constructing unequal social identities and social relations which consequently prevents racialized minorities from accessing post-secondary educational opportunities. Four themes are identified and discussed here. First, the "Too Asian?" article reinforces an Us/Them division and a "forever foreigner" identity of racialized minorities. Second, it essentializes ethnic culture and identifies culture rather than structural constraints as an explanation for individual social behaviors. Third, it represents "Asian" students as self-segregationists who should be blamed for their own exclusion. Last, but most important, it aims to justify white privilege in the field of post-secondary education by questioning the idea of meritocracy as university admission criteria and suggests maintaining "WASP Credentials.".

T1  - Hate-Crime Victimization and Fear of Hate Crime Among Racially Visible People in Canada: The Role of Income as a Mediating Factor
AN  - 1660021836; 201505578
AB  - Hate-crime victimization against racially visible people is of growing concern and it raises questions about social cohesion in a multiracial and ethnic democracy such as Canada, particularly among immigrants across the country. Using income as a mediating factor, this article examines hate-crime victimization against visible minority groups in Canada using the Ethnic Diversity Survey. Using multinomial and binary logistic regression, the study describes the likelihood of experiencing hate crime victimization and fear of hate crime. The results indicate that hate crime and fear of hate crime depends on visible minorities' ethnic background, above and beyond their socioeconomic status. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Beyond Fear And Loathing: Tea Party organizers' Continuum Of Knowledge In A Racialized Social System
AN  - 1429630468; 201335688
AB  - Making use of fieldwork and 25 open-ended interviews with Tea Party organizers in the state of Illinois, I argue that Tea Party organizers draw from a continuum of knowledge, combining personal knowledge and experience with a conservative corporate media and Tea Party network frame. I draw upon the work of Weber to show how this continuum connects to various types of rational social action. Widening this scope of analysis allows not only for a more complex analysis of how corporate interests are connected to the grass roots movement, but also how the core frames of the movement are located throughout our mainstream political and ideological system.

T1  - The Need for Interventions to Prevent Skin Bleaching: A Look at Tanzania
AN  - 1373426540; 201328653
AB  - The practice of skin bleaching, or chemically lightening the skin, has become more common worldwide in the past 30 years. In Africa, the practice is especially problematic, because caustic ingredients are combined with bleaching products, increasing the risk for health problems, such as irreversible skin damage, cancers, and liver or kidney failure. Despite these risks, skin bleaching remains prevalent, with rates nearing 30% in East Africa. The few interventions implemented to prevent skin bleaching show marginal success in decreasing these numbers. This study takes steps to identify the most effective means of prevention for a Tanzanian community where skin bleaching practices are prevalent. A team of 20 Tanzanians worked toward this goal using participatory research techniques. Results yielded components for the structure of an ideal intervention program, including (a) didactic education, (b) governmental action, and (c) educational media. Implications for practice, policy, and research are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - White like them: Whiteness and anachronistic space in representations of the English white working class
AN  - 1494300563; 201402069
AB  - Themes of whiteness have informed many recent discussions of English national identity, yet the whiteness in question is attached to some groups but not others. In particular, whiteness is emblematically attached to members of the white working class, so that the whiteness of the middle classes becomes obscured. This paper is concerned with representations of white working-class people in the context of recent media and other discussions of English national identity. Hence, it is concerned not with the actions or sentiments of working-class people themselves, but with their positioning (by middle-class commentators) within an economy of cultural meaning around definitions of nation, multiculturalism and identity. Using press discussion of the BBC's 'White Season' as a framing device, I argue that whiteness has come to be a signifier of white working-class existence. In this context, 'white' has shifted its meaning from something normal, normative and unmarked -- Dyer's 'ordinary whiteness/whiteness as ordinary' -- to a marked -- and markedly problematic -- category that is applied only to some white people, who become bearers of 'extreme whiteness'. This marking is linked with a positioning in the past, so that white working-class people can be marked as inhabiting 'anachronistic space'.

T1  - Acculturation and Self-Rated Health among Latino and Asian Immigrants to the United States
AN  - 1266149436; 201300399
AB  - The ways in which immigrant health profiles change with shifts in acculturation is of increasing interest to scholars and policy makers in the United States, but little is known about the mechanisms that may link acculturation and self-rated health, particularly for Asians. Utilizing the National Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS) and its data on foreign-horn Latinos (N = 1,199) and Asians (N = 1,323) (Pennell et al. 2004), we investigate and compare the associations between acculturation and self-rated health for immigrants to the United States from six major ethnic subgroups (Chinese, Filipino, Vietnamese, Mexican, Cuban, and Puerto Rican). Using comprehensive measures of acculturation, we demonstrate that across ethnic groups, and despite the widely varying contexts of the sending countries and receiving communities, native-language dominance is associated with worse self-rated health relative to bilingualism, and measures of lower acculturation -- coethnic ties and remittances -- are associated with better self-rated health; and moreover, these associations are only partially mediated by socioeconomic status, and not mediated by acculturative stress, discrimination, social support, or health behaviors. We speculate that immigrants who maintain a native language while also acquiring English, as has been shown for other immigrant outcomes, attain a bicultural fluency, which also enables good health. Surprisingly, we do not find strong associations between duration of time in the United States or age at migration -- measures frequently used to proxy acculturation -- with self-rated health. Our findings illustrate the complexity of measuring acculturation and its influence on health for immigrants. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Self-Categorization Explanation for the Hostile Media Effect
AN  - 1650148101; 201503187
AB  - The hostile media effect is a phenomenon in which partisans on both sides of an issue perceive neutral media reports to be biased against their side. Three experiments were performed to test a self-categorization explanation. In Experiment 1, the effect was amplified when partisan identity was salient and attenuated when a shared identity was salient. In Experiment 2, the effect manifested when the media source was an outgroup, but not an ingroup. In Experiment 3, an attack on Democrats was perceived as less biased when attributed to a Democrat than when attributed to a Republican. The effects in Experiments 2 and 3 were amplified by partisanship. The findings are consistent with self-categorization theory and difficult to reconcile with other explanations.

T1  - Do Turkish women in the diaspora build social capital? Evidence from the Low countries
AN  - 1567049471; 201435181
AB  - Ever since Putnam (2000) made social capital a concept that should be mourned for its decline in the USA, researchers and policy makers in some western countries have adopted it as a solution to what they believe to be the failed practices of multiculturalism. Instead of preserving their individual cultures and traditions, critics would have them build social capital by bridging to people and institutions in their new countries and adopt the 'shared values' of the host countries and become 'integrated'. This study, based on a study conducted in the Netherlands in 2006, and supplemented with survey findings from Flanders at the same time, examines whether this perspective is accurate, focusing on women migrants who live in the Low Countries (Netherlands and Flanders in Belgium), of the networks they have built or not and the reasons for that, and of the role of media and the internet in that process.

T1  - Identities in-between: the impact of satellite broadcasting on Greek Orthodox minority (Rum Polites) women's perception of their identities in Turkey
AN  - 1567049355; 201435229
AB  - This study aims to shed a light on women belonging to the Greek Orthodox Christian (Rum Polites) community in Istanbul, Turkey and their perception of their identity with the help of satellite broadcasting (ERT World). This research is the first attempt to analyse Rum women's viewing attitudes and their correlations with a number of variables such as education, age, family structure, religion, occupation, and their perceptions of themselves as part of a distinctive religious and cultural entity. Since the female members of the community are heavy television viewers, television is a powerful tool to construct a social reality and a sense of self. By conducting in-depth interviews and interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA), this study aims to reveal how this unique community makes sense of their identities and social worlds through television.

T1  - Introduction: gender, migration and the media
AN  - 1567049081; 201435124
AB  - Mediated representations of gender, ethnicity and migration play an increasingly important role in the way these categories are understood in the public sphere and the private realm. As media often intervene in processes of individual and institutional communication, they provide frameworks for the production and consumption of representations of these categories. Thus media -- in their production, representations and consumption -- need to be analysed, not only as reflections as pre-existing socio-political realities, but also as constitutive elements in the production of meanings of the self and the Other. This special issue includes a number of articles that examine the articulations of gendered ethnic identities and of gendered citizenship as these are shaped in media production, media representations and media consumption.

T1  - The Transformation of the US-Based Liberian Diaspora from Hard Power to Soft Power Agents
AN  - 1761675018; 201602160
AB  - As a result of a 'hurting stalemate' and the failure to capture power through coercion, moderate elements within the US-based Liberian diaspora resorted to soft power in order to have a greater impact on homeland affairs. The effectiveness of the diaspora is aided by the attractiveness of diaspora success and US culture, the morality of diaspora policies, and the credibility and legitimacy of the diaspora. The US-based Liberian diaspora exerts soft power influences towards peace building via the following mechanisms: persuasion and dialogue; public diplomacy; media assistance; and development assistance/job creation campaigns. The study concludes that development assistance/job creation campaigns are the least sustainable because of cost compared to the other mechanisms that attract a buy-in from the community. This research is based on snowball and in-depth interviews with forty US-based Liberian diaspora leaders that also includes leaders of non-Liberian advocacy groups and participatory observation of selected diaspora activities from 2007-2010. It is also supplemented with content analysis of US-based Liberian diaspora online discussion forums and archival records of congressional hearings on Liberia during the civil war.

T1  - Origins of the New Latino Underclass
AN  - 1081865476; 201235303
AB  - Over the past four decades, the Latino population of the United States was transformed from a small, ethnically segmented population of Mexicans in the southwest, Puerto Ricans in New York, and Cubans in Miami into a large national population dominated by Mexicans, Central Americans, and South Americans. This transformation occurred through mass immigration, much of it undocumented, to the point where large fractions of non-Caribbean Hispanics lack legal protections and rights in the United States. Rising illegality is critical to understanding the disadvantaged status of Latinos today. The unauthorized population began to grow after avenues for legal entry were curtailed in 1965. The consequent rise in undocumented migration enabled political and bureaucratic entrepreneurs to frame Latino migration as a grave threat to the nation, leading to a rising frequency of negative framings in the media, a growing conservative reaction, and increasingly restrictive immigration and border policies that generated more apprehensions. Rising apprehensions, in turn, further enflamed the conservative reaction to produce even harsher enforcement and more still more apprehensions, yielding a self-feeding cycle in which apprehensions kept rising even though undocumented inflows had stabilized. The consequent militarization of the border had the perverse effect of reducing rates of out-migration rather than inhibiting in-migration, leading to a sharp rise in net undocumented population and rapid growth of the undocumented population. As a result, a majority of Mexican, Central American, and South American immigrants are presently undocumented at a time when unauthorized migrants are subject to increasing sanctions from authorities and the public, yielding downward pressure on the status and well-being of Latinos in the United States.

T1  - What is an "appropriate" migrant? Impact of the adoption of meritocratic worldviews by potential newcomers on their perceived ability to integrate into a Western society
AN  - 1030866584; 201227681
AB  - The acceptance of migrant populations and the definition of an "appropriate" migrant are controversial issues in many countries. The present research focuses on the ideological determinants of how newcomers are evaluated by a host population in a Western country with a strongly rooted meritocratic ideology. We carried out two studies to examine how the expression of meritocratic beliefs by a male potential migrant affects the way he is evaluated by the host population. We measured the host population's perception of the potential migrant's ability to integrate into society, his tendency to adopt the host country's culture, and the general desirability of his world vision for all newcomers. We also noted the host population's judgments of the target's agency and communality. The results showed that a potential newcomer who expresses a strong (vs. weak) belief in a just world (Study 1) or an internal (vs. external) locus of control (Study 2) is evaluated more favorably by the host population. In addition, judgments of the target's integration capacity were only mediated by his perceived agency. We discuss these results in the light of work on the meritocratic ideology and intercultural relations. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Depressive symptoms in native and immigrant adolescents: the role of critical life events and daily hassles
AN  - 1023025814; 201223975
AB  - The present study compared native Austrian, first and second generation immigrant adolescents regarding their level of depressive symptoms, critical live events, and daily hassles. Furthermore, the associations between these constructs were tested in the three groups. The sample comprised 330 native Austrian (52.1% girls), 120 first generation immigrants (49.2% girls) and 159 second generation immigrants (54.2% girls) aged 14-19 (M=15.61). Compared with native adolescents, first generation immigrant adolescents reported more depressive symptoms and daily hassles related to parents, the self, leisure, romantic partner, and future, whilst second generation immigrant adolescents reported more daily hassles related to parents, school, and romantic partner. Controlling for gender, multiple group structural equation models revealed that daily hassles fully mediated the path between critical live events and depressive symptoms in all three groups of adolescents. Implications for future research on immigrant adolescents' psychological well-being are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Benefits of Segregation for White Communities: A Review of the Literature and Directions for Future Research
AN  - 1364699957; 201323316
AB  - The relationship between racial residential segregation and African-American crime rates has thoroughly been explored within the literature on race and crime. However, predictions are mixed when addressing the relationship between racial residential segregation and white crime. According to Massey (2001), whites should be expected to benefit from segregation. This paper explores the research and the literature related to racial residential segregation and crime from the perspective of white advantage. Specifically, it is postulated that racial residential segregation may benefit whites economically, politically, and culturally via several key pathways: by removing them from residential areas of concentrated disadvantage, by distancing them from criminogenic subcultures and areas of higher victimization, and by maintaining political stability and/or reinvestment in white neighborhoods. The methods by which these relationships may be empirically tested are discussed. We further explore different measures of racial segregation, as well as potential intervening variables that may mediate the relationship between racial residential segregation and crime, and discuss the benefits and implications for their inclusion in future research.

T1  - White Privilege, Language Capital and Cultural Ghettoisation: Western High-Skilled Migrants in Taiwan
AN  - 1023030538; 201223893
AB  - Drawing on the case of Taiwan, this article looks at high-skilled migration from the West to Asia. I explore how Western high-skilled migrants exert agency to negotiate their positions as non-citizens, privileged others and professional workers. I have coined the term 'flexible cultural capital conversion' to describe how English-speaking Westerners convert their native-language skills, as a form of global linguistic capital, into economic, social and symbolic capitals. Their privileged positions are nevertheless mediated and constrained by their class, nationality, race/ethnicity and gender. In the global context, whiteness is marked as a visible identity and the 'superior other'. Such cultural essentialism functions as a double-edged sword that places white foreigners in privileged yet segregated job niches. Their flexibility in capital conversion and transnational mobility is territory-bound. Many experience the predicament of 'cultural ghettoisation' in the global South, and they often face grim job prospects on returning home to the North. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social Psychology, Religion and Inter-Group Relations: Hamas Leaders' Media Talk about their Vision for the Future
AN  - 914768125; 201200109
AB  - This paper focuses on the relationship between Islam and the secular aspects of society which differentiate Islamic societies from other states. Bound up with this question is the issue of the extent to which Islamists challenge proposals that religion should be 'set aside' when people act as citizens by arguing that Islam embraces the whole of life. Using discourse analysis we examine extracts from media interviews with leaders of the Islamist Hamas movement about Islam and its application within the Gaza strip. The interviewees construct religion as being congruent with existing social practices within Gaza. This allows interviewees to make three claims: that the introduction of Islam will make no difference to existing society, that Islam will be tolerant of existing social practices, and that potentially criticisable political acts should be viewed in civic rather than religious terms. By so doing, the interviewees display sensitivity to potential distinctions between religious and civic practices and attend to inferences that might arise in respect of inter-group relations. Constructions of religion and of civic society can thus be viewed as participants' rather than analysts' concerns and should be examined for their functions within both distal and local contexts.

T1  - A Paradise for LGBT Rights? The Paradox of Belgium
AN  - 1023025734; 201223834
AB  - How is it that a small country such as Belgium, with its reputation of relative conservatism, has jumped to the forefront of LGBT-friendly nations when it comes to the extension of rights to, and implementation of government policies for, its LGBT population? The analysis offered here focuses on a combination of six causes: the impact of wider secularization processes; the political history and culture of the country; the organization of especially the Flemish LGBT movement and reasons for its political effectiveness; mainstream social trends in national scapegoating hierarchies; the overall media environment; and the window of opportunity opened by the political landslide of 1999.

T1  - "Generation Islam": Arab American Muslims and Racial Politics after September 11
AN  - 1010632377; 201210458
AB  - This research draws upon the lived experiences of sixty young adult Muslims living in Los Angeles in order to provide a comprehensive overview of the racialized processes shaping the representation, oppression, and emergent identities of the Muslim diaspora. Historically, Arab American Muslims have occupied a contradictory position within U.S. race relations. They have been designated by the government as categorically white, but simultaneously have been the victims of racism in different institutional arenas. I explore how the War on Terror has shaped the collective and individual racial consciousness of young adult Arab American Muslims. Moreover, I argue that the newest generation of Muslims, designated "Generation Islam" by mainstream media outlets, exhibits a distinguishing feature that older cohorts of Arab American Muslims do not possess: namely, they are more likely to disidentify with whiteness. My research demonstrates how this generation of Arab American Muslims is far more likely than previous generations to situate their racial identity as non-white "racialized" subjects.

T1  - Got on My Traveling Shoes: Migration, Exile, and Home in Toni Morrison's A Mercy
AN  - 964195835; 201207468
AB  - "Got on My Traveling Shoes" examines Toni Morrison's (2008) A Mercy in terms of its engagement with tropes of migration, exile, and home. This article builds upon the scholarship of critics such as Paul Gilroy, Homi Bhabha, Carol Boyce Davies, bell hooks, and Morrison herself in arguing that the author's latest novel refigures the essentialist model of double-consciousness reified in W.E.B. DuBois's The Souls of Black Folk and gestures toward a liminal home existing outside fixed cultural bounds. The article's unique contribution to the transnational studies conversation centers on the analysis of Morrison's re-inscription of the moment of race consciousness. Through an inventive use of language, Morrison not only disrupts the fixed historiography underlying figurations of the American Empire, she also creates a new, hybrid personal whose complex subjectivity defies reductive attempts at racial categorization. A Mercy therefore mediates against simplistic genealogical notions embedded in "DuBoisian" ways of perception, even as it lays the groundwork for a more nuanced reading of American history.

T1  - Digital Expression Among Urban, Low-Income African American Adolescents
AN  - 964195793; 201207385
AB  - Digital production is a means through which African American adolescents communicate and express their experiences with peers. This study examined the content and the form of the digital productions of 24 urban, low-income African American adolescents who attended a summer academic program. The content of student digital productions focused on academic experiences and friendships. Their production styles revealed that youth used perceptually salient production features, such as rapid scene changes and loud rap music. The results suggest that when placed in a supportive, academic environment and provided with digital production resources, students who traditionally face barriers due to cultural and economic inequalities digitally express to their peers an interest in academics and positive peer relationships, and that these youth communicate their experiences through a shared production style that reflects their broader cultural experiences.

T1  - Incarceration and the Health of the African American Community
AN  - 887500753; 201118191
AB  - This article reviews evidence linking incarceration and health, with a particular focus on African Americans, who are disproportionately affected by the incarceration system. Although inmates generally suffer from worse health than comparable, non-institutionalized adults, this comparison is not uniformly the case, and some of the strongest negative effects of incarceration emerge after release, suggesting that the struggles of reintegration into society are as important as the conditions of incarceration. We review evidence for the basic relationship between incarceration and health from individual-level and aggregate-level studies, as well as from evidence and speculation regarding potential mediating mechanisms. Many questions remain regarding these mechanisms and, by extension, which policies are most promising for reducing incarceration's impact on health. Among other issues, the incarceration-health connection also raises fundamental questions regarding the level of harm society is willing to accept as part of routine punishment for criminal behavior.

T1  - Endorsement of Assimilationism among Ethnic Minority and Majority Youth in a Multination-Multiethnic Context: The Case of Brussels
AN  - 887498051; 201118207
AB  - This study examined attitudes towards weak and strong assimilation in a sample of 3,121 pupils from 70 secondary schools in Brussels with a multilevel linear analysis. Controlling for socio-demographic variables, members of some ethnic minority groups endorsed weak assimilation to a greater extent than the majority. Within members of the majority, the French-speaking Belgians held similar attitudes towards assimilation to the Dutch-speaking Belgians. Among ethnic minorities, the identification of pupils from some foreign-origin countries with the mainstream society was positively associated with the endorsement of strong assimilation, while their ethnic identification remained non-significant. Intergroup friendship among pupils of foreign origin was positively related to strong assimilation. Moreover, pupils of foreign origin who experienced institutional discrimination against ethnic minorities in favour of the majority endorsed strong assimilationism to a lesser extent. Among the majority, the perception that people of foreign origin are victims of discrimination was positively related to the endorsement of weak assimilation. However, this association was mediated by the experience by the majority of institutional discrimination against the majority and in favour of ethnic minorities. In-group identification among the majority was not associated with the endorsement of assimilation. The results and their implications for future research and policy makers are discussed.

T1  - Two Multicultural Debates and the Lived Experiences of Chinese-Canadian Youth
AN  - 1429627533; 201335705
AB  - This paper examines the lived experiences of Chinese-Canadian youth in Alberta in relation to two multiculturalism debates: multiculturalism as a politics of recognition and multiculturalism as a cohesive force. It focuses on three themes of their lived experiences, which include racial discrimination and stereotypes in school; biased media representation; and the relationship between ethnic language maintenance, sense of belonging and multiculturalism policy within a bilingual framework. Two findings are highlighted in this paper. First, the racism youth experienced at school and the racist discourse against Chinese-Canadian students found in Canadian media indicate that Chinese Canadians as racialized and ethnic minorities have not been recognized and treated as equal partners in social interactions with the White dominant group. The multicultural policy focus and task of addressing racism in the 1980s has yet to be finished despite current multicultural policy having a new focus. Second, multiculturalism within a bilingual framework is more an assimilating force than a divisive one. Given the separation of language rights and cultural rights as well as the strong linguistic and cultural assimilation forces in major Canadian institutions, it is less likely for Chinese-Canadian youth to maintain their ethnic language and culture. The main factor that affects their sense of belonging to Canada is the racism in Canadian society rather than the symbolic recognition of diversity that multiculturalism encourages.

T1  - Using Hegemonic Masculinity to Explain Gay Male Attraction to Muscular and Athletic Men
AN  - 870432855; 201114287
AB  - This article reviews relevant research on male homosexual attraction. Utilizing masculinity as its theoretical frame, the authors use childhood experiences with both fathers and peers, the gay community's inculcation of heteronormative ideologies, and the gay media's adherence to masculine prototypes, to provide causal explanations for the appeal of muscular, lean, and athletic physiques. While the authors acknowledge that not all individuals within the gay community look toward muscularity and athleticism as the primary components of attractiveness, it nonetheless remains important to examine the theoretical perspectives that may explain the appeal of this specific aesthetic.

T1  - Spirit-Possession Rituals in Southern Ghana: Priests, Musicians, and Ritual Efficacy
AN  - 925712238; 201204078
AB  - In this article, I aim to show that possession rituals in southern Ghana problematize a notion of priests as always the central religious actors responsible for ritual efficacy in indigenous religious life. I present an analysis of possession rituals at two shrines in villages located in the Eastern Region of Ghana. While priests are normally responsible for mediating between humans and the spirit realm, my analysis suggests that during possession rituals, the ritual labor of communicating with the spirits becomes the responsibility of the musicians, because music is believed to invoke the spirits and manage their engagement during rituals of possession. Thus, priests must rely on the musical-ritual acumen and abilities of others to help ensure ritual efficacy. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - An Assessment of Afro Centricism, Color-Blind Ideology, and Intersectionality
AN  - 887499948; 201118226
AB  - Some have argued that multiracial/multicultural congregations are the fastest growing types of large Christian churches in the United States today (Yancey 2003). In this multi-sited unobtrusive ethnography, I compare three churches to explore diverse meanings of church unity in the context of American color-blind society (Bonilla-Silva, 2007). Site 1, an African American Protestant evangelical congregation is distinguished by its coherence around black liberation theology. Site 2, a largely white Protestant evangelical leadership and multiracial congregation practices a color-blind approach. Finally site 3, an inclusive multi-racial church and pastoral staff works hard at maintaining its multi-racial/multi-cultural identity through a more intersectional approach to unity. The availability of resources for understanding, expressing, and mediating racial identity shapes the choices of members in these church settings concerning addressing cultural difference. And local context, educational attainment, and exposure of ministers and parishioners, all indicators of social isolation (as discussed by Emerson & Smith, 2000), contribute to this resource base. Despite efforts to build internal cohesion, some analysts may continue to criticize multiracial churches' slow progress toward eradicating color blind racism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Acquisition of Cross-Ethnic Friends by Recent Immigrants in Canada: A Longitudinal Approach
AN  - 1221407566; 201244098
AB  - This paper examines the development of inter-ethnic friendships between immigrants and Canadians. It uses longitudinal data from three waves of the Canadian LSIC survey, in which newly arrived immigrants were followed during the first 4 years of settlement. It is found that pre-migration characteristics play an important role in the development of inter-ethnic friendships: immigrants who arrive at a younger age and for economic reasons, as well as those who are highly educated and have a cross-ethnic partner at the moment of arrival, establish more inter-ethnic friendships over time. In addition, post-migration characteristics affect the formation of inter-ethnic friendships. Such friendships are more common among immigrants who embrace Canadian traditions and acquire the host-country language, as well as among those who work in international settings and inhabit ethnically mixed neighborhoods. The effects of pre-migration characteristics are partially mediated by post-migration characteristics. Our findings point out that economic, cultural, and spatial integration are all conducive to inter-ethnic friendships. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada: Insights into the Goal of Transformative Education
AN  - 1010630761; 201210499
AB  - In 2006, the Government of Canada announced the approval of a final Residential Schools Settlement Agreement with the collaboration of the four churches responsible (United, Anglican, Presbyterian, Catholic), the federal government and residential school survivors. Schedule "N" of the Agreement lists the mandate of the TRC; therein, the TRC states one of its goals as: (d) to promote awareness and public education of Canadians about the system and its impacts. Can education -- as the TRC hopes to engender -- truly be transformative, renewing relationships and promoting healing in the process of forging these new relationships? The literature reviewed and the conferences attended highlighted that generating empathy may be a necessary ingredient for the instigation of social change, but is insufficient. Transformation through education, or reconciliation through truth-telling, testimonial reading and responsible listening would mean claiming a genuine, supportive responsibility for the colonial past. Educational policy and media initiatives are fundamental to creating awareness, developing public interest and support of the TRC's recommendations. However, authors also stress the importance of critical pedagogy in the whole process of truth and reconciliation, and that real reconciliation would require confronting the racism that initiated these institutions and allowed for a decontextualization of their impacts.

T1  - The Social Distribution of Distress and Well-Being in the Canadian Aboriginal Population Living Off Reserve
AN  - 1010630717; 201210627
AB  - This article examines how the social structure distributes risk and protective factors and mental health outcomes within the off reserve Aboriginal population in Canada. It uses the stress process model, a prominent model in the sociology of mental health, to explore pathways between social status, stress, coping resources, and mental health outcomes. Path analyses are used to decompose total effects on distress and wellbeing into direct and indirect or mediating pathways. The results suggest that stress, mastery, and social support are important mediators between social status and mental health outcomes. Stress appears to be a stronger contributor to distress while mastery and social support are of higher relative importance to wellbeing. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Today, We Are All Ahmadi': Configurations of Heretic Otherness between Lahore and Berlin
AN  - 881461977; 201116433
AB  - The Ahmadis are widely regarded as heterodox in Pakistan, where they have moved after the Partition of British India in 1947, and where they have later been declared by the state as being 'non-Muslim'. Faced with violence and discrimination on a regular basis, they have migrated in large numbers to Europe, including Germany. There, they are free to continue their religious practice, but at the same time have been treated with hostility as they become part of central city life. Faced with suspicion both at home and now in Europe, this article explores the double sense of heterodoxy which the Ahmadis now face, and explores the complex reactions, including media campaigns to which they have given rise in Germany.

T1  - Inconsistent Latino Self-Identification in Adolescence and Academic Performance
AN  - 868012262; 201112919
AB  - Research has documented important connections between ethnic identity and academic success. In the multiethnic context of the US, ethnic self-identification is a dynamic process that develops through social interaction within institutions. Understanding the emergence of a Latino self-identity within schools can provide insight into the meanings adolescents confer to a Latino identity and the relationship between a Latino self-identity and academic success. This study uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine (1) the association between a Latino self-identification in-school but not at home and academic well-being, (2) the association between a Latino self-identification in-school but not at home and school processes, and (3) whether school processes help to mediate the relationship between Latino self-identification in-school but not at home and academic well-being. Results suggest that while adolescents who identify as Latino at school but not at home come from families and neighborhoods with higher levels of economic and human capital, by the end of high school they have accumulated less educational capital then either consistently identifying Latinos or non-Latino whites. Much of this association can be explained by prior academic experiences, yet other factors associated with resistance to institutional norms and attending low performing schools may also be important. Results suggest that non-minority, underachieving adolescents may choose to self-identify as Latino in schools as a way to save face and avert identity crises and that perhaps youth in schools have come to associate a Latino identity with poor school performance.

T1  - Performing Race and Gender in Brazil: Karim Ainouz's Madam Sata (2002)
AN  - 1018358615; 201212865
AB  - This article focuses on the ways that racialized and gendered identities intersect in Brazil. It considers how the objectification of certain racialized and sexualized bodies became central to the national imaginary, and how Afrodescendant identitarian claims can simultaneously invoke and contest hegemonic representations of racial types. The second half of the article analyzes the performance of race and gender in the 2002 film Madame Sata, in the light of the ideologies discussed in the first half. It explores the construction of a black queer body as a spectacle mediated by racist cultures of national and popular discourse and cinematic images, and comments on how the protagonist of this biographical film plays with the assigned social meanings of black bodies in the interplay of race and gender relations.

T1  - I Ain't No Girl: Representation and Reconstruction of the "Found Girls" of Sudan
AN  - 1018358607; 201212857
AB  - Despite the worldwide attention received by the so-called Lost Boys of Sudan, Sudanese young women remain relatively invisible. From their refugee experiences in Egypt or Kakuma, where many arrived alone but were placed with foster families, to their long and arduous process of resettlement in new cultures, Sudanese young women seem to still be "lost" -- predominantly in the eyes of the media. This article troubles notions of belonging and resettlement for those who -- like Sudanese diasporic young women -- remain invisible and (underrepresented) in resettlement figures and programs, but whose tasks in resettlement highlight the gendered differences this process demands. Despite lower levels of schooling and increasing research that suggests they are at higher risk of disengagement than their male peers, young women from refugee pasts are finding alternative and increasingly creative ways of making their voices heard. This paper draws on the work of James Clifford and Peter McLaren and on my doctoral research project, Cross-Marked: Sudanese Australian Young Women Talk Education to provide an alternative space where these young women's voices can be heard, their stories told. Media and educational spaces can begin to offer them opportunities that for too long have been "lost." The reader might also wish to view the films under discussion at http://web.mac.com/amharris.

AN  - 754039514; 201049780
AB  - Healthcare is the keystone of a number of complex progressive social justice issues that evoke complex emotions. As the demography of Ireland rapidly changes, the practices and expectations of some asylum-seekers and others seeking refugee status present new opportunities and challenges for health-service providers. This paper looks at some of the emotions evoked in healthcare issues. It draws on observations and interviews from empirical fieldwork carried out for the Health Research Board. The research was conducted both in the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, incorporating the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght and in a number of refugee reception centres in Ireland. At one level, honouring faith choices within a healthcare setting is a societal acknowledgement--often made to people at their most vulnerable--that the potent and cathartic transformative rituals they value are significant in mediating and managing their emotions. This paper argues that, at another level, it is a practical and symbolic communication of a statutory commitment to interculturalism and community cohesion. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Community Services and Out-Migration
AN  - 743058746; 201031727
AB  - This paper investigates the relationship between changing community context and out-migration in one of today's poor countries, seeking to document the various mechanisms by which infrastructure affects the migratory behavior. We focus on the expansion of social and physical facilities and services near to rural people's homes, including transportation, new markets, employment, schools, health clinics, and mass media outlets such as movie halls. We draw upon detailed data from Nepal to estimate the hypothesized effects. The direct effects of expanding economic and human capital infrastructure are clearly negative, reducing out-migration. However, increased economic infrastructure is associated with a greater accumulation of human and social capital among respondents and their parents. Through these intervening mechanisms, economic and social infrastructure increased the odds of migrating out. These results reveal the often countervailing nature of short- and long-term effects of economic and social change, and the complex pathways influencing migration outcomes.

T1  - Bystander Sexism in the Intergroup Context: The Impact of Cat-calls on Women's Reactions Towards Men
AN  - 743060942; 201045989
AB  - Despite the fact that sexism is an inherently intergroup phenomenon, women's group-level responses to sexism have received relatively little empirical attention. We examine the intergroup reactions experienced by 114 female students at a U.S. university in New England who imagined being a bystander to a sexist cat-call remark or control greeting. Results indicate that women experienced greater negative intergroup emotions and motivations towards the outgroup of men after overhearing the cat-call remark. Further, the experience of group-based anger mediated the relationship between the effect of study condition on the motivation to move against, or oppose, men. Results indicate that bystanders can be affected by sexism and highlights how the collective groups of men and women can be implicated in individual instances of sexism.

T1  - The presence and absence of race
AN  - 743067215; 201043392
AB  - Wade examines the presence and absence of race, and David Theo Goldberg's thesis in The Threat of Race that racism under neoliberalism continues in hidden form, not named as such. Wade argues that Goldberg's approach privileges an overly institutional presence for race and thus loses sight of the real and continuing presence of race in contemporary societies, especially notable in biotechnological and genomic contexts. This depends on defining race in a clear way, so that it can be recognized when it is present: race is not about biology, but about a constant movement between nature and culture, mediated by classifications of Others, based on histories of western colonialism and postcolonialism. Wade goes on to argue that, in Latin America, racialized difference is, if anything, made more explicit in the context of what Charles Hale has labelled 'neoliberal multiculturalism'.
