T1  - Using Intergroup Contact Theory to Understand the Practices of Youth-Serving Professionals in the Context of YPAR: Identifying Racialized Adultism
AN  - 2679010745
AB  - Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) is an approach where youth and adults partner to identify and address social issues and, in theory, creates conditions for positive intergroup contact. Yet, little is known about how the practices of YPAR facilitators enable or constrain intergroup contact, particularly in racially diverse groups. Using critical discourse analysis, we examined data from an observational study of YPAR at four sites of a youth organization serving public housing residents to interrogate power dynamics between youth and adults. Our findings suggest that supporting youth in leading and making decisions, encouraging dialogue and using open-ended questions, engaging in joint work, facilitating with intentionality, celebrating accomplishments, and involving staff who are willing to contribute to group activities may enable positive intergroup contact and mitigate adultism. Policing youths’ behavior, disengaging with the project, separating adults from youth, and only involving other staff members in punitive discipline are all practices that adults engaged in that constrained intergroup contact. Practices hindering positive intergroup contact may best be understood in relation to racialized adultism. To realize positive intergroup contact in YPAR and other youth-serving settings, therefore, this study suggests that practitioners must mitigate racism and adultism.

T1  - Cultivating practices of inclusion towards same‐sex families in Italy: A comparison among educators, social workers, and healthcare professionals
AN  - 2618224056
AB  - LGB+ parented families in recent years are becoming more visible, but limited information exists about how professionals interact with people in these family forms. This study used the framework of intergroup contact theory to investigate whether contact with lesbians and gay men, same‐sex couples, and same‐sex parents respectively increase inclusive practices towards same‐sex families, and whether this association is mediated by professionals' prejudice and endorsement of same‐sex families' rights. A questionnaire with scales on: (a) intergroup contact, (b) professionals' orientation towards same‐sex families' inclusive practices, (c) professionals' prejudices, and (d) support of same‐sex couples' rights was administered to 460 professionals (9.8% males) working in social (N = 103), education (N = 156), and healthcare (N = 201) services in Italy. Path analysis was used to test the prediction that contact increases professionals' intention to embrace inclusive practices towards same‐sex families through the mediation of both prejudice and support to same‐sex couples' rights to have and raise children. Results showed that contact reduced prejudices towards same‐sex families and increased the endorsement of same‐sex families' rights, which in turn favoured professionals' willingness to modify their practices to include these family forms. Implications for the training and development of inclusive models are discussed. Please refer to the Supplementary Material section to find this article's Community and Social Impact Statement.

T1  - Is Group-Directed Praise Always Welcome? Reactions to Ingroup and Outgroup Praise Depend on Linguistic Abstraction
AN  - 2560602870
AB  - This research examined how recipients reacted to group-directed praise formulated by ingroup or outgroup members and varying in linguistic abstraction. Study 1 (N = 81) showed that ingroup praise was perceived as more sincere when formulated in abstract (vs. concrete) terms, whereas outgroup praise formulated in abstract terms was seen as less sincere than concrete praise. In Study 2 (N = 89), recipients of outgroup praise formulated in abstract versus concrete terms attributed more hidden agenda and prejudice to the speaker, and perceived lower congruency between the speaker’s words and beliefs; the opposite pattern occurred for ingroup praise. Perceptions of congruency and hidden agenda mediated the effects of speaker group membership and linguistic abstraction on recipients’ perception of the praising message. This research points out that linguistic abstraction influences the appraisal of group-directed praise as it works as a cue of speakers’ motives. It also suggests important implications for developing successful communications between groups.

T1  - Integration policies and threat perceptions following the European migration crisis: New insights into the policy-threat nexus
AN  - 2616241282
AB  - The link between integration policies and intergroup attitudes or threat perceptions has received considerable attention. However, no studies so far have been able to explore how this relationship changed following the European migration crisis due to a lack of recent comparative policy data. Using new MIPEX data, this is the first study to examine mechanisms underlying the policy-threat nexus following the European migration crisis, distinguishing between several strands of integration policies, and realistic and symbolic threat. To do so, we combine 2017 Eurobarometer data with 2017 Migrant Integration Policy data, resulting in a sample of 28,080 respondents nested in 28 countries. The analyses also control for economic conditions, outgroup size, and media freedom. Multilevel analyses indicate that respondents living in countries with more inclusive integration policies in general report lower realistic and symbolic threat. When investigating different policy strands, we find that inclusive policies regarding political participation and access to nationality for immigrants are associated with lower realistic and symbolic threat. We compare our findings to those from prior to the European migration crisis and discuss the potential role of this crisis in the policy-threat nexus.

T1  - The intergroup sensitivity effect in mergers and acquisitions: Testing the role of merger motives
AN  - 2559690308
AB  - Research has shown that people are more defensive to criticism when it stems from an outgroup member, compared to an ingroup member (the intergroup sensitivity effect: ISE). We conducted two online vignette experiments to examine the ISE in the context of an organizational merger and the role of merger motives for the ISE. We predicted that the ISE would also emerge in mergers and acquisitions (M&As), but people would respond less negatively to criticism from the outgroup when the motive for the merger is described as achieving synergies rather than growth. In Experiment 1 (N = 452), which did not mention any motives behind the acquisition, a significant ISE emerged. Experiment 2 (N = 587) again showed an ISE regardless of the merger motive. In both experiments, the ISE was mediated by perceptions of the outgroup criticism as less legitimate and constructive. Overall, this research points to the intergroup sensitivity effect as a relevant phenomenon during post‐merger integration.

T1  - Positive versus negative contact and refugees' intentions to migrate: The mediating role of perceived discrimination, life satisfaction and identification with the host society among Syrian refugees in Turkey
AN  - 2546893089
AB  - Most research on refugee integration focuses on attitudes toward refugees among the members of the host society. Consequently, little is known on refugees' intentions to return home or migrate to another country. The present research investigates whether positive and negative contact with Turks are related to Syrian refugees' migration decisions via perceived discrimination, identification with the host society, and life satisfaction. Using a sample of Syrian adults (N = 285), we found that positive contact with Turks was associated with reduced return intentions via perceived discrimination and identification with the host society and with reduced intentions to migrate from Turkey to the Western countries via life satisfaction. Negative contact was only associated with increased return intentions via perceived discrimination. This study underscores the role of intergroup contact to better understand migration decisions of refugees and potential underlying mechanisms to explain this association.

T1  - Group Psychological Abuse and Psychopathological Symptoms: The Mediating Role of Psychological Stress
AN  - 2539852510
AB  - In the context of the long-term effects of psychological abuse, this study examined psychological stress and psychopathological symptoms in survivors of groups with cultic dynamics where abusive behaviors take place on an ongoing basis. We specifically tested the mediating role of psychological stress suffered after the departure from the group between the group psychological abuse experienced and current psychopathology. An online questionnaire was administered to 608 Spanish-speaking former members of different groups. We distributed participants into a sample of victims (N = 365) and a sample of nonvictims (N = 243), according to whether or not they reported having experienced group psychological abuse. Moderate associations were found among group psychological abuse, psychological stress, and psychopathological symptoms. Greater differences in psychological stress intensity between samples were related to personal conflicts (            η  p  2             = .30) and social relations (            η  p  2             = .29). Greater differences in psychopathological symptoms were related to paranoid ideation (            η  p  2             = .17), psychoticism (            η  p  2             = .15), depression (            η  p  2             = .15), and interpersonal sensitivity (            η  p  2             = .13). Moreover, mediation testing demonstrated that psychological stress partially mediated the impact of group psychological abuse on psychopathological symptoms. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the long-term effects of group psychological abuse. Survivors of abusive groups not only need help in dealing with psychopathological symptoms, but also need resources to cope with stressful environmental demands. Interventions should address both psychological stress and clinical symptoms to promote survivors’ health and well-being during their integration process into the outgroup society.

T1  - Contact with older people, ageism, and containment behaviours during the COVID‐19 pandemic
AN  - 2518085461
AB  - To reduce and slow the spread of the coronavirus during the pandemic, people throughout countries are asked to adopt a series of prevention behaviours such as keeping physical distance and using protective devices (containment behaviours). Vulnerability of older people during the pandemic has been stressed by mass‐media and in political communication, calling for protection of this sector of the population. Based on intergroup contact theory and on the stereotype content model, I conducted a correlational study during the coronavirus lockdown in Italy, analysing contact with older people before the pandemic, ageism, and containment behaviours. Quality of contact with older people, favourable attitudes toward older people, and benevolent ageism were found to be positively associated with containment behaviours. Findings suggest that positive intergenerational relations are likely beneficial for public health.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Opposition to Same-Sex Parents: the Mediation Effect of Satisfaction with Contact
AN  - 2449451148
AB  - IntroductionThe intergroup contact variable has been widely studied in the literature, and it has been shown to be closely related to less prejudice. The present article analyzes the role of an affective mediator in the relationship between the degree of contact-rejection of the outgroup (same-sex parents) variables, linked to the variable quality of contact or satisfaction with contact with people with a homosexual sexual orientation.MethodsThe sample is composed of 401 Spanish university students (67 males, 16.2%, and 347 females, 83.8%) with a mean age of 21 years (SD = 3.20). The data collection took place between November 2016 and March 2017.ResultsThe results show a complete mediation effect in the case of open or traditional prejudice (individual opposition), and partial mediation when analyzing modern or subtle rejection of same-sex parents (normative opposition).ConclusionsOur findings suggest that efforts to reduce the rejection of same-sex parents must take into account the individual’s positive evaluation of the contact because it is a mechanism that mediates the relationship between degree of contact and rejection.Social policy implicationsHomophobia intervention programs must consider the intergroup contact variable, taking into account that it is also necessary to act on positive emotions and affectivity toward relationships with people with a homosexual sexual orientation. Increasing positive contact with same-sex parents could be a key element in reducing rejection toward the effects of their child-rearing on their children.

T1  - Superkilen: exploring the human–nonhuman relations of intercultural encounter
AN  - 2353195047
AB  - Superkilen is a much-lauded contemporary urban public space that has been widely photographed and the subject of public talks, articles, interviews, short films, books and awards, including the prestigious Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2016. Although it was designed to improve social cohesion in the multi-ethnic neighbourhood of Nørrebro, it remains largely unresearched in how well its built form contributes to this goal. This paper provides an empirical examination of how the built form of Superkilen enables and constrains intercultural encounter. The paper begins with an exploration of literature on encounter in public spaces, and the agency of built form in mediating such interactions. The paper then presents three key findings based on ethnographic fieldwork using actor-network theory. This paper is critical of the design concept behind Superkilen, claiming that it privileged spatial representation above spatial practice. However, the findings also show how such encounters can be triangulated, shaped and programmed. It is hoped these findings will better inform urban designers in shaping public space for intercultural encounters in Western cities.

T1  - With a little help from our friends: The impact of cross‐group friendship on acculturation preferences
AN  - 2185683468
AB  - Despite extensive research on intergroup contact and acculturation, our understanding of how contact affects receiving society members’ preferences for acculturation orientation of immigrants over time is still relatively rudimentary. This longitudinal study examined how perceived group similarity and outgroup trust mediate the effects of cross‐group friendship on acculturation preferences (culture maintenance and culture adoption) of the receiving society. It was predicted that cross‐group friendship would affect acculturation preferences over time, and that these relationships would be partly mediated by outgroup trust and perceived group similarity. A three‐wave full longitudinal sample (N = 467 Chilean school students) was analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results confirmed that cross‐group friendship longitudinally predicted majority members’ support for the adoption of Chilean culture (via perceived group similarity) and Peruvian culture maintenance (via outgroup trust). Conceptual and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - Interethnic Contact in Integrated Churches: Mediation without Transformation of Majority-Roma Relations in Central Europe
AN  - 2406943577
AB  - While intergroup contact and group position scholars have found that individuals can maintain prejudice despite associational contact and affective ties, this study finds that integrated organizations can specifically mediate ethnic relations through managing threat to the privileged majority’s group position. In Slovakia, where Roma are generally even more impoverished and interethnic relations are just as tense, group-level interethnic conflict occurs less often than in the neighboring Czech Republic. Integrated church organizations in Slovakia seem to provide opportunities for associational interethnic contact, known to contain conflict. In reality, while Slovak church leaders manage to integrate their organizations to varying extents, perceived threat to majority group position limits their ability to truly transform unequal ethnic relations. A comparison to the socially and politically similar Czech case, where neither secular and religiously affiliated organizations are able to play this role among a generally nonreligious population, demonstrates that Whites perceive both service provision and advocacy as threatening their group position. Organizations thus settle for brokering relationships between Romani communities and official institutions, not with their White neighbors. With evidence from semi-structured interviews with key respondents conducted between 2014 and 2015, I argue that Slovak churches and church-affiliated organizations racially integrate and maintain peaceful relations not through the expected routes, but through mediating structured interethnic relations. By focusing on service provision, limiting Romani participation, or internally segregating the organization, Whites can mentally maintain their superior group position despite integration. These findings have implications for all multi-ethnic societies interested both in maintaining interethnic peace and pursuing racial equity.

T1  - “An Australian-style points system”: Individualizing immigration in radical right discourse in the 2015 U.K. General election campaign
AN  - 2136511846
AB  - Analyses of racist discourse have often involved data from contexts concerning issues of human mobility. A great deal of this literature points to the extent to which people draw on the tropes of liberalism to justify social exclusion, and in particular to warrant negative evaluations of outgroups. Using media data from political debates involving the radical right-wing U.K. Independence Party (UKIP) in the U.K. General Election campaign of 2015, the present article highlights a different rhetorical strategy by which exclusion can be warranted by speakers arguing for a reduction in immigration. This novel strategy explicitly avoids any negative characterization of outgroups, and instead advocates the individualization of immigration decisions. This is exemplified in UKIP’s policy of basing the United Kingdom’s approach to immigration on an “Australian-style points-based system.” This was invoked by UKIP representatives in the debates as a straightforward “off-the-shelf” system that would enable the U.K. to “take back control” of immigration, while ensuring that immigration decisions were based on individual merit rather than on group membership. As such, the points system could also be invoked specifically to anticipate and counter accusations of racism and/or xenophobia. The findings are discussed in relation to the tacit ideological assumptions underpinning UKIP’s policy, specifically around psychologization, the reliance on an acultural version of Australia, and the tacit use of categorical accounting.

T1  - Anger as a catalyst for change? Incremental beliefs and anger’s constructive effects in conflict: GPIR
AN  - 2109033310
AB  - The traditional understanding of the role of anger in conflicts is that it leads to aggressive actions that escalate conflict. However, recent research has found that under certain circumstances anger can have constructive effects such as increasing support for more risky conciliatory steps in negotiation. The current study aims to identify a psychological moderator that determines whether anger has such destructive or constructive effects. We propose that people’s beliefs about the malleability of groups (i.e., implicit theories about groups) moderate whether anger leads to conciliatory, constructive behaviors or destructive, aggressive behaviors. We test this hypothesis in two different contexts (a) race relations in the US in the context of recent protests against police brutality, and (b) the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Results indicated that induced anger (compared to control condition) increased support for aggressive policies for participants who believed that groups cannot change. In contrast, for those who believed groups can change, inducing anger actually increased support for conciliatory policies compared to a control condition. Together, this indicates that anger can have constructive effects in conflict when people believe that groups can change.

T1  - Race-based experiences of ethnic minority health professionals: Arab physicians and nurses in Israeli public healthcare organizations
AN  - 2012859218
AB  - Increasing workforce diversity was found to contribute to the narrowing of disparities in health. However, racism toward ethnic minority health professionals has not been adequately researched. In Israel, public healthcare organizations that serve a mixed Jewish-Arab population employ Arab minority healthcare professionals. Instances of prejudice and manifestations of racism toward them, which frequently surface in public discussion and the media, have unfortunately gained little scholarly attention. We used the intergroup contact approach and the theory of the social process of everyday racism as a theoretical framework. The objective of the research was to study race-based experiences of Israeli Arab healthcare professionals.Methodology: We used a qualitative research method that allows respondents to describe their views, experiences, beliefs and behavior in the way they think about them. During 2013 and 2014 we conducted in-depth interviews with a snowball sample of 10 Arab physicians and 13 Arab nurses who work in Israeli public hospitals. The study protocol was ethically approved.Findings: Interviewees noted institutional efforts to maintain egalitarianism and equality. However, at the micro-level, interviewees, mostly nurses, reported instances that ranged from refusal to accept treatment from an Arab nurse, through verbal abuse, to the use of physical violence against them. At the meso-level, interviewees, mostly physicians, reported experiences of institutional discrimination. At the macro-level, one physician reported policy-related discrimination in the context of the immigration of Russian Jewish physicians to Israel.Conclusions: We recommend combining the intergroup contact approach with the social process theory of racism to examine minorities' subjective perceptions, especially in conflictual and violent contexts; conducting broad-based quantitative research in Israeli healthcare organizations, which may have important implications for the specific strategies to be used; and emphasizing the importance of institutional support. By reconstructing race-based experiences of ethnic minority health professionals, health organizations can better manage racial situations and reduce their frequency.

T1  - The Correlates of Discord: Identity, Issue Alignment, and Political Hostility in Polarized America
AN  - 1928618097
AB  - The American public remains largely moderate on many issues, but incivility and hostility are rife in American politics. In this paper, I argue that the alignment of multiple issue attitudes along the traditional ideological spectrum helps explain the asymmetrical rise in negative political affect. I introduce belief congruence theory as a supplemental theoretical framework to social identity theory. Cross-sectional data reveal a significant association between issue alignment and negative out-party affect that is neither mediated nor moderated by partisan identity. A first-difference approach using two panel studies then addresses potential heterogeneity bias by testing a change-on-change model within individuals. Both panels, which are from different time periods, covering different issues, reveal significant associations between issue alignment and outgroup dislike. In contrast, partisan identity was only significantly associated with ingroup affect. This work suggests that cross-cutting issue preferences could help attenuate political hostility and reiterate the need to reconsider the role of issue-based reasoning in polarized America.

T1  - The vitality of social media for establishing a research agenda on black lives and the movement
AN  - 1916702737
AB  - Social media provides scholars with important portals into the lives of marginalized communities and the movements organized to combat issues of race and racism in society. However, how to incorporate the seemingly unwieldy amount of social media data for research in our fields can pose challenges to further clarify how people navigate our social world and the issues with in it, but also how they organize to push for social change and equality. In what follows, the authors discuss how social media data can be used to enhance our studies of black lives in reflection of the burgeoning Black Lives Matter movement on issues such as gun violence, public health, and higher education.

T1  - Does Terror Defeat Contact? Intergroup Contact and Prejudice Toward Muslims Before and After the London Bombings
AN  - 1961000088
AB  - Allport (1954) proposed a series of preconditions that have subsequently been shown to facilitate effects of intergroup contact on attitudes toward outgroups (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). The present study examines whether objective threat, in the form of the 2005 London 7/7 terror attack, can inhibit the positive effects of contact. We tested hypotheses that contact would affect prejudice toward Muslims regardless of the bombings (contact prevails) or that the bombings would inhibit the effects of contact on prejudice (threat inhibits). Data were collected through representative national surveys 1 month before and again 1 month after the attacks in London on July 7, 2005 (pre-7/7 N = 931; post-7/7 N = 1,100), which represent relatively low and relatively high salience of "objective threat." Prejudice against Muslims significantly increased following the bombings. Psychological threats to safety (safety threat) and to customs (symbolic threat) mediated the impact of the bombings on prejudice, whereas perceived economic threat did not. All 3 types of psychological threat mediated between contact and prejudice. Multigroup structural equation modeling showed that, even though the objective threat did raise levels of psychological threats, the positive effects of contact on prejudice through perceived psychological threats persisted. Results therefore support a contact prevails hypothesis. [web URL: http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-07257-001]

T1  - 'Don't discriminate against minority nationalities': practicing Tibetan ethnicity on social media
AN  - 1883583494
AB  - Through an analysis of popular posts Tibetans shared over the social media application WeChat in 2013 and 2014 and offline discussions about them, this paper shows how Tibetans living in and traveling through Xining City practiced and performed their ethnic identity in the face of perceived harassment. Through their viral posts, they created a cyber-community that contributed to Tibetan ethnic group formation when Tibetans interpreted their ethnic identity as the basis for unjust treatment by the Chinese state and private Han individuals. In online posts the Han are portrayed as harassing Tibetans after terror attacks across China, violating minzu rights, denigrating Tibetan culture and territory, and denying Tibetans equal footing as modern compatriots. Social media are changing the 'representational politics' of Tibetan ethnicity, altering participation in the representation of the Tibetan ethnic group. Still, online discourse remains subject to constraints; private offline discussions remain important fora of opinion exchange.

T1  - Social Imaginaries, Sperm and Whiteness: Race and Reproduction in British Media
AN  - 1923057099
AB  - This article analyses narratives about so-called Viking babies and Viking sperm. Over the last few years an increasing number of British single women and lesbian couples have been creating families by becoming pregnant with Danish donor sperm, termed 'Viking sperm'. Through analyses of British media coverage of these new families, this article explores contemporary constructions of race, especially whiteness, and gender, and shows how imaginaries of Vikings, genes and white superiority circulate in British media and among British mothers. The article illustrates how a racial discourse, which often is associated with nineteenth-century racial science, can surface in contemporary times. Yet the article also reveals how colonial and racial legacies of whiteness tend to be erased from narratives of fertility, as the (neoliberal) focus on the individual as consumer frames reproduction as individual (free) choices distant from a colonial past.

T1  - Complex and dynamic integration processes in Europe: intra EU mobility and international migration in times of recession
AN  - 1869136525
AB  - During the last 20 years migration in Europe has become more dynamic and complex, creating a different socio-economic and political context within which ever changing migrant integration challenges have to be addressed. In contrast to previous periods, and especially the recession years of the mid-1970s and early 1980s, European governments have turned again more favourable towards labour migration in the 1990s and the first decade of the twenty-first century. Labour migration and intra-European Union (EU) mobility was seen as one of the driving forces of economic growth in the process of the consolidation of the European Common Market (Geddes and Boswell 2011). Migration flows have not only increased globally and particularly towards the direction of Europe, they have also solidified internationally within the Europe of free movement and mobility. From an international migration perspective, we are witnessing a multiplication of destination countries (which, for instance, include southern and central-eastern European countries); a multiplication of origin countries; a diversification of migration pathways that no longer follow the post-colonial logic as countries of origin are increasingly integrated in global migration flows; and a higher level of mobility and connectivity through faster and cheaper IT technologies and means of transport (Castles and Miller 2009; Triandafyllidou and Gropas 2014). From an intra-European migration perspective, we observe how the Europe of free movement is shaped by very different groups of ‘mobile citizens’: rapidly changing patterns of East–West (temporary) migration, a revival of the old South–North migratory route, but also pensioners migrating from the North to the South, young Europeans who make use of education opportunities and many working migrants from diverse backgrounds in both low-skilled and high-skilled professions travelling across the European labour market.

T1  - Assessing Politicized Sexual Orientation Identity: Validating the Queer Consciousness Scale
AN  - 1892727837
AB  - Building on psychological theories of motivation for collective action, we introduce a new individual difference measure of queer consciousness, defined as a politicized collective identity around sexual orientation. The Queer Consciousness Scale (QCS) consists of 12 items measuring five aspects of a politicized queer identity: sense of common fate, power discontent, system blame, collective orientation, and cognitive centrality. In four samples of adult women and men of varied sexual orientations, the QCS showed good test-retest and Cronbach's reliability and excellent known-groups and predictive validity. Specifically, the QCS was positively correlated with identification as a member of the LGBTQ community, political liberalism, personal political salience, and LGBTQ activism and negatively correlated with right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation. QCS mediated relationships between several individual difference variables and gay rights activism and can be used with both LGBTQ people and allies.

T1  - The relationship between media discourses and experiences of belonging: Dutch Somali perspectives
AN  - 1840585144
AB  - This article explores the relationship between media discourses and experiences of belonging. Studies on Muslims and the media have suggested that there is a largely negative discourse about Muslims in Western countries. As a result, the 'othering' processes that occur in the media may impact how Muslim citizens experience their individual attachments to society. We use excerpts from focus group interviews with Somalis in the Netherlands1 to investigate how they look upon, counter or internalize media discourses that seem to depict them in a negative way, particularly because they are Muslims. The findings indicate that discriminative discourses create a plurality of outcomes for our participants. Whereas all perceive a negative debate, some discursively 'join' a global Muslim community as a result, while others try their best to avoid association with a worldwide Muslim alliance and emphasize within-group variances. Though the opposing reactions might seem contradictory, we argue that both responses counter the same problems: 'othering' and victimization. Thereby we give voice to Somalis who are not often heard, while at the same time adding to the theoretical understanding of 'othering' processes.

T1  - Predicting support for collective action in the conflict between Turks and Kurds: Perceived threats as a mediator of intergroup contact and social identity: GPIR
AN  - 1830218141
AB  - Two studies investigated the role of perceived realistic and symbolic threats in predicting collective action tendencies, and in mediating effects of intergroup contact and social identity on collective action in the context of an intractable conflict. Extending earlier research on collective action, integrated threat theory, and intergroup contact theory, we tested whether realistic and symbolic threats would predict collective action tendencies and outgroup attitudes; and mediate the effects of intergroup contact and social identity on collective action tendencies and outgroup attitudes among the advantaged, Turks, and the disadvantaged, Kurds. Findings from both studies (Study 1, N = 289 Turks; Study 2, N = 209 Kurds) supported the predictive and mediating role of threats on collective action tendencies and outgroup attitudes. Overall findings suggest that advantaged and disadvantaged groups might not always have disparate psychologies regarding collective action and incorporating perceived threats as antecedents of collective action can help to explain collective action tendencies among both groups especially in conflictual contexts.

T1  - Bernard Magubane's The Making of a Racist State Revisited
AN  - 1825694328
AB  - The year 2016 not only marks the 20th anniversary of Bernard Magubane's classic book in historical sociology, The Making of a Racist State: British Imperialism and the Union of South Africa, 1875-1910 , but it is also a year in which White South Africans engaged in racial bigotry on social media. A number of commentators, together with South African politicians, have argued that racism in South Africa should be "criminalized." This review essay argues that such an approach is not only ahistorical but that it also mistakes the unessential for the essential. In particular, the review essay conducts a close reading of Magubane's book in an effort to gain insights on how best to understand racism.

T1  - Scientific justification of social policies: concepts of language and immigrant integration
AN  - 1814221871
AB  - Population mobility, globalisation, and the Internet contribute to the change of immigration patterns and the emergence of new kinds of identities and integration strategies. It is necessary to re-examine the heuristic significance of this field's key concepts in order to ensure that relevant and theoretically sound knowledge consistently informs integration policies, measures, and programmes. This paper focuses on the concepts of language and maintains that a narrow-utilitarian approach to the issue of language and integration may thrive due to uncritical acceptance of an instrumentalist view on language as a means of communication and/or a social marker together with an essentialist concept of identity that stems from the sociolinguistic tradition. However, this conceptual framework does not correspond to the complexity of the integration process in a contemporary society. The present paper aims to contribute to the field of language and immigrant integration via outlining an alternative approach to language grounded in the ideas of Humboldt, Potebnja, and Vygotsky (language as a creative force, a worldview, and a mediating tool) and discussing its potential for addressing the issue of integration in contemporary conditions.

T1  - Body Talk: Body Image Commentary on Queerty.com
AN  - 1807594891
AB  - In this study, we conducted a content analysis of 243 photographic images of men published on the gay male-oriented blog Queerty.com. We also analyzed 435 user-generated comments from a randomly selected 1-year sample. Focusing on images' body types, we found that the range of body types featured on the blog was quite narrow-the vast majority of images had very low levels of body fat and very high levels of muscularity. Users' body image-related comments typically endorsed and celebrated images; critiques of images were comparatively rare. Perspectives from objectification theory and social comparison theory suggest that the images and commentary found on the blog likely reinforce unhealthy body image in gay male communities.

T1  - The ethnic composition of schools and students' problem behaviour in four European countries: the role of friends
AN  - 1793307529
AB  - This study examines the relation between the proportion of co-ethnics in school and adolescents' problem behaviour in school (e.g. skipping class and arguing with teachers) and whether friendship patterns are underlying this relationship. We use data from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Survey in Four European Countries on ±16,000 students in England, Germany, The Netherlands, and Sweden and find that children display less problem behaviour when the proportion of co-ethnics in school is higher. This relationship is mediated by the characteristics of the friends that students have: the proportion of co-ethnics in school positively relates to students' proportion of in-school friends and co-ethnic friends in class, which are in turn negatively associated with problem behaviour in school. The strength and significance of these paths depend on students' ethnicity and country of residence. Implications of this study are discussed in the conclusion.

T1  - Queer Forms: Producing Documentation in Sexual Orientation Refugee Cases
AN  - 1879489216
AB  - Bureaucratic documents are often overlooked by anthropologists because of their "presumed transparency," that is, the assumption that they provide immediate access to what they document (Hull 2012). However, recent anthropological research reframes documents as mediating objects with active and lively capacities, challenging assumptions of transparency. In this article, I investigate the production of documents in sexual orientation refugee claims in Canada and how this production is crucial to the creation and surveillance of the category of the "sexual orientation refugee." I argue that anxieties about the production and circulation of "credible documentation" (Fassin and Rechtman 2009) by various participants in the refugee system and reliance on "social aesthetics" (Cabot 2013) in making decisions about who is deserving of a letter reflect the state's increased levels of distrust of refugee claimants. These affective anxieties contribute to particular modes of defining, delimiting, or discrediting sexual identity formations and experiences at all levels of the refugee determination system.

T1  - Love thy neighbour? Exploring prejudice against ethnic minority groups in a divided society: the case of Northern Ireland
AN  - 1784150894
AB  - Northern Ireland has seen a rise in racially motivated crimes and incidents reported to police in recent years and, although this has been accompanied by intensified media coverage, this phenomenon has been the subject of relatively little research. The purpose of this study is to evaluate empirically three theories that have been proposed to explain prejudice towards ethnic minorities in Northern Ireland; economic self-interest, social contact, and 'sectarianism as racism'. Using the 2013 Northern Ireland Life and Times Survey, which contains new questions on contact with ethnic minorities, this study looks at attitudes towards Eastern Europeans, Muslims and a third category of 'other ethnic groups'. Results from multivariate linear regression provide evidence for all three theories but also show that the strength and significance of predictive variables for prejudice vary across the minority groups. The findings that there are different motivations for prejudice towards different groups can inform policies to tackle racism in Northern Ireland.

T1  - Organa: The First Portuguese Lesbian Magazine
AN  - 1773060285
AB  - Organa magazine (1990-1992) is the first known lesbian publication in Portugal and exemplifies the distinct course of lesbian activism in Portugal, namely the late emergence and consolidation of a national lesbian community and subculture. Organa also bears similarities with the international gay and lesbian press regarding its alternative character, objectives, editorial contents, and trajectory. Despite having adopted an assimilationist strategy during most of its existence, it is argued that Organa fostered the political mobilization of Portuguese lesbians.

T1  - Organ donation, ethnicity and the negotiation of death: ethnographic insights from the UK
AN  - 1784145688
AB  - The introduction of end-of-life care criteria in the UK aims at standardising the processes of care at the end of life, including how medical decisions on death are communicated to the families of dying and (brain) dead patients. In the setting of the intensive care unit, these activities are routinely complicated by the imperative to secure donor organs for transplantation: where recent changes to donation services have seen the accommodation of organ donation procedures into end-of-life care routines. This has ramifications for understanding how medical decisions around death and dying are brokered with the families of potential organ donors. Drawing on an ethnographic study in England, this paper will document how communications around death get turned into a particular matter of concern for the practice of requesting organ donation from minority ethnic families. It shows how attempts to resolve differences of opinion between health professionals and families about a diagnosis of brain stem death or dying are mediated by sets of brokering practices: specifically, those termed technological, authoritative and religious brokering. These practices, we argue, not only facilitate a family's acceptance of their relative's death, but also serve to make possible a decision on organ donation.

T1  - Cutting across Imperial Feminisms toward Transnational Feminist Solidarities: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism
AN  - 1824184452
AB  - Photography, not only by imperial men but also by imperial women, has played a significant role in portraying the Muslim woman as the apolitical exotic of orientalist fantasies. The legacy of colonial photography by European women travelers continues to haunt the media of the global North even today. Such imperial feminist discourse on women in Egypt was blatant in Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's December 2011 announcement of the National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security at Georgetown University, as well as in the rhetoric of Laura Bush, Cherie Booth, and Condoleezza Rice on the War on Terror and Afghan and Iraqi women. In contrast, this article draws on the photographic counter-narratives, like "the girl in the blue bra," that transnational feminists circulated through social media during the people's uprising in Egypt beginning in 2011 to evoke powerful images of women from the global south. It also examines the figure of the pan-Arabfeminist Huda Shaarawi, who in 1919 organized the largest women's anti-British demonstration, and became in 1935 the vice president of the International Alliance of Women for Suffrage and Equal Citizenship, and in 1945 the founding president of the Arab Feminist Union. Bringing these figures into conversation with Angela Davis's encounter with women in Egypt in her book Women, Culture, and Politics opens up new spaces for cross-border feminisms that cut across imperial legacies that continue to define relationships between women of the global North and the global South.

T1  - Managing a marginalised identity in pro-anorexia and fat acceptance cybercommunities
AN  - 1752183305
AB  - This study examines how members of pro-anorexia (PA) and fat acceptance (FA) cybercommunities manage their ascribed 'offline' socially marginalised identity in an 'online' environment. While much of the sociological literature continues to focus on the corporeal or face-to-face practices of socially marginalised groups, we use online non-participant observation to explore how members of these sites use the internet to manage their marginalised identities. We find that cybercommunities provide a safe place for identity management where members come together to understand, negotiate and, at times, reject the marginalised identity ascribed to them in their offline environment. From the accounts of the PA and FA members we studied, we find that online and offline identities are mutually reinforcing and collectively inform and shape identity. However, the online environment provides an anonymised space for identity work, emotional support and an acceptance of their body, whatever their shape or size.

T1  - Internalized gay ageism, mattering, and depressive symptoms among midlife and older gay-identified men
AN  - 1751218095
AB  - In this paper we introduce the construct of "internalized gay ageism," or the sense that one feels denigrated or depreciated because of aging in the context of a gay male identity, which we identify as an unexplored aspect of sexual minority stress specific to midlife and older gay-identified men. Using a social stress process framework, we examine the association between internalized gay ageism and depressive symptoms, and whether one's sense of mattering mediates or moderates this association, controlling for three decades of depressive symptom histories. The sample is 312 gay-identified men (average age = 60.7 years, range = 48-78, 61% HIV-negative) participating in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) since 1984/85, one of the largest and longest running studies of the natural history of HIV/AIDS in the U.S., who provided contemporary (2012/13) reports of stress experiences. We find that internalized gay ageism can reliably be measured among these men, is positively associated with depressive symptoms net of an array of other factors that may also influence symptomatology (including depressive symptom histories), and mattering partially mediates but does not moderate its effect on depressive symptoms. Midlife and older gay men have traversed unparalleled historical changes across their adult lives and have paved the way for younger generations of sexual minorities to live in a time of less institutionalized discrimination. Still, they are at distinct risk for feeling socially invisible and devalued in their later years.

T1  - Thinking Lampedusa: border construction, the spectacle of bare life and the productivity of migrants
AN  - 1680154639; 201513931
AB  - This article interrogates the relationship between the Italian island of Lampedusa and trans-Mediterranean migration. It explores how the construction of Lampedusa as a border zone has been implicated in the rise and fall in numbers of migrants reaching the island's shores over the last two decades. It proceeds to consider the appropriateness of interpreting death and detention on Lampedusa in terms of 'bare life'. While acknowledging how Giorgio Agamben's formulation of bare life has been problematized in relation to irregular migration and taking into account the frequent acts of migrants' political agency on the island itself, it is argued that the transformation of Lampedusa by the media and political establishment into a spectacle of bare life is not only instrumental to the functioning of migration management at Europe's southern border but is also constitutive of the subordinate position of migrants in Italian society and its labour market.

T1  - Preference for consistency and value dissimilarities in dehumanization and prejudice toward asylum seekers in Australia
AN  - 1700676275; 201524984
AB  - Recent research has highlighted the importance of differential attribution of uniquely human characteristics in dehumanization and prejudice. Relatively little is known, however, about the importance of perceiving dissimilarities between the ingroup and outgroup in different types of values (beyond prosocial values), or the role of preference for consistency (PFC). This study investigated values, perceived dissimilarities in values, and PFC, in dehumanization of and prejudice toward asylum seekers in Australia. Results from a survey of 140 Australians revealed a strong relationship between dehumanization and prejudice. Individuals with stronger conservation and self-enhancement values, and greater perceived dissimilarity to asylum seekers on self-transcendence and self-enhancement values, dehumanized asylum seekers more and were more prejudiced toward them. The relationships between perceived self-transcendence and self-enhancement dissimilarities and prejudice were mediated by dehumanization, whereas PFC moderated the relationship between conservation value differences and dehumanization. These findings offer important insight into the conditions that promote dehumanization and prejudice, which may in turn help explain the negative perceptions of asylum seekers in Australia.

T1  - Polish Graduates: Migration and Its Media Representations
AN  - 1728662424; 201535505
AB  - The aim of the paper is to present the results of research into the dominant media discourses on post-accession migration within the context of the economic and socio-cultural situation of Polish University graduates. The first part of the article relates to the historical context of the educational boom in the late 1990s that led to the devaluation of the degree diploma, an increase in unemployment and increased numbers of tertiary-level educated Poles leaving Poland post 2004. The second part relates to the media debate on young migrants understood as a significant sphere (Jeffrey Alexander) in the construction of common knowledge on migration and the trigger transferring particular issues of migration into the civic sphere. The analysis reveals the interplay between media representations/narratives and popular academic conceptualizations of the effect of migration on young graduates: the crowding out hypothesis (Okolski) and double-marginalization (Iglicka) which are a part of the brain waste versus brain gain discourse.

T1  - From Slavery to Social Class to Disadvantage: An Intellectual History of the Use of Class to Explain Racial Differences in Criminal Involvement
AN  - 1723865790
AB  - Social class differences have been invoked to explain perceived racial differences in criminal involvement in the United States since the middle of the nineteenth century. Scholars have joined with the public and the media to make such arguments with mixed success. Despite criticism of the theories and research methods used and contradictory evidence, social class arguments have persisted. Among the most enduring are subculture of violence and subculture of poverty theories, which purportedly explain instrumental crimes such as property crime, drug sales, and robbery, but also violence including homicide and assault. Proponents argue that African Americans are carriers of pro-crime norms and values. Criminologists and sociologists have recently advanced more parsimonious theories that posit that structured social and economic disadvantage account for racial and ethnic patterns of crime. Good data and analysis provide compelling supporting evidence. Ethnographic evidence has compellingly shown that observable cultural differences are consequences of disadvantage and not causes of the conditions in which the impoverished poor live.

T1  - The Demand to Progress: Critical Nostalgia in LGBTQ Cultural Memory
AN  - 1700673408; 201525252
AB  - This article argues that, while representations of tragic lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) histories are disseminated widely, positive aspects of the past must be largely pushed out of the cultural imaginary to support a vision of the present in which sexual rights and freedoms have been achieved. It proposes that this view relies on a linear progress narrative wherein the experiences of LGBTQ people are held as consistently improving over time. In considering the construction of cultural memory through popular media and art, it claims a nostalgic turn to the past as a useful political tool for dismantling the pacifying aspects of the present.

T1  - Undocumented Immigrant Threat and Support for Social Controls
AN  - 1728660349; 201534060
AB  - Popular support for enhanced border and internal controls to deal with undocumented immigration is examined in relation to contextual measures of group threat as well as perceived levels of cultural and economic threat posed by undocumented immigrants. Results from a national survey of non-Latino respondents (N = 1,364) indicate that presumed threatening context measured in static terms is inconsequential. But when context is measured in dynamic terms that also reflect dispersion and potential contact, it significantly predicts support for border controls. Perceived threats are stronger predictors of support for enhanced controls than either contextual indicators of presumed threat or individual characteristics of respondents. Results also show that perceived economic and cultural threats mediate the effects of individual respondent characteristics and dynamic contextual conditions as well. Implications for future research on immigrant threat emphasize the importance of context measured in both change and dispersion-related terms and responses to threat that distinguish alternative dimensions of control. Future work should also consider that perceptions of threat may not only have direct influence on immigration policy preferences but can mediate the effects of context and individual characteristics on those preferences.

T1  - East Asian Religious Tolerance-A Myth or a Reality? Empirical Investigations of Religious Prejudice in East Asian Societies
AN  - 1718065865; 201532228
AB  - Is East Asian religious tolerance, as opposed to Western monotheistic prejudice, a stereotype or a reality? Based on theoretical and empirical evidence, we hypothesized low prejudice as a function of East Asian religiosity. We examined whether this holds true for interreligious, anti-atheist, ethnic, and anti-gay prejudice. In Study 1, analysis of the International Social Survey Program (ISSP) 2008 data from Eastern religious and Christian samples in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan (total N = 3,555) showed, contrarily to Christians, high interreligious tolerance and weaker if no anti-gay prejudice as a function of Eastern religiosity. In Study 2, Eastern religiosity among Taiwanese (n = 222) was negatively related to prejudice against various religious outgroups (except atheists), especially among those low in authoritarianism. In Study 3, Eastern religiosity among Taiwanese (n = 102) was negatively related to implicit interreligious (Muslims) and ethnic (Africans) prejudice; prosociality partially mediated the former association. Eastern religious tolerance seems to be true, but not unlimited. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Immigrant narratives and nation-building in a stateless nation: the case of Italians in post-devolution Wales
AN  - 1660024455; 201505632
AB  - This article aims to contribute to the study of migration and nation-building in stateless nations. It explores the media portrayal of Italian immigration in Wales after the 1997 devolution. It assesses why Italian immigrant narratives have figured prominently in the Welsh media after devolution. It shows that, being seen as Wales's 'model minority', Italians have ideally served a reinforcement of the surrounding inclusive rhetoric, one that draws on an old-standing Welsh tolerance-myth. Thus, this article argues that stateless nations aiming to gain increasing autonomy can use their immigration history to construct and disseminate a tolerant and inclusive national image, one that aims to foster both indigenous people and migrants' sense of national belonging.

T1  - The vulnerable other -- distorted equity in Chinese-Ghanaian employment relations
AN  - 1559007156; 201431956
AB  - Based on a two-sided ethnographic study in Accra, this paper analyses Chinese-Ghanaian employment relations from the perspectives of psychological contract, cross-cultural equity expectations and foreignness. Reaching beyond racially framed allegations of each other that are informed partly by politicized media discourses, structural analysis shows that mutually contradictory, culturally grounded expectations regarding their employment relationship are central to the understanding of conflict between Chinese employers and Ghanaian employees. Central to the frictions of mutual equity expectations is the feeling of existential vulnerability that -- although particular for each group -- is shared by both Chinese migrant employers taking high financial risks in an unfamiliar and potentially hostile environment and their local employees recruited almost exclusively from economically marginalized groups.

T1  - Faces of globalization and the borders of states: from asylum seekers to citizens
AN  - 1551002521; 201429893
AB  - Intensifying processes of globalization have led to a series of tensions around the way in which even the most cosmopolitan democracies now treat people who move across their borders. Non-citizens have become problems. The postcolonial settler nation-states -- Australia, Canada, the USA and others -- were 'founded' by immigrants and refugees who moved globally to become citizens in these 'new lands'. Such countries were made by migrants displacing indigenous others. However, in a conflict-ridden world in which the displacement of persons has become endemic -- and in a media-connected world where the possibility of finding a better place to live has become increasingly imaginable and desired -- these countries are now attempting to manage that global flow of people by stringent homeland security measures that are becoming increasingly problematic. While they are constituted through the modern imaginary of liberal democratic norms, human rights and rule of law, in each country over the last few years, rules have been bent, breached or bolstered in order to keep people out. The essay argues that given the globalization of people movement, the nation-state has reached the limits of responding though unilateral or even regional multilateral arrangements.

T1  - Formula as Content: Medieval Jewish Institutions, the Cairo Geniza, and the New Diplomatics
AN  - 1728661818; 201533789
AB  - In the last 50 years, the study of the Jewish communities of the medieval Islamic world has changed as research on Cairo Geniza documents has assumed a more central place in the field. Where historians used to characterize those communities as autonomous, self-enclosed, and hierarchical, Geniza-based work has emphasized their multiple points of contact with the state, their fluidity, and their networks of individual ties. Yet we still know very little about how communal institutions actually worked, especially rabbinical courts. Whereas work on Geniza legal documents has focused mainly on litigants and the cases they brought, we propose instead to pay close attention to scribes-to the documents' formal and formulaic features. Here, we use a single document to illustrate how formulas can provide evidence for the relationship between litigants and the institutions they approached for legal mediation.

T1  - Perceptions of a Superordinate Identity in Northern Ireland
AN  - 1718067781; 201530747
AB  - Northern Ireland is still a deeply divided society where national and religious identities remain important. In recent years, the emergence of a new identity, 'Northern Irish,' has attracted researchers' attention. It has been suggested that it may be acting as a common ingroup identity, associated with more positive intergroup attitudes. This study aimed to examine perceptions of the Northern Irish identity. It was predicated that British Protestants and Irish Catholics would perceive the Northern Irish identity differently and that identity strength would influence perception of inclusion, but only through subgroup identity threat. Using a cross-sectional survey, participants who self-identified as British Protestant (n = 76), Irish Catholic (n = 41), Northern Irish Protestant (n = 78), or Northern Irish Catholic (n = 13) were asked to report their strength of identity in addition to how inclusive and threatening they felt the Northern Irish identity to be. They were also asked to indicate who they think uses the Northern Irish identity and what it means. Result show that Irish Catholics were less likely to perceive the Northern Irish identity as inclusive, compared to British Protestants but there were no differences on perceptions of threat. Threat was found to mediate the relationship between identity strength and superordinate identity inclusion. The Northern Irish identity was suggested to be mostly used by British Protestants but the meaning of this identity differed, both within and between identity groups. These findings have implications for understanding the real world applicability of a superordinate identity and for societies trying to move forward from sustained periods of conflict.

T1  - Joyous Discipline: Native Autonomy and Culturally Conservative Two-Spirit People
AN  - 1622295690; 201438384
AB  - Every few months he's contacted by a media outlet, usually a radio station or a newspaper, asking him to comment on some happening surrounding Two-Spirit people, same-sex marriage among Natives, or to react to some new wave of discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, or queer (GLBTQ) Indians. The invocation of gay liberation counter narratives, particularly the idea of 'acceptance,' creates a dilemma for GLBTQ and Two-Spirit (GLBTQ2) Natives' involvement in their own local emancipation and their desire to be active and contributing members of their communities. The community attitudes from which they seek relief are contained within the communities they also seek to be accepted. Here, Gilley argues that spaces are less framed by acceptance and more so by ancient conceptions of participation, commitment, and trust-conceptions derived from the broadly defined category of autonomy.

T1  - Compañeras in the Middle: Toward a History of Latina Lesbian Organizing in Chicago: Gay Lesbian Quarterly
AN  - 1517910643
AB  - Since the scholarship that exists on lesbian organizing in the Midwest neglects to engage with the history of Latina lesbian organizing, this project focuses on Latina lesbians as agents of change and active subjects of a multiracial history of grassroots organizing. I explore the history of two organizations in Chicago -- LLENA, an activist organization that existed from 1988 to 1992, and Amigas Latinas, a Latina lesbian, bisexual, and transgender advocacy organization that was founded in 1995 and is still in existence. My analysis is based on oral interviews, participant observation, archival records (minutes, flyers, newsletters, letters, and financial papers), and media accounts in the Chicago gay press. I describe the founding of LLENA and Amigas Latinas, their efforts to create Latina lesbian visibility in both the "Latino" and "lesbian" social and political cultures of Chicago, and their successful and unsuccessful attempts to negotiate divergent national and ethnic histories, class and linguistic differences, and the diverse political stances of their membership. I also look at the coalition-building politics that the two organizations established with other Latino and queer communities in Chicago and internationally, their strategies for sustainability, and their enduring contributions. I argue that through small and large accomplishments, both LLENA and Amigas Latinas advance significant cultural and political change in the Chicago area. The collective effort of Latina lesbians to create and occupy public spaces is inherently political and has forever altered the mainstream LGBT and Latino communities in Chicago.

T1  - What factors account for black-white differences in anti-Muslim sentiment in the contemporary USA?
AN  - 1551000612; 201429155
AB  - I use data from the 2004 General Social Survey (N=719) and multivariate analyses to: explore the effects of race on attitudes toward Muslims; evaluate the extent to which the racial differences were mediated by psychological and religious factors; and assess whether the race effects differed significantly by gender. The findings show that blacks report significantly more favourable feelings toward Muslims than whites. Those respondents who are female, more educated and Catholic also hold significantly higher scores on the 100-point scale assessing feelings toward Muslims. After controlling for religious and psychological factors, I find that the racial difference in feelings toward Muslims is increased, indicating that the race effect is suppressed by these factors. Moderation analysis reveals that white men hold the highest level of negative feelings toward Muslims, compared to women and black men. The findings suggest challenging the misconstrued perceptions of Muslims through education and endorsement of positive images. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Piloting Lead with Love: A Film-Based Intervention to Improve Parents' Responses to Their Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Children
AN  - 1680151993; 201513964
AB  - Lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth are at increased risk for a variety of poor health outcomes, relative to their heterosexual counterparts, and recent research implicates family responses to a child's sexual orientation as an important predictor of these health difficulties. Lead with Love is a 35-min documentary-style preventive intervention created to improve parents' behaviors toward their lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) children, by providing parents with support, information, and concrete behavioral guidance. The film was made available free online, and was promoted widely with a multi-media marketing campaign. In this paper we describe the theoretical and empirical rationale for the intervention, and report findings from pilot data collected in the first year after the film's release. Specifically, we gathered data to examine the feasibility of reaching parents of LGB youth with this intervention, to determine whether it was acceptable, and to provide preliminary indicators of its potential efficacy. In the first 12 months after launch, 10,949 individuals viewed the film online. The film successfully reached parents of LGB youth (n = 1,865), including the hardest to reach parents: 21% had only learned about their child's sexual orientation in the past month, 36% reported having an LGB child was 'very' or 'extremely' hard for them, and 86% had never obtained any other formal support for having an LGB child. Parents who completed a follow-up assessment immediately after the film reported significant pre- to post-film increases in self-efficacy for parenting an LGB child. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Missy 'Misdemeanor' Elliott and Nicki Minaj: Fashionistin' Black Female Sexuality in Hip-Hop Culture-Girl Power or Overpowered?
AN  - 1550999924; 201429145
AB  - Since the emergence of hip-hop in the early 1980s, African American women's sexuality and its correlation to their search for self-identity and self-control have been at the forefront of the genre's discourse. Using a multidisciplinary theoretical framework (objectification theory, scripting theory, and Black feminist epistemologies), this article explores the fashion aesthetic, imagery, and celebrity culture of two major African American female hip-hop megastars, Nicki Minaj and Missy Elliott, to examine how the sexual politics of hip-hop culture has helped to define their sexuality, agency, and subjectivity. By examining the style and professional choices that fashioned their careers in hip-hop media, we explore the extent to which they have refuted, or submitted, to the distorted view of African American female sexuality, and thus contributed to their objectification or empowerment.

T1  - Music as a weapon of ethnopolitical violence and conflict: processes of ethnic separation during and after the break-up of Yugoslavia
AN  - 1494751508; 201401977
AB  - Using illustrations from the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s and their aftermath, Baker argues that understanding popular music and public discourses about it can help to understand the dynamics of ethnopolitical conflict. Studies of war and conflict have approached music as political communication, as an object of securitization, as a means of violence and as a symbol of ethnic difference, while international law in the context of another case of collective violence, Rwanda, has even begun to question whether performing or broadcasting certain music could constitute incitement to genocide. Drawing on poststructuralist perspectives on the media and ethnicization in conflicts, Baker explores and interrogates the discourse of popular music as a weapon of war that was in use during and after the violent break-up of Yugoslavia. Music during the Yugoslav wars was used as a tool of humiliation and violence in prison camps, and to provoke fear of the ethnic Other in line with a strategy of ethnic cleansing; it was also conceptualized as a morale-booster for the troops of one's own side. A discourse of music as a weapon of war was also in use and persisted after the war, when its referent was shifted to associate music-as-a-weapon not to the brave and defiant ingroup so much as the aggressive Other. This was then turned against a wider range of signifiers than those who had directly supported the Other's troops and had the effect of perpetuating ethnic separation and obstructing the reformation of a (post-)Yugoslav cultural space. Despite evidence that music did serve as an instrument of violence in the Yugoslav wars (and the precedent of the Bikindi indictment in Rwanda), Baker concludes that music should be integrated into understandings of ethnopolitical conflict not through a framework of incitement and complicity but with respect for the significance of music in the everyday.

T1  - The Role of Premigration Status in the Acculturation of Chinese-Vietnamese and Vietnamese Americans
AN  - 1463011682; 201345878
AB  - Drawing from fifty in-depth interviews, this research examines the role of existing parental language knowledge on the ethnic identity negotiation of two ethnically distinct children of immigrant groups-Vietnamese and Chinese-Vietnamese-whose families have emigrated from Vietnam to the Southern California region of the United States. While previous research focused primarily on the influence of premigration status on first-generation immigrants, this article considers how a central aspect of premigration status (intranational ethnicity) applies specifically to the children of first generation immigrants. By taking the premigration approach of comparing the experiences of different ancestral-origin groups from a single nation (the intranational ethnicity perspective), this analysis suggests that a family's premigration ethnic status shapes the 1.5 and second-generation's ethnic self-identification choices through the mediation of parental language knowledge. Specifically, for the children of immigrants with twice-minority status (Chinese-Vietnamese Americans), parental language knowledge serves as an easy ethnic identity default during these children's early self-identification process.

T1  - The Role of Job Insecurity in Explanations of Racial Health Inequalities
AN  - 1429629576; 201335722
AB  - The literature documenting substantial health differences for racial minorities in the United States is well developed and has considered a multitude of explanations for such disparities. However, the literature seldom addresses the health effects for racial minorities produced in the workplace. This study bridges these two literatures in order to understand the mediating role of job insecurity in explanations of racial health disparities. Our central argument is that racial differences in job insecurity resulting from the marginalized labor market positions of racial minorities are partially responsible for racial disparities in health. This study utilizes adjacent category and partial adjacent category logit models of general health using data from the 2000 to 2010 General Social Survey in order to test this claim. Overall, the results from this study indicate that there are substantial racial differences in job insecurity, and both race and job insecurity are important predictors of general self-rated health. Additionally, racial differences in job insecurity help explain a portion of the racial disparities in health. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for the study of health disparities in the United States. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Reality Television and the Metapragmatics of Racism
AN  - 1494300050; 201402116
AB  - In the contemporary United States, racism is commonly thought to be located in the hearts and minds of a particular negatively valorized social figure: the "racist." Racist discourse is often implicit and indexical, and interracial interactions may be overdetermined by mutual "racial paranoia" (Jackson 2008) about interlocutors' true thoughts. In this paper I argue that the reality television genre has a unique engagement with tropes of authenticity and intentionality that exploits this dynamic of suspicion. I take as an example a conflict that occurred on an episode of Survivor around comments made by a White southern man to an African American woman. In the scenes analyzed, racial paranoia is itself mobilized as a narrative hook. Participants prod each other to reveal the indexical meaning that they suspect is underlying each other's utterances, showing a perceived incongruence between language and intention. Casting, production, and editorial practices contribute to the dramatization of racism as interpersonal conflict. I show that interventions like sound mixing, the use of testimonial interviews, and the editorial placement of reaction shots reinscribe broader cultural oppositions between "authentic" mental states and "false" performed identities.

T1  - 'They are all the same': Low perceived typicality and outgroup disapproval as buffers of intergroup threat in mass media
AN  - 1364703240; 201323752
AB  - Three studies examined whether the perceived typicality of a threatening outgroup actor in media messages alters threat effects on attitudes toward the entire outgroup; and whether outgroup (dis)approval of the actor influences perceived typicality. Study 1 measured Dutch majority attitudes toward Moroccans before and after the Van Gogh murder by a Moroccan-Dutch Muslim. Low perceived typicality of the murderer mitigated less favorable attitudes toward Moroccans after the murder. Study 2 used a newspaper report involving a Moroccan perpetrator to manipulate (dis)approval by other Moroccans. Controlling for prior attitudes toward Moroccans, outgroup disapproval effectively reduced the perceived typicality of the perpetrator as a Moroccan. Study 3 manipulated threat to Psychology students' identity by an Economy student's insulting behavior and (dis)approval by other Economy students in a campus magazine interview. Outgroup disapproval reduced the perceived typicality of the insulting student and buffered threat effects on Psychology students' attitudes toward Economy students. We conclude that outgroup disapproval buffers threat effects of negative outgroup behavior in mass media on outgroup attitudes through reducing perceived typicality. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - AN INCONVENIENT BIRTH
AN  - 1347783126; 201318658
AB  - This article reconstructs the history of the nationalist movement among the Dusunic peoples also known as Kadazandusun in the Malaysian state of Sabah, and its demise following the formation of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. It analyses how the 'Kadazan nationalists' elaborated a modern, objectified culture based on cultural traits, symbols and traditions of rural peoples and used print media and local radio to spread it. When the Dusunic peoples were integrated as a minority in Malaysia, the nation builders acquired control of all the main media and excluded their languages and culture. The article then analyses the dynamics of the struggle between the ethnic group and the central government as reflected in cultural production, language development and loss, and in ethnic naming. While these issues reveal competition between various native elites they have nevertheless allowed the growth of a sense of belonging to a Dusunic ethnic group, however named.

T1  - Edna O'Brien and narrative diaspora space
AN  - 1429624027; 201335803
AB  - Given the persistent presence of migration in the work of Edna O'Brien, it is surprising how marginal a theme it is in critiques of her work. This article explores how questions of diaspora have reached a renewed level of depth and intensity in her novel The Light of Evening (2006) and the related short story 'My Two Mothers' (2011). Looking, in particular, at how letters play a central role in the relationships of three generations of Irish women across three countries, it analyses how issues of mother(land), diaspora and belonging are mediated through migrant fiction. It draws on the work of Avtar Brah and Paul Ricoeur to argue that, along with related forms of textuality within O'Brien's oeuvre, letters represent a 'narrative diaspora space' which illuminates the relationship between mothers, daughters and writing in Irish migrant experience.

T1  - INDIGENOUS INTERFERENCE: Mapuche Use of Radio in Times of Acoustic Colonialism
AN  - 1520336732; 201412952
AB  - Since 1993 to the present, a group of Mapuche activists has aired the bilingual radio show, Wixage anai, in Santiago, Chile; on the other side of the Andes, another Mapuche collective, the Equipo de Comunicacion Mapurbe, produced and broadcast a series of brief radio programs between 2003 and 2005 in Bariloche, southern Argentina. In this article, the author argues that these radio programs constitute an exercise of Mapuche agency that challenges what he calls the acoustic colonialism of corporate and criollo mass media in both countries. This article illustrates how Mapuche activists creatively use radio as a connective medium among Mapuche communities and a space for the public audibility of their own voices, sounds, and modes of speech. The author analyzes the history, cultural politics, and performative features of these two initiatives, engaging theoretical and critical views on sound media, state cultural policies, and politics of indigenous agency.

T1  - Flotus: Media Darling Or Monster?
AN  - 1429629276; 201335699
AB  - The job of First Lady of the United States (FLOTUS) is the official hostess of the U.S. with a White House Office and Staff, and is high profile, unpaid, highly scrutinized by the media, criticized by many, sometimes thankless, offers great travel to distant lands, and is one that is oftentimes misunderstood. For example, Hillary Clinton (FLOTUS #42) was demonized for wearing pantsuits and saying she wasn't a stay at home mom who baked cookies. Nancy Reagan (FLOTUS #40) was criticized for her Hollywood connections, designer gowns and astrology consultations. Barbara Bush (FLOTUS #41) was noted for her grandmotherly white hair and ever-present pearls. And now there is Michelle Obama (FLOTUS #44). Most recently, there was a Fox News story about whether the Muppets, in the latest movie, are spouting Communists propaganda. "Are the Muppets Communists?" is the headline on one story with a big color picture of FLOTUS Michelle Obama seated next to Kermit the Frog. The photo, not from the movie trailer, was taken on Dec. 1, 2011 during the National Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony. In addition, FLOTUS Obama has been criticized for favoring sleeveless garments and for eating a hamburger in public while championing the fight against childhood obesity and while encouraging children to "Let's Move." This paper will examine media representations and coverage of the first ladies over the past three decades. Those first ladies are: #40 -- Anne Frances Robbins Nancy Davis Reagan (1923-), Ronald Reagan Administration 1981-1989; #41 -- Barbara Pierce Bush (1925-), George H.W. Bush Administration 1989-1993; #42 -- Hillary Rodham Clinton (1947-), William Jefferson Clinton Administration 1993-2001; #43 -- Laura Welch Bush (1946-), George W. Bush Administration 2001-2009; and #44 -- Michelle Robinson Obama (1964-), Barack H. Obama Administration 2009-. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Interrelations Between Age, Sense of Belonging, and Depressive Symptoms Among Australian Gay Men and Lesbians
AN  - 1373427342; 201328676
AB  - Researchers have demonstrated that age is related to depression among gay men and lesbians, with younger adults experiencing more depression than older adults. Other researchers have indicated that a sense of belonging is related to lower levels of depression. This study investigated whether sense of belonging to the gay and lesbian community moderates and mediates the relationship between age and depressive symptoms among gay men and lesbians. An Australian sample of self-identified gay men (n = 346) and lesbians (n = 270) completed the Psychological subscale of the Sense of Belonging Instrument and the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Results indicated that age and sense of belonging were directly and independently related to depressive symptoms for gay men and lesbians. In addition, for lesbians only, sense of belonging moderated the age-depressive symptom relation. For lesbians with low levels of sense belonging to the lesbian community, age was not associated with depressive symptoms. In contrast, for lesbians with high levels of sense of belonging to the lesbian community, the association between sense of belonging and depressive symptoms decreased with increasing age. Encouraging gay men and lesbians (especially younger lesbians) to become involved in the gay and lesbian community is likely to be beneficial for their mental health.

T1  - The politics of fear: what does it mean to those who are otherized and feared?
AN  - 1315602779; 201307445
AB  - Islamophobia has, of late, created a tendency to conflate all Muslims as belonging to a single nation of Islam that does not recognize and respect boundaries imposed by western geopolitics. This has been done by some to create and by others to generate a sense of exclusive unity that would separate all Muslims and make them into 'others' within western societies. It is the contention of this paper that such calls both embody and ignore the diversities of Islam as understood and practised by its adherents. Furthermore by 'otherizing' the entire community of Muslims in the West, the singular label of 'Islamism' marginalizes and may even silence the vibrant contestations among Muslims about their faith and its teachings; these include questions posed by women who may be described as feminists. The attributes of Islamism, ascribed to the faith by public, the media and politicians in the West and adopted by some Muslims primarily as a politically unifying force, are very different from the fluidity and flexibility that has been a historic part of lived Islam. Many Muslims may well aspire to belong to the umma: people of Islam conceptualized as crossing ethnic, racial, geographical and political boundaries. But Muslims in general and Muslim women in particular do not wish to do so at the expense of being otherized and conforming to the negative stereotypes ascribed to them that mask their fluid identities and, in the case of 'white' women, their close ties with their kinship networks. The multiplicity of Muslim's identities sits more easily within the permeable unbounded umma applicable to the global as well as the local without necessarily always privileging one or other identity.

T1  - Modes of incorporation and transnational Zimbabwean migration to Britain
AN  - 1315601146; 201307661
AB  - In the last decade, the phenomenal growth of Zimbabwean congregations in Britain, responding to conditions in both the hostland and homeland, has received little scholarly attention. This article, drawing from an in-depth study of Zimbabwean Christians and the modes-of-incorporation framework, examines the ways in which the context of reception in the hostland shape, alter and influence the development of religious transnationalism among migrants. As this article will argue, Zimbabweans' mode of incorporation into Britain was mediated by a hostile reception from authorities, considerable prejudice and hostility from the host society and a weak pre-existing co-ethnic community. These conditions in the hostland reinforce migrants' transnational religious ties to the homeland. In addition, the article illustrates the contradictory ways in which respondents reproduce, contest and construct their transnational gendered identities. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Do Muslims in Germany Really Fail to Integrate? Muslim Integration and Trust in Public Institutions
AN  - 1322723519; 201310748
AB  - Multivariate analysis of 2008 data from the German Social Survey (ALLBUS) provides firm evidence on the basis of one important dimension of political integration-individuals' trust in the political system-that Muslims are integrating well into German society. The results are significant despite controls for multiple indicators of respondents' social capital, socioeconomic status, post-material views, ideological position, partisan support for parties in power, assessment of government performance, interest in politics, and amount of television viewing. Furthermore, Muslims' level of religiosity does not influence their level of political trust. The findings raise new questions about integration in that the significantly lower levels of political trust found among non-Muslims may negatively affect their views of government and its efforts to respond to Germany's Muslim population. Skepticism and distrust of government by non-Muslim ethnic Germans may undermine important programs designed to bridge the actual value and cultural differences which remain the source of the ignorance that fuels prejudice and discrimination.

AN  - 1728661444; 201534146
AB  - Migratory experiences are part of the representative phenomena of contemporary social arrangements since not only goods and capital but also persons move from one part of the earth to another, joining the synergic flows of capitalism organized on a global scale. Empirically, we refer to the migratory experiences of footwear industry workers from Novo Hamburgo, Brazil, who have immigrated to China in recent years. We analyze the strategies adopted by these groups to support their projects to migrate to and settle in China. Above all, we focus on the role played by communications media in the construction of links between the community of origin and the new ethnic environment recreated in foreign lands.

T1  - Peddling sport: liberal multiculturalism and the racial triangulation of blackness, Chineseness and Native American-ness in professional basketball
AN  - 1283642052; 201303504
AB  - Deploying liberal multiculturalist discourse, the media depicts professional basketball as a post-racial space where all talented players, regardless of their race, can thrive if they work hard. An analysis of the construction of non-white players in the 1930s and in 2010 demonstrates sport as modulated by racially charged discourse. As part of a liberal multiculturalist frame, the coding of basketball players as hero, threat and novelty serve to privilege whiteness and replicate racialized and gendered images that can be traced to the 1930s. In doing so, the article highlights how liberal multiculturalism involves racial triangulation and the simultaneous processes of hyper-racialization and de-racialization.

T1  - Getting integration right? Media transnationalism and domopolitics in Ireland
AN  - 1567049111; 201435226
AB  - This article examines the transnational media environments and experiences of Nigerian and Chinese nationals living in Ireland. It theorizes empirical research in the context of the mode of integration governance developed in the Republic of Ireland during a period of significant in-migration. Building on a theory of domopolitics, it suggests that Ireland's short-lived integration regime deployed culture and interculturalism as resources for the self-governing integration of all foreign nationals, while developing a system of civic stratification designed to limit claims to citizenship and social and economic rights. It examines the concomitant development of public service media policies in this context. Drawing on recent discussions of contrapuntal media readings, the article argues that transnational media experience refracts the lived tensions inherent in the disjuncture between the possibilities of cultural participation and the constraints of socio-political containment.

T1  - The body as experienced: an embodied approach to the packaging of the Dai river bathing custom in Xishuang Banna, China
AN  - 1315600384; 201307618
AB  - This article looks at the filming of the Dai river bathing custom by the media professionals for tourism promotion in Xishuang Banna, China. It speaks to the previous scholarships that have studied the Otherness of ethnic minorities in China's mainstream and popular representations. Yet this case contextualizes this issue in the era of China's domestic tourism, when ethnic cultures and bodies are increasingly put on display, experienced, and (re-)produced through individualized, immediate, embodied encounters in tourist zones. By taking embodied experiences to the center, this article studies the touristic representation of ethnic minorities as China's national Others from an angle of embodiment. It inquires how the embodied experiences of both media professionals and Dai bathers at the filming constitute the very process during which Otherness, difference, and selfness are perceived, actualized, and (re-)produced in localized reality and at the grassroots level.

AN  - 1315601058; 201307442
AB  - Womanism praxis mediates the daily interactions and experiences of life, forming both a resistance to oppression and a global engagement derived from self-determined vision. Womanist mothers recall traditional African mothering practices and forge a future that is empowering to both their children and themselves. Womanist mothers challenge the confines of the nuclear family, embracing extended familial and communal bonds, drawing from traditional African gender roles, kinship ties and definitions of community to build a "village" that shares in child-rearing responsibilities and enables mothers to develop as full and complete human beings who are guided by spirit as they engage in motherhood and their own development as a part of the larger human struggle for greater peace, beauty, freedom and justice.

T1  - Manufacturing Identities: Masking in Postwar Highland Guatemala
AN  - 1023028704; 201223979
AB  - At their patron saints' annual fiestas, the Maya and the Ladinos of western highland Guatemala perform dances in costumes that take their inspiration from film, television, music, and the Internet. The two groups adapt the costume dance to their own interests, and the tension between them is evident in the different types of costumes they rent and purchase. Ladino costumes distinguish their wearers as modern consumers, while K'iche' costumes stress communitas, adding to the borrowed images to connect with indigenous forms of subsistence and lifestyle and to allow comment on proper forms of behavior and on social ills. The costume makers act as cultural intermediaries, producing both the context and the meaning of the dances and enabling performers and spectators alike to construct different identities through them.

T1  - Affective mediators of intergroup contact: A three-wave longitudinal study in South Africa
AN  - 964187094; 201207308
AB  - Intergroup contact (especially cross-group friendship) is firmly established as a powerful strategy for combating group-based prejudice (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). Great advances have been made in understanding how contact reduces prejudice (Brown & Hewstone, 2005), highlighting the importance of affective mediators (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008). The present study, a 3-wave longitudinal study undertaken among minority-status Colored high school children in South Africa (N = 465), explored the full mediation of the effects of cross-group friendships on positive outgroup attitudes, perceived outgroup variability, and negative action tendencies via positive (affective empathy) and negative (intergroup anxiety) affective mediators simultaneously. The target group was the majority-status White South African outgroup. As predicted, a bidirectional model described the relationship between contact, mediators, and prejudice significantly better over time than either autoregressive or unidirectional longitudinal models. However, full longitudinal mediation was only found in the direction from Time 1 contact to Time 3 prejudice (via Time 2 mediators), supporting the underlying tenet of the contact hypothesis. Specifically, cross-group friendships were positively associated with positive outgroup attitudes (via affective empathy) and perceived outgroup variability (via intergroup anxiety and affective empathy) and were negatively associated with negative action tendencies (via affective empathy). Following Pettigrew and Tropp (2008), we compared two alternative hypotheses regarding the relationship between intergroup anxiety and affective empathy over time. Time 1 intergroup anxiety was indirectly negatively associated with Time 3 affective empathy, via Time 2 cross-group friendships. We discuss the theoretical and empirical contributions of this study and make suggestions for future research. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - NEIGHBORLINESS WITH ETHNIC GROUPS IN THE UNITED STATES: MODELING ITS NEWS ANTECEDENTS AND HEALTH OUTCOMES
AN  - 1567045572; 201435072
AB  - The current study builds and empirically tests a theoretical model in which news use influences health outcomes directly and indirectly, as mediated by neighborliness with specific ethnic groups. With telephone survey data from 2007, a well-fitting structural equation model indicates direct and indirect effects of news use measures on two health outcomes: health status and stress. Effects of newspaper news use were more favorable than those via television and online news, and effects of neighborliness with whites and with Asians were more favorable on health outcomes than effects of neighborliness with blacks and with Hispanics. .

T1  - Post-Jewish?: Theorizing the Emergence of Jewishness in Canadian Television
AN  - 1364699509; 201323334
AB  - This essay examines representations of Jewishness in three recent Canadian TV series -- Less than Kind, Being Erica, and 18 to Life. In it, I consider that Canadian television has historically avoided depictions of Jewishness to differentiate itself from American television, and how the emergence of Jews/Jewishness in Canadian television signals a post-Jewish turn. Through the study of these texts, and an examination of literatures on ethnicity, nation, and television, I begin to articulate a theory about Jewishness in contemporary Canadian television that does not rely too heavily on comparisons with the United States but also recognizes our intimate connection and deep debt to that nation's televisual and scholarly traditions.

T1  - Language, Gay Pornography, and Audience Reception
AN  - 907929208; 201124714
AB  - Erotic imagery is an important component of gay pornographic cinema, particularly, where work of audience reception is concerned. However, to assume the audience engagement with the films is limited solely to the erotic realm is to underestimate the workings of ideological power in the context and aftermath of reception. For example, the director of the film under discussion here (Men of Israel; Lucas, 2009b) intended to present an erotic celebration of the nation-state. Yet, most viewers ignore the particulars of context in their comments about audience reception, placing the "Israeli" narrative within a broader framework, using transnational rather than film-specific criteria to guide their "reading" of the Israeli-centered narrative. This article uses as its entry point the language that viewers employ when describing their reactions to Men of Israel on a gay video club's Web site; this article shows how the work of audience reception may draw attention to a film's erotic details while invoking social and political messages that completely reframe the film's erotic narrative.

T1  - Neighborhood diversity and the appreciation of native- and immigrant-owned homes
AN  - 896165326; 201120125
AB  - This paper examines the effect of neighborhood diversity on the nativity gap in home-value appreciation in Australia. Specifically, immigrant homeowners experienced a 41.7% increase in median home values between 2001 and 2006, while the median value of housing owned by the native-born increased by 59.4% over the same period. We use a semi-parametric decomposition approach to assess the relative importance of the various determinants of home values in producing this gap. We find that the differential returns to housing wealth are not related to changes in the nature of the houses or the neighborhoods in which immigrants and native-born homeowners live. Rather, the gap stems from the fact that over time there were differential changes across groups in the hedonic prices (i.e., returns) associated with the underlying determinants of home values.

T1  - 'The language of shirkers and scroungers?' Talking about illness, disability and coalition welfare reform
AN  - 1037877547; 201231069
AB  - Following establishment of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, welfare benefits and those who receive them have become of increased significance, with the government and the media alike lamenting the amount of people receiving benefits and what could, and indeed should, be done about it. With a recent White Paper outlining a new Universal Credit, an integrated working age credit that will replace a range of benefits including the Employment Support Allowance for ill and disabled recipients, it means that once again sickness-related benefits are back in the spotlight. This piece critically reflects upon the way people receiving sickness-related benefits such as Incapacity Benefit and Employment Support Allowance can be labelled, portrayed and discussed within a wider rhetoric that encompasses governmental, public and media attitudes. Unfortunately, the impacts of such rhetoric could be counter-productive with regards to employer responses to ill and disabled individuals. Yet policy remains centred largely on the supply rather than the demand side of labour. As a consequence, policies that target and highlight the functional limitations of individuals with perceived impairments are prioritised and supported at the expense of those which draw attention to and seek to resolve the stark inequalities of the social organisation of work.

T1  - Negotiating social identities on an Eastern Maroon radio show
AN  - 1010633367; 201211360
AB  - In recent years, Pidgin and Creole languages have made significant inroads into the public domain of the countries where they are spoken. The media, and the radio broadcasting sector in particular, are the areas in which they figure most prominently. Extension of their use has brought about linguistic changes (Garrett, 2000). This paper explores such changes in relation to the Eastern Maroon radio program Loweman Pansu broadcasted in French Guiana. It investigates whether the program assimilates established norms and practices of programs run in European languages or introduces innovative ones based on local practices. Analysis suggests that the program's makeup and linguistic practices contribute to the emergence of an alternative social space that is distinctly Eastern Maroon in character but integrates properties that are linked to the urban context. This contributes to the construction of a modern urban Maroon identity that transcends traditional ethnic and national borders. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

T1  - A Man-Made Disaster: The Earthquake of January 12, 2010 -- A Haitian Perspective
AN  - 875715894; 201115277
AB  - The earthquake of January 12, 2010, was not the first, nor will it be the last to hit Haiti, a volcanic land traumatized by natural and man-made disasters from its beginning as a colony and sovereign nation. In the throes of reinventing itself politically, socially, and culturally since the overthrow of the Duvalier dictatorship, 1957-1986, Haiti now has to reinvent itself physically. Are there bounds to the Haitians' vaunted resilience? The author proposes to examine the aftermath of the "Goudougoudou," as Haitians now call the event, relating it to other events that have taxed Haitian resolve over the course of two centuries.

T1  - Mediated Intergroup Conflict: The Discursive Construction of "Illegal Immigrants" in a Regional U.S. Newspaper
AN  - 1928170803
AB  - Using an intergroup communication framework, this article examines how a newspaper in southeastern Virginia discursively constructs the "illegal immigrant" as a metonym for Latino immigrants. This mixed methods study traces the development of this newspaper discourse about illegal immigrants from1994 to 2006 using quantitative lexical analysis. It then shows how two local news events further instantiate an illegal immigrant metonymy influencing perceptions of Latinos, subsequent media discourse about immigration, and local immigration policies using critical discourse analysis. The quantitative findings suggest that news discourse focusing on (illegal) immigration tended to use lexical items low in optimism and commonality, consistent with out-group negativity. The qualitative findings show how two incidents involving "illegal immigrants" attached negative stereotypes to this category, which then potentially influenced perceptions of Latinos more broadly. This analysis shows some of the ways that media discourse influences perceived intergroup threats at the local and national levels.

T1  - New Online Ethnicities and the Politics of Representation
AN  - 1081863743; 201235298
AB  - The paper interrogates the literature on online cultural and religious identities through a critical engagement of Stuart Hall's work on new ethnicity and regimes of representation. It suggests that this literature conflates Hall's notion of 'new ethnicity' with one that argues that online cultural and religious identities are 'new' because of transnational and global processes, the pervasiveness of computer-mediated communication and the global mobility of immigrants. Thus, current research on online ethnic and religious identities underestimates the complexity of Hall's concept and to highlight this complexity we ponder the extent to which new online ethnicities -- as expressed in the current literature -- reflect, construct or renegotiate so-called offline ethnicities. The paper concludes that online ethnic subjectivities, while providing alternative representations to counteract the dominant racist discourse within host societies, still reflect mimic essentialist voices.

T1  - Ethnic identity 'under review': The issue of the anthropologic survey on the Indigenous Lands of Brazil
AN  - 1030866161; 201227790
AB  - This article analyses anthropological surveys in Brazil that are conducted by consultant researchers (specialists in ethno-anthropological disciplines) for the national institutions responsible for officially recognising which lands are to become indigenous reserves. The complexities of the Brazilian situation and the theoretical, methodological and ethnic (identity) issues faced by the anthropologists are examined. This article attempts to answer the question: can anthropology, which since the 1960s has developed a specific analysis of the concepts of ethnicity and ethnic identity, provide specific answers to such institutions concerning the ethnic identity of these groups and their territorial borders? This article attempts to answer this question by drawing on field research that turned anthropologists into informers, just as Indians seeking to claim their territorial rights were turned into informers by these anthropologists. The article analyses the strategies adopted by these Brazilian researchers while performing their consultancies, concluding that the anthropologists who have decided to embark on this challenge assume a role as mediator between indigenous community and state rather than that of a classifier by and for the state.

T1  - Intergroup Contact and Ingroup Reappraisal: Examining the Deprovincialization Thesis
AN  - 856403162; 201106822
AB  - According to the deprovincialization thesis, interethnic contact involves a reappraisal and distancing from the ingroup. Contact can broaden one's horizon by acknowledging and recognizing the value of other cultures and thereby putting the taken-for-granted own cultural standards into perspective. The current research uses data from three surveys to examine the relationship between quantity of outgroup contact and ingroup distance (ingroup identification and ingroup feelings) among native Dutch participants. More positive contact with ethnic outgroups was expected to lead to a higher endorsement of multiculturalism, that, in turn, is related to a stronger distancing from the ingroup. Findings in all three studies support the deprovincialization thesis. In addition, in Study 3, mediation is found independently of outgroup threat. Findings across the three studies confirm the stability of the results and cross-validate the deprovincialization thesis. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Gender as catalyst for violence against Roma in contemporary Italy
AN  - 835111663; 201100576
AB  - Silvio Berlusconi's use of ethnicity and immigration as national security issues in his successful campaign for election to the Italian presidency in 2008 was by no means unique in contemporary Europe. What was surprising was the speed of his right-wing government's legislative restriction of migrants in the form of the so-called 'security package', first introduced just five weeks after the election. Woodcock explores the striking fact that this 'security package', and the intense wave of racist violence by Italians against Roma that it legitimized and encouraged, was proposed and justified in response to media reports of Italian babies being stolen by 'Zingari' from the 'nomad camps' and of Italian women being raped and beaten by Romanian men of 'Zingari' ethnicity. Gender and ethnicity are the twin constitutive discourses of modern European society, and racialized subjects are necessarily gendered. The stereotype of 'dangerous black men sexually threatening white women' has been mobilized in a vast range of European and colonial nationalist projects in order to justify the policing of both racialized masculine subjects and women as objects of the patriarchy. Similarly, the depiction of women as hysterical, sexually vulnerable objects in need of (white) masculine protection is an old story that the Italian media recognize as a fairy tale even as they reproduce the discourse. Woodcock explores what has not been mentioned thus far, namely, that gender stereotypes are vital to the mobilization of violent racism against the Roma in contemporary Italy, and how conservative gender binaries are strengthened and policed in a time of social crisis through the stereotyping of Roma as racial threat.

T1  - Understanding Global Migration: A Social Transformation Perspective
AN  - 835111607; 201100463
AB  - This article aims to examine some of the difficulties of theory formation in international migration studies, and to suggest a response. The starting point is an examination of the dominant perception of 'migration as a problem'. This is followed by a discussion of some key obstacles to theoretical advancement in migration studies. I argue that a general theory of migration is neither possible nor desirable, but that we can make significant progress by re-embedding migration research in a more general understanding of contemporary society, and linking it to broader theories of social change across a range of social scientific disciplines. A conceptual framework for migration studies should take social transformation as its central category, in order to facilitate understanding of the complexity, interconnectedness, variability, contexuality and multi-level mediations of migratory processes in the context of rapid global change. This would mean examining the links between social transformation and human mobility across a range of socio-spatial levels, while always seeking to understand how human agency can condition responses to structural factors. The argument is illustrated through the example of the changing dynamics of labour forces in highly developed countries. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Taste of Louisiana: Mainstreaming Blackness Through Food in The Princess and the Frog
AN  - 758122224; 201057040
AB  - Food-related practices, behaviors, and values cannot be ignored as relevant markers of power, cultural capital, class status, ethnicity, race, and gender. In the Disney Pictures' film The Princess and the Frog, food is used to negotiate the on-screen presence of Princess Tiana, the first African-American female protagonist in a Disney movie. While Tiana is depicted as a strong and motivated character in her determination to achieve her professional goals, her dreams of success as a restaurateur are constantly framed in terms of actual cooking, an occupation that has been historically connected with black women. Furthermore, she is a practitioner of Louisiana cuisine, heavily influenced by black and Creole traditions but represented as vaguely exotic, non-intimidating, and less racially recognizable than soul food because shared by many non-Black characters. These gastronomical negotiations render her more acceptable and less threatening to mainstream audiences. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social value orientation moderates ingroup love but not outgroup hate in competitive intergroup conflict
AN  - 818797448; 201068349
AB  - In intergroup conflict, individual cooperation may be directed at strengthening the ingroup, thus undermining the effectiveness and sustainability of the competing outgroup. Reversely, cooperation directed towards the competing outgroup indirectly undermines the viability of the ingroup and is often seen by ingroup members as disloyal, non-cooperative behavior. Using the Intergroup Prisoner's Dilemma-Maximizing Differences Game to model intergroup conflict, the experiment reported here shows that compared to individuals with a chronic pro-self orientation, those with a chronic prosocial orientation display stronger ingroup trust and ingroup love-they self-sacrifice to benefit their ingroup-but not more or less outgroup distrust and outgroup hate. Furthermore, in this situation pro-social individuals were driven more by ingroup fairness considerations when contributing to their ingroup. Path analyses suggest that effects of social value orientation on ingroup love are mediated by ingroup trust and not by fairness considerations. Implications for research on social value orientations, and intergroup conflict and competition are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - 'What did You Say, and Who do You Think You Are?' How Power Differences Affect Emotional Reactions to Prejudice
AN  - 758124347; 201056866
AB  - Three studies examine how power differences between targets and sources of prejudice affect targets' emotional reactions to prejudice. Study 1 first demonstrates that people do not expect powerful others to be prejudiced. Studies 2 and 3 then examine what happens when targets encounter prejudice, as a function of the source's power. Targets notice and recall prejudiced statements from powerful sources, irrespective of whether they are personally dependent on the source. However, results also demonstrate that personal dependency on the source determines how much targets attend to and are emotionally affected by prejudice. Emotional reactions to prejudice as a function of source power were mediated by negative expectations about future interactions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Visibility That Demystifies: Gays, Gender, and Sex on Television
AN  - 758122489; 201057029
AB  - A content analysis of 98 episodes of primetime entertainment programs on commercial broadcast and cable television stations from the 2005-2006 season showed that gay characters on television were more likely to be shown in sexual situations than straight characters, and women were more likely to be shown in same-sex sexual situations than men. In addition, gay characters were more likely to be depicted as sexually active on cable television than they were on commercial broadcast television, and they were more likely to be relegated to guest star status on commercial broadcast television than on cable television. The study also showed that gay characters made up 7.5% of all the characters studied. This study discusses the implications of these findings for gay and straight audiences.

T1  - Immigrants from the Pacific: "Drain on the Economy" or Active Participation in the Labor Force?
AN  - 1907225720
AB  - In May 2008, a major controversy about the participation of Pacific Islanders and their descendants in the New Zealand economy was initiated by the release of a report claiming they were "a drain on the economy," were becoming an "underclass" and displayed "significant and enduring underachievement." This report received considerable media attention at the same time that the first results of New Zealand's Longitudinal Immigration Survey (LisNZ) were released. The results of the LisNZ received much less attention in the media, even though they contained considerable information about the participation of Pacific migrants in the labor force. This paper reviews some of the findings contained in the May 2008 release of LisNZ data as well as some additional information relating to the larger group of Pacific migrants who entered under all categories of approval spanning skilled migration, business migration, family sponsorship, humanitarian provisions, as well as the special Pacific categories. Three simple indices of labor market participation are used to compare migrants entering under the special Pacific categories with Pacific migrants who gained approval for residence under the other categories. Greater attention is then focussed on the labor market participation of three groups of Pacific migrants - Fiji Indians, Samoans and Tongans. Fiji Indians are included because they are the largest single group of immigrants from a Pacific country in the LisNZ survey database. The evidence generated by the first wave interviews of the LisNZ does not support an argument that Pacific migrants are failing to gain employment in New Zealand and thus becoming a "drain on the economy" or that "Polynesian immigration fuels an underclass." On the three measures of labor force participation there were generally small differences between the Pacific migrant groups, however these were defined, and the rest of the migrants interviewed in the LisNZ. There were some expected differences in occupation distributions, education levels, and ways of obtaining work in New Zealand. But these differences are not indications of "underachievement" or any systemic failure of policies regulating immigration from the Pacific.

T1  - Danny Almonte: Discursive Construction(s) of (Im)migrant Citizenship in Neoliberal America
AN  - 754039527; 201049736
AB  - In this project I will trace former Little League Baseball star, Danny Almonte's, celebrity identity and flexible citizenship with particular regard to the way that he has been used as both an exemplary Dominican immigrant and later a cautionary tale. As such this critical biography of Almonte's rise and fall in American popular culture-informed by Henry Giroux's extensive theorizing on youth culture, Ong's concept of flexible citizenship, and Steven Jackson's understanding of "twisting"-will critically interrogate the mediated discourses used to describe, define, and make Almonte into a symbol of a (stereo)typical Dominican male. In accordance with contemporaneous hyper-conservative and neoliberal rhetoric pervasive throughout the United States, I posit the notion that Almonte's contested celebrity was formulated within the popular media as the embodiment of the minority "assault" on white privilege.

T1  - The Impact of Exposure to Mass Media Campaigns and Social Support on Levels and Trends of Hiv-Related Stigma and Discrimination in Nigeria: Tools for Enhancing Effective HIV Prevention Programmes
AN  - 743066596; 201043244
AB  - People living with HIV & AIDS (PLWHAs) often face stigma & discrimination, especially in developing countries. HIV-related stigma is expressed through social ostracism, personal rejection, direct & indirect discrimination, & denial from families & friends. Consequently, it is associated with reduced adoption of preventive & care behaviours, including condom use, seeking for HIV test & care-seeking behaviour subsequent to diagnosis. Ignorance about the epidemiology of the disease on modes of transmission & prevention aggravates HIV-related stigma in Nigeria. Behaviour change communication activities through mass media have been shown to be an effective approach in improving people's knowledge about the disease. This paper monitors trends in the level of accepting attitudes towards PLWHAs in Nigeria between 2003 & 2007. It also evaluates the impact of exposure to mass media & social support on the levels of accepting attitudes towards PLWHAs. A significant & positive trend was evident between 2003 & 2007 (p<0.0001). Furthermore, exposure to mass media communications on HIV & AIDS issues & social support were significantly related to the reduced stigma & discrimination against PLWHAs (p<0.0001).

T1  - Breaking the Silence: The Emergence of a Black Collective Voice in France
AN  - 758121872; 201056957
AB  - Since the turn of the millennium, French society has become the theatre of a noticeable Black agency. Few previous events have ignited the media's interest in a Black French agenda more than the Collectif Egalite-led "March for the dignity of Black peoples" and the formation of the Conseil Representatif des Associations Noires (CRAN). Through these newly-founded organizations, French activists of African descent have been challenging the hegemonic ideology of color-blindness, and heralding the claims, problems, and expectations of postcolonial African-descended people. Informed by this ideology of so-called color-blindness, the academic literature in France has been slow to account for this new form of political expression. Moreover, as this article will argue, postcolonial African-descended people have not been recognized as political agents in the French literature. Few studies have attempted to correct this myopic view by analyzing the current political dynamic of postcolonial African-descended people. Due to the state-centered or institutionalist approach, these studies are more concerned with highlighting external and structural factors, such as racial discrimination, at the expense of endogenous determinants. They focus on what postcolonial African-descended people are denied in the French society instead of investigating the qualities these citizens actually possess that enable them to organize collectively. This article is intended to contribute to this new literature. It will pinpoint the different transformations that postcolonial African-descended people have undergone from the 1960s through the 1990s, examine the resources and skills under these actors' control, and gauge the contribution of these resources and skills to the emergence of a Black collective voice.

T1  - Caregiving and Female Embodiment: Scrutinizing (Professional) Female Bodies in Media, Academe, and the Neighborhood Bar
AN  - 754044448; 201053298
AB  - Our essay analyzes contemporary discourses of gender, mothering, and caregiving as they intersect with embodiment. We combine an interview featuring the life of one employed mother with academic research, popular media commentary, and our journaling and everyday conversations to develop three "writing-stories" (Richardson, 2000). Our "writing-stories" explore the commodification of the baby "bump," the facades of embodied caregiving, and embodied caregiving processes in professional contexts. We problematize discourses of caregiving, surface underlying assumptions, and advance alternative conceptualizations that (re)value embodied caregiving. We encourage others to expand and continue our writing-stories. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Moral identity and psychological distance: The case of adolescent parental socialization
AN  - 60355577; 201017489
AB  - A mediation model using a sample of 1059 adolescents (56% girls; M age = 16.02, SD = 1.37) tested relations between parenting, adolescent moral identity, and the formation of psychological distance towards others. In short, adolescent moral identity mediated relations between parenting and the ways in which adolescents oriented others in their psychological space. Specifically, adolescent-report parenting style dimensions (responsiveness, autonomy-granting, and demandingness) were positively related to the formation of both private and public moral identity dimensions (internalization and symbolization), which were in turn associated with a tendency to construct psychological distance towards others (negatively with social dominance orientation and positively with the circle of moral regard). Therefore, one way parents may be able to influence how adolescents relate to their peers is by fostering a sense of moral identity in their children through authoritative parenting.

T1  - Political groups in contact: The role of attributions for outgroup attitudes in reducing antipathy
AN  - 60355474; 201017261
AB  - In two cross-sectional surveys and one experiment, we tested the hypothesis that attributions for outgroup ideologies would mediate the relationship between quality of contact and reduced prejudice. In Study 1, a British sample (N = 85) rated their perceptions of, and attributions for, their political outgroup's (i.e., conservative or liberal) belief system. Supporting our hypothesis, the relationship between contact and outgroup attitudes was mediated by rationality attributions - attributions that outgroup members obtained their views via rational thought processes. Study 2 was a replication of Study 1 with an American sample (N = 229) and expanded construct measurement. The results of Study 2 replicated those of Study 1, showing support for rationality attributions as a mediator of the contact-prejudice link. In Study 3 (N = 132), we experimentally manipulated the priming of past positive or negative outgroup contact with individual outgroup members and measured the proposed mediational constructs with respect to that outgroup encounter. Results further supported the role of rationality attributions as mediators of the contact-prejudice link. The implications of these findings for perceptions and relations between antagonistic ideological groups are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Rural-urban migration and health: Evidence from longitudinal data in Indonesia
AN  - 60351976; 201017564
AB  - Previous studies on the impact of migration on health often face the difficulties of choosing the proper comparison group and addressing potential selection of migration. Using longitudinal data for 1997 and 2000 from Indonesia, this paper examines the effect of rural-urban migration on physical and psychological health, by (1) comparing the health of migrants with that of the appropriate group of comparison, people who remained in rural origins, and (2) studying health both prior to and after migration to adjust for possible selection bias. The research further explores various socioeconomic, psychosocial, and behavioral pathways mediating the migration effect. Results show that rural-urban labor migration increased the risk of psychological disorder as measured by depressive symptoms. This was largely a result of reduced social support due to family disruption, because the deleterious effect was particularly strong for migrants who moved alone and was negligible for migrants moving with family members. In contrast, migration had little impact on physical health in the medium term. This was largely attributed to the multiple offsetting influences of migration: migration improved economic status and living standards but led to increased work-related stressors and barriers to health utilization. In addition, despite earning higher income, migrants tend to underconsume and remit a large amount of earnings to original families, which hindered potential health gains from improved economic well-being.
