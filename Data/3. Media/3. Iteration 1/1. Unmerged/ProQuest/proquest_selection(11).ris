T1  - Do moms demand action on guns? Parenthood and gun policy attitudes
AN  - 2691117194
AB  - The idea that motherhood primes women to support stronger gun control policy permeates our contemporary politics. Motherhood shapes views on a variety of issues, but the question remains whether mothers hold distinctive views on gun control policies relative to their non-parent peers. We draw on 2017 Pew Research Center data to explore the ways gender, parenthood, and race intersect to shape attitudes on gun policy in the post-Sandy Hook era when gun violence has become prominently linked with schools and children, and during a time when the Black Lives Matter movement has drawn national attention to the relationship of gun violence and racial inequality. Most notably, we find that contemporary depictions of mothers as a distinctively pro-gun control constituency are largely inaccurate. The very real gender gap in gun policy attitudes appears to be falsely attributed to motherhood, rather than gender. We also find very little impact of parenthood for men. Finally, we generally fail to see much relationship between race, parenthood, and gun attitudes. Overall, despite common belief and media reporting to the contrary, the story is very much one where parenthood seems to play little role in gun policy attitudes.

T1  - The Effect of Pronatalist Rhetoric on Women's Fertility Preferences in Turkey
AN  - 2682274261
AB  - This paper analyzes the impact of pronatalist rhetoric on women's fertility preferences in Turkey using a mixed‐methods approach. Since 2008, Prime Minister (and since 2014 President) Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has given speeches about the necessity of increasing fertility and has demanded at least three children from families. This call was supported by monetary incentives in 2015. I analyze the impact of the rhetoric on women's fertility preferences between 2008 and 2013. In the first part of the paper, I use qualitative data I collected through in‐depth interviews in 2013 to show a relationship between women's political orientation and their acceptance of the rhetoric. Then, using quantitative data from the 2008 and 2013 rounds of the Turkey Demographic and Health Surveys, I analyze whether the pronatalist rhetoric had an independent effect on increasing fertility preferences. An individual‐level religiosity variable is used as a proxy to account for women's responsiveness to the rhetoric. I find that religiosity was positively related to women's desire to have a third child in both 2008 and 2013, but it was statistically significant only in 2013 after the rhetoric had been widely circulated in the media.

T1  - The American racial divide in fear of the police
AN  - 2652811428
AB  - The mission of policing is “to protect and serve,” but recent events suggest that many Americans, and especially Black Americans, do not feel protected from the police. Understanding police‐related fear is important because it may impact civilians’ health, daily lives, and policy attitudes. To examine the prevalence, sources, and consequences of both personal and altruistic fear of the police, we surveyed a nationwide sample (N = 1,150), which included comparable numbers of Black (N = 517) and White (N = 492) respondents. Most White respondents felt safe, but most Black respondents lived in fear of the police killing them and hurting their family members. Approximately half of Black respondents preferred to be robbed or burglarized than to have unprovoked contact with officers. The racial divide in fear was mediated by past experiences with police mistreatment. In turn, fear mediated the effects of race and past mistreatment on support for defunding the police and intentions to have “the talk” with family youths about the need to distrust and avoid officers. The deep American racial divide in police‐related fear represents a racially disparate health crisis and a primary obstacle to law enforcement's capacity to serve all communities equitably.

T1  - The politics of mask-wearing: Political preferences, reactance, and conflict aversion during COVID
AN  - 2695518674
AB  - The current project examines how psychological reactance and conflict orientation relate to the highly politicized debate over mask-wearing in the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. We explore how psychological reactance and conflict orientation are related to self-reported mask-wearing, and how these same predispositions are correlated with political beliefs. We then assess how favorability towards President Trump in the context of the 2020 Election was uniquely correlated with these traits and how Trump favorability both mediated and moderated the effects of conflict orientation and psychological reactance on individuals' likelihood of wearing masks. Results from a national survey of U.S. adults from Nov–Dec 2020 suggest that Trump favorability was positively associated with trait reactance, negatively associated with conflict aversion, and negatively associated with self-reported mask-wearing. The opposite was true of favorability towards Joe Biden. Moderation analyses indicate that conflict-approaching Biden detractors were especially unlikely to report wearing masks, while mediation analyses show that political preferences significantly mediated the relationships between both psychological traits and self-reported mask-wearing. Implications for the politicization of health messaging and health behavior are discussed.

T1  - Frequency of exposure to the media is associated with levels of HIV-related knowledge and stigmatising attitudes among adults in Ghana
AN  - 2646092136
AB  - Studies show that increased knowledge of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is achieved through exposure to mass media, which then contributes to positive attitudes and behaviours towards people living with HIV and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This study examined the relationship between the frequency of exposure to the media and the level of HIV-related knowledge and stigmatising attitudes towards HIV and AIDS among adults in Ghana. A weighted sample of 13 484 men and women 15 to 59 years old took part in the study. The main outcome variable was the HIV-related knowledge score, calculated based on responses to eight questions about general HIV concepts and HIV transmission modes. The frequency of exposure to the media was the primary explanatory variable. The relationship between the frequency of media exposure and the level of HIV-related knowledge was investigated using Poisson regression methods in Stata 13.0. Of the 13 484 respondents analysed, 25%, 88.2% and 79.7% reported reading print media, listening to the radio and watching TV at least once a week respectively. The average HIV-related knowledge score was 4.9 (SD 1.6), with 22.9% of respondents correctly answering five questions and about 2.0% correctly answering all eight questions. The frequency of exposure to the media, particularly print media and television, was associated with an increase in the level of HIV-related knowledge. When compared to having a low level of HIV-related knowledge, having a moderate and high level of HIV-related knowledge reduced the score of stigmatising attitude by 0.065 and 0.277 points, respectively. The adult population in Ghana has a very low level of HIV or AIDS knowledge, as well as a significant level of stigma associated with HIV or AIDS, which could stymie HIV prevention efforts. The media, on the other hand, provide a platform for these issues to be addressed.

T1  - Religion, Politics, and Public Funding for Abortion
AN  - 2637652276
AB  - An abundance of research examines Americans’ attitudes toward abortion legality and morality with particular attention to polarization around this issue and the influence of social movements, religious organizations, the media, and political leaders. There is a relative dearth, however, of research focusing on attitudes toward the public funding of abortion services. Using three national, random samples of American adults, we address this gap in the literature. We find that the oft‐cited “bipartisan consensus” around opposition to public funding of abortion is a myth. In fact, there is more bipartisan consensus around abortion legality than abortion funding, across religious traditions. As national debates about abortion funding intensify, these findings underscore the importance of future surveys consistently measuring Americans’ attitudes toward public funding of abortion, above and beyond abortion legality or morality.

T1  - COVID-19 in a collectivist culture: social isolation and maintenance of social relations
AN  - 2646104566
AB  - Purpose>The purpose of this paper is to investigate the way people in a collectivist culture, particularly Egyptians, define social isolation and to understand the effect of social isolation on maintaining traditional networks of social relations.Design/methodology/approach>To do this, online ethnographic semi-structured interviews were carried out with a purposeful sample of non-infected Egyptians who have access to social media networks.Findings>Although collectivism may be perceived as a risk factor in developing countries, it has positive effects on reducing the spread of COVID-19 among Egyptians through the preventive measures it entails. Increased fear, worries and anxiety about the family and in-group members is a limiting factor against the prevalence of the disease, despite the emotional hardships experienced by individuals.Research limitations/implications>The sample interviewed does not refer to the entire Egyptian population, since the number of social media users represents 43.5% of Egyptians. Therefore, generalization of research data may be problematic.Practical implications>The paper aims to raise awareness of the important of stressing collectivist character traits since they can help develop more preventive measures against the spread of the disease. Research findings also indicate that there is a need to coexist with the disease under controlled conditions to lessen the psychological risks of social isolation.Originality/value>In light of the paucity of research carried out on COVID-19, the present research provides a pioneering insight into the meaning of social isolation in a collectivist culture and the distinctive local methods adopted by people to maintain their networks of social relations.

T1  - Visual Portrayals of People in Need: The Impact of Refugee Depictions, Compassion, and Support for Humanitarian Aid
AN  - 2617957676
AB  - As conflicts flare around the world, images of refugees have become a familiar presence in Western media. Drawing on existing accounts of visual influence, this analysis explores how (un)sympathetic refugee portrayals in news accounts affect distant viewers’ compassion responses and refugee policy attitudes. The study reports the results of three survey experiments, in Sweden, the United States, and the UK, involving 25 unique images and over 4,500 combined respondents. Building on previous work on Moral Foundations Theory, we find the manifest vulnerability of depicted refugees to be an important influence on how visual portrayals evoke sympathy and impact conservatives’ (but not liberals’) compassion responses. Once activated, compassion is found to mediate the effect of refugee portrayals on right-wing support for refugee aid.

T1  - Mind The Gap! The Role of Political Identity and Attitudes in the Emergence of Belief Gaps
AN  - 2631532080
AB  - To more fully understand the belief gap hypothesis, this study examines the effect of political identity, education, and partisan media consumption on the formation of attitudes and false beliefs. Using a two-wave, nationally representative online survey of the U.S., we assess people’s attitudes and beliefs toward climate change, on the one hand, and Syrian refugees, on the other. Building on previous studies, we demonstrate that the effect of one’s political identity on attitudes and false beliefs is contingent upon education, which appears to widen the belief gap in consort with political identity.

T1  - Living as immigrant in Germany: an analysis of civil society organizations leaders’ perspectives
AN  - 2600768877
AB  - PurposeImmigration is considered a stressful process that causes many problems such as social isolation, prejudice, unemployment, minority status and intergenerational tensions. This study aims to determine the opinions of the leaders of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) in Germany about the experiences of individuals who immigrated from Turkey to Germany.Design/methodology/approachIn this study, a qualitative method was used. This study was conducted between April and May 2014 with leaders of CSOs who were living in Germany. Informed consent forms were signed by all the participants. Purposeful sampling was used to select the leaders of CSOs to be included in the sample. In-depth interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview format. The data reached saturation for the 30 leaders of CSOs. The data were collected through in-depth interviews and evaluated through thematic analysis.FindingsFour main themes were identified: “Difficulties experienced”, “Recommendations to cope with/solve the difficulties experienced,” “Medical tourism” and “Use of health services.”Research limitations/implicationsThis study has some limitations that should be taken into consideration during the interpretation of the results. A majority of the leaders of CSOs had bachelor’s degrees, and were middle-aged and older, which might affect the variety required in qualitative studies. Thus, it remains unclear whether the results could be generalized to all Turkish immigrants in Germany.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first qualitative study conducted with different Turkish CSO leaders living in Germany. This study outlines perspectives of CSO leaders’ migration-related challenges that Turkish immigrants struggle with to integrate into German societies. As a consequence, Turkish immigrants’ socio-cultural values, beliefs, difficulties they experienced, and legal rights should be taken into consideration in health care and tourism interactions. Possible found experiences could help to provide evidence on how to improve migrants’ situations.

T1  - The Affective Foundation of Political Opinion Expression on Social Media: A Panel Analysis
AN  - 2518670685
AB  - Social media (SM) allow citizens to not only read news but also express their political opinions. Drawing from cognitive appraisal and affective intelligence theory, this study investigated the affective foundation of political opinion expression on social media (POESM) using two-wave panel data. The results indicate that enthusiasm and anger stimulated POESM but only for individuals with a minimum threshold motivation to use SM for political purposes. Among the politically motivated, anxiety increased POESM for individuals with low political knowledge but lessened POESM for ones with high political knowledge. Thus, emotional states can be powerful drivers of POESM. In contexts with low levels of POESM, emotions may stimulate online discussion as well as contribute to the further emotionalization of political debates.

T1  - From diagnosis to action: Understanding youth strengths and hurdles and using decision-making tools to foster youth-inclusive sustainable agriculture intensification
AN  - 2543839848
AB  - By 2050, the youth population in Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) is expected to exceed 60%. To contain the ensuing youth bulge, reduce unemployment and 'flight' from rural areas, and increase agricultural productivity, countries seek policies to enhance youth engagement in agriculture. However, orthodox assumptions and locally-inappropriate policies keep youth engagement low. We use qualitative enquiry with focus group discussions and key informant interviews in Ghana and Malawi to examine youth strengths, aspirations, barriers to sustainable agriculture intensification (SAI), and implications for enhancing their inclusion. We further examine the potential of three equity-analysis tools to guide decision making on youth-inclusive SAI. Findings show that youth face limited access to land and capital, limited involvement in decision making and in farmer/development groups, and negative attitudes from community members and officials. Land access was complex, mediated by land-inheritance system, land type, population pressures, culture, and land markets. Land-access problems were acute in matrilineal Malawi, particularly for young men. Decision makers attested to the relevance and usefulness of selected youth-equity analysis tools, and to positive training outcomes on awareness, knowledge, and skills in using them. We contribute context-specific evidence on youth's positive contributions in SAI and the need to recognize them with more targeted and location-differentiated interventions on resources access, including land. Findings also inform the quest for pathways to move the youth-agriculture/SAI debate into tangible actions from below, equipped with youth-analysis tools for decision makers to foster youth-inclusive SAI in Ghana, Malawi, and other countries with similar contexts.

T1  - Snowballing or wilting? What affects public support for varying models of basic income?
AN  - 2592964484
AB  - Recently, the idea of a universal basic income has received unprecedented attention from policymakers, the media and the wider public. This has inspired a plethora of surveys that seek to measure the extent of public support for the policy, many of which suggest basic income is surprisingly popular. However, in a review of past surveys, with a focus on the UK and Finland, we find that overall levels of support for basic income can vary considerably. We highlight the importance of survey design and, by employing new survey data in each country, compare the levels and determinants of support for varied models of basic income. Our results point to the importance of the multi-dimensionality of basic income and the fragility of public support for the idea. The findings suggest that the ability of political actors to mobilise the public in favour of basic income will eventually depend on the precise model they wish to implement.

T1  - Confidence in political leaders can slant risk perceptions of COVID–19 in a highly polarized environment
AN  - 2476854782
AB  - The COVID-19 virus poses an unprecedented level of risk to the health and well-being of the entire global population. As of the writing of this article (June 2020), the United States has the largest number of confirmed cases with more than 2 million and there are over 120,000 deaths (Johns Hopkins University). This public health crisis has since led to cascading effects such as a rapidly rising unemployment rate, deteriorating mental health (Ammerman et al., 2020), and disturbed stock market (Baker et al., 2020) among others. By several accounts, the U.S. government's response to this pandemic is judged to be inadequate (Science, 2020). Because this coronavirus is novel, its full impact on the human population remains unknown. It represents a classic case of an unknown and dreadful risk that can generate heightened societal risk perceptions (Slovic, 1987). Under a great number of uncertainties surrounding this novel coronavirus, the American public has to rely on various authorities such as political leaders, governments, the media, and scientists for information about this disease. President Trump, to his credit, frequently communicates with the public about the evolving situation through the White House daily briefings. Key members of the coronavirus task force including its chair Vice President Mike Pence often appear on the side of the President. The public indeed shows a substantial level of confidence in officials at the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), and state and local elected officials (Pew Research Center, 2020 a). The public evaluations for President Trump and the news media handling the coronavirus outbreak tend to be divided along a party-line (Pew Research Center, 2020 a). The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have become a politicized issue in this highly polarized political environment, along with a long list of issues such as immigration, abortions, and climate change. Confronted with the historical challenges posed by COVID-19, how the American public perceives such risks warrants close investigation. Our overarching question is how does confidence in political leaders shape American public risk perceptions of COVID-19? Numerous studies have shown the link between risk perception and risk mitigation behaviors (Huang et al., 2012; Shao et al., 2017a, 2017b). Heightened risk perceptions are conducive to the adoption of risk mitigation behaviors. In this study, we aim to examine how confidence in national political leaders, attitudes towards the media, along with socio-demographic characteristics and political predisposition influence American public risk perceptions of COVID-19. Further, we attempt to examine how confidence in national political leaders can slant risk perceptions of COVID-19 among different segments of the population, especially people with different political ideologies. We analyze a national sample of respondents to a survey conducted in early March, approximately two months after the first reported COVID-19 case in the U.S. on January 21. Results of this study can shed light on the formation of risk perceptions of this ongoing public health crisis. Furthermore, the results are believed to provide useful insights to policymakers.

T1  - Intention to be screened for Alzheimer’s disease in nondemented older adults: Integrated behavioral model and self-efficacy as mediation effect
AN  - 2434474748
AB  - The study explored factors associated with intention to be screened for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The study also examined whether self-efficacy mediates the relationship between knowledge about screening and the intention to be screened for AD. A population-based, random-digit dialing survey was performed and 1,043 responses were collected from a sample of nondemented persons (50 years or older) living in urban, suburban and rural areas in a Midwestern state. The findings showed that participants who were younger and who had higher levels of (a) perceived benefits and barriers, (b) social support and (c) self-efficacy reported higher levels of intention to be screened for AD. Older adults with positive life orientation reported greater intention to be screened for AD, whereas depressed participants were more likely to report a plan to be screened for AD. Self-efficacy mediated the relationship between knowledge about screening and intention to be screened. Older adults were more likely to report intention to be screened when they had positive attitudes about the screen and believed that they could receive the screen. The intention to be screened for AD could serve public awareness by defining effective ways to assist older adults to seek a cognitive screen.

T1  - The segregated gun as an indicator of racism and representations in film
AN  - 2489910508
AB  - Film emphasizes an ironic history of racism in gun control and ownership and a justification for seeking justice among the Black community, but film also perpetuates structural racism and bias, segregating Black from White, and failing to promote equality, solidarity, and progress. The gun is both a symbol of structural racism, and an expression through which critical attitudes and political statements can carry greater meaning and lead to positive action, empowerment, and desegregation. The symbolic meaning of guns in the hands of Blacks as violent, exceptional or some other stereotypical character trope is illustrated using three selected films including: Django Unchained, John Q., and Proud Mary. This paper is divided into three acts: Act I: The gun as symbol of structural racism in film; Act II: Stereotypical characters and their guns; Act III: Desegregation of the gun in film. These sections illustrate the meaning and representation of the gun as a theatrical object in film, and when in the hands of stereotypical character tropes, has perpetuated racist beliefs and attitudes that have not been adequately addressed in the film industry. To desegregate the gun in film, filmmakers need to critically examine the overt and hidden film texts and how the gun, and the characters wielding it, are perceived among audiences.

T1  - Redistribution and recognition: An analysis of gender in/equality discourse on Nigerian female blogs
AN  - 2415221046
AB  - This article examines the dynamics of representation between cultural and economic forms of gender inequality on Nigerian female blogs. Through a thematic analysis of 253 comments retrieved from five female-authored blogs, I draw on prominent cases of gender inequality in Nigeria, such as ‘President Muhammadu Buhari’s position on his wife’ and the ‘rejection of the Gender and Equal Opportunities Bill’. The analysis showed that blog discussions among females in Nigeria suggest extensive intolerance to cultural change, especially in comparison to the more positive attitude towards redistribution. To tackle this complexity, I argue that gender equality advocacy in Nigeria should commence mainly from a redistributive standpoint. This needs to be accompanied by the ulterior aim of achieving recognition. Overall, the study contests the idea that identity politics is threatening to replace the issue of redistribution on the global political agenda by highlighting the primacy of redistributive politics in blog discourse. It enriches media studies and gender research by providing rare insight into the practical connections between cultural and economic politics of gender inequality in an online discursive context.

T1  - Preventing Child Sexual Abuse Using Picture Books: The Effect of Book Character and Message Framing
AN  - 2405024879
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate whether and how a picture book preventing child sexual abuse can improve children’s self-protection skills. The study was conducted in China with Chinese children. In a 2 × 2 between-subjects design, character in the book (human versus animal) and message framing (gain versus loss) were manipulated. Compared to a baseline group who were not exposed to the prevention book, children in the experimental groups significantly enhanced their ability to recognize a potential abuse situation and refuse an inappropriate touch request. Results suggest that the prevention picture books are more effective when using a human character and a gain-framed message. The explanation for this was that human characters simulated children’s perceived norm and gain-framed messages increased children’s message recall, perceived self-efficacy and positive attitude toward the message, all of which in turn positively affected children’s self-protection skills.

T1  - Attitude toward rehabilitation as a key predictor for adopting alternative identities in deradicalization programs: An investigation of terrorist detainees’ profiles
AN  - 2350160977
AB  - Several studies have shed light on factors that contribute to radicalization. However, fewer studies have addressed the factors that contribute to deradicalization, especially with terrorist detainees as participants. The present study investigates the role of attitudes toward rehabilitation in deradicalization programs, and its role in predicting the outcome for these programs. We hypothesized that when terrorist detainees adopt alternative identities (identities alternative to their jihadist identity), their support for jihad as war will be lessened, even when they still hold jihadist ideology as their source of significance. To test this hypothesis, we obtained 89 interview profiles of actual terrorist detainees across 35 Indonesian prisons. We found that lesser support for jihad as war was predicted by a more positive attitude toward the deradicalization program, and this was mediated by the adoption of alternative identities. Further, the effect of the mediator on support for jihad as war was neither weakened nor strengthened by perceived significance of jihadist ideology. These findings suggest that even when a person possesses a strong ideological commitment to jihad, this may not manifest into violence when they adopt alternative identities and goals. These results were interpreted and discussed through goal systems theory and the multifinality account of radical behavior.

T1  - In pursuit of happiness: Life satisfaction drives political support
AN  - 2341350389
AB  - It is argued in this article that citizens in democracies use their subjective well‐being (SWB) as an evaluative criterion when deciding how willing they are to support and comply with government dictates (political system support). When life is satisfactory, government authorities are rewarded with support, when it is not, citizens punish authorities by withholding their support. To make sense of the relationship, it is suggested that citizens act as if they have signed a happiness contract with ‘those in power’. In support of this argument, comparative survey data shows that SWB predicts attitudes on political system support across country contexts and under strong control conditions. Establishing that the relationship is causal, panel data documents that attitudes on political system support can be undermined following the termination of a close personal relationship, and that the causal effect is mediated via changes in SWB. Finally, as predicted, the happiness‐support relationship is weaker among individuals who are high on spirituality/religiousness and attribute blame for external events to both worldly and non‐worldly powers.

T1  - #(Me)too much? The role of sexualizing online media in adolescents' resistance towards the metoo-movement and acceptance of rape myths
AN  - 2358484178
AB  - Introduction The current study addresses how sexualizing online media practices, i.e., exposure to sexually explicit internet material and receiving negative appearance feedback on social media, relate to the acceptance of sexist attitudes among adolescents. Specifically, it extends previous research on the acceptance of rape myths by exploring a construct related to these beliefs, i.e., resistance towards the metoo-movement. Methods The study is based on a cross-sectional paper-and-pencil survey among 568 Flemish adolescents (15–18 years old, Mage = 16.4, SD = .98, 58.3% girls) that measured adolescents' sexualizing online media use, sexist attitudes and objectification processes. Results The results showed that exposure to sexually explicit internet material, but not receiving negative appearance feedback on social media, was related to more resistance towards the metoo-movement and the acceptance of rape myths through notions of women as sex objects. Self-objectification did not function as a valid mediator in the examined relations. Gender and self-esteem did not moderate the proposed relations. Conclusions The findings underline the role of media use in how adolescents develop sexist beliefs and, more precisely, beliefs about contemporary actions to combat sexism, i.e., the metoo-movement. The present study showed that sexual objectification fueled by sexually explicit internet material may result in less positive attitudes and, thus, more resistance towards this movement.

T1  - Dissolving into the sea: cinematic migrants and the problem of agency
AN  - 2336171133
AB  - Films about irregular migration to Europe that centre on the Mediterranean sea crossing often unwittingly strengthen the regime of migrant (in)visibility furthered by sensationalist media, which include topoi of shipwrecks, dramatic rescues, and body bags. Such films’ imagery of the Mediterranean as a metaphorical space of transformation into living death, actual death, or paradisiacal life also suggests that the identity of the migrant is indeterminable, zombie-like, even monstrous. Finally, focusing on the sea as central to the migrant journey makes invisible the broader geopolitical context, especially the continuing neocolonial relationship between the global North and the global South. My essay examines the political implications of focusing on migrant bodies in the middle of the sea, especially in sympathetic accounts which portray the Mediterranean as a gothic space where the perished yet ghostly migrants haunt Europe like revenants of its colonial past. Gianfranco Rosi’s acclaimed docudrama Fire at Sea (2016) exemplifies this approach. I analyse it in the context of similar visual representations before briefly contrasting it with Želimir Žilnik’s Logbook Serbistan (2015), which situates migrants in a broader geopolitical context and portrays them as non-idealised people with complex backgrounds, political opinions, and agency.

T1  - Dehumanization of dirty workers and attitudes toward social support
AN  - 2319730213
AB  - In lay perception, dirty work is a type of labor that degrades human dignity. Work can be perceived as dirty on three bases: social (related to the subordinate position or associated with contact with stigmatized people), physical (related to direct contact with garbage and waste), and moral (related to jobs considered sinful, dubious, or defying social norms). “Dirty” stigma makes workers objects of dehumanization and discrimination, in particular, people distance themselves from dirty workers and are not ready to help and support them. In the experimental study (N = 340), we investigated how certain types of dirty workers are dehumanized compared to nondirty workers and the indirect effect of the type of dirty work on attitudes toward the social support of dirty workers via animalistic (attribution of uniquely human traits) and the mechanistic (attribution of human nature traits) dehumanization. The results show that individuals are willing to offer more social support to a low status but not dirty worker rather than to social or moral dirty workers. At the same time, less social support is provided to nondirty than to physical dirty worker. Animalistic and mechanistic dehumanization mediates the relationship between the types of dirty work and the attitudes toward social support. In particular, less dehumanization leads to more positive attitudes toward social support. The limitations and future directions of the obtained results are discussed.

T1  - Politics, concern for future generations, and the environment: Generativity mediates political conservatism and environmental attitudes
AN  - 2303012466
AB  - Climate change and pollution impact those alive today as well as future generations, suggesting that attitudes toward future generations may be linked with environmental attitudes. Despite the widespread impact of the environmental on human lives, there is considerable partisan divide in the United States with regards to environmental issues. We investigated relationships between political conservatism, generativity, and environmental attitudes in two studies (N = 429 and N = 618). Political conservatism was associated with lower pro‐environmental attitudes; however, political conservatism was also associated with higher generativity and had a positive indirect effect on pro‐environmental attitudes through higher generativity. More politically conservative individuals may have greater concern for future life and thereby have more pro‐environmental attitudes even while having lower pro‐environmental attitudes overall. These results likely reflect partisan polarization with regard to environmental issues. Pro‐environmental messages may be more persuasive for conservatives if they are linked to concerns about future generations.

T1  - A Crisis of Competence: Benevolent Sexism Affects Evaluations of Women’s Competence
AN  - 2174080475
AB  - People higher in benevolent sexism often outwardly endorse gender equality, but support men over women for challenging positions and experiences. Reflecting shifting standards (a tendency to evaluate stereotyped group members against within-category judgment standards), people higher in sexism may evaluate prominent women’s competence against a lower competency standard for women (who are stereotyped as less competent than men are), and not against a standard for men. Thus prominent women could be perceived as especially competent (versus other women), yet men might still garner ultimate support. Study 1 tested for this possibility using an ecologically valid example: the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Study 1 showed that benevolent (and not hostile) sexism predicted less opposition to Donald Trump’s candidacy and more positive attitudes toward the election outcome among 57 mostly female U.S. college students. Study 1 also showed that benevolent sexism positively predicted competence perceived in Hillary Clinton. To determine if this positive relationship reflected shifting standards, we manipulated the gender to which a prominent woman would be compared in Study 2 with 189 U.S. adults. Reflecting shifting standards, benevolent sexism related to evaluating women as more competent when they were evaluated against other women versus other men. Shifting standards also mediated a relationship between benevolent sexism and expecting lower female success. Using shifting standards may be one way that people higher in benevolent sexism might evaluate prominent women as especially competent, yet ultimately support men.

T1  - Extremists on the Left and Right Use Angry, Negative Language
AN  - 2249480460
AB  - We propose that political extremists use more negative language than moderates. Previous research found that conservatives report feeling happier than liberals and yet liberals “display greater happiness” in their language than do conservatives. However, some of the previous studies relied on questionable measures of political orientation and affective language, and no studies have examined whether political orientation and affective language are nonlinearly related. Revisiting the same contexts (Twitter, U.S. Congress), and adding three new ones (political organizations, news media, crowdsourced Americans), we found that the language of liberal and conservative extremists was more negative and angry in its emotional tone than that of moderates. Contrary to previous research, we found that liberal extremists’ language was more negative than that of conservative extremists. Additional analyses supported the explanation that extremists feel threatened by the activities of political rivals, and their angry, negative language represents efforts to communicate as much to others.

T1  - Echoslamming: how incivility interacts with cyberbalkanization on the social media in Hong Kong
AN  - 2239603329
AB  - Cyberbalkanization has growingly become common on the Internet and can lead to public's opinion polarization. This study investigates a specific process of cyberbalkanization through which incivility is circulated within online communities. From a dataset of Hong Kong-based Facebook Pages collected during a social movement, a set of politically-organized communities was identified and their connectivity generated a post-sharing network. A random sample of contents shared between and within these communities was then manually classified based on the level of incivility. The targets of offence through the use of uncivil language were also coded. Contents shared within ideologically compatible communities were found to be more likely to be uncivil. The association was significantly more positive in a populistic community, of which members had unique political nature and cultural norms. The targets were usually political opponents and incivility was adopted to petition detractors from within-community discussions. We therefore suggest 'echoslamming' is an online phenomenon through which uncivil contents catalyse anger toward political opponents among ideologically congruent information sources and consequently reinforce the audience's predilection. Such a mechanism can be one underlying explanation for a vicious circle of cyberbalkanization-induced polarization on political opinions.

T1  - Politics, power, and performativity in the newsroom: an ethnography of television journalism in Turkey
AN  - 2250554161
AB  - How do political divisions within the newsroom shape negotiations around news production? This article addresses this question by examining how Turkish journalists, in their discourse and practices, represent Kurds and Arabs when interpreting and discussing current events related to the Kurdish question and the Arab Spring. The study draws upon a year of ethnographic fieldwork, and interviews conducted in 2011 and 2012, in the newsrooms of two mainstream national television channels in Turkey. It reveals how journalists with opposing political beliefs perform their representational practices by continuously modifying them according to the opinions of managerial boards. In negotiations on the portrayal of Kurds and Arabs in news reports, journalists mask or modify ‘undesired’ aspects of their individual interpretations to fit them into a dominant news frame. However, they can also challenge that frame. Based upon the observation of such negotiations, this article advances a novel definition of journalistic performance as a purposeful, strategic, and staged form of symbolic communication: an essential tool for navigating ideological conflicts in the power structure of the newsroom.

T1  - Who Doesn’t Want Democracy? A Multilevel Analysis of Elite and Mass Attitudes
AN  - 2221125799
AB  - Despite its global rise in popularity, a significant number of people still oppose democracy. The current study evaluates three competing theories of opposition to democracy–developmentalist, culturalist, and elitist – using a series of multi-level regression models that combine individualand country-level variables. Results of our statistical analyses suggest that: 1) country-level indicators of social, political, and economic development are not consistently related to individual support for democracy; 2) macro-cultural factors have mixed effects on individual support for democracy; and 3) individual income and education have strong effects on individual support for democracy, but this relationship is mediated by country-level economic development. Specifically, we find that high-income individuals in relatively underdeveloped countries are more likely to oppose democracy than high-income individuals in wealthier countries. These results suggest that economic, social, and political development do not necessarily go together.

T1  - Post-trauma: healthcare practitioners use social media during times of political tension
AN  - 2213063644
AB  - The approach of context collapse and the notion of unintentional context collisions are of importance to scholars of social media. Israeli public hospitals are a particularly suitable venue for studying these topics, as they employ both Jewish and Arab practitioners, who care for both Jewish and Arab patients amid an ongoing violent conflict. In-depth interviews were conducted with 50 managers and healthcare practitioners (physicians and nurses), both Jewish and Arab, employed at 11 public hospitals in Israel. We found that despite hospitals managements' instructions to avoid political discourse, it erupts nonetheless whenever the conflict escalates. Fearing damage to professional relations and care of patients, political discourse spills over into social media, where political opinions are expressed mostly by Arab practitioners and stereotypical attitudes against Arabs are expressed mostly by Jewish ones. Our study exemplifies the usefulness of the context collapse approach-and specifically unintentional context collisions-to work organizations and all the more so to healthcare organizations.

T1  - Screened Anxieties: Affect and Temporality in <i>The Birth of a Nation</i>
AN  - 2577067988
AB  - This essay examines attitudes toward the future in D. W. Griffith's film  The Birth of a Nation , focusing in particular on the opposed emotions hope and fear. In doing so, it establishes critical connections between the film's aesthetic philosophy – which is marked by an attempt to control its characters, its audience, and even history itself – and the film's troubling and much-discussed racial politics. Griffith's stated beliefs in the ability of cinema to fully capture the past and in turn to dictate to its audience the terms of the future, manifest themselves everywhere in  The Birth of a Nation not only thematically but formally. However, the film sets an impossible task for itself, and where it falls short, its own hopes and fears become dramatically visible. This failure indicates that  The Birth of a Nation is ultimately imbricated in the modernist episteme of uncertainty it works to deny and disavow.

T1  - Satirical Narrative Processing: Examining the Roles of Character Liking and Media Enjoyment on Narrative-Consistent Attitudes
AN  - 2430088232
AB  - This study uses online survey data (n = 127) with an embedded media manipulation to examine relationships between character liking, media enjoyment, and narrative consistent attitudes with late-night political comedian, Stephen Colbert’s satirical campaign finance narrative. The data offer empirical support for the notion that narratively structured political satire processing models should consider relevant entertainment psychology and narrative persuasion concepts such as how audiences respond to the main characters and the role enjoyment plays in the process. Using structural equation modeling, media enjoyment significantly mediated the relationship between character liking and narrative consistent attitude formation (about the antagonist), but appears to have functioned as a suppressor variable. Competing models are offered in an Online Appendix.

T1  - Was There a “Simple Soviet” Person? Debating the Politics and Sociology of “Homo Sovieticus”
AN  - 2297900617
AB  - Intellectual efforts to understand post-Crimean Russian society have brought to prominence explanations that emphasize psychological and attitudinal legacies of Soviet society. The recent revival of the term homo sovieticus (or Soviet man) in the media and intellectual discourse is a good illustration of this trend. Yurii Levada's late-Soviet sociological research project on the “simple Soviet man” serves as a frequent reference point in these discussions. In this article, I explore the ideological and analytical foundations of the Levada project and juxtapose the sociological construct developed by Levada and his team with the interpretative approach developed by Natalya Kozlova, another Soviet scholar who dedicated her life to studying Soviet society. I argue that essentialist and deterministic views of individual personality underpinning the Levada project that guide the current use of the Soviet man category are more politically and ideologically driven rather than being based on the state of the art in social psychology.

T1  - Exposure to Neoliberalism Increases Resentment of the Elite via Feelings of Anomie and Negative Psychological Reactions
AN  - 2190816412
AB  - For several decades now, neoliberalism has been the dominant economic and political ideology throughout large parts of the world. In many places, its rise has gone hand in hand with growing social inequality and a cultural emphasis on individualism and competition. Lately, concerns are being raised about the effects of these developments on politics and societies. The renewed rise of populism in Europe, the United States, and other countries has been attributed to economic insecurity among the working and middle classes by politicians, journalists, and academics alike. Similarly, the spread of nationalist and anti‐immigration sentiments is frequently interpreted as a result of fears over job security and perceived competition in a hostile economic climate. We examined the effect of neoliberalism on two types of prejudice (anti‐elitism and anti‐immigrant prejudice) across two studies in Germany (N = 198) and the UK (N = 173). Results show that priming neoliberalism leads to higher levels of anti‐elitism but not anti‐immigrant prejudice and that this effect is mediated by anomie and negative psychological reactions (feelings of threat, unfairness, and hopelessness). Thus, our research suggests that while neoliberalism is linked to lower social cohesion and increased outgroup derogation, this is not primarily directed against disadvantaged social groups but against those at the top.

T1  - Attitudes toward Same-Sex Marriage and Parenting, Ideologies, and Social Contacts: the Mediation Role of Sexual Prejudice Moderated by Gender
AN  - 2033531692
AB  - Recognition of same-sex marriage and parenting has increased in the last two decades but remains a controversial issue in which public opinion plays a role, as it can influence political leaders but also determine the immediate environment of same-sex families. The literature highlights the effect of religiosity, political orientation, beliefs about etiology of homosexuality, and social contacts with gay men and lesbians on attitudes toward same-sex marriage and parenting (ASSMP). The aim of this study was to explore the under-studied mediation role of sexual prejudice in this process and how participants’ gender moderated the mediation effects. Data were collected from 1416 heterosexual French students and analyzed with moderated mediation models in accordance with recent recommendations from Hayes (2013). Sexual prejudice mediated the effects of religiosity, political orientation, and etiological beliefs on ASSMP more strongly in men than in women. It also mediated the effect of contact with gay and lesbian persons and same-sex couples on ASSMP in men but not in women. The results highlight the need to explicitly deconstruct negative beliefs about homosexuality during debates about same-sex marriage and same-sex parenting, even when prejudice against homosexuality itself is not explicit in opponents’ discourse.

T1  - National identity and distrust in the police: The case of North West Wales
AN  - 2165984454
AB  - Trust in the police, as defined by perceived procedural fairness, just decisions and effectivity, may be impacted by deep political divisions among the population, especially where citizens adopt opposing national identities. In Europe, North West Wales is one such area. Nationalism is intensified by language issues (Welsh vs. English) and historical experiences of UK institutions. A sample of 207 residents living within the local authority of Gwynedd were asked to take part in the study. A questionnaire survey addressed how much trust in the police ultimately depends upon national identity as expressed by preference for the Welsh language, trust in UK institutions and attitudes towards political symbols. Other factors tested included personal experience of the police, the influence of news reports and police TV series, as well as the perceived effectiveness of the police in addressing crime. Trust in UK institutions, preference for the Welsh language and news reporting were found to have most influence on trust in the police.

T1  - Brief Textual Indicators of Political Orientation
AN  - 2154457092
AB  - Language reflects one’s thoughts, feelings, and worldview. Technology has led to a proliferation of brief communications. Is this brief text meaningful? We examine whether text from brief political and nonpolitical communications reflect political ideology. Student responses to their ideological foundations (Study 1), brief snippets of unanimous Supreme Court verdicts (Study 2), and celebrity tweets (Study 3) were textually analyzed to examine whether they contained perceived threat and resistance to change content and whether this predicted the authors’ political affiliation. Across three studies, words related to resistance to change, but not perceived threat, were related to political ideology such that conservatives were more likely to include resistance-to-change-related words in their responses compared with liberals. These results suggest that brief text, even when not overtly political, reflects one’s political ideology. The increase in brief text production via new technology and its ability to predict political ideology make these findings particularly meaningful.

T1  - Silver screen sorting: Social identity and selective exposure in popular film viewing
AN  - 2178951653
AB  - While research in media and politics has long stressed the importance of television, the political impact of movies has largely been ignored. However, a small body of literature suggests that both political docudramas and popular films may have the capacity to change the issue attitudes of viewers. Building on that work, this paper examines the potential for selective exposure in movie viewership. We develop a theory that there is large-scale sorting into popular movies rooted in social identity theory. We argue that sorting is a result of two processes: film studios marketing films towards particular social groups and individuals sorting into films based on social group characteristics. We test this theory using a unique dataset in which undergraduate students were asked to rate trailers for a variety of political docudramas and popular films. Our results indicate that there is indeed widespread sorting into popular films on the basis of social identities rooted in socio-demographic traits.

T1  - The Reception of Immigrants and Refugees in Western Countries: The Challenges of Our Time
AN  - 2151163790
AB  - In a rapidly changing world, the challenges of migration, as well as its potential benefits, are hotly debated. Recent years have seen new challenges as a result of unprecedented levels of migration, instability following the Global Financial Crisis, economic and security concerns surrounding immigration, and negative portrayals of immigrants by some Western leaders. These developments make it all the more important to understand the psychological processes underpinning attitudes toward immigrants and refugees, support for particular immigration policies and responses to changing policies, the role of portrayals of immigrants in the media, and the consequences of immigration attitudes and policies. This special issue brings together researchers interested in the topic of immigration from a psychological perspective, with a focus on understanding the reception of immigrants and refugees in Western countries. In this introductory article, we outline the background to this special issue and briefly describe each article included.

T1  - It Runs in the Family
AN  - 2129849685
AB  - What motivates citizens to run for office? Recent work has shown that early life parental socialization is strongly associated with a desire to run for office. However, parents not only shape their children’s political environment, they also pass along their genes to those same children. A growing area of research has shown that individual differences in a wide range of political behaviors and attitudes are linked to genetic differences. As a result, genetic factors may confound the observed political similarities among parents and their children. This study analyzes Swedish register data containing information on all nominated and elected candidates in the ten parliamentary, county council, and municipal elections from 1982 to 2014 for a large sample of adoptees and their adoptive and biological parents. By studying the similarity in political ambition within both adoptive and biological families, our research design allows us to disentangle so-called “pre-birth” factors, such as genes and pre-natal environment, and “post-birth” factors like parental socialization. We find that the likelihood of standing as a political candidate is twice as high if one’s parent has been a candidate. We also find that the effects of pre-birth and post-birth factors are approximately equal in size. In addition, we test a number of potential pre- and post-birth transmission mechanisms. First, disconfirming our expectations, the pre-birth effects do not seem to be mediated by cognitive ability or leadership skills. Second, consistent with a role modeling mechanism, we find evidence of a strong transmission in candidacy status between rearing mothers and their daughters.

T1  - Resisting dehumanization: citizen voices and acts of solidarity
AN  - 2099586905
AB  - Recent years have seen an increase in the influx of asylum-seekers in Scandinavia, and in Denmark this has led to ever-tighter immigration control. This article discusses emerging practices of refugee solidarity and resistance to migration policy in Danish civil society in the wake of what has been referred to as the European refugee crisis. To accomplish this purpose, I analyse how participants in Facebook discussions construe topoi and attitudes when facing the ethical dilemma of respecting the law versus showing concern for humans in need, in line with what Foucault (1983. The subject and Power. In H. Dreyfus & P. Rabinow (Eds.), Michel Foucault: Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics (pp. 208-226). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press) has referred to as 'ethical self-formation'. This is illustrated through a case study of an incident from September 2015, when a member of a Danish City Council offered private shelter to immigrants on their way to Norway. The incident led to legal proceedings in August 2016 for what the defendant referred to as 'the offense of helping fellow human beings in need'. The study is informed by Critical Discourse Analysis (Fairclough, N. (2003). Analysing Discourse. Textual analysis for social research. London and New York: Routledge; Wodak, R. (2015). The politics of fear. London and New York: Sage) and governmentality theory (Foucault, M. (1983). The subject and Power. In H. Dreyfus & P. Rabinow (Eds.), Michel Foucault: Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics (pp. 208-226). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press; Foucault, M. (2007). Security, Territory, Population: Lectures at the Collège de France 1977-78. (G. Burchell, Trans.). New York: Palgrave Macmillan; McIlvenny, P., Klausen, J. Z., & Lindegaard, L. B. (2016). Studies of Discourse and Governmentality. Amsterdam and Philadelphia: Benjamins). Data include media representations and facebook comments published during 2016. The analytical approach combines topos analysis (Wodak, R., & Meyer, M. (Eds.). (2010). Methods of Critical Discourse Analysis. London: Sage; Wodak, R. (2015). The politics of fear. London and New York: Sage) and appraisal analysis to tease out evaluative meaning.

T1  - Brainwashing paranoia and lay media theories in China: the phenomenological dimension of media use (and the self) in digital environments
AN  - 2082932799
AB  - Drawing on the phenomenological tradition, this article focuses on the ‘lay media theories’ that ordinary people rely on to orient their media use. Existing scholarship on certain perceptions users hold about media and their behavioral consequences tends to assume that these perceptions by default rest on a sense of self that is pre-existing and immune to media. My empirical research troubles this theoretical assumption. Analyzing interviews and ethnography in China, I investigate the media practices of certain individuals under the influence of ‘brainwashing paranoia’. Through their engagements with the information abundance on the Chinese Internet, these individuals had, over time, revamped rather than enhanced their established political beliefs. I argue that in today’s high-choice environments, users’ lay media theories, especially their conceptions about media in relation to the self, should be taken into account as one major sociocultural factor that moderates or mediates the age-old tendency for selective exposure.

T1  - Implications of Sex Guilt: A Meta-Analysis
AN  - 2019389382
AB  - A meta-analysis of the literature examining the outcomes related to feelings of sex guilt was conducted. The analysis demonstrates gendered differences in the experience of sex guilt and myriad attitudinal and behavioral impacts. Specifically, men report lower levels of sex guilt, r = -.227 than do women and implications of sex guilt experience are vast, including its association with engagement in less sexual activity, r = -.337, less favorable attitudes toward sex and lessened use of contraceptives, r = -.276, reduced reports of sexual arousal in response to an explicitly sexual media content, r = -.308, less positive emotional response to sexually explicit media content, r = -.367, reduced level of sexual information accuracy, r = -.324, and less positive attitudes toward sexual behavior, r = -404. Sex guilt is positively related to level of religiosity/religious behavior, r = .439. The findings suggest that sex guilt provides a consistent set of responses to sexual information and media content as well as a motivational basis for behavior. These outcomes are further explicated and discussed.

T1  - Film literacy in secondary schools across Europe: A comparison of five countries’ responses to an educational project on cinema
AN  - 2087922686
AB  - We present the results of an exploratory study framed within a large film literacy project carried out simultaneously in five European Union countries (Croatia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom). The study looks at students’ responses to an educational project on cinema designed to be implemented regionally for five months in high schools to increase film literacy and to favour more positive attitudes towards European cinema. The results show that students’ film preferences remain stable after the programme and vary only slightly. Major changes occur in their knowledge about film production and expression. The aspects that change the least are their conceptions about cinema and their preferences. Moreover, the student attitudes towards national and European cinema are more positive. However, the results also show that the implementation of a film literacy programme at a cross-cultural level can affect different aspects depending on the cultural context (country) in which it occurs. Indeed, they provide data about the specific impact of the programme in each country. The information offered by this study could enhance film literacy programmes, inform theory, and nurture the debates about the common European identity and the particular traits of the diverse cultures of the European Union.

T1  - Toxic Talk: How Online Incivility Can Undermine Perceptions of Media
AN  - 2430088579
AB  - Scholars are increasingly concerned with the potential for uncivil discourse to enhance political polarization in society (Mutz, 2006; Stryker, 2011). Political elites and partisans boost levels of incivility in news media (Muddiman, 2013), and people perceive higher levels of incivility in politics when individuals rather than issues are attacked (Stryker, Conway, & Danielson, 2014). The concerns over incivility extend to the online information environment, where nasty comments can harm healthy back-and-forth dialogue central to democracy that often happens in spaces such as newspapers (Coe, Kenski, & Rains, 2014; Meltzer, 2015). Early research shows that incivility in online comments can be a polarizing factor in how people perceive issues in media, particularly for individuals who hold stronger opinions before seeing the comments (Anderson, Brossard, Scheufele, Xenos, & Ladwig, 2014). In particular, incivility has been found to affect people’s perceptions of the content covered in news articles, a phenomenon dubbed the “nasty effect” (Anderson et al., 2014). It can also increase the perception that individuals in society hold polarized attitudes (Hwang, Kim, & Huh, 2014). Yet, we still do not fully understand how incivility in comments affects perceptions of the news stories themselves or the effect it can have on lines of political polarity in society. Here, we explore the effects of uncivil comments proximate to a blog post containing hard news content on individuals’ perceptions of media. We examine these effects across two controversial scientific issues—nuclear energy and nanotechnology—on perceptions of bias of the news blog post. We also examine how political ideologies are related to how people interpret incivility in online comments as it relates to perceptions of bias. In doing so, this study contributes to understanding of the polarizing nature of incivility. While this is a common concern in the literature, few have empirically tested whether online incivility heightens existing divisions in society. We find that perceptions of bias are greatest after seeing online incivility among politically conservative ideologues, providing evidence for the polarity of incivility in online comments.

T1  - “Life Isn't Some Cartoon Musical”: Neoliberal Identity Politics in <i>Zootopia</i> and <i>Orange Is the New Black</i>
AN  - 2023533129
AB  - Neoliberal identity politics in "Zootopia" and "Orange Is the New Black" are discussed. Two popular texts exemplify the contradictory logic of neoliberal popular media and the coexisting types of media‐industrial production: Disney's Zootopia (2016) and Netflix's Orange Is the New Black (2013–). Both strongly foreground “progressive” attitudes toward identity politics in their representational strategies of race and gender. On one hand, the reception of Zootopia (2016), a traditionally “mainstream” media text, has clearly been shaped by gestures of progressive representational politics which clearly added to their status among the most desirable audience groups. Orange Is the New Black, on the other hand, provides a striking example of popular “niche” media, which circulates as a cultural text within a much more limited audience, and which also appears to embrace a more radical politics.

T1  - More than a Media Moment: The Influence of Televised Storylines on Viewers’ Attitudes toward Transgender People and Policies
AN  - 2015610332
AB  - Numerous studies have demonstrated the power of entertainment narratives to influence attitudes and behaviors; fewer have examined the effects of TV portrayals on attitudes toward marginalized groups. The present study is among the first to explore how entertainment narratives depicting transgender individuals influence viewers’ attitudes toward transgender people and related policies. The study examines the impact of exposure to a TV storyline on Royal Pains (USA Network) and cumulative effects of viewing other TV series featuring transgender individuals. An online survey of 488 U.S. viewers of Royal Pains was conducted (391 had seen the relevant episode). ANCOVAs revealed exposure to both the Royal Pains’ storyline and other storylines portraying transgender individuals were associated with more supportive attitudes toward transgender people and policies. Mediation models revealed that for viewers of the Royal Pains’ storyline, the relationships between political ideology and attitudes toward transgender people and policies were mediated by identification with the main characters and the emotion of hope. Disgust mediated viewers’ attitudes toward transgender people, but not policies. Post hoc analyses revealed that exposure to transgender narratives reduced the influence of viewers’ political ideology on their attitudes. The attitudes of more conservative viewers became increasingly positive as they saw more media portrayals of transgender individuals. These findings highlight the potential for entertainment narratives to influence attitudes toward marginalized groups, and they demonstrate the importance of emotion in the context of divisive topics. Social, political, and public health implications are discussed.

T1  - Fighting ageism through nostalgia
AN  - 2011520343
AB  - Two experiments tested whether nostalgia is a resource for fighting ageism. In Experiment 1, younger adults who recalled a nostalgic (vs. ordinary) encounter with an older adult showed a more positive attitude towards older adults, mediated by greater inclusion of older adults in the self (IOGS). In Experiment 2, these findings were replicated and extended with a subtle nostalgia manipulation. Younger adults identified an older, familiar adult, before writing about an encounter with this person that was characterized by either central (e.g., keepsakes and childhood) or peripheral (e.g., wishing and daydreaming) features of the construct of nostalgia (i.e., prototype). Participants who recalled a central (vs. peripheral) nostalgic encounter reported greater social connectedness, which predicted increased IOGS. In turn, increased IOGS was associated with a lower desire to avoid older adults. Several alternative explanations for the intergroup benefits of nostalgia were ruled out. The research established that nostalgia qualifies as a resource for combatting ageism.

T1  - Self-interest and public opinion in health policy: smoking behavior and support for tobacco control
AN  - 1992156664
AB  - This study examines the influence of self-interest on attitudes about public health policy, specifically the influence of smoking on opposition to tobacco control measures. We analyze the relationships between being a current smoker, former smoker, or nonsmoker and support for cigarette taxes and anti-tobacco health education campaigns in order to reveal the extent to which the direct “pocketbook” self-interest of health-related behaviors, versus general sociotropic values, influence public health policy opinions. Using a sample of 442 adult participants in a statewide survey, binary logistic regression and proportional odds models compare respondents’ support for varying amounts and allocation levels of cigarette taxes, as well as anti-tobacco health education campaigns, controlling for smoking status and demographic variables. Results indicate that the connection between being a current smoker and being less supportive of cigarette taxes (a policy that directly affects self-interest) is not mediated when controlling for attitudes about anti-tobacco education campaigns (a policy that does not as directly affect self-interest). However, while former smokers do not support cigarette taxes as much as do nonsmokers, their support for taxes becomes indistinguishable from that of nonsmokers when their attitudes about anti-tobacco education campaigns are considered. We conclude that both direct self-interest and broader social values influence tobacco control policy attitudes. Smokers appear to consider their pocketbooks, but simultaneously both current and former smokers are ideologically motivated to oppose health initiatives. Thus, public health policymakers should highlight the importance of public education and social norms in garnering support for tobacco control policies.

T1  - OFF THE HOOK: EXPLORING REASONS FOR QUITTING PLAYING ONLINE GAMES IN CHINA
AN  - 2153630989
AB  - China is now one of the biggest online game markets, and the games are seen as both an economic opportunity and a social threat, especially to the young. I investigated the nature of, reasons for, and influences of online game quitting in China with 176 participants selected using deviant case sampling. I examined the relationships between the attitudes of those who were quitting playing toward online games, their perception of media portrayal of online games, family pressure, peer influence, functional alternatives, self-esteem, loneliness, online game quitting, and satisfaction with life after quitting. Results showed that the more negatively the participants felt about online games, the more likely they were to quit, and perception of peers' negative attitude toward online gaming, perception of alternatives, and lower income were significant predictors of online game quitting. These findings could help policy makers rethink healthy gaming and antiaddiction strategies.

T1  - In-Group and Out-Group in Russian Political Cartoons: Research of the Latent Meanings of Narrative Conflict between Russia and the West: Politicheskie Issledovanii︠a︡
AN  - 2099450135
AB  - The article examines the invariant contents of Russian political cartoons, the representation of actual political processes in it and, most significantly, the implicit or masked aspects of sociopolitical life identified via content analysis of the caricature image. The author claims that the virtualization of politics has given humor an additional significance for contemporary political discourse. Despite the emergence of new genres, professional cartoons in the media are still the static-visual humor direction most in demand. Plots of political cartoons as well as of political humor in general often reflect conflict episodes of the relationship between in-group (for the artist and audience) and out-group. This is also true for the Russian cartoons, given the relatively high importance of state, cultural and national identity for Russian collective identity. As shown by the comparative-historical analysis, the representation of conflicts between Russians as in-group and the West / representatives of Western societies as out-group is typical for Russian cartoons. The profound meanings of the reflection of Russian cartoonists over this antagonism and the dynamics of the concentration on it are studied by the method of content analysis. This study revealed that since the “perestroika” time the interest to represent Western political actors in cartoons has decreased – the domestic events and processes became a priority. The attractiveness of the in-group representation declines over time, which indicates a more critical attitude to the Russian internal problems. With a greater overall attractiveness of Russian in-group, it is important to note that, as a result of content analysis, out-group representatives are shown as more impressive and presentable. The transfer of the in-group and the out-group antagonism from the foreign policy field to the internal policy field which is characteristic of the last decades, coupled with the polar ideological orientation of contemporary Russian cartoonists (including the attitude toward the West), indicates a low consolidation of Russian society.

T1  - Evaluations of Antigay Hate Crimes and Hate Crime Legislation: Independent and Differentially Predicted
AN  - 2002462527
AB  - Minimal studies have investigated individuals' evaluations of antigay hate crimes and hate crime legislation simultaneously, with most research focusing on one or the other. In a sample of 246 heterosexual undergraduates, the present study found that evaluations of antigay hate crimes and hate crime legislation were unrelated. Higher social dominance orientation (SDO) and crime control orientation scores were associated with more positive evaluations of antigay hate crimes. Positive evaluations of hate crime legislation were associated with more positive attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. We also found that the relationship between SDO and evaluations were mediated by crime control beliefs (for hate crimes evaluations) and antigay attitudes (for hate crime legislation evaluations). The present findings have possible implications for the manner in which organizations advocate for the extension of hate crime legislation to include sexual orientation.

T1  - Cultural stressors, identity development, and substance use attitudes among Hispanic immigrant adolescents
AN  - 1977210060
AB  - The goal of this investigation was to determine whether various cultural stressors (bicultural stress, perceived discrimination, and perceived negative context of reception [PNCR]) predict positive and negative substance use attitudes, directly and indirectly through personal identity, in a sample of immigrant Hispanic adolescents. Data on cultural stressors, substance use attitudes, and covariates were collected from 302 Hispanic immigrant adolescents (152 from Miami [61% Cuban] and 150 from Los Angeles [70% Mexican]) at 3 time points. PNCR was associated with identity confusion ([beta] = .175, p = .033). Identity confusion significantly predicted higher positive attitudes toward alcohol and other drug (AOD; [beta] = .216, p < .001) and cigarette use ([beta] = .191, p = .015) and mediated the relationship between PNCR with unfavorable AOD attitudes ([beta] = -.019, 95% confidence interval [CI] [- 0.052, - 0.001]) and favorable AOD attitudes ([beta] = 0.038, 95% CI [0.003, 0.086]). Perceptions of a negative context of reception may hinder successful personal identity formation and impact health outcomes for immigrant youth.

AB  - The mass arrivals of political and economic migrants in Slovenia started when Hungary closed its border with Croatia. In this article, we analyze the reactions of parliamentary parties in Slovenia, focusing on the media statements of their leaders and members on the significant events since the beginning of mass arrivals of migrants to date: first arrivals of migrants to Slovenia, erection of fences on Slovenian-Croatian border, November 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, protests against accommodation of minor migrants unaccompanied by adults in Student dorm in Kranj, proposal for consultative referendum on the acceptance of migrants in Slovenia and Act on amendments to the Aliens Act. We point out some of the most defining statements to show the political opinions of individual parties and compare the responses of these parties in the light of the political division between left-wing and right-wing politics as well as political division based on the urban-rural cleavage.Alternate abstract:Masovni prihodi političnih in ekonomskih migrantov v Slovenijo so se začeli, ko je Madžarska zaprla svojo mejo s Hrvaško. V tem članku avtorja analizirava reakcije parlamentarnih strank v Republiki Sloveniji s poudarkom na medijskih izjavah njihovih voditeljev in članov o pomembnih dogodkih od začetka množičnih prihodov migrantov do danes: prvi prihodi migrantov v Slovenijo, postavitev ograj na slovensko-hrvaški meji, pariški teroristični napadi novembra 2015, protesti proti nastanitvi mladoletnih migrantov brez spremstva odraslih v dijaškem domu v Kranju, predlog posvetovalnega referenduma o nastanitvi migrantov v Republiki Sloveniji in Zakon o spremembah in dopolnitvah Zakona o tujcih. Izpostavljava nekatere najbolj odmevne izjave, ki odražajo politična stališča posameznih strank, in primerjava odzive teh strank glede na levo in desno politično usmeritev ter tudi glede na politično delitev, osnovano na razlikah med urbanim in ruralnim.

T1  - WHEN OLD MEETS NEW: AN ANALYSIS OF KOREAN TRADITIONAL NARRATIVE IN THE CONTEMPORARY REALITY TV SHOW INFINITE CHALLENGE
AN  - 1986318863
AB  - In an attempt to explore how local traditional narrative manifests in a globalized media format, we analyzed five aesthetic elements of Korean traditional performances in Infinite Challenge (Muhan tojon) in terms of the sinmyong narrative. In the Infinite Challenge show, the personae release pent-up energy through endless challenges, sustain positive attitudes towards life by wiping away tears through laughter, have fun with playful deception games or word play, act like childish fools (pabo) and pranksters (kondal) who indulge their unbound desires, and interact with participatory audiences in an open structure. Coupled with previous research confirming that traditional communication styles shape modes of expression in contemporary media content, we believe this study can provide empirical evidence to substantiate the creative potential of local traditional narrative in indigenizing global media programs.

T1  - Links among Familial Gender Ideology, Media Portrayal of Women, Dating, and Sexual Behaviors in African American, and Mexican American Adolescent Young Women: A Qualitative Study
AN  - 1938050077
AB  - Utilizing grounded theory methodology and drawing from sexual script theory as a research lens, we examined familial gender ideologies, media portrayals of Black and Latina women, dating attitudes, and sexual behaviors among 33 low-income early adolescent (aged 11–14) African American and Mexican American young women. Themes revealed divergent experiences for African American and Mexican American young women. In particular, African American participants reported egalitarian familial gender ideologies and sexual objectification of Black women, as well as more open and positive attitudes toward dating and sexuality. In contrast, Mexican American participants reported patriarchal familial gender ideologies and the portrayed mistreatment of Latinas in telenovelas and Spanish language songs, along with cautious attitudes towards dating and sexuality. Additionally, Mexican American participants reported that they censored their communication about sexual matters with their family. Overall, findings suggest that interventions should be tailored accordingly for African American and Mexican American youth. Interventions with African American young women should focus on providing accurate information on safer sexual practices, whereas interventions with Mexican American young women should focus on promoting constructive conceptualizations of gender roles, which could help foster self-efficacy around sexual communication with parents and potential partners.

T1  - Kalashnikov and Cooking-spoon: Neo-Nazism, Veganism and a Lifestyle Cooking Show on YouTube
AN  - 2562814953
AB  - Food consumption has always been a deeply symbolic, identity-related issue. But contrary to the intuitive assumption that links meat-free diets to peace-loving, left-leaning actors and ideologies, this article illustrates how a group of (German) neo-Nazis, Balaclava Küche (Balaclava Kitchen), appropriates vegan diet in its YouTube cooking videos. Analyzing these videos, supported by an interview with the group, the article inquires into the various ways in which cooking and food consumption are intertwined with their politics. It closes by putting the group’s attitude into a wider perspective, suggesting an ideal typical model of how links between culture, nature, and identity can be understood.

T1  - Romanians' current perception of threat from immigrants in a context of co-ethnic migration: assessing the role of intergroup conflict and active/passive contact
AN  - 2008942928
AB  - This paper investigates the predictors of natives' perception of the immigrant threat in Romania, an interesting site given immigrants' marginal presence in the total population and the sizeable proportion of co-ethnic immigrants. Yet the interplay between nationalism and religion shapes an ideological frame that favours unwelcoming attitudes towards immigrants that challenge the Romanian identity forged along ethnic and religious ties. The authors used regression to analyse immigrant threat according to several dimensions: cosmopolitanism, group conflict and intergroup contact. In order to reflect specificities of this particular context, the latter dimension is conceptualized so as to include active and passive contact with immigrants. This distinction is relevant because of immigrants' low presence in Romania. Findings suggest that variables from conflict theory explain more of the variation in the perceived threat, while indirect contact through mass-media exposure to immigrant content has the potential to reduce the perception of immigrant threat.

T1  - Gulliver's Politics: Conservatives Envision Potential Enemies as Readily Vanquished and Physically Small
AN  - 1947376907
AB  - Political conservatives have been widely documented to regard out-group members as hostile, perceive individuals of ambiguous intent as malevolent, and favor aggressive solutions to intergroup conflict. A growing literature indicates that potential violent adversaries are represented using the dimensions of envisioned physical size/strength to summarize opponents' fighting capacities relative to the self or in-group. Integrating these programs, we hypothesized that, compared to liberals, conservatives would envision an ambiguous out-group target as more likely to pose a threat, yet as vanquishable through force, and thus as less formidable. Participants from the United States (Study 1) and Spain (Study 2) assessed Syrian refugees, a group that the public widely suspects includes terrorists. As predicted, in both societies, conservatives envisioned refugees as more likely to be terrorists and as less physically formidable. As hypothesized, this "Gulliver effect" was mediated by confidence in each society's capacity to thwart terrorism via aggressive military or police measures.

T1  - Trump Gave Them Hope: Studying the Strangers in Their Own Land
AN  - 1933966393
AB  - This article argues that a set of recent books published in advance of the 2016 U.S. presidential election provides a road map for understanding its outcome and a research agenda for political communication scholars in the years ahead. This article focuses on sociologist Arlie Hochschild's Strangers in Their Own Land, a field study that documents the roles that identity, narratives, and emotions play in shaping the political beliefs and behavior of White Tea Party supporters. Building on these insights, through an analysis of 123 content analyses published in Political Communication between 2003-2016, we demonstrate gaps in our field and argue that scholarship can grow analytically and empirically by accounting for the findings of these books. We conclude with suggestions for future research into people's perceptions of identity, group status, deprivation, and political power, as well as the role of media, political actors, and social groups in creating these narratives of American politics.

T1  - Bridging the Partisan Divide? Exploring Ambivalence and Information Seeking Over Time in the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election
AN  - 1891393124
AB  - Research has shown that holding conflicted attitudes (ambivalence) about political decisions may lead people to act as ideal citizens. One example of this normatively ideal behavior is seen in research linking ambivalence to information seeking. To expand on this line of inquiry, this study examines the over-time relationship between ambivalence and information seeking. We use three-wave panel data collected during the 2012 election to determine whether over-time relationships exist between these variables and test the causal direction of these relationships. We find that use of counterattitudinal information increases ambivalence, which leads people to seek out more counterattitudinal information. We also find that use of pro-attitudinal media decreases levels of ambivalence.

T1  - Media Framing and Partisan Identity: The Case of Immigration Coverage and White Macropartisanship
AN  - 1951657991
AB  - Laboratory studies frequently find that framing changes individual issue positions. But few real-world studies have demonstrated framing induced shifts in aggregate political opinions, let alone political identities. One explanation for these divergent findings is that the competitive nature of most real-world political debates presents multiple frames that cancel each other out. We assess this proposition and the extent of real-world framing by focusing on the issue of immigration, which has been framed in largely negative terms by the media. Specifically, we assess the connection between New York Times coverage of immigration and aggregate white partisanship over the last three decades. We find that negative framing on immigration is associated with shifts toward the Republican Party--the Party linked with anti-immigrant positions. This suggests that under the right circumstances, framing can alter core political predispositions and shape the partisan balance of power.

T1  - Attitudes of Professional Associations' Members towards Jordanian Political Mobility during the Arab Spring Era
AN  - 2633263372
AB  - This study aimed to identify the attitudes of the members of professional associations (PAMs) attitudes towards the Jordanian political mobility during the Arab Spring era via delineating its efficiency, future, and role in the political reform process. The study also attempted to pinpoint the PAMs' stance from such mobility and their potential future involvement in its activities. Besides, the study shed light on the extent of PAMs' participation in this sort of mobility, along with the common means of expression they used to this end. The study sample consisted of 661 members selected by a multi-phase sample. Using a three point Likert-scale, a structured questionnaire was specially designed by the researchers to fulfill the study objectives. Results showed that 86.7% of the PAMs participated in the political mobility; their participation took many forms, including writing and/or commenting on hard or soft copy newspapers. Findings also revealed that social networks were the most common means used by PAMs, accounting for 77% of the used media. Career and job demands formed the primary motivation behind PAMs' participation in the political mobility. Comprehensive economic reforms, on the other hand, came second as a major motivating factor for their participation in the activities of this mobility. Moreover, findings explicitly indicated that the efficiency of the political mobility in the future, its role in the political reform process, PAMs' stance from this mobility, along with their future potential participation in its activities are inclined to be passive. Additionally, the attitudes of the PAMs towards the continuity of the political mobility in Jordan indicated that it is inclined to backtrack.

TT  - RUSSIAN INTELLIGENTSIA AND INSTITUTIONS: TRUST OR ALIENATION?
AN  - 2007968971
AB  - В статье рассмотрены особенности и структура институционального доверия гуманитарной интеллигенции; раскрыты сущность и предпосылки его возник- новения, охарактеризована структура институционального доверия, последователь- но рассмотрены элементы этой структуры. Высший уровень доверия интеллигенция демонстрирует президенту, однако доверяющие значительно отличаются по установ- кам и мотивам выражения доверия (истинные сторонники и пассивные наблюдате- ли). Декларируемое доверие к армии отражает признание ее заслуг и обеспечения безопасности государства. Проявление полного доверия к церкви свидетельствует об идентификации с ценностями и целями этой организации. Низкий уровень доверия к политическим институтам, демонстрируемый интеллигенцией, является современной международной тенденцией – распространение чувства несправедливости, отсутствие надежды на улучшение и уверенности в будущем, подрывающих доверие к государ- ству как таковому. Доверие полиции и судам на низком уровне во многом обуслов- лено распространенными предрассудками, низкой осведомленностью о деятельности этих учреждений и редкой практикой взаимодействия с ними. Доверие к телевидению и прессе среди интеллигенции весьма ограниченно, хотя телевидение остается основ- ным источником новостей; важной альтернативой ему становится Интернет. Низкий уровень институционального доверия в среде гуманитарной интеллигенции сочетает- ся с консервативными, патерналистскими установками, гражданской и политической пассивностью и свидетельствует скорее о разочаровании и отчуждении, чем о выра- жении критического настроя и активизации конструктивного потенциала недоверия.Alternate abstract:The article examines features and structure by institutional trust of the humanitarian intelligentsia. The highest level of trust is demonstrated to the President, but those two groups, who express “full” and “partial” trust, differ significantly in their motivations for trust (true supporters/passive observers). The declared trust to the army reflects recognition of its responsible function in ensuring security of the state, protecting the country, past merits. The manifestation of the full trust to the church testifies to the identification with the values and goals of this institution. A low level of trust in political institutions (excluding the President) is demonstrated by intelligentsia and it is a modern international trend, conditioned by the spread of a set of attitudes (feelings of injustice, lack of hope for improvement and confidence in the future, the desire for change), undermining confidence to the state system as a whole. The trust to the police and the court is at a low level, which can be largely due to widespread prejudices, low awareness of the activities of these institutions and rare practices of interaction with them. The declaration of trust to media (TV and the press) among the intelligentsia is not widespread. Despite the fact that television remains the main source of news, the Internet becomes an important alternative. The low level of institutional trust among the humanitarian intelligentsia is combined with paternalistic attitudes, civil and political passivity, and indicates disappointment and exclusion rather than activation of the constructive potential of mistrust.

T1  - Correlates of Political Ideology Among U.S.-Born Mexican Americans
AN  - 1851016959
AB  - Latino Americans have to navigate involvement and identification with two cultural groups--their ethnic culture and the dominant American culture. Differences in cultural identifications have been found to correlate with political affiliation and attitudes toward acculturation. Using a sample of U.S.-born Mexican Americans, we examined several correlates of political ideology including the strength of identification with both Mexican and Anglo-American cultures, acculturation attitudes, and socioeconomic status (SES). Strength of Mexican identity, stronger integration acculturation attitudes, weaker assimilation attitudes, and lower SES were associated with holding a more liberal political ideology. Furthermore, we found that integration acculturation attitudes mediated and SES moderated the relationship between Mexican identification and political ideology. These findings suggest that political campaigns should be mindful of differences in cultural identifications and acculturation attitudes when addressing their Latino constituents.

T1  - "All Lives Matter": The Cost of Colorblind Racial Attitudes in Diverse Social Networks
AN  - 1787037480
AB  - In this study, we examined the effects of colorblind racial attitudes and outgroup prejudice on people's social network positions within a diverse social setting. Sixty-four racially diverse participants created self-resembling avatars and interacted in groups of diverse peers in the virtual world, Second Life. We conducted a social network analysis based on friendships developed during the group interactions and also examined participants' physical distances in relation to outgroup members and levels of chat participation. Colorblind racial attitudes, but not outgroup prejudice, were directly related to lower levels of closeness centrality and clustering within the network. In addition, outgroup physical distance, but not chat participation, was found to be a behavioral mechanism that mediated the relationships between: 1) colorblind racial attitudes and closeness centrality; and 2) colorblind racial attitudes and clustering. Findings are discussed in relation to the adverse affects of colorblind racial attitudes on intergroup behavior and the pro-sociality of recognizing race and racism within increasingly diverse settings such as the workplace or educational settings.

T1  - Rendering the implicit explicit: political advertisements, partisan cues, race, and white public opinion in the 2012 presidential election
AN  - 2571055019
AB  - In The Race Card (2001), Tali Mendelberg claims that once the racial content of an implicit racial appeal has been exposed the appeal loses its ability to mobilize voters. In this paper, we investigate this claim by employing a survey experiment embedded in Amazon's Mechanical Turk in which respondents view Mitt Romney's “Right Choice” television ad on welfare and then read a short op-ed. The op-ed, written by a fictitious member of Congress whose partisanship was systematically varied, argues that the Romney ad (1) is racist or (2) has no racial undertones. In line with Mendelberg's predictions, we find that – regardless of the partisanship of the elite in question – exposure to an op-ed that denounces the Romney welfare advertisement as racist leads white Democrats and Republicans to more strongly perceive the advertisement as racist and express greater opposition to Romney's campaign. Our findings contribute to the literatures on racial priming and partisan motivated reasoning, and also make a strong case for further evaluating the influence of political leadership on racial attitudes.

T1  - The Meaning of Students' Personal Belief in a Just World for Positive and Negative Aspects of School-Specific Well-Being
AN  - 1774178514
AB  - In two cross-sectional questionnaire studies with N = 1792 German and Indian students, aged between 12 and 17 years, we investigated the relation between personal belief in a just world (BJW) and positive as well as negative dimensions of school-specific well-being. Furthermore, we considered students' personal experience of teacher justice as possible mediator in this relation and controlled for confounding effects of gender, neuroticism, and locus of control. In Study 1, we used multilevel modeling to analyze the German data and to control for class-level effects. In accordance with our hypotheses, Study 1 showed that the more students believed in a personal just world, the better their positive attitudes toward school, their academic self-esteem, and their enjoyment in school were, and the less somatic complaints in school, social problems in school, and worries toward school they experienced. These associations partly differed between classes, but generally persisted when controlled for sex, neuroticism, and locus of control. Finally, the association between personal BJW and well-being was at least partly mediated by students' personal experience of teacher justice. In Study 2, we focused on the generalizability of the pattern of results across different cultural contexts. However, we did not aim to carry out comparative research. Results from bootstrap mediation analyses were predominantly the same as in Study 1. The adaptive functions of BJW and implications for future school research are discussed.

T1  - Media-Induced Elevation as a Means of Enhancing Feelings of Intergroup Connectedness
AN  - 1708525390; 201528944
AB  - The majority of research on media counter-stereotyping of race/ethnicity has tended to employ positive portrayals or counter-stereotypical exemplars as a primary strategy in eliciting positive attitudes among White participants. In contrast, this article reports the results of an experiment on the unique role of affective responses to media messages as a mechanism in inducing greater feelings of connectedness with a diversity of racial/ethnic groups. Our focus is on the affective response of elevation specifically, which refers to feelings of being moved, touched, and inspired by images of people engaged in morally beautiful acts such as love, generosity, and kindness. Results show that the experience of elevation in response to inspiring videos was associated with heightened feelings of overlap between the self and humanity, with this overlap associated with greater feelings of connectedness with those from a diversity of racial/ethnic groups. This connection was also associated with more favorable attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - MATERIALISTIC VALUES, SHOPPING, AND LIFE SATISFACTION IN ROMANIA
AN  - 1767324844; 201607553
AB  - Numerous studies have shown that generally materialists are less happy than those lower in materialism. Several studies confirm that people who experience a lower level of life satisfaction are more interested in shopping; therefore materialism determines directly and indirectly (mediated by life satisfaction) the desire of going shopping. There are only few studies that deal with this topic within Romanian consumers. The conceptual model proposed here was tested on a convenience sample of 390 Romanians. Using structural equation modelling, our findings confirm the hypothetical model only partially. Materialism leads to life dissatisfaction and shopping, but life dissatisfaction does not increase shopping. To the contrary, there is a positive relationship between life satisfaction and the desire for shopping. One possible explanation is that Romanians perceive materialism as a positive attitude. Anyway, nuances should be considered regarding the role of money and possession in bringing life satisfaction. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Victorious justifications and criticism of defeated: Involvement of nations in world wars, social development, cultural values, social representations of war, and willingness to fight
AN  - 1767330329; 201606258
AB  - Social representations of the historical past, anchored in historical experience and cultural values, play a motivational role for justifying collective behaviour. The First and Second World Wars (WWI and WWII) are the most remembered historical events around the world. The aim of the current study is to investigate, based on country-level data, the relationship between the country's role during the war, social development, cultural values and willingness to fight in a future war, and how social representations of WWII mediate these processes. The data from the World History Survey were collected from a total of 6628 university students from 36 countries. The results showed that ascribing WWII a progressive (UN creation, democracy) or technological-scientific explanation, but also perceiving WWII as a social catastrophe, prevailed more than beliefs justifying WWII (just and necessary war). Directly or indirectly victorious nations endorse legitimizing and positive representations of world wars more than defeated ones. The effects of hierarchical and collectivistic values and low social development on willingness to fight in a war are mediated by legitimizing social representations of WWII. Importantly, when controlled for socio-structural differences (human development index), the indirect effect of being a victorious nation in a war on willingness to fight through legitimizing representations of WWII was also significant. These findings suggest that social representations of WWII serve as anchors for determining the role of a nation in collective violence. Social representations legitimizing past collective violence seem to facilitate more positive attitudes towards potential future collective violence in victorious nations. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

AB  - This article describes an agent-based simulation model of ethnonationalist radicalization between political actors and their constituencies based upon evidence from the former Yugoslavia. The central mechanism is the recursive feedback between political and cultural dynamics, focusing on processes prior to the outbreak of actual violence. The results offer theoretical insights by revealing mechanisms that lead to escalation. These can be found within politics as well as among the population: between conflicting ethnically homogeneous regions, opposing radicalization forces fuel an escalation spiral. These processes are driven by political influences. Challenging the theory that diversity breeds conflict, this suggests that multiethnic regions are more capable of withstanding political pressures. However, they are vulnerable to imported violence, driven by the local population. This finding is tested with a different model of the same events, in which different implemented mechanisms generate results, in line with the diversity-breeds-conflict theory. A comparative discussion demonstrates how simulation is sensitive to theoretical predispositions. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Traits and Roles in Gender Stereotypes: A Comparison between Moroccan and Spanish Native Samples
AN  - 1680152612; 201517779
AB  - This study examines gender role attitudes and attitudes toward 'man' and 'woman' in two native samples from Spain and Morocco. The samples were made up of 400 participants, 200 in each country, containing the same number of men and women and selected with a similar procedure. We expected differences based on the independent variables of nationality, gender and educational level. The Spanish sample, female and student participants were predicted to present more egalitarian gender role attitudes and more positive attitudes toward 'woman' than participants in the Moroccan sample, male and non-student participants. Overall MANOVAs were used to show the differences in gender role attitudes and attitudes toward 'man' and 'woman'. Results confirmed the role of the nationality variable in the expected way. The Spanish sample showed a more egalitarian view and more favorable attitudes toward 'woman' than the Moroccan one. Educational level and gender showed significant effects on the Moroccan sample but only partially. Moroccan student females and non-student males presented a more egalitarian view than non-student females and student males respectively. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social media for learning: A mixed methods study on high school students' technology affordances and perspectives
AN  - 1641424275; 201501157
AB  - Using an explanatory sequential mixed methods design, the study investigated high school students' affordances for social media, their attitudes and beliefs about these new technologies, and related obstacles and issues. The affordance findings indicate that students depend on social media in their daily lives for leisure and social connections. Educational uses by teachers for classroom teaching and learning are sporadic, while uses by students on their own for learning purposes seem to be abundant but also incidental and informal. Quantitative results suggest that in general, students show positive attitudes and beliefs about social media use in education. Exploratory factor analysis revealed three components that explained a total of 65.4% of the variance: (a) benefits of social media use, (b) disadvantages of social media use, and (c) current social media use in education. Three issues emerged from the interview data: Conceptual understanding of social media for learning; close-minded, acquired uses versus open-minded, innate uses of social media; and changed concepts of learning. The study results suggest that for social media to be used as effective learning tools and to adjust students' prior affordances with these tools, complicated efforts in designing, scaffolding, and interacting with students during the process are necessary.

T1  - Motives for Active Participation in Political Blogs: A Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Eight German Blogs
AN  - 1531931120; 201422694
AB  - Blogs play an important role in political communication and in forming the opinions of political actors and politically interested users. Their ability to facilitate active interaction, present opinions, mobilize voters, and thereby, influence public opinion and eventually election outcomes makes political blogs an interesting research subject. Thus, this article draws upon a qualitative content analysis to reveal the readers' motivations and main themes to post comments and get involved in the discussions on political blogs. We analyze 12 blog discussions (500 pages) in eight left-leaning German political blogs and use qualitative content analysis to develop a category scheme comprising of 3,868 codings. We find that social interaction with other blog users is the main motive for blogging on German political blogs together with the desire for the exchange of further information and analysis, and the expression of the own opinion concerning the subject. Moreover, we classify 191 users by their motivations for blogging using cluster analysis and identify the bloggers' different communication roles. By providing insight into the users' political discussions, motives for participation, and communication roles, we clarify the role that political blogs play in the process of forming political opinion and derive implications for politics.

T1  - Benefits and barriers to sports participation for athletes with disabilities: the case of Malaysia
AN  - 1692288171; 201521457
AB  - The purpose of this paper was to explore the benefits and barriers influencing participation for athletes with disabilities from a developing country (Malaysia). Two independent studies were undertaken: Study 1 included a sample of 123 athletes (95 males, 28 females) who participated in the 2006 Far East and South Pacific Games for the Disabled (FESPIC Games); Study 2 involved focus group discussions with 14 elite athletes. The athletes ranged in age from 15 to 59 years. Data were collected through a questionnaire (Study 1) and focus group discussions (Study 2). The primary reasons for participation in sport were achievement/challenge (58%) and competency/skill development (41%). The main barriers faced by the athletes were structural (facilities, equipment, funding) and the negative attitude from the government, public and media. However, despite these difficulties the majority of athletes were keen to continue to compete. Further work is required to ensure athletes with disabilities are provided with similar opportunities to athletes without disabilities. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Supervising Rioters: The Role of Probation
AN  - 1504423777; 201407683
AB  - This article aims to investigate the current response to the riots in the UK in August 2011 by comparing and contrasting the political and institutional factors with the reaction to the riots that occurred in Brixton and Toxteth 1981 and those in Bradford, Burnley and Oldham in 2001. The article focuses on the changes which have occurred within the probation service over that period and by interviewing twelve frontline practitioners, seeks to gain an insight into the ways these transformations reflect wider differences within the role of probation, the community, political and government attitudes and the ways this is communicated within the media.

T1  - Outrageous political opinion and political anxiety in the US
AN  - 1541997076; 201427283
AB  - In a time marked by declining audiences for nightly news broadcasts and dwindling newspaper readership, the audience size for outrage-based political opinion-media (e.g., The Rush Limbaugh Show, The O'Reilly Factor, The Ed Show) has grown dramatically. Existing research has shown that people gravitate toward media sources that support their pre-existing beliefs, but explanations for this tendency dwell upon psychological processes and perceptions of information quality. We find such explanations unsatisfying for this unique genre, and we apply a more sociological lens. Using in-depth interviews with fans and qualitative analyses of television and talk radio transcripts-this research shows how anxieties churned up by public political dialog and people's related tendency to avoid political talk with those outside their most trusted inner circles help to create powerful connections between charismatic political talk show hosts and their fans. Shifting the focus from the information desired by fans to experiences they value, and from psychological to social needs, we show that outrage-based political opinion programs create safe political spaces for fans. We end by suggesting how shifts in the broader political climate have left conservative audiences hungrier for such content. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

T1  - Consensus, compromise, justice and legitimacy
AN  - 1463012041; 201347451
AB  - Could the notion of compromise help us overcoming -- or at least negotiating -- the frequent tension, in normative political theory, between the realistic desideratum of peaceful coexistence and the idealistic desideratum of justice? That is to say, an analysis of compromise may help us move beyond the contrast between two widespread contrasting attitudes in contemporary political philosophy: 'fiat iustitia, pereat mundus', on the one side, and 'salus populi suprema lex', on the other side. More specifically, compromise may provide the backbone of a conception of legitimacy that mediates between idealistic (or moralistic) and realistic (or pragmatic) desiderata of political theory, i.e. between the aspiration to peace and the aspiration to justice. In other words, this paper considers whether an account of compromise could feature in a viable realistic conception of political legitimacy, in much the same way in which consensus features in more idealistic conceptions of legitimacy (a move that may be attributed to some realist theorists, especially Bernard Williams). My conclusions, however, are largely sceptical: I argue that grounding legitimacy in any kind of normatively salient agreement does require the trappings of idealistic political philosophy, for better or -- in my view -- worse.

T1  - Don't ask don't tell: examining attitudes about black homosexuality and the media in an online forum
AN  - 1792349912
AB  - On 8 November 2005, a posting appeared on the BET.COM Bulletin Board under the heading Noah's Arc. It read: 'Has anyone caught the new show called Noah's Arc? It comes on a gay/lesbian channel called LOGO and the show is really good. It is about four gay men living and loving in Los Angeles ... it gives us a glimpse into a world of gay men and the struggles that they endure in life. I suggest that all of you watch it.' Using textual analysis, this study examines the responses of forum users addressing the following research question: Thematically, what attitudes and opinions emerged from the postings surrounding the question 'Has anyone caught the new show Noah's Arc?' Eight themes emerged from the postings submitted by 84 respondents as BET.COM visitors engaged in a four-month discussion about sexual orientation and identity, race, religion and spirituality. The analysis reveals that while many respondents were homophobic and heterosexist, others had a more sophisticated and enlightened understanding of sexuality, media images and stereotypes, religion, and identity politics. Results suggest that an inevitable consequence of discussions of homosexuality is a discussion of morality and religion.

T1  - Consuming Ourselves to Dearth: Escalating Inequality and Public Opinion
AN  - 1221408915; 201244629
AB  - This article proposes an agenda for research on the relation of structural inequality to the study of politics and consumption in the field of communication. The authors review evidence for increasing inequality in the United States and argue that (1) consumption choices and desires are strongly constrained by structural location; (2) political beliefs and attitudes are shaped by location in the income or class structure; and (3) consumption as a form of political self-expression or civic identity, for example, boycotting or "buycotting," is also constrained by economic structural location. Given these propositions, it becomes critical to analytically situate notions of personalization of politics within the context of increasing economic inequality.

T1  - Facing Up to Aging: Mid-Life Women's Attitudes toward Cosmetic Procedures
AN  - 1567049158; 201437033
AB  - Despite the fact that mid-life and older women are a major consumer group for cosmetic procedures (e.g., botox, face lifts), few studies have been done on their attitudes toward these procedures and their willingness to undergo them. The purpose of the present study was to gather information about the popularity of these procedures among a group of 57 mid-life American women, examine whether some personality and attitudinal measures might predict attitudes toward these procedures, and consider the ramifications of the data for the treatment of women in feminist therapy. About one third (38.5%) of our sample had had one or more cosmetic procedures, and 81% said that they would have a procedure if cost were not an issue. Positive attitudes toward cosmetic surgery and preoccupation with being over-weight best predicted women's interest in cosmetic procedures. The popularity of these procedures is discussed in light of the double standard of aging and age discrimination, weight as a 'normative discontent,' and the ubiquity of advertisements for, and normalization of, these procedures in the popular media.

T1  - Beauty, Ethnicity, and Age: Does Internalization of Mainstream Media Ideals Influence Attitudes Towards Older Adults?
AN  - 958727213
AB  - Mainstream North American media promotes the message that attaining a thin, youthful appearance is central to a woman's value and social role while appearing older is highly undesirable. However, appearance ideals and attitudes toward aging differ substantially across cultural and ethnic groups, which may influence the degree to which one internalizes media ideals and holds anti-aging attitudes. Consequently, this study examined the relationships between internalization of the youthful, thin-ideal appearance perpetuated by mainstream North American media and attitudes toward the elderly in a sample of 281 undergraduate females under the age of 30 attending a university in the Western United States. Specifically, European American (n=115), Asian American/Pacific Islander (n=74), Hispanic/Latina (n=52), and African American (n=42) women voluntarily completed self-report measures of internalization of media ideals and attitudes towards older adults. Attitudes towards the elderly were significantly more negative at higher levels of internalization of North American appearance ideals, independent of ethnicity. These data suggest that internalization of North American appearance ideals perpetuated by media are related to negative attitudes towards older adults. Future research should investigate the influence of negative attitudes about aging on behaviors toward older adults or one's own aging process.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Wife Abuse in Tamil Nadu
AN  - 1283640746; 201306390
AB  - Wife abuse is a major public health and human rights problem. Using an ecological framework, data from National Family Health Survey (NFHS 2005-2006) of 3446 women were analyzed to determine the factors associated with wife abuse in urban and rural Tamil Nadu, India. The prevalence rate of wife abuse in the year prior to the interview was 25.8% and was similar across urban and rural areas. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that in urban and rural Tamil Nadu, the micro level variables explained the highest percentage of variance in wife abuse followed by the ontogenetic, the exo system, and the macro system variables. Some of the variables that were significantly associated with wife abuse in Tamil Nadu were witnessing parental violence, drinking habit in husbands, emotional abuse, patriarchal ideology, and positive attitudes towards abuse. Implications of the results are discussed within the socio-cultural milieu of the respondents. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Masbirim Israel: Israel's PR Campaign as Glocalized and Grobalized Political Prosumption
AN  - 1221412983; 201244631
AB  - In 2010, Israel's Ministry of Information and Diaspora Affairs launched a new campaign: Masbirim Israel. Its purpose was to "recruit" Israeli citizens to the task of improving the nation's public image in the world. It was the first time a well-organized campaign was launched, systematically employing new-media tools and calling on Israeli citizens to independently take part in improving their country's international image-all at the behest of a government ministry. The executive authority in effect delivered some of its responsibilities and obligations to private hands. This article discusses prosumption in the political sphere and expands the idea of prosumption to a domain in which the state itself is the producer and its citizens are the consumers. Prosumption is perceived as acts conducted by citizens who operate to fulfill aims (i.e., produce products) that traditionally have been in the purview of the state. The article presents two arguments: First, the campaign is an expression of the idea of prosumption in the political sphere. By integrating Israel's citizens in the process of public relations (PR), they become prosumers in the sense that they participate in the production of a public good that traditionally has been supplied by the state. Second, the Masbirim Israel campaign is an expression of a glocalized and grobalized condition in Israeli reality, as it reflects trends of neoliberal values and practices of privatization and expresses the political opinions of (extreme) nationalism and particularism to nonformally "recruit" its citizens to the national PR effort.

T1  - Environmental Justice And Safety Restraint In Atlanta, Georgia
AN  - 1347781814; 201318684
AB  - Atlanta is a region designed for cars. Automobile crashes are the leading causes of injury-related deaths in the United States. Deaths and injuries of passengers tend to cost employers by days missed from work and lost productivity. The passive safety of the auto consists of seatbelts, airbags, and the physical structure of the automobile. Safety restraint is very important because it saves lives. Seat belts are considered the most effective means of reducing fatalities and serious injuries during a car crash. Child safety seats are used to protect children while they are riding in a motor vehicle. The environmental justice framework is used to analyze safety restraint in the context of who is being discriminated against environmentally. The researchers have studied safety restraint in Atlanta, Georgia over a ten year period by reviewing and analyzing data on safety restraint. They also reviewed and analyzed the content of ten years of newspaper articles on transportation equity and pedestrian fatalities in the Atlanta metropolitan area. An environmental justice impact assessment is done to explain how specific impacts (cumulative, direct, indirect, & community) affect the environment of a community. Environmental justice tends to provide alternatives for pedestrians and drivers by providing vital recommendations on reducing unnecessary roads and highways that can be risky and hazardous for pedestrians. Minority pedestrians face multiple risks associated with transportation because their primary mode of traveling is by foot. Environmental justice ensures that laws are enforced which protects individuals who walk or drive in the Atlanta metropolitan area. The researchers provide policy recommendations that can be used to improve safety restraint. A safe environment makes it safer for people to live and makes it easier to preserve life.

T1  - Transactional Politics
AN  - 1994216958
AB  - In spring 2009, revelations over the expense claims of British MPs led to one of the most damaging scandals affecting the legitimacy of parliamentary democracy in recent history. This article explores how this incident reveals the capacity of Web 2.0 devices and transactional data to transform politics. It reflects, graphically, the political power of identifying and knowing people on the basis of their transactions, on what they do rather than what they say. It also shows in practice how Web 2.0 devices such as Crowdsourcing, Google Docs, mash-ups and visualization software can be used to mobilize data for collective and popular projects. Basic analytic tools freely available on the Web enable people to access, digitize and analyse data and do their own analyses and representations of phenomena. We examine media and popular mobilizations of transactional data using the specific example of the MPs' expenses scandal and relate this to larger currents in online government data and devices for public scrutiny which give rise to a new politics of measurement. We argue that this politics of measurement involves the introduction of new visual devices based on the manipulation of huge databases into simplified visual arrays; the reorientation of accounts of the social from elicited attitudes and views to transactions and practices; and, the inspection of individuals arrayed in relation to other individuals within whole (sub) populations. It is also a politics that mobilizes new informational gatekeepers and organizers in the making and analysis of transactional data and challenges dominant or expert forms of analysis and representation.

T1  - Anti-Slavic imagery in German radical nationalist discourse at the turn of the twentieth century: a prelude to Nazi ideology?
AN  - 1531933839; 201423301
AB  - By applying methods of cognitive metaphor theory, Jaworska examines metaphorical scenarios employed in the discourse of anti-Slavism, which featured prominently in radical nationalist propaganda in Germany at the turn of the twentieth century. She does so by analysing metaphorical expressions used to refer to the Polish population living in the eastern provinces of Prussia, in the so-called Ostmark. Her article is based on an analysis of a range of pamphlets and newspaper articles written by some of the leading figures of two nationalist organizations: the Pan-German League (Alldeutscher Verband) and the Eastern Marches Society (Ostmarkenverein). The main research questions it addresses are: What kind of metaphoric scenarios were used to depict the Polish minority, and to what extent were the metaphorical patterns of anti-Slavic imagery similar to those employed in the antisemitic propaganda of the Nazi era? Is there a discursive continuity between the radical nationalism of imperial Germany and the National Socialism of the Third Reich at the level of metaphorical scenarios? Ultimately, Jaworska attempts to contribute to a better understanding of the cognitive mechanisms underlying radical and essentially racist attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Job attitudes and well-being among public vs. private physicians: organizational justice and job control as mediators
AN  - 919903159; 201202490
AB  - Background: The present study examined whether there are differences in job-related attitudes and well-being among physicians working in private sector and public sector. In addition, we examined whether psychosocial factors (organizational justice and job control) could mediate these possible differences in different sectors. Methods: Cross-sectional survey data from the Finnish Health Professional Study was used. A random sample of Finnish physicians included 1522 women and 1047 men aged 25-65 years. Outcome variables were job satisfaction, organizational commitment, psychological distress, work ability and sleeping problems. Job control and organizational justice were measured using established questionnaires. Series of regression analyses were performed and the mediational effects were tested following the procedures outlined by Baron and Kenny. Results: Physicians working in private sector had higher levels of job satisfaction and organizational commitment and lower levels of psychological distress and sleeping problems when compared with physicians working in public sector. Private physicians also had higher levels of organizational justice, which acted as a mediator behind more positive attitudes and better well-being in private sector. Private physicians had higher levels of job control but it did not act as a mediator. Conclusions: Private physicians feel better than public physicians and this is partly due to higher organizational justice in private sector. Public health care organizations should invest effort to increase the fairness in their organizations and management and pay more attention in improving the well-being of their employees, which could possibly increase the attractiveness of public sector as a career option.

T1  - Red socks and purple rain: the political uses of colour in late apartheid South Africa
AN  - 887499210; 201118580
AB  - This article explores the extent to which colour functions as an independent mode in a particular context and explores the culturally produced regularities in the uses of colour in this context. Drawing on a Hallidayan metafunctional view of text, we look at how colour instantiated systems of knowledge and belief (ideational function) and social relations and identities (interpersonal function) in South Africa during the last decade of the apartheid government. In this type of repressive socio-political context, colour was a less policed mode, and thus had different affordances to images and the verbal modes. We argue that colour can function as an independent mode under certain conditions, such as stringent press restrictions, where the use of colour in a range of media (clothing, flags, posters) can play a crucial role in communicating.

T1  - Attacks on Indian students: the commerce of denial in Australia
AN  - 1928305719
AB  - The issue of racist violence appeared in the Australian media and politics in mid-2009 following a spate of attacks on international students in Melbourne and Sydney. The racist aspect of these attacks was downplayed, authorities describing them as 'opportunistic' and a 'regrettable fact of urban life'. The denial of racism is a familiar hallmark of contemporary racism; for some scholars, it is a defining criterion of what has been called the 'new racism'. But the denial of racism around the attacks on Indian international students also had an economic imperative. Negative media coverage within India posed a substantial threat to the AUS$18.6 billion international education export market, with potential students and sponsors becoming concerned about their security should they elect to study in Australia. Data from the Challenging Racism project provide compelling evidence on the racist context of the attacks. The Indian media and politicians maintained an outraged position on the attacks, affecting student interest in Australia. And as the substantial economic costs became clearer, Australian governments came to more openly acknowledge a racist element to the attacks, also hinting at structural issues regarding community relations and attitudes which required policy attention.

T1  - An Experimental Test of the Effects of Fictional Framing on Attitudes
AN  - 862595973; 201110278
AB  - Objectives. Most studies of media effects in political communication focus on news media. A smaller body of work extends theories of news media effects to fictional entertainment media. Just as news media engage in priming and agenda setting, these studies suggest that fictional media do as well. In this study, we deal with fictional media's framing of issues. No research has sought to test the effects of framing in explicitly fictional media on political opinions. We develop the outlines of a theory we call 'fictional framing' and test it in an experiment. Methods. Participants in our treatment group watched the film Cider House Rules. The movie frames the issue of abortion in the case of incest in a pro-choice way, and frames morality in terms of following one's own conscience. Results. The film influenced opinions in ways consistent with the framing of these issues. Conclusions. Since abortion opinions and moral values tend to be entrenched, we consider this a strong first test of the effects of fictional framing. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Influence of Spanish-Language Media on Latino Public Opinion and Group Consciousness
AN  - 902083233; 201122263
AB  - Objective: This article determines if the use of Spanish-language media among Latinos influences public opinion on various policy issues and group consciousness. Methods: Using a 2004 national public opinion survey of U.S. Latinos, a multivariate analysis is run to determine the effect of language media preference on immigration policy, abortion, same-sex marriage, and three measures of group consciousness. Results: I find more frequent use of Spanish-language media leads to more liberal attitudes toward immigration, but has no effect on opinions toward abortion and same-sex marriage. I also find increased use of Spanish-language media leads to increased levels of group consciousness. Conclusions: The differences in attitudes are due to the diverging goals of Spanish-language and English-language media. The effect of using Spanish-language media serves to promote a sense of group consciousness among Latinos by reinforcing roots in Latin America and the commonalities among Latinos of varying national origin.

T1  - Political bias in TV interviews
AN  - 870432886; 201114659
AB  - The study aims to provide empirical data on the alleged political bias of Dutch media. It also aims to contribute to the development of an instrument for the measurement of partiality in TV interviews. Its main question is: are TV interviewers biased in putting adversarial questions to politicians with different political backgrounds? The data collection encompasses 12 interviews taken from the late-night talk show Pauw & Witteman during the run-up to the parliamentary elections of 2006. The analysis focuses on five measures of adversarial questioning that were developed by Clayman et al. (2007): initiative, directness, assertiveness, opposition and accountability, as well as on a sixth measure that was developed in the context of this study, persistence. The results show that left-wing politicians are approached less adversarially than right-wing politicians and politicians in the political centre, even when various factors that might offer an alternative explanation are included in the analysis. The conclusion is that interviewers are partial in shaping the way in which politicians can present themselves to the public. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Britney Spears Remained in Russia: Dynamics of Musical Preferences in the Integration of Immigrant Adolescents
AN  - 2076977042
AB  - This study examined the roles of popular music in the lives of immigrant adolescents from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS-former Soviet Union) in Israel. Based on 70 in-depth interviews with newly arrived adolescents aged 12-18, our research revealed that these adolescents' musical preferences matched different stages of adaptation to their new country, with different music styles fulfilling different integration needs. During their first two years in Israel, interviewees enthusiastically explored local musical fare. This stage was also characterised by positive attitudes towards their new home and their anticipated integration. In dramatic contrast, the next three to five years were characterised by disappointment with the local culture, accompanied by growing social alienation. Many adolescents found consolation in late-1980s Russian rock music, as texts critical of the Soviet regime helped them express anger and frustration felt as they came of age in new, difficult and often hostile surroundings. It seems, therefore, that, for immigrant adolescents, different types of popular music not only serve as a marker of their evolving cultural identity but also as indicators of social and psychological adaptation.

T1  - Mixed methods evaluation of a menu of research learning opportunities for mid-career social work academics with 'protected time'
AN  - 1364701474; 201327060
AB  - Knowledge about research methodologies and positive attitudes about research are each essential for academics who teach social worker students to advocate for and to deliver effective, empowering services to vulnerable people. This paper evaluates a menu of learning opportunities offered to fifty-two mid-career social work academics from 30 UK universities given 'protected time' to increase their research skills, funded by RDI4-ESRC. Qualitative and quantitative survey data are summarized. All participants attended five of eight conference days on research methodologies; 80% participated in small discussion groups; 49% attended a 3-day writing retreat; 49% signed up to a research mini-placement; 31% presented research at a conference; 21% submitted manuscripts to a journal. The demonstrated commitment of time, expertise, and advanced skills to this project from 32 senior social science/social work researchers came at a time when media was blasting the profession. They modelled enthusiasm and confidence and 'bridged' access for the 'next generation' of academics. Repeated encounters amongst the participants gradually built 'bonded' social capital 'normed' positively around the enterprise of research. Participants reported at follow-up increased knowledge and confidence as they teach... In the current economic context, there are benefits of 'protected time' combined with structured opportunities for mid-career social work academics. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - News use and political socialization among young Jordanians
AN  - 1018356712; 201213409
AB  - This study examined the relationship between young Jordanians' (N = 321) news use and their feelings toward the Jordanian and US governments. Consumption of traditional news delivery formats (such as print newspapers, radio broadcasts and interpersonal sources) was measured, as was reliance on new media formats such as blogs, text messaging and podcasting. Political socialization measures were indices of political trust and appraisals of the US government. Results suggest that young Jordanians in the sample rely mostly on TV news, newspapers and interpersonal contacts for current events information, and that TV news use and reliance on interpersonal sources were associated with negative views of the US government.

T1  - Attitudes influence implicit racial face categorization in a perceptual task
AN  - 1018356374; 201212746
AB  - Perceptual mechanisms have been proposed for the categorization of racial faces. Social cognitive mechanisms involved in the categorization of racial faces, however, remain unclear. The present study investigated whether and how attitudes influence racial face categorization by measuring reaction times to judge orientations of own-race or other-race faces. Study 1 showed that, in a task of judging orientations of Caucasian and Asian faces, European Americans responded faster to own-race (Caucasian) faces than to other-race (Asian) faces. Study 2 showed that Han Chinese responded faster to own-race (Han Chinese) faces than to other-race (Uigur Chinese) faces. In addition, we found that, in both experiments, own-race advantage in reaction times was eliminated by inducing negative attitudes toward own-race faces using a negative association priming procedure. Moreover, the mediation analysis in Study 2 showed that the priming effect was mediated by attitude bias toward own-race faces. Our findings provide evidence for categorization of racial faces in a perceptual, race-irrelevant task, which, however, is strongly modulated by attitudes toward target faces.

T1  - Sexual Experience and Couple Formation Attitudes Among Emerging Adults
AN  - 1429638613; 201338116
AB  - In this study, we explore the relationship between attitudes toward both marriage and cohabitation and sexual experience during emerging adulthood. Results from 990 emerging adults indicated only moderate evidence that marital attitudes are related to sexual experience but strong evidence of a relationship between attitudes toward cohabitation and sexual experience. In particular, sexually active emerging adults were more likely to have positive attitudes toward cohabitation. Furthermore, it was found that both religiosity and dating status moderate the relationship between couple formation attitudes and sexual experience. For highly religious emerging adults, sexual activity was associated with higher endorsement of cohabitation; however, this pattern was not present for emerging adults with low religiosity. Dating status was found to have some impact on the relationship between sexual behavior and attitudes toward marriage but did not greatly impact the overall pattern of relationships.
