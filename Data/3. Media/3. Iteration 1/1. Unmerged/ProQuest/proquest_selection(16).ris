T1  - Judging “Them” by My Media Use: Exploring the Cause and Consequences of Perceived Selective Exposure
AN  - 2632022444
AB  - Focusing on Hong Kong’s anti-extradition bill movement and drawing on a sample of 527 pro-democracy Hong Kong students, this paper investigates the relations among selective exposure, perceived selective exposure, presumed media influence, and their potential consequences. It shows that individuals’ assumption of the outgroup’s media diet is a mirror image of their own media choices. The more an individual consumes like-minded information, the more he/she expects outgroup members to do so. On the contrary, the more one uses cross-cutting media, the more he/she expects outgroup members to engage in cross-cutting exposure as well. Individuals’ perceived media exposure of the outgroup will further influence their presumed media influence on the outgroup, which may trigger potential attitudinal and behavioral reactions. The findings shed new light on the consequences of selective exposure. Besides directly influencing us through pro-attitudinal information, selective exposure can also affect us indirectly, by making us believe that our rivals are also engaging in and polarized by selective exposure to ideologically congruent sources.

T1  - Memory of Conflicts and Perceived Threat as Relevant Mediators of Interreligious Conflicts
AN  - 2642613327
AB  - The present study investigated to what extent memory of conflict and perceived threat explain the relation between religiosity and supporting interreligious conflicts between Muslims and Christians in Indonesia. We employed data from the survey of the interreligious conflicts in 2017, involving 2026 adults from five hotspot regions: Aceh Singkil, South Lampung, Bekasi, Poso, and Kupang. Our confirmatory factor analysis and measurement invariance demonstrated that all employed scales were valid and reliable across religious groups. Our structural equation modelling showed that while the memory of conflicts was only positively related to supporting lawful protests, the perceived threat was shown to be strongly related to supporting both lawful and violent protests. This shows that memory of past physical injuries is not highly susceptible to exclusive behaviours against the religious outgroup. However, it is the individuals’ evaluation of the religious outgroup as a result of past conflicts which encourages exclusionary behaviours against them. These findings provide empirical insights into the importance of the aftermath of interreligious conflicts and how they can be used to avoid future clashes.

T1  - Cognitive and neural bases of decision-making causing civilian casualties during intergroup conflict
AN  - 2574932303
AB  - Civilian casualties occur during military attacks. Such ‘collateral damage’ is prohibited by international laws but increases with substantial consequences when intergroup conflict escalates. Here, we investigate cognitive and neural bases of decision-making processes resulting in civilian harm, using a task that simulates punishment decision-making during intergroup conflict. We test two groups of Chinese participants in a laboratory setting, and members of two ethnic groups (Jewish and Palestinian) in Israel. The results dissociate two psychological constructs, harm preference and harm avoidance, which respectively characterize punishment decision-making related to outgroup combatants and outgroup noncombatants during intergroup conflict. In particular, individuals show decreased avoidance of harming outgroup noncombatants when conflict escalates. Brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging) reveals that decreased harm avoidance is predicted by inhibition of the left middle frontal activity during selection of punishment decisions. Our findings provide insight into the cognitive and neural bases of decision-making involving civilian harm during intergroup conflict.During intergroup conflict, decision-makers must often consider whether their actions will harm noncombatant members of the outgroup. Here, Han et al. examine cognitive and neural processes during ‘collateral damage’ scenarios, revealing decreased avoidance of harm to outgroup civilians when conflict escalates.

T1  - Perceived normalization of radical ideologies and its effect on political tolerance and support for freedom of speech: GPIR
AN  - 2466739950
AB  - Two studies tested the idea that perceived normalization of radical political ideologies (right and left) reduces support for freedom of speech of the opponents and political tolerance. In Study 1 (N = 633), Americans were primed with the normalization of the radical right or left. Primed with the normalization of radical outgroup ideologies, both liberals and conservatives were more willing to restrict their opponents’ freedom of speech and were more politically intolerant – effects that were mediated by collective angst. Study 2 (N = 632) replicated the results of Study 1 and extended them by showing that both conservatives and liberals worried about the image of their party not when they were exposed to the normalization of radical ingroup ideologies, but when they were exposed to the normalization of radical outgroup ideologies. These results suggest that perceived normalization of radical ideologies affects people’s attitudes towards freedom of speech and political (in)tolerance.

T1  - Using virtual reality to induce gratitude through virtual social interaction
AN  - 2449986932
AB  - The present research examined to what extent virtual reality was an effective tool to induce a complex, positive, other-oriented emotion: gratitude. We hypothesized that receiving the help of a virtual benefactor should generate a feeling of gratitude, but also social benefits. In two studies, we showed that this virtual social interaction induced a feeling of gratitude in contrast to a control condition. Furthermore, in both studies, being helped by a virtual confederate led participants to be more inclined to offer social support to their benefactor, in contrast to the control condition. The beneficial effect of the gratitude induction on social support intentions was mediated by the virtual confederate's perceived warmth (Studies 1 & 2) and by enhanced perceived interpersonal closeness (Study 2). Finally, the expected benefits of gratitude were observed for both ingroup and outgroup benefactors. Implications of these findings for emotion induction, well-being, and intergroup contacts are discussed.

T1  - Superficial ingroup love? Collective narcissism predicts ingroup image defense, outgroup prejudice, and lower ingroup loyalty
AN  - 2448123183
AB  - We examined the associations between the need for personal control, different types of ingroup commitment, and group‐related outcomes: (1) defensive responses to ingroup criticism, (2) ingroup disloyalty, and (3) outgroup attitudes. We assumed that collective narcissism (i.e., a belief in ingroup’s greatness which is contingent on external validation and stems from frustrated individual needs) should be concerned with defending the ingroup image and derogating outgroups, but not necessarily with being loyal to the ingroup. Secure ingroup identification (i.e., a confidently held ingroup evaluation, which stems from satisfied needs), in contrast, should predict greater ingroup loyalty and positive outgroup attitudes. We expected these effects to be especially strong once we account for the overlap between collective narcissism and group‐level self‐investment – a key component of ingroup identification. In a nationally representative sample of Polish adults (n = 1,007), collective narcissism (net of group‐level self‐investment) mediated between low personal control and ingroup image defense, lower group loyalty, and less positive outgroup attitudes. Secure ingroup identification (group‐level self‐investment net of collective narcissism) mediated between high personal control and ingroup loyalty and positive outgroup attitudes. It was not associated with ingroup image defense. Implications for understanding the role of identification in inter‐ and intra‐group relations are discussed.

T1  - Filial discrepancy and mortality among community-dwelling older adults: a prospective cohort study
AN  - 2430093089
AB  - Objectives: Adult children play a significant role in ageing parents’ health and well-being. However, the evidence is mixed regarding whether the parent-child relations will affect older adults’ longevity. This study aims to investigate the relationship between filial discrepancy and mortality risk.Method: Data were derived from a prospective cohort study from 2011 to 2017 of US Chinese older adults aged 60 and above in the Greater Chicago area, with a median of follow-up of 5.28 years. Filial discrepancy was assessed by the gap between filial expectation and receipt, including six domains (discrepancy in respect, greet, care, obey, make happy, and financial support). Mortality ascertained during follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models were used.Results: Among 3,021 participants, care expectation was least fulfilled while financial expectation was better fulfilled compared with other filial discrepancy domains. Compared with no respect discrepancy, older adults with respect expectation above receipt had higher risk of mortality (HR, 1.44; 95%CI, 1.07–1.94). Older adults with higher greet expectation than receipt experienced greater risk of mortality (HR, 1.56; 95%CI, 1.16–2.09) than those with no greet discrepancy. Older adults with care receipt above expectation had lower risk of mortality (HR, 0.75; 95%CI, 0.56–1.00).Conclusion: This study extends the relative standards model to investigate mortality outcomes. The findings add new insights to the association between parent-child relations and mortality risk. It is suggested that educational programs could focus on fostering young immigrants’ attitude and behavior to provide more respect and greeting for aging parents to strengthen the family protection role.

T1  - An investigation of an Expanded Encapsulate Model of Social Identity in Collective Action (EMSICA) including perception of threat and intergroup contact to understand support for Islamist terrorism in Indonesia
AN  - 2350161729
AB  - Although there have been many empirical studies of terrorism within the psychology literature, relatively few studies have theorized terrorism from the perspective of collective action theory. The present study aimed to understand factors that predict support for Islamist terrorism by using the Encapsulate Model of Social Identity in Collective Action (EMSICA) perspective. To extend previous studies, we added perception of threat and intergroup contact to the model. A correlational study using 66 terrorism detainees in Indonesia as participants found solid support for our expanded EMSICA. The models extending EMSICA with perception of threat and quantity of contact as predictors had improved fit indices and explained more variance in the dependent variable support for Islamist terrorism, as compared to the standard model. Social identity had a significant direct effect on support for Islamist terrorism and mediated the effect of intergroup contact, perception of threat, perceived injustice, and group efficacy on support for Islamist terrorism.

T1  - When Can Exemplars Shape White Racial Attitudes? Evidence from the 2012 U.S. Presidential Campaign
AN  - 2431020183
AB  - Prior research finds that exposure to outgroup exemplars reduces prejudice, but it has focused on most-likely cases. We examine whether salient outgroup exemplars can reduce prejudice under more challenging conditions, such as when they are counter-stereotypical but not well-liked, and the audience is heterogeneous and holds strong priors. Specifically, we assess the impact of the Obama exemplar under the less auspicious conditions of the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign. Using panel data, we find that racial prejudice declined during the campaign, especially among Whites with the most exposure to Obama through political television. Liking Obama proved irrelevant to these effects, as did partisanship. Racial prejudice increased slightly after the campaign ended, but the effects remained largely intact weeks later.

T1  - Ingroup and outgroup interconnectedness predict and promote political ideology through empathy: GPIR
AN  - 2323388412
AB  - In 4 studies (N = 886), we investigate the effect of intergroup interconnectedness on political ideology and examine whether this is mediated through empathy. In Study 1, ingroup interconnectedness predicted approval and outgroup interconnectedness disapproval of the Trump administration’s executive order on immigration, and empathy toward immigrants differentially mediated these relationships. In Study 2, ingroup interconnectedness negatively predicted and outgroup interconnectedness positively predicted liberalism, whereas the opposite relationships were found for conservatism. Moreover, outgroup interconnectedness positively predicted liberalism through greater empathy, but negatively predicted conservatism through less empathy. Manipulating outgroup interconnectedness (against a control) increased outgroup empathy and liberalism, decreased conservatism (Study 3a), and increased support for a liberal welfare policy (Study 3b), but these effects on ideology only occurred indirectly through greater outgroup empathy. Overall, results suggest ingroup and outgroup interconnectedness differentially predict and promote political ideology through empathy.

T1  - The Cost of the Veil: Visual Communication Impacts of <i>Hijab</i> on News Judgments
AN  - 2322331449
AB  - Using disposition theory as a framework, this 2 (headscarf vs. no headscarf) by 2 (US citizen vs. refugee) experiment sought to elucidate the impact of visual and verbal cues in mediated messages on conclusions drawn from a television news package about a woman accused of consorting with a known terrorist group in the US, in terms of parochial empathy for and perceived innocence of the woman. Parochial empathy measures the difference between ingroup and outgroup empathy; higher levels indicate ingroup empathy is greater than outgroup empathy, meaning the individual’s empathy is very narrow in scope or “parochial.” Political identity was a measured independent variable. The data supported a model in which political identity was a significant moderator of the headscarf’s effect on parochial empathy, and that parochial empathy mediated the relationship between the manipulated and measured predictor variables on perceived innocence. Details of the relationships among variables are reported and the implications for theory and journalism practice are discussed.

T1  - Does violence beget violence? The role of family ethnic socialization and intergroup bias among youth in a setting of protracted intergroup conflict
AN  - 2264572988
AB  - Does violence beget violence among youth in a setting of protracted conflict? Framed by a developmental intergroup approach, this paper examines the mediating roles of family ethnic socialization and intergroup bias. Two time points from 466 (50% female/50% male, 51% Catholic/49% Protestant) 14- to 16-year-olds in Northern Ireland were analyzed. Bootstrapped chain mediation found that previous experience with sectarianism, or intergroup violence, was positively related to family ethnic socialization, which predicted later intergroup bias, which was related to higher levels of adolescent participation in sectarian antisocial behavior. Findings identify the importance of family processes in the link from experiencing to committing sectarian acts. Implications for preventing youth participation in sectarianism are discussed.

T1  - National identification and support for discriminatory policies: The mediating role of beliefs about <i>laïcité</i> in France
AN  - 2253034273
AB  - In France, laïcité is a legal principle enforcing State secularism. However, research indicates that Modern (vs. traditional) beliefs about laïcité (ML) help legitimate prejudice against minorities. From Social Identity Theory, we hypothesized that ML should be positively linked with national identification, stereotyping, prejudice and support for discrimination. Accordingly, we demonstrate that ML independently predicts support for discriminatory policies (Study 1a, N = 241) and Maghrebi IAT scores (Study 1b, N = 242). ML mediates the link between national identification and Generalized Prejudice (Study 2a, N = 215; Study 2d, N = 114) as well as Support for Discriminatory Policies (Study 2b, N = 250). Experimental corroboration of this mediation was provided (Study 2c, N = 100). An exploratory study showed that priming ML led to more support for discrimination through national identification (Study 3, N = 89). These results reveal the important intergroup regulation feature of ML beliefs in France.

T1  - An Examination of the Effects of Mediated Intragroup and Intergroup Interactions among Latino/a Characters
AN  - 2238261275
AB  - Content analytic work has consistently shown that Latinas are consistently found to be one of the most sexualized social groups in the media. In this study we experimentally examined the implications of exposure to the sexualized depiction of Latinas (among non-Latino viewers), when presented in the media in a within group context (Latina-Latino portrayal) and an intergroup context (Latina-White male portrayal). Findings suggest that when in an intergroup interaction, sexualized Latinas are evaluated more favorably and elicit less negative emotion than sexualized Latinas in an intragroup interaction. Implications are discussed within the context of mediated intergroup contact and intergroup emotion.

T1  - Overpopulation Discourse: Patriarchy, Racism, and the Specter of Ecofascism: PGDT
AN  - 2186585742
AB  - As our current climate crises increase in severity, discussions on solutions have found themselves at the forefront of mainstream media, and talked about by political actors and economic elites. While many of these solutions may seem ethical or even the answer to our ecological problem, we must take a critical look at the root causes in order to understand what actions are necessary. Without this, our discussions fall short, and tend to negatively affect marginalized communities. Family-planning programs aimed at the suppression of certain populations is one example used when discussing how to combat overpopulation in order to alleviate climate change. This superficial, Western, capitalist-driven idea and discussion, laced with sexist and racist undertones, is the discourse we will be analyzing. By employing a critical decolonial and ecofeminist lens, we will critique this discourse, and argue that it’s an all-too-common tool of deflection and scapegoating that white environmentalism employs in order to ignore historic power relations. Further, we will illuminate historical roots and trends around the family-planning movement, such as anti-immigrant sentiment, nationalism, and ecofascism.

T1  - The evolving normative dimensions of ‘riot’: Towards an elaborated social identity explanation
AN  - 2110256581
AB  - The question of how normative form changes during a riot, and thus how collective behaviour spreads to different targets and locations, has been neglected in previous research, despite its theoretical and practical importance. We begin to address this limitation through a detailed analysis of the rioting in the London borough of Haringey in 2011. A triangulated analysis of multiple sources of data (including police reports, media accounts, and videos) finds a pattern of behaviour shifting from collective attacks on police targets to looting. A thematic analysis of 41 interview accounts with participants gathered shortly after the events suggests that a shared anti‐police identity allowed local postcode rivalries to be overcome, forming the basis of empowered action not only against the police but to address more long‐standing grievances and desires. It is argued that collective psychological empowerment operated in a ‘positive feedback loop’, whereby one form of collective self‐objectification (and perceived inability of police to respond) formed the basis of further action. This analysis of the development of new targets in an empowered crowd both confirms and extends the elaborated social identity model as an explanation for conflictual intergroup dynamics.

T1  - The Processes Underlying the Quality of Contact With the Primary Out-Group and In-Group Importance on Support for the Syrian Resettlement in a Post-Accord Context
AN  - 2110458557
AB  - The current sociopolitical climate of Northern Ireland presents an intriguing setting to examine how, following a 30-year period of sectarian violence, individuals in a society of protracted intergroup conflict respond to other victimized groups. Syrian refugees were identified as the novel out-group due to the 2,000 Syrians refugees to be resettled in Northern Ireland through the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme. This article was interested in understanding if the perceptions one has about the primary out-group in Northern Ireland, generalize to a novel out-group entering the setting. It was hypothesized that higher quality of contact with the primary out-group would be positively related to support for Syrian resettlement in Northern Ireland, whereas high in-group importance would be negatively related to this outcome. Moreover, the authors wanted to identify potential mechanisms through which the predictor variables influenced support for the Syrian resettlement. Participants (N = 378; M = 27.40, SD = 11.31 years; 70% female; 58% Catholic, 42% Protestant) were recruited from community groups, local businesses, and universities. The results of the chain mediation models indicated the quality of contact with the primary out-group and in-group importance were related (positively and negatively, respectively) with support for the Syrian resettlement via perspective taking and intergroup attitudes. These findings highlight that interventions to improve intergroup attitudes may facilitate support prior to and during resettlement. Application and relevance to social policies related to refugee resettlement are discussed.

T1  - Where should the birds fly after the last sky? Images and voices of women of the Iraqi diaspora in the United Kingdom
AN  - 2127541316
AB  - This paper tackles the formation of identity of a group of first generation Iraqi women in the diaspora, who went to the northern city of Kingston upon Hull in England, after 2003. The paper, therefore, focuses on three identity categories, viz. religious, cultural, and linguistic to see how the diaspora women negotiate the terms of their subject position as a first generation diaspora group in the United Kingdom, UK. The researcher used ethnography and interviewing in the study. Fifteen Iraqi women were interviewed in order to understand what 'home' means to them. The paper also examined the Iraqi women's understanding of 'citizenship' and the role social media sites had played in creating virtual spaces for them, especially by feeding into their personal and cultural identities in the diaspora. The research is situated within the sphere of feminist political philosophy of diaspora in connection with the women's rights to have identities different from the dominant culture in their host countries. Moreover, the researcher reviews three hypotheses bearing on intercultural relations: the multiculturalism hypothesis, the integration hypothesis, and the contact hypothesis. (Berry, John W. 2013. "Intercultural Relations in Plural Societies: Research Derived from Multiculturalism Policy." Acta De Investtigacion Psicologica 2 (3), 1122-1135) By testing the three intercultural hypotheses against the results of the conducted research, the study concludes that the Iraqi diaspora community is not a homogenous entity as it includes minorities within the minority. Therefore, there needs to be a system that respects diversity, hence the researcher supports the continuation of multiculturalism policy in hope of developing better intercultural relations.

T1  - Do you think like me? Perceived concordance concerning contact and culture maintenance on international students’ intentions for contact with the host-society
AN  - 2069025538
AB  - An experimental study was conducted to analyse if perceived concordance on intergroup contact and culture maintenance might influence the attitudes and behavioural investment of international students toward the majority members. The mediating role of metastereotypes and some intercultural communication factors (self-disclosure, contact avoidance, and certainty) were investigated. The participants were 114 international students in Italy (mean age = 22.83), who were categorized into different levels of concordance with respect to culture maintenance and intercultural contact. Our findings showed that perceived concordance with respect to culture maintenance influenced international students’ desire for contact with majority members. Conflict avoidance mediated the relationship between concordance with respect to culture maintenance and behavioural investment. No other mediational relationships were statistically significant. This research is one of a small number of studies examining how concordance of acculturation preferences can influence the intergroup attitudes and intentions of international students. Specifically, the most positive outcomes were produced when majority members were perceived as sharing ideas concerning culture maintenance with international students. Interventions that aim to improve majority–minority relations should consider not only the preferences of minority members with respect to acculturation, but also the way minority members perceive the expectations of majority members and, more notably, the interplay between preferences and perceptions.

T1  - Victims or Intruders? Framing the Migrant Crisis in Greece and Macedonia
AN  - 2057257455
AB  - Representations of immigrants in media are considered a major factor in shaping immigration attitudes. In the context of the migrant crisis in Europe, we analyze how news content about the migrant crisis is framed by media in Greece and Macedonia, two neighboring countries on the Balkan migrant route. By using framing theory as analytical framework, this study applies Benson's (2013) paradigmatic "security/threat" and "humanitarian/victim" frame dichotomy in migration coverage to the concept of issue framing. The content analysis of six print media outlets in both countries (N = 660) investigates the variety of subframes and framing devices within the scope of the two overarching frames, finding dominant portrayals of refugees as illegal trespassers, potential terrorists and social burdens in both countries. However, positive depictions of migrants are more common in Greece, which we attribute to the absence of ideological consensus and differences between the countries' political and media systems.

T1  - Sex With Neighbors: Canada and Canadians in the U.S. Homophile Press
AN  - 1891114431
AB  - This article examines U.S. homophile magazine contributions from and representations of Canada from 1953 to 1964. Drawing on 240 articles, letters, and other items that were published in ONE, Mattachine Review, and The Ladder, the essay first reviews Canadian-authored materials and then shows that U.S. gay and lesbian movement periodicals depicted Canada as more sexually conservative than the United States in three ways and more sexually liberal in one way. The magazines presented Canada as more sexually conservative in its failure to develop an organized gay and lesbian movement, its policies and practices of sexual censorship, and its opposition to progressive homosexual law reform. They portrayed Canada as more sexually liberal in the ways that its mainstream media covered homosexuality. The essay argues that U.S. homophile representations of Canada participated in the ongoing construction and reconstruction of U.S. nationalism. In demonstrating that the magazines generally represented Canada as more sexually conservative than the United States in the years from 1953 to 1964, the essay also shows that more recent depictions of Canada as more sexually liberal are relatively new.

T1  - Making sense of race/ethnicity and gender in televised football: reception research among British students
AN  - 1875839351
AB  - Most people today watch football by way of the mass media, sites that reproduce and transform ideologies and ideas surrounding racial/ethnic and gender identity. However, still little remains known as to what extent actual football viewers take up or resist these ideas. Drawing on a cultural studies perspective, this study tries to identify the dominant discourses that British television viewers use to assign meaning to race/ethnicity and gender in men's and women's football on television. Eleven focus groups of British students (n = 44) were utilized to explore these discourses. Our findings indicate that viewers from various ethnic backgrounds were largely compliant with the hegemonic media discourses about natural physicality in both gender and race/ethnic comparisons. At the same time, multiple negotiated/oppositional discourses were found in relation to women's football that showed how other social practices contributed to such readings. Limitations and possible areas for future research are discussed.

T1  - Being a desirable migrant: perception and racialisation of Icelandic migrants in Norway
AN  - 1875839325
AB  - In the aftermath of the financial crisis that hit Iceland in October 2008, increased numbers of Icelanders migrated to Norway to seek employment due to difficult economic circumstances in Iceland. Using critical perspectives from postcolonial studies and critical whiteness studies, the paper explores how these Icelandic migrants in Norway make sense of their new position as economic migrants within a global economy characterised by a growing sense of precariousness, while past inequalities and racism continue to matter. We also examine how these migrants are perceived in Norwegian media, and how social discourses of Icelandic migrants reflect larger Norwegian debates on racism, desirability and cultural belonging. Media discourses in Norway and interviews with Icelandic migrants reveal a hierarchy of acceptability of migrants. Icelanders are positioned as highly desirable compared to other migrant groups due to the intersection of perceived racial belonging, nationality and class. Our discussion contributes, furthermore, towards a critical analysis of the category migrant, by exploring how the term immigrant (innvandrer/innflytjandi) is used in narratives of Icelandic migrants in Norway and in Norwegian media discussions, showing the negative and racialised connotations of the term immigrant and how its understanding is linked with vulnerable positions and discrimination.

T1  - The Black Panther Party and the Japanese Press
AN  - 1925230625
AB  - This paper examines representations of the Black Panther Party (BPP) in three of Japan's top-circulating newspapers--Yomiuri Shimbun, Asahi Shimbun, and Mainichi Shimbun--from 1966 to 1979, these years marking the period of greatest BPP activity. The purpose of this analysis is to bring renewed perspective regarding the light in which the BPP was covered by a non-US press, as a step toward further developing scholarship of transnational discourse on black militancy. Through making additions to said scholarship, the author wishes to contribute to the greater aim of reexamining frameworks of representational power, calling into question the lynchpins of this power as they function toward our understanding of blackness and race in an historical context. The paper is divided into two distinct parts. The first part chronicles the trajectory of the Japan and black American relationship. This forms the context for the author's examination of BPP coverage in the aforementioned newspapers.

T1  - The Identification and Definition of the Minority Community as an Ideological Construct: the Case of Slovenians in Italy: Treatises and Documents : Journal of Ethnic Studies
TT  - Opredeljevanje in definicija jezika narodne manjsinske skupnosti kot ideoloski konstrukt: primer Slovencev v Italiji
AN  - 1866457366
AB  - When identifying the language/-s spoken by different members of a community, we first categorise and then further merge it/them into definitions. The author discusses some such definitions often used in discourse on the Slovenian language in Italy. The author gathered and analysed these definitions using the method of critical analysis of media discourse on language. She discusses the material from an epistemological perspective that transcends the linguistics field and reaches to other fields of humanities and social studies. Namely, the social dynamics and cultural paradigms of a language-speaking community are reflected in the perceptions of languages, their practices, and language policies. In this article, the author shows examples of language definitions found in the analysed material and explains when and why these definitions could be problematic.Alternate abstract:Ko ¿elimo opredeliti jezik/-e, ki ga/jih uporabljajo razlicni govorci neke skupnosti, ga/jih po navadi razvrstimo v kategorije, ki jih nadalje strnemo v definicije. V nadaljevanju clanka avtorica obravnava nekatere take definicije, ki se pogosto pojavljajo v diskurzu o slovenskem jeziku v Italiji; definicije so bile zbrane in analizirane s kriticno analizo medijskih diskurzov o jeziku, v tem prispevku pa gradivo obravnava kot epistemolosko vprasanje, ki ne sega samo na podrocje jezikoslovnih ved, ampak tudi na druga podrocja humanistike in druzboslovja. Skozi percepcije jezika terprakse in politike, ki so z jezikom povezane, se namrec odrazajo druzbene dinamike in kulturne paradigme skupnosti govorcev. V clanku avtorica ob primerih definicij jezika, ki jih je zasledila v analiziranem gradivu, pokaze, kdaj in zakaj so lahko te definicije sporne.

T1  - Does family language matter? The role of foreign language use and family social capital in the educational achievement of immigrant students in Germany
AN  - 1827658131
AB  - The role of ethnic resources in the educational success of immigrants is highly disputed. Combining arguments of segmented assimilation and Coleman's concept of family social capital, this study investigates whether speaking one's language of origin at home relates to achievement by facilitating the mobilization of resources or their transmission from parents to children. Mediating and moderating mechanisms are disentangled and empirically questioned in regression models that predict the mathematical competences of immigrant students from Turkey, Poland and the former Soviet Union. Based on data from the German National Educational Panel Study, the results contradict the assumption that foreign language use will contribute to education through mechanisms of social capital. Regardless of parental human capital or the group of origin, the language used at home does not affect the students' learning when German language proficiency is accounted for.

T1  - Risk and resilience in British Muslim communities
AN  - 1827655849
AB  - This article presents findings from a survey of British Muslims communities. It employs the research frameworks of risk, hate crime and grounded theory to examine 'everyday' experiences of victimization and discrimination and the perceived complicity of the British media in creating adverse social conditions for Muslim communities. The article also examines the rather surprising descriptions of agency, personal strength and coping offered by the research participants when discussing their reactions to experiences of hate crime and prejudice. An examination of these reactions was informed by emerging psychological and sociological literatures concerning the concept of resilience.

T1  - Ukrainian and American identities as predictors of marital and parenting attitudes within the acculturating Ukrainian-American community
AN  - 1820665660
AB  - The Ukrainian-American community represents a unique acculturating community with respect to sociohistorical context, as well as specific demographic and cultural characteristics. The Ukrainian immigrant experience reflects the identity formed in relation to its challenges faced during the twentieth century and its complex relationship with the former Soviet Union. The purpose of this study was to examine the process of acculturation within the Ukrainian community in the United States and to examine how acculturation processes are related to attitudes on childrearing and traditional family formation. The participants for this sample included 188 participants drawn from the Ukrainian diaspora in Central New York. Analyses demonstrated the unique influence of religious beliefs and the simultaneous unique influence of both American identity and Ukrainian identity on attitudes towards traditional marriage formation and parenting. American identity was associated with more liberal attitudes towards divorce while both Ukrainian and American identity were associated with childrearing beliefs. Higher Ukrainian identity predicted more traditional parenting beliefs, while higher American identity predicted more progressive (less traditional) parenting beliefs. These results describe the distinctive features of the Ukrainian-American community in the United States that contribute to attitudes regarding marital behaviour as well as parenting beliefs.

T1  - 'I'm not an activist': an exploratory investigation into retired British Paralympic athletes' views on the relationship between the Paralympic games and disability equality in the United Kingdom
AN  - 1848149361
AB  - One claim of the UK Government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport is that the London 2012 Paralympic Games 'improved attitudes to disability and provided new opportunities for disabled people to participate in society'. In addition, the International Paralympic Committee's strategic plan suggests that the Paralympic Games is a vehicle for achieving 'a more equitable society'. The aim of this study was to examine the reflections of a group of retired British Paralympic athletes on the relationship between the Paralympic Games and disability equality in the United Kingdom. Narrative interviews were conducted with five male retired British Paralympians and one female retired British Paralympian who had participated in a total of 22 Summer Paralympic Games events. I will argue that some Paralympic athletes who are not obvious 'activists' can still contribute to equality for disabled people.

T1  - On Are we all postracial yet?
AN  - 1817595756
AB  - If the postracial is a coherent formation, it is produced not by ideological lock-step but by distributed affinities and relations in a transnational space of interconnection and exchange. The neoliberal erasure of ' ... the structural conditions of racial reproduction and racist articulation' (34) and the clouding of the historicity of racisms produces postraciality as 'the illusion that the dream of the nonracial has already been realized' (180). This illusion is familiar in writing on the postracial that focuses on the denial - be it through the averted gaze of 'color-blindness', or the official state prohibition of racism, or the triumphalism of strategic declarations of the 'end of racism' - of enduring racialized inequality. Goldberg's advance is to explore how the illusion has become increasingly weaponized; that far from signalling the end of race, it represents an emergent 'neo-raciality, racism's extension if not resurrection' (24).

T1  - "It is just SICKENING": Emotions and discourse in an anti-immigrant discussion forum
AN  - 1799227603
AB  - Following 9/11, organizations advocating for stricter immigration policy grew across the United States. This study examines the Web site and online discussion forum of Americans for Legal Immigration Political Action Committee (ALIPAC), a group identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as nativist extremist. While forum participants are geographically dispersed, social media provide them a space to interact with like-minded people. Results show that ALIPAC members provide shared accounts that construct positive moral identities. Forum participants promise positive emotions of pride and power for joining the group, despite the perception that outsiders perceive them as racists. Drawing from tenets of patriotism, participants construct virtual identities and reject the racist stigma by turning them on immigrants, civil rights organizations, and politicians. Participants claim their emotional responses are rational and morally superior to those of the perceived opposition. Failing to share their anger, sense of injustice, and disgust is framed as irrational.

T1  - Homophobic Attitudes and Associated Factors Among Adolescents: A Comparison of Six Latin American Countries
AN  - 1812250491
AB  - Homophobic attitudes are still very common in the world, although there are large differences between countries. This study analyzed the responses of almost 30,000 8th- and 9th-grade students from six countries who participated in the Latin American component of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study. Higher levels of homophobia were found in the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, and Paraguay than in Chile, Colombia, and Mexico. Homophobic attitudes were positively associated with being male, having lower levels of empathy, spending less time with friends and the media, having aggressive attitudes, and being more religious, in particular non-Catholic Christian.

T1  - The crisis as an opportunity for change? High-skilled immigration policies across Europe
AN  - 1802902021
AB  - The recent economic crisis provided a shock to the system, and led governments to scramble for solutions to problems of falling economic growth, high unemployment and weak job creation. Many European governments responded to protectionist calls by restricting immigration policies, even towards the highly skilled. Yet countries have faced different challenges and thus the cross-national variation in the demand for policy closure or openness is remarkable. Some seized the opportunity to restrict their high-skilled immigration policies, while others took advantage of the crisis for further liberalisation. The article explores different reasons for this variation, ranging from socio-economic conditions, the inflow of labour migrants to the role of labour market institutions and political actors. Countries badly affected by the crisis and with a recent influx of labour migrants were more likely to respond to mobilised groups lobbying for restrictive policies than those countries weathering the crisis relatively better but suffering from continuing labour shortages. The article examines the changing conditions and the role of mobilised stakeholders to explain policy change in selected European countries. It also presents an updated index on states' openness to high-skilled immigrants to measure change over time. The findings are based on position statements of stakeholders, official documents and media coverage.

T1  - History, Disrupted: The aesthetic gentrification of queer and trans cinema
AN  - 1868510469
AB  - This essay connects Sarah Schulman's discussion of aesthetic gentrification in The Gentrification of the Mind with the concept of disruptive innovation to analyse patterns in recent mainstream film exploring LGBTQ histories. Since the Great Recession, LGBTQ cinema in the Global North has become structured by disruptive narrative strategies that reroute the transformative power of queer and transgender histories upward and away from the most at-risk LGBTQ populations. Films such as Dallas Buyers Club, Stonewall, and The Danish Girl purport to represent 'actual' moments in LGBTQ history, but instead appropriate aesthetic space from communities with little to no cultural representation - HIV positive, working-class, and of colour, queer and trans populations - instead offering that space to symbolic gentrifiers. Cultural erasure of AIDS activism and of trans people's important roles in LGBTQ histories and politics are among the most deleterious shared outcomes of this new wave of cinema. This essay contends that historical disruption and resulting aesthetic gentrification of queer and trans cinema in the Global North has potentially global implications for the future of LGBTQ representation.

T1  - Chinese College Students' Attitudes Toward Homosexuality: Exploring the Effects of Traditional Culture and Modernizing Factors
AN  - 1783663058
AB  - Using survey data of 494 college students from two universities in China, this study explores the effects of traditional culture (filial piety, parental attitudes toward homosexuality, and attitudes toward sexuality) and social changes accompanying modernization (intergroup contact and exposure to homosexuality in the media) on attitudes toward homosexuality as well as gay and lesbian people in China. This study finds that Chinese college students generally hold accepting attitudes toward homosexuality, although the extent of tolerance is limited, and is affected by various factors. Traditional cultural factors predict less tolerance for homosexuality and gay and lesbian people, whereas modernizing factors predict greater tolerance. Although both traditional and modernizing factors shape contemporary attitudes toward homosexuality in Chinese society, modernizing variables seem to have a greater impact. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed.

T1  - Los de Adentro, Los de Afuera: Transnational Cuba, "17-D," and the Cuban-American predicament
AN  - 1776460986
AB  - What started as a dinner table rallying cry became a dream deferred. By the late 1960s, the promise of a “next year in Cuba” had receded for most Cuban exiles into the realm of implausibility. The idea, however, retained a peculiar currency. According to critic Ricardo Ortiz, dominant strains of a burgeoning “Cuban-American” culture became prisoner to “a historical paradigm that both promise[d] return and stave[d] it off by virtue of [a] structural reliance on the indefinite deferral of that return.” Life for many, in other words – in Little Havana, Union City, or New York – revolved around an emotional captivity, an “idealized addiction to [a] redemptive promise” that most exiles in their heart of hearts increasingly knew would never materialize, not in the near future anyway (Ortiz 2007, 134–135). Today, in light of the restoration of diplomatic relations between Washington and Havana, the existential paralysis that once defined the Cuban-American community seems decidedly passé. Long ago it cracked at the seams. For though Miami’s grandest prophecies of anti-communist salvation fell short, since the late 1970s tens of thousands of Cuban émigrés and their descendants have gone back to the island to visit their relatives, albeit initially on short, expensive and controversial package tours. By the 1990s, what scholar Antonio López calls the “Cuban-American return narrative” had acquired the predictable familiarity of a literary trope. Memoir after memoir codified the defining characteristics of the archetypal “returnee”: white, descending from the pre-revolutionary middle and upper classes, liable to find an “Afro-Cuban-occupied” family home (López 2012, 185–212). Now, amidst a flurry of Cuba-related media coverage, fresh or newly replayed stories about “bridges to/from” the island offer human-interest analogues to the budding annals of US–Cuba rapprochement (Pedro Ruiz: Coming Home 2011; Bridges to/from Cuba 2015; Vincent 2015; Oye Cuba! A Journey Home (2015; in production)). A year after the shock of what Cubans have taken to calling “17-D” – 17 December 2014, the date Barack Obama and Raúl Castro first announced their negotiated breakthrough – feel-good tales of family reunions and diasporic collaborations seem to be setting the affective stage for the bigger embrace of US and Miami capital still to come.

T1  - Does assimilation work? Sociocultural determinants of labour market participation of European Muslims
AN  - 1784151480
AB  - Numerous studies have shown that even after controlling for relevant socio-economic background variables, the labour market position of immigrant minorities lags considerably behind that of natives. The label 'ethnic penalties' is often used to denote these gaps and reflects the idea that differences between natives and immigrants that cannot be explained by demographic and human capital variables must be due to discrimination by employers. I challenge this interpretation by looking at the role of sociocultural variables such as language proficiency, interethnic social ties and gender values as alternative sources of unexplained ethnic group differences. I use the data from the cross-national 'Eurislam' survey of four immigrant ethnic groups of predominantly Muslim belief-Turks, Moroccans, former Yugoslav Muslims and Pakistani-as well as native ethnics. The results indicate that once sociocultural variables are taken into account, differences in rates of labour market participation and unemployment between native ethnics and the Muslim groups are strongly reduced and in many cases become statistically insignificant. Using mediation analyses, I demonstrate that the findings do not fit a scenario that assumes that the causality primarily flows from labour market participation to sociocultural assimilation rather than the other way around.

T1  - The 2012 killing of Chinese citizens in Rome and the ambivalence of Italian journalism
AN  - 1784145627
AB  - Sredanovic discusses the killing of a father and daughter of Chinese origin in Rome in January 2012, and the portrayal of the case in Italian print journalism. He uses a qualitative analysis of a corpus of 193 articles from seven Italian newspapers with different political, market and geographic profiles. The frequency of generally negative and stereotypical portraits of migrants in crime news is well known; however, this specific case offers a number of less familiar insights. Sredanovic shows the multiple and changing frames and themes, both positive and negative, deployed to portray the event across the two-week period in which it was featured on the front pages of newspapers. He demonstrates in particular the ways in which stereotypes that are often used against migrants in crime news find place even in a case in which the migrants were the victims of the crime. He further illustrate how the representation of the perpetrators shifted from describing them as an exception (when it was thought they were autochthonous) to generalizing about their deviance when it was discovered that they were of Moroccan origin. Sredanovic locates this discussion in an anti-groupist theoretical frame, arguing that the stereotypes used cannot be adequately explained by majority-minority group interactions, and that the delimitation and definition of groups should be understood as ideological from the start. He also argues that aspects of the production routines of crime journalism can be added to the factors that explain the portrayal of the event. He concludes by arguing that Sinophobia is a form of prejudice that varies geographically and in time, and calling for non-reifying, practice-informed analyses that mix discriminating and non-discriminating discourses.

T1  - Statistical and Perceived Diversity and Their Impacts on Neighborhood Social Cohesion in Germany, France and the Netherlands
AN  - 1758095538
AB  - The question whether ethnic diversity is associated with declining social cohesion has produced much controversy. We maintain that more attention must be paid to cognitive mechanisms to move the debate ahead. Using survey data from 938 localities in Germany, France, and the Netherlands, we explore a crucial individual-level mechanism: perceptions of diversity. We not only consider perceptions of the amount, but also of the qualitative nature of diversity. By asking about various qualitative aspects of diversity, we test the cognitive salience of three explanations that have been proposed in the literature for negative diversity effects: out-group biases, asymmetric preferences and coordination problems. We show that all three mechanisms matter. Perceptions both mediate statistical diversity effects, and have important explanatory power of their own. Moreover, we are able to address the question to what extend the relationship of perceived diversity and neighborhood social cohesion varies across policy contexts. Based on assumptions in the literature about positive impacts of inclusive and culturally pluralist immigrant integration policy approaches, we hypothesize that ethno-cultural diversity is less negatively related to neighborhood social cohesion in more inclusive policy contexts. Our results provide partial support for this hypothesis as perceived diversity has a significantly stronger negative impact on neighborhood cohesion in Germany.

T1  - Homosexuality and the Law: The Construction of Wolfenden Homonormativity in 1950s England
AN  - 1754143247
AB  - This article analyses a television broadcast in England in 1957 in response to the Wolfenden Report (Wolfenden, 1957) into homosexuality and prostitution. Here I argue that those participants in the broadcast who are sympathetic with liberal reforms of the legislation on homosexuality utilize discourses related to normality and the public/private domains to discursively construct the Wolfenden homonormative male. In addition, I also show how, particularly through the trope of homonormativity, both the heterosexual and homosexual audiences are interpellated by the discourses exploited within the broadcast as publics whose subjectivities are reconfigured toward Wolfenden homonormativity.

T1  - Self-expansion motivation improves cross-group interactions and enhances self-growth: GPIR
AN  - 1752001233
AB  - Rather than seeing outgroup members as targets of fear, conflict, or even tolerance, the self-expansion model proposes that outgroup members might be seen as attractive opportunities for self-growth. The current study utilizes an experimental manipulation to raise (or lower) self-expansion motivation prior to a positive interaction with a stranger from a different ethnic group. The results show that priming high self-expansion motivation leads to higher quality interactions, greater interpersonal closeness, greater feelings of self-growth, and higher feelings of self-efficacy. In addition, these outcomes show patterns of mediation consistent with the predictions of self-expansion theory. These findings point to a potentially valuable tool for improving the quality of cross-group contact experiences. More broadly, they focus attention on the genuinely positive functions that relationships with outgroup members can have for the self. [web URL: http://gpi.sagepub.com/content/19/1/60.abstract]

T1  - Migration and Ethnicity in Coalfield History: Global Perspectives
AN  - 1744618395
AB  - This article provides a general background to the case studies in this Special Issue by highlighting some general themes in the history of migration to coalfields worldwide. All over the world, mining companies have struggled with labour shortages and had to find ways to recruit sufficient numbers of mineworkers. The solutions adopted ranged from the involvement of part-time peasant miners, organized mediation by labour contractors, and systems of forced labour, to state regulation of national and international migration. The importance of these kinds of "intervening institution" in mobilizing labour for the coalmines is illustrated by examples from different parts of the world. Efforts to find new workers for the mines often resulted in the recruitment of ethnic groups of a lower social status, not only because they were rural and unskilled, but also because they were considered inferior from a cultural or ethnic viewpoint. In this respect there was a huge difference from the migration and settlement of skilled miners, like those from Britain and other countries. Ethnic differences were often closely related to differences in skill and social status. Although there are many instances of inter-ethnic solidarity and cooperation, depending on the time-frame and circumstances, these differences could have a profound effect on social relations in mining communities.

T1  - Towards a multi-ethnic public sphere? African-Australian media and minority-majority relations
AN  - 1732943611
AB  - The potential connections between minority ethnic media producers and the majority ethnic group in multicultural societies have received little academic attention. As a result, important questions regarding the role of ethnic minority media beyond their specialised audiences have remained largely unanswered. In this article, we draw upon a series of interviews with African-Australian media producers in Melbourne and interrogate the relationship between ethnic minority media and the broader Australian public sphere. Drawing on Husband's notion of the multi-ethnic public sphere as an ideal-type model, we analyse the explicit and implicit attempts by African-Australian broadcasters and media producers to communicate across communities and to positively impact the practices and understandings of White Australian journalists and audiences.

T1  - Manufacturing Naxi's original ecological culture in contemporary China
AN  - 1784139934
AB  - (ProQuest: ... denotes non-USASCII text omitted)
For over a decade, original ecological (yuanshengtai[...]) has contested ethnic (minzu) as an influential framework in representing minority folk culture in Chinese official and popular media. This article explores the ideological implications of such a shift in the context of state-minority relationships. By examining Han elites' invention of the neologism and Naxi elites' adaptations, I argue that YST transforms local ethnic categories into a transethnic, translocal, and transnational concept, and therefore allows both the nation state and the minority groups to promote their own versions of ethnic identities. Compared to the antagonistic model between state domination and minority resistance, YST reflects a shift from minority political self-determination to cultural self-representation in the drastically changing global environments.

T1  - Mentoring and Mothering Black Femininity in the Academy: An Exploration of Body, Voice and Image through Black Female Characters
AN  - 1767324905; 201605997
AB  - This paper examines the ways in which body, voice, and image are portrayed in contemporary media productions that persist in creating negative identity constructs for Black women. Much of what is consumed by mainstream culture is a skewed, caricatured perception of Black women created by those outside of their demographic. More recent and limited works by and about Black women attempt to dismantle this phenomenon and are moving in the right direction by offering images of empowerment; however these presentations of the Black female experience are still distorted and conventionalized. This essay encourages additional portrayals that affirm and explore a wider array of Black female experiences. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Balkan Immigrant Workers as Slovenian Victimized Heroes
AN  - 1761674740; 201602253
AB  - This article sheds light on recent discursive shifts in representations of the 'Balkan' in the Slovenian press. I focus on the strategies that the media, and the left-wing press in particular, uses to construct the identities of immigrant workers in Slovenia. I use critical discourse analysis to show how the media has recently attempted to avoid Balkanism and tried to create a more inclusive, democratic rhetoric on these workers and how they become a legitimate 'other' in Slovenian society only when constructed as helpless victims. I analyze the role of the victim in the Slovenian imaginary, its disillusioned hero a cogent signifier for collective national identification, and how this figure's characteristics are transposed to ex-Yugoslav immigrants to Slovenia, placing them within a rhetoric of victimization that is framed within a broader humanitarian discourse in order to interrogate what Maria Todorova has defined as Balkanism. I conclude by exploring victimization as the process of desubjectivation and point out aspects of victimization that reaffirm long-standing power relations between Europe and the Balkans.

T1  - Understanding the Selection Bias: Social Network Processes and the Effect of Prejudice on the Avoidance of Outgroup Friends
AN  - 1690246025
AB  - Research has found that prejudiced people avoid friendships with members of ethnic outgroups. Results of this study suggest that this effect is mediated by a social network process. Longitudinal network analysis of a three-wave panel study of 12- to 13-year-olds (N = 453) found that more prejudiced majority group members formed fewer intergroup friendships than less prejudiced majority group members. This was caused indirectly by the preference to become friends of one's friends' friends (triadic closure). More prejudiced majority members did not have a preference for actively avoiding minority group members. Rather, they had the tendency to avoid friends who already had minority group friends and thus could not be introduced to potential minority group friends. Instead they became friends with the majority group friends of their friends. This research shows how a social networks perspective can further our understanding of the processes underlying intergroup contact.

T1  - Collectivistic Orientation, Acculturative Stress, Cultural Self-Efficacy, and Depression: A Longitudinal Study Among Chinese Internal Migrants
AN  - 1680155045; 201513934
AB  - The current study examined the longitudinal relationship of collectivistic orientation and depression and the mediating effects of acculturative stress and cultural self-efficacy between collectivistic orientation and depression. We expect that collectivistic orientation would decrease acculturative stress and increase cultural self-efficacy, and in turn, improve depression. Using data from 641 Chinese internal migrants during a 1-year period, the results supported the hypothesis that collectivistic orientation predicted decreased depression. Moreover, collectivistic orientation alleviated depression through reducing acculturative stress. Although cultural self-efficacy was also a significant mediator, collectivistic orientation relieved depression through decreasing cultural self-efficacy. Implications for future research directions and counseling are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Friendships and outgroup attitudes among ethnic minority youth: The mediating role of ethnic and host society identification
AN  - 1735657216; 201537003
AB  - This study investigates among ethnic minority adolescents how friendships with ethnic minority and majority group peers are related to their attitudes towards the majority outgroup. Friendships with majority group peers are proposed to be indirectly related to outgroup attitudes through host society identification. Friendships with ethnic ingroup peers are proposed to be indirectly related to outgroup attitudes through ethnic ingroup identification. Hypotheses were tested longitudinally among ethnic minority adolescents (n = 244) who recently entered middle schools in the Netherlands. Lagged structural equation models showed that friendships with majority group peers were related to stronger identification with the host society which was in turn related to improved attitudes toward the majority outgroup. Ingroup friendships and ingroup identification was not related to outgroup attitudes. Additional analyses indicated that the relation between host society identification and majority group friendships was bidirectional. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Imperial Whiteness and the Diasporas of Empire
AN  - 1761679816; 201602223
AB  - Every US-led imperial war in the Arab region extends itself into the lives of Arab diasporas in the United States. The period directly after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, when the United States consolidated its relationship with Israel, entailed the first significant institutionalized attacks against Arab activists in the United States.1 As Arab American studies has shown, many Arab Americans tended to enjoy a 'proximity to whiteness.'2 Yet the aftermath of 1967 set off a conflation between Arabness (and Arab anti-imperialist activism) with the racialized figure, Arab/Middle Eastern/Muslim enemy of the nation within US corporate media and government rhetoric.3 Indeed, Arab American racial formations have depended on shifting US imperialist agendas. The 1990s Gulf War marked one of the most widespread periods of anti-Arab/anti-Muslim violence in the United States up until that period-from fires that destroyed Arab American businesses to public beatings, hate crimes, firebomb attacks, bomb threats, and vandalism-contributing to increased representations and treatment of Arab Americans as different from and inferior to persons perceived to be whites.4 An Arab American woman whom I conducted research with in 2000 who was in high school during this period recalled her teacher asking her to raise her hand.

T1  - Acculturation is a two-way street: Majority-minority perspectives of outgroup acculturation preferences and the mediating role of multiculturalism and threat
AN  - 1767328952; 201606269
AB  - A 2 OE 2 experimental design investigated the effects of perceived outgroup acculturation preferences on intergroup outcomes for both the Hispanic-minority (N = 50) and European-American-majority (N = 163) in California, USA. Participants read fabricated interviews which manipulated outgroup acculturation preferences for contact (high vs. low) and culture maintenance (high vs. low). For majority participants: Hispanics' desire for contact strongly predicted positive intergroup emotions and low prejudice; desire for culture maintenance only impacted emotions. These acculturation dimensions interacted, revealing the most favorable intergroup outcomes for the high contact, high culture maintenance condition (integration). Support for multiculturalism, along with realistic threat, mediated these effects. Minority responses differed: for Hispanics, perceived European-Americans' acculturation preferences did not impact intergroup emotions or prejudice, but their support for multiculturalism did suppress the interaction of acculturation dimensions on intergroup emotions. The acculturation attitude that exemplified American support for multiculturalism differed for majority and minority participants (integration and separation, respectively). Further majority-minority discrepancies were found with a newly developed measure of behavioral investment in acculturation. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

AN  - 1692287336; 201521342
AB  - This essay examines the little explored relationship between communication and Jewish identity, using communication as a means through which to open a discussion on the state of American Jewish identity in the twenty-first century. Focusing in particular on the topics of conversational style and gesture, this paper draws both on historical studies of Jewish behaviour and a contemporary analysis of the television sitcom Curb Your Enthusiasm to determine the extent to which identifiably Jewish behaviours continue to be seen in the United States, before seeking to explore the impact of these behaviours on shaping, maintaining and reinforcing American Jewish identity.

T1  - 'She Is Not Acting, She Is': The conflict between gender and racial realness on RuPaul's Drag Race
AN  - 1660022561; 201505794
AB  - This essay examines the popular television show RuPaul's Drag Race to reveal the ways drag performance provides an ambivalent, contradictory space for wrestling with contentious issues surrounding cultural identity and authenticity in reality TV. Focusing on the show's controversial season three, the authors demonstrate how drag queens subvert and play with ideas of gender 'realness' but find an impasse in open discussions of race. The racial minstrelsy of some contestants we observe created antagonisms between black/brown characters and their white/Asian counterparts, exposing a rift in ideas about racial play despite the general acceptance of flexibility in gender bending. Recognizing that reality TV exploits and uncovers these tensions, we demonstrate that while drag performance enacts a subversive mode of queer performance, it provides a contested site and complex semiotic space for dealing with sensitive matters of race/ethnicity, especially when certain forms of stereotyping are rewarded over others.

T1  - Demonising 'the other': British Government complicity in the exploitation, social exclusion and vilification of new migrant workers
AN  - 1660023946; 201505831
AB  - This article demonstrates the close and complex connection between the demonisation, exploitation and exclusion of new migrant workers. In so doing, it testifies to the blurred boundaries between the categories of severe labour exploitation, forced labour and slavery. This study highlights the absence of citizenship rights as crucial to understanding the vulnerability to demonisation, exploitation and exclusion that characterises the embodied experience of such workers. It also highlights the key role of citizenship as a means for such workers to make rights claims. In the UK, new migrant workers, particularly those arriving from Eastern Europe since 2004, have been increasingly designated by government and media as interlopers in a tight labour marketplace. Whilst their collective economic contribution is sometimes welcomed, they are regarded as 'external' to UK society and citizenship, a potential threat to indigenous values and culture, and in competition with British workers. Rarely are migrants afforded the space in public and private spheres to express their individual needs, wants, cares or perspectives. UK migrants have variously been portrayed by the tabloid media and irresponsible politicians as rapacious opportunists, as benefit scroungers, criminals and potential terrorists. The predominant discourse around new migrant workers in the UK is that they are not citizens, but temporary residents who are expected to work industriously and to remain otherwise unseen and unheard until they return to their country of origin. No further contribution to social and political life is required or expected. It is within such an unsupportive environment that new migrant workers in general, and undocumented migrants in particular, have become highly susceptible to employer and gangmaster abuse and exploitation.

AB  - Relatively little research has investigated the association of information sources and the stereotyping of homosexuals in other cultures. This study is a survey of 226 Chinese college students about their stereotypes of homosexuals and their sources of information on gays and lesbians. The stereotyping of homosexuals is predicted by the size of community, interest in knowing homosexuals, and in-person contacts. A higher level of negative stereotypes is associated with frequent usage of Chinese media. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Boundaries crossing and blurring: The case of Tali Fahima
AN  - 1531934592; 201423376
AB  - This article applies the case of Tali Fahima, an Israeli woman who was convicted of aiding the enemy during wartime, in order to analyse how the ethno-national community is threatened by members it fails to control and fit into existing categories. The author argues that what makes an assumingly bright boundary so sensitive and problematic to cross is not its impenetrability but its actual vulnerability. The state tries to police uncertain citizens and if necessary to expunge them from the collective in order to imagine the boundaries as bright again. The author examines how Fahima used her privileged body to protect a Palestinian insurgent and the ways in which her body is invested with the meanings of national, ethnic and sexual boundaries and analyses how the Israeli security services, courts, media and public define proper citizenship and belonging.

T1  - Social support as a mediator of religious involvement and physical and emotional functioning in a national sample of African-Americans
AN  - 1541997840; 201426892
AB  - Researchers propose social support as one of the factors that may explain the positive relationship often observed between religious involvement and health outcomes. African-Americans are a population that tends to have higher than average levels of religious involvement and are also disproportionately impacted by most health conditions. The present study sought to determine whether social support mediates the role of religious involvement in physical and emotional functioning and depressive symptoms, among a national probability sample of African-Americans (N = 803). Study participants completed telephone interviews. We used structural equation modelling to test hypotheses based on the theoretical model. Findings suggest evidence for a mediating role of belonging and tangible support in the association between religious behaviours and physical functioning as well as depression. There was no mediational role played by appraisal support, or for emotional functioning. Implications for faith-based health promotion interventions are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnic Diversity within Australian Homes: Has Television Caught up to Social Reality?
AN  - 1531932548; 201423307
AB  - Inter-ethnic intimacy is on the rise in Australia, bringing an unprecedented level of ethnic diversity into our homes. Yet analyses of media representations of ethnic diversity have concentrated on the community level, neglecting the intimate sphere of family life. This paper explores the possibilities and limits of love within and across ethnic boundaries on fictional Australian television programmes. The results of a nine-week content analysis reveal a mixed picture. Inter-ethnic intimacy was regularly portrayed; but committed, long-term relationships across ethnic boundaries (marriage and co-habitation) were scarce. And although Australian television producers did not shy away from portraying physical intimacy across ethnic boundaries, emotional intimacy was often absent. Overt stereotyping of ethnic minority characters involved in inter-ethnic relationships was rare -- instead, ethnic differences were downplayed or erased. Storylines were underpinned by the assimilation of inter-ethnic couples -- in all their diversity -- into the (white) mainstream. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Community and the Politics of Memory
AN  - 1750223842
AB  - This essay reflects on the "politics of memory" essential to the construction of a national community in relation to Jacques Derrida's conception of the archive. To do so, it focuses precisely on two films by the Franco-Algerian director Rachid Bouchareb (.Indigènes [Days of Glory], 2006, and Hors la loi [Outside the Law], 2010). These two fictional narratives try to draw a history of the origins of the Maghrebi community in France, opposing the usual French account of the same history. It will be posited here that Bouchareb's films place us, as spectators, in "a spectral moment, a moment that no longer belongs to time" (Derrida Specters xx). Moreover, meaningful spectral effects are provoked by the fact that Bouchareb chooses not only to create a historical reconstruction of the past, he also frames these films in two stereotyped genres while using the same actors to represent different characters in different historical periods.

T1  - 'Reel love' across ethnic boundaries? The extent and significance of inter-ethnic intimacy in Australian cinema
AN  - 1520342843; 201413204
AB  - National cinemas play an important role in the construction of national identities, representing the 'self' to both domestic and international audiences. Evidence of the material impacts of media representations on individuals and society, and the pervasiveness of movie-watching as a cultural activity, underscore the importance of scholarly inquiry into film. Here, we are concerned with how ethnic diversity has been negotiated within the Australian national cinema -- specifically at the scale of intimate interpersonal relationships. Our analysis of twenty-five recent Australian films considers how cinema alerts audiences to the possibilities and limitations of love within and across ethnic boundaries. We find cause for modest optimism in regard to the frequency of Australian cinematic representations of inter-ethnic intimacy, although the narrow range of ethnic groups permitted to participate in these encounters, and an apparent reticence to portray marriage, co-habitation and child-bearing across ethnic boundaries, remain cause for concern.

T1  - Intergroup retaliation and intra-group praise gain: The effect of expected cooperation from the in-group on intergroup vicarious retribution
AN  - 1504421878; 201405376
AB  - Intergroup vicarious retribution is the phenomenon whereby, after an out-group member attacks an in-group member, a member of the victim's group retaliates against a member of the perpetrator's group. This study examined the effect of expected cooperation from the in-group on intergroup vicarious retribution through intra-group reputation based on praise gain and exclusion avoidance. In the experiment, we conducted a one-on-one match in which, after participants learned that an out-group member (as the winner) had imposed a fine on an in-group member (as the loser) in a previous round, winning participants were allowed to impose an arbitrary fine on the other losing out-group member. As a result, participants imposed a larger fine on their out-group member opponent in retaliation when they were expected by in-group members to cooperate than when such cooperation was not expected. Furthermore, participants regarded a fine as intra-group cooperation. Since a path analysis revealed a mediating effect of praise gain, but no mediating effect of exclusion avoidance, expected cooperation from in-group members facilitated vicarious retribution because those involved in retribution sought praise from other in-group members. These findings suggest that the intra-group reputation dynamics of expected cooperation and praise gain escalate intergroup conflict. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Correlates and Predictors of Black Women's Physical Activity: Afrocentric Insights
AN  - 1550999690; 201428885
AB  - The health benefits of physical activity have long been well documented. However, standing at the crossroads of gender, race, and physical inactivity are Black women. Consequently, Black women tend to have higher health maladies than Black males, Caucasian women, and other Women of Color. As such, this investigation sought to examine the behavioral correlates and predictors of a case selection of Black women's (N = 123) physical activity, noting the impact of race. The analyses revealed that: (a) the women were moderately physically active, (b) their physical activity was positively correlated with their sport media behaviors, and (c) psychological stimulation, educational attainment, and racial identification were positive predictors of their participation in physical activity. A noteworthy contribution of this exploratory investigation was the finding of an operative and influential 'raced/Black psyche' and the illumination of the corresponding Afrocentric insights yielded.

T1  - Fixing Gwen: News and the mediation of (trans)gender challenges
AN  - 1531931362; 201423230
AB  - In this project I present a case study of (trans)gender mediation -- a discourse analysis of news around the murder of Gwen Araujo, a 'transgender teen,' in Newark, California, 2002-2006-and I read that discourse in the context of larger contemporary cultural dynamics and movements around trans and genderqueer politics. News narratives around the Araujo case had some progressive implications, as residual marginalization tropes for gender nonconforming identities were sidelined and a hate crime frame was constructed in news for the murder. However, the discourse also manifested a persistent tendency to contain and restrict gender meanings and to recuperate critical gender challenges back into conventional binary categories. I identify and discuss some of the gender 'fixing' strategies mobilized in this discourse, including the mobilization of 'wrong body discourse' as an overarching (and problematic) explanation for gender nonconformity. Like Matt Shepard's murder a few years before, the Araujo case represents a critical discourse moment in genderqueer media politics, illuminating, in microcosm, some critical dynamics in the mediation of (trans)gender politics more generally.

AB  - When young adults are questioned about where they gain their knowledge of HIV, overwhelmingly popular media (including television) is reported. Thus, the goal of this article is to question how media is used to educate and influence young people's present perceptions of HIV/AIDS. Narrative analysis of popular prime time shows was used focusing on the story lines and characters used to introduce the topic, as well as the myths and facts about HIV. Results presented provide researchers a clearer insight to how popular shows discuss HIV/AIDS while also highlighting the ways Social Cognitive Theory can still be utilized.

T1  - Breaking the in-group out-group: shifting boundaries in transnational partner choice processes of individuals of Moroccan, Tunisian, Algerian, Turkish, Punjabi Sikh, Pakistani and Albanian descent in Belgium
AN  - 1463011385; 201345765
AB  - The ongoing popularity in some second and third generation migrants in Western Europe of marrying a partner from the countries of origin of their (grand)parents is considered to be problematic for micro and macro level societal integration of some migrant populations. Partner choice and marriage practices in migrant communities are problematized in public, media and political discourses by discriminating them from marriage practices in the 'native' population on the basis of three related dichotomies: (1) agency versus structure, (2) us versus them and (3) romantic versus instrumental marriage intentions dichotomies. By means of in-depth qualitative research methodologies on the partner choice processes of women and men of Turkish, Moroccan, Algerian, Tunisian, Punjabi Sikh, Pakistani and Albanian descent in Belgium and an intersectional theoretical approach, this article aims to deconstruct popular and simplifying dichotomous representations of partner choice processes in these migrant populations. Our study reveals how religious, gender and social class boundaries are stretched to meet personal/individual desires and preferences. Individuals do experience social restrictions when it concerns social group boundaries and the potential partners that they can look for. At the same time individuals are never fully determined by their social environment, they creatively develop strategies to by-pass certain restrictions and to some extent are able to meet their personal needs while being sensitive to the desires of their social environment.

AB  - In this article, historical womanist theory, which situates Black women as a unique racialized and gendered laboring class in the United States, is empirically validated through testing of several key fundamental assumptions of the theory. This research identifies ways in which images of Black women's reproduction and parenting are manipulated in order to justify ongoing regulation and dominance of Black labor: biological, reproductive, and productive through an analysis of popular film and policies that disproportionately impact Black women in the United States.

T1  - Geography Written in Lightning: Race, Sexuality, and Regulatory Aesthetics in The Birth of a Nation
AN  - 1429630177; 201337385
AB  - D. W. Griffith's racist masterpiece, The Birth of a Nation (1915), offers a potent imaginative geography of race, sexuality, and political agency that resonates nearly a century after its production. Prior to national release, the film was reviewed and approved by the National Board of Censorship, but on protest by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Board reviewed its decision and mandated changes. The archival traces of this moment are read through the concept of a "regulatory aesthetic," which enables a fuller consideration of the aesthetic effects, both representational and affective, of regulatory, governmental, and political projects such as the production and regulatory reception of Birth and the geographies they produce. Through this lens, a reading of the National Board's changes to the film in tandem with the film itself shows that white agency was fractured by region, with the northern reformers staffing the Board claiming racial innocence to resist film director and southerner D. W. Griffith's incitement to historical complicity with racism and to bolster its claim to be a nationally representative yet "disinterested" regulatory body. Simultaneously the Board sought to marginalize African American agency, specifically the protests of the NAACP, through a combination of attenuating the affective links between black characters and white spectators and acquiescing to the film's multiscalar geographies of exclusion from political space. This reading of the National Board's regulatory aesthetic underscores how cultural productions have material, political effects on and off the screen. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The changing public face of Muslim associations in Britain: Coming together for common 'social' goals
AN  - 1448996343; 201342796
AB  - This article examines the Muslim organizational field in Britain based on interviews with activists. It applies a political opportunity perspective to address the degree to which organizations' aims and activities have been shaped by the contextual factors confronting them, or more independently, by 'bottom-up' beliefs and commitments drawn from their relationships to the community. Specifically, the empirical part examines, first, how activists perceive media representation as an opportunity or constraint, and second, how their organizations have constructed collective identities in order to advance their aims within the UK context. Generally, we find that organizations have come together using under a broad ascriptive 'Muslim' label that works across denominational, national and ethnic differences. Not only is this orientation a direct response to the pressures of community cohesion policies and discourses but it also has a strong independent and faith-based component in serving the community and its social needs. The resultant Muslim organizational field is strongly acculturative to UK society, but remains critically independent of governing authorities. Finally, organizations have responded to what they see as poor media representation of Muslims by proactively engaging in media work.

T1  - Craigslist Exposed: The Internet-Mediated Hookup
AN  - 1417522135; 201332047
AB  - This research examines how people advertise themselves on Craigslist. The authors develop a framework that highlights 13 resources that heterosexual and homosexual men and women offer in Craigslist advertisements. The results reveal that many heterosexual advertisers offer and seek similar resources on Craigslist, whereas gay men primarily use Craigslist to seek and offer sex. About one-fourth of homosexual advertisers are in committed relationships. The authors build on this finding by exploring the extent to which married men use Craigslist for "hookups." The authors show the extent to which married men solicit responses to 6 different advertisements for sexual encounters that range from safe to high risk. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "One Time for My Girls": African-American Girlhood, Empowerment, and Popular Visual Culture
AN  - 1417526764; 201331983
AB  - In this essay I examine how popular/public culture depicts African-American girlhood and adolescence. Primarily using a hip hop generation feminist theoretical framework, I discuss both the limitations and progressive possibilities of popular visual culture in representing African-American girlhood and adolescence. The essay moves from a discussion of a video that highlights the disempowering possibilities of mass, digital, and social media for black girls and adolescents to a discussion of two videos propelled by a black girl-centered discourse of empowerment. Each of the videos discussed offers insight into the lived experiences of African-American girls from historical, aesthetic, and expressive perspectives. I use visual media text analysis, hip hop generation feminist theory, and social and cultural theory to discuss how these videos contribute to the formation of a contemporary discourse of empowerment for black girls and adolescents. Ultimately, I assert the importance of popular/public culture for empowering black girls and adolescents, while acknowledging extant limitations and obstacles in mass, digital, and social media.

T1  - Commercially arranged marriage and the negotiation of citizenship rights among Vietnamese marriage migrants in multiracial Singapore
AN  - 1347785527; 201318970
AB  - Globalization and increased mobilities have multiplied cross-border transactions not only in the economic sphere but have also a major impact on human relationships of intimacy. This can be seen in the increased volume of differently mediated forms of international marriage, not just straddling 'east' and 'west', but within Asia and across different ethnicities and nationalities. International marriage raises a host of social issues for countries of origin and destination, including challenges relating to the citizenship status and rights of the marriage migrant. This paper examines the negotiation of citizenship rights in the case of commercially matched marriage migrants -- namely Vietnamese women who marry Singaporean men and migrate to Singapore as 'foreign brides'. While they are folded into the 'family' -- what is often thought of as the basic building block of the nation in Asian societies -- they are not necessarily accorded full incorporation into the 'nation' despite Singapore's claims to multiculturalism. This is particularly salient at a point when cross-nationality, cross-ethnicity marriages between Singapore citizens and non-citizens are on the increase, accounting for over a third of marriages registered in Singapore in recent years. Vietnamese women who marry Singaporeans are positioned within the nation-state's citizenship regime as dependents of Singaporean men, having to rely on the legitimacy of the marriage relationship as well as the whims of their husbands in negotiating their rights vis-a-vis the Singapore state. Drawing on interviews and ethnographic work with 20 Vietnamese women who are commercially matched marriage migrants, the paper first focuses on the vulnerable positions these women find themselves, particularly given difficulties in forging their own support networks as well as weaknesses of the civil society sector in what has been called an 'illiberal democracy' characterized by a political culture of 'non-resistance'. The paper then goes on to examine the way they negotiate rights to residency/citizenship, work and children within webs of asymmetrical power relations within the family and the nation-state. We draw on our findings to show that citizenship is 'a terrain of struggle' within a multicultural nation-state shaped by social ideologies of gender, race and class and negotiated on an everyday basis within spheres of family intimacy.

T1  - The President's Pleasant Surprise: How LGBT Advocates Ended Don't Ask, Don't Tell
AN  - 1567046914; 201435116
AB  - This study assesses the role of LGBT advocates in repealing the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy in the U.S. Congress. It draws on the author's direct involvement with that effort as well as personal interviews and media evidence to consider the contributions of the Obama Administration, members of Congress, the media, and individuals and pressure groups in the repeal process. It argues that repeal succeeded not because of the effective implementation of a White House plan but because the pressure of LGBT advocates ultimately shattered several key obstacles including inadequate messaging and dysfunction and inertia among both politicians and interest groups in Washington. The article offers insight into the role of public pressure in forwarding social change. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Avatars of Whiteness: Racial Expression in Video Game Characters
AN  - 1347782894; 201318715
AB  - Video games are an enormous segment of popular media today, comparable to television and movies. Moreover, video games represent a new form of media distinguished from previous forms due to the interactive element, where game players have the ability to change and influence the game world. This paper contributes to the study of race and popular media by examining how race is presented in role-playing video games through the feature of avatar creation. Capabilities for avatar creation are analyzed in over sixty massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) in service as of early 2010 and twenty offline role-playing games (RPGs) published over the past 10 years. The analysis shows that the vast majority of games, both online and offline, do not allow for the creation of avatars with a non-white racial appearance. Forcing an Anglo appearance on avatars that purport to represent the player has the potential to reinforce a sense of normative whiteness as well as shape the social composition of online worlds into all-white virtual spaces, contributing to the creation of a virtual "white habitus.".

T1  - TRANS-KIN UNDOING AND REDOING GENDER: NEGOTIATING RELATIONAL IDENTITY AMONG FRIENDS AND FAMILY OF TRANSGENDER PERSONS
AN  - 1504422946; 201405552
AB  - The experiences of transgender persons have gained increased attention in academic discourse; however, few studies address how significant others, family members, friends, and allies (SOFFAs) process the transition of a loved one. This study seeks to fill this gap with research based on 133 observational hours and fifty interviews. Focusing on three relational identity themes -- sexual orientation, social role, and religious identity -- the findings suggest that SOFFAs use various intentional and unintentional strategies to negotiate relational identities. Furthermore, reflected appraisals and social stigma mediate the ability of SOFFAS to 'undo' and 'redo' gender when negotiating their relational identities. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Homonegative Microaggressions and Identity in Bisexual Men and Women
AN  - 1322724040; 201310836
AB  - Homonegative microaggressions are small verbal, behavioral, or environmental slights, intentional or unintentional, that communicate hostile or derogatory messages toward sexual minorities. This is an exploratory attempt to investigate how bisexual men and women experience these microaggressions, compared to gay men and lesbians. Bisexual men and women were found to experience the microaggression Alien in Own Land and report more identity confusion than gay men or lesbians. Using a hierarchy of four linear regression models, experience of the microaggression Alien in Own Land was found to mediate the relationship between a bisexual orientation and feelings of identity confusion. These results have implications for future research and for clinicians with bisexual clients. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Structuring Migrants' Political Activities on the Internet: A Two-Dimensional Approach
AN  - 1347781020; 201318786
AB  - The Internet has become a central provider of information and means of communication and participation for people around the world. This is especially the case for migrants, as their spheres of interest and their social networks often span large geographical distances. This paper focuses on one specific domain of migrant activity on the Internet-the political arena-which has gained only marginal attention in migration and media studies to date. Thereby I conceptualise the political sphere of migrants as spanning both the country of origin and that of residence and also online and offline forms of political activity. Using data collected from onsite surveys, I analyse first- and second-generation migrants' political activities on- and offline and test how these patterns vary depending on migrants' primary interest in either their country of origin or of residence. My models show that the existence of social networks online, as well as political communication and participation offline, are the best predictors of online activity.

T1  - Culturally unconscious: Intercultural implications of The New York Times representation of the Israel-Palestine conflict in 2009 and 2011
AN  - 1283639985; 201304345
AB  - In this article, the author critically examines The New York Times (NYT) representation of the Israel-Palestine conflict in the recent political contexts presented by US President Obama's Cairo speech in 2009 and leader of West Bank, President Mahmoud Abbas's, imminent claim to nationhood at the UN in 2011. The purpose of the case study is to establish a theoretical framework for the connection between media representation of conflicts and influence on intercultural communication and relations between various cultural groups. The analysis of the editorials, op-eds, and letters to the editor reveals that media representation of conflicts has deep implications for intercultural communication and relations, that representational politics allows for overrepresentation of dominant groups in the Israel-Palestine conflict context, that discursive use of conflict terms like 'peace,' 'victim,' etc., constructs particular identities that privilege dominant groups, and that there is unconscious projection of cultural expectations of the dominant groups in the discursive representation of the conflict.

T1  - Come get these memories: gender, history and racial uplift in Bill Condon's Dreamgirls
AN  - 1792349945
AB  - On the release of the screen adaptation of Dreamgirls (2006), ex-Motown songwriter William 'Smokey' Robinson fielded speculations about corruption at America's most successful black-owned business. In the broader context of racial inequalities in media ownership and distribution, this article asks how spectacles of hard-won individual success, juxtaposed sharply against sexually and financially corrupt 'music moguls', continue to shape popular mythologies of the US music industry. In particular, the article focuses on the ways that sexual combat, corrupt masculinities and the politics of respectability inform Dreamgirls' dramatization of the shift from pre-integration to post-Civil Rights America. Finally, the notion of post-racial discourse is used to make sense of the competing historical interpretations at work in the film and its critical reception, especially with regard to the use of past entertainment icons to make sense of Beyoncé Knowles' and Jennifer Hudson's own success stories. Throughout, the article argues that myths of meritocracy cannot be separated from the racialized and gendered cultures of production that continue to shape the contemporary repackaging of popular histories and musical genres.

T1  - The neglected role of proactive behavior and outcomes in newcomer socialization
AN  - 1023031076; 201223959
AB  - This study examined the direct, mediating, and moderating effects of proactive outcomes in the relationship between newcomer proactive behaviors and socialization outcomes. Based on a sample of 204 co-op university students who completed surveys at the end of their work term, the results indicated that newcomers who more frequently engaged in a proactive behavior (e.g., information seeking) were more likely to receive the corresponding proactive outcome (e.g., information). We also found that proactive outcomes mediate the relationship between proactive behaviors and socialization outcomes and several of the proactive behaviors were more strongly related to socialization outcomes for newcomers who obtained more proactive outcomes. These results indicate the important yet previously neglected role of proactive outcomes for understanding the relationship between newcomer proactive socialization behaviors and outcomes.

The authors conducted semi-structured individual interviews with twenty-six participants who self-reported experiencing racism and racial trauma during doctoral studies. Analysis of the data resulted in findings that encompass three categories: internal responses, controlled responses, and external responses. These three broad themes comprise an inventory for responding to racism and racial trauma that focuses on coping and mediating relationships. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Online mediations in transnational spaces: cosmopolitan (re)formations of belonging and identity in the Turkish diaspora
AN  - 1567048959; 201435085
AB  - The lives of transnational groups and individuals are marked by a spatial and imaginary split: a phenomenon wherein identity, belonging and representation have become increasingly elusive concepts, and the realm of the 'cultural' vastly important. And, the theoretical compasses of cosmopolitanism and transnationalism are particularly relevant and illuminating in considering social space, mediated communication and belonging in relation to urban diasporic communities and gendered subjectivities. The aim of this paper is to address expressions of identity and belonging at the intersection of online communicative practice and offline spatial formations, with a focus on the specificities of gendered constructions of sociality and subjectivity in the diaspora.

T1  - 287(g) and the Politics of Interior Immigration Control in the United States: Explaining Local Cooperation with Federal Immigration Authorities
AN  - 1347781737; 201318964
AB  - This paper aims to improve our understanding of emerging patterns of interior immigration control in the United States by examining local law enforcement cooperation with federal immigration authorities under the 287(g) Program. While several recent studies have drawn attention to the shifting terrain of immigration enforcement away from borders into the interior, few have attempted to systematically explain reasons for this shift. Using a county-level dataset of all counties in the United States, this study finds that, despite the purported links between the 287(g) Program and public safety, county crime rates are not significantly related to local cooperation with federal immigration authorities. Rather, the results indicate that local decisions to engage in immigration control efforts are driven by political factors, particularly a county's partisan composition, and demographic pressures related to increases in the Hispanic/Latino population. Demography is not, however, destiny, as new immigration in localities with established foreign-born populations does not significantly increase the likelihood of cooperation under 287(g). This suggests that the partisan composition of the places where immigrants settle mediates the extent to which the demand for tighter immigration enforcement exceeds the political influence immigrant communities have in their efforts to contest restrictive immigration control policies.

T1  - Morality plays and money matters: towards a situated understanding of the politics of homosexuality in Uganda
AN  - 1504423681; 201405527
AB  - Since the drafting of Uganda's anti-homosexuality bill in 2009, considerable attention has been paid both in Uganda and across the African continent to the political and social significance of homosexual behaviour and identity. However, current debates have not adequately explained how and why anti-homosexual rhetoric has been able to gain such popular purchase within Uganda. In order to move beyond reductive representations of an innate African homophobia, we argue that it is necessary to recognise the deep imbrication of sexuality, family life, procreation and material exchange in Uganda, as well as the ways in which elite actors (including government officials, the media and religious leaders) are able to manipulate social anxieties to further particular ends. We employ a discourse analysis of reporting in the state-owned newspaper New Vision, first considering how the issue of homosexuality has been represented in relation to wider discourses regarding threats to public morality and national sovereignty. Then, through fieldwork undertaken in Uganda in 2009, we explore three key themes that offer deeper insights into the seeming resonance of this popular rhetoric about homosexuality: constructions of the family, the nature of societal morality, and understandings about reciprocity and material exchange in contemporary Ugandan society.

T1  - The invisible weight of whiteness: the racial grammar of everyday life in contemporary America
AN  - 1037875726; 201231004
AB  - Racial domination, like all forms of domination, works best when it becomes hegemonic, that is, when it accomplishes its goal without much fanfare. In this paper, based on the Ethnic and Racial Studies Annual Lecture I delivered in May 2011 in London, I argue there is something akin to a grammar -- a racial grammar if you will -- that structures cognition, vision, and even feelings on all sort of racial matters. This grammar normalizes the standards of white supremacy as the standards for all sort of social events and transactions. Thus, in the USA one can talk about HBCUs (historically black colleges and universities), but not about HWCUs (historically white colleges and universities) or one can refer to black movies and black TV shows but not label movies and TV shows white when in fact most are. I use a variety of data (e.g., abduction of children, school shootings, etc.) to illustrate how this grammar works and highlight what it helps to accomplish. I conclude that racial grammar is as important as all the visible practices and mechanisms of white supremacy and that we must fight its poisonous effects even if, like smog, we cannot see how it works clearly.

T1  - Realizing Rights in Manila Brokers and the Mediation of Sexual Politics in the Philippines
AN  - 1512219724; 201408904
AB  - In recent years, a great deal of scholarly work has focused on global queering and the roles that nongovernmental organizations and activists play in diffusing models of sex and sexuality. With its focus on large-scale phenomena, however, this scholarship has tended to gloss over how those engaged in advocacy actually take up such models. In this essay, I consider the roles that brokers play in shaping LGBT politics in the Philippines: how they engage with transnational frameworks; how this is shaped by history, intersectionality, and heterogeneity; and the extent to which their resulting advocacy might resonate with those it is designed to assist. The introduction of transnational models is not the final stage of the diffusion process; instead, it triggers debates about whether and how to apply those models. While transnational frameworks can drown out local understandings of sex and sexual politics, paying attention to the dynamism of brokerage reveals how they can also be used in powerful and locally resonant ways.

T1  - Unveiling The Web Of Race, Class, Language, And Gender Oppression: Challenges For Social Justice Educators
AN  - 1347781231; 201318854
AB  - There is often a tendency to focus on one form of oppression and pay less attention to, or leave others out, despite the fact that a vast body of research shows that all forms of oppression are interconnected. This paper aims to counter this tendency that has been circulated in the mainstream media as well as in institutions such as schools. Specifically, drawing on the scholarly work of feminist, socio-cultural, and critical race theorists, this paper critically examines the effects of intersectional oppression on people, particularly those who have been pushed to the margins because of their targeted social identities, and proposes alternative ways to combat these forms of oppression.

T1  - Defining Africana Womanhood Developing an Africana Womanism Methodology
AN  - 1315601072; 201307664
AB  - Contemporary media provide a venue to promote an anti-Black woman agenda which in turn places constant assaults on African humanity. Stereotypical portrayals of Africana women dominate current popular perceptions of Africana womanhood. Utilizing an empirical examination rooted in an African-centered Africana womanism methodology, this research sought to actively engage Africana women as agents of their own image liberation. Africana females were asked to provide images to describe who they are and how they want to be seen. Results indicate that through agency Africana woman reject media portrayals of their humanity and instead offer multidimensional representations of Africana womanhood.

T1  - Disneyfication and Localisation: The Cultural Globalisation Process of Hong Kong Disneyland
AN  - 1018343048; 201213436
AB  - Hong Kong Disneyland (HKDL) was seen as the 'Millennium Dream Comes True!' in 1999, but as 'Hong Kong's shame' after its opening in 2005. In this article, interviews and ethnographic research are used to examine the different positions of various actors (HKDL workers, consumers and media practitioners) in their relationship with HKDL. Appropriating Lefebvre's conceptual triad of space, these stories show that Disney brought Hong Kong a physical park, non-transparent values and related management practices. These same stories also demonstrate that HKDL workers and visitors work and consume the park in a local way that Disneyland management finds difficult to control; local people produce and circulate the changed meanings of 'Disney' and change certain Disney management policies.

T1  - Continuity and change in anti-Jewish prejudice: the transmission of the anti-talmudic texts of Sixtus of Siena
AN  - 907925907; 201124635
AB  - One of the main elements common to both the mediaeval anti-Jewish tradition and modern antisemitism is the use of Jewish religious texts-particularly the Talmud-in order to 'prove' that Jews pose a threat to non-Jews. Bravo Lopez considers how a series of anti-talmudic texts written by Sixtus of Siena in the sixteenth century were disseminated and used, up to the beginning of the twentieth century, to legitimize a threatening image of Judaism and Jews. Despite the changing historical context, that image remained virtually intact throughout the centuries, allowing these same texts to be used time and time again to 'prove' that it was a faithful reflection of reality. Although historical changes can account for differences in the specific motives that drove each author to use the texts of Sixtus of Siena, those authors all shared the same image of Judaism and the Jews, and they considered these texts-cited as an authoritative source, legitimizing their point of view-to be effective in support of their cause.

T1  - Recent advances in intergroup contact theory
AN  - 1417524805; 201332225
AB  - Recent advances in intergroup contact theory and research are reviewed. A meta-analysis with 515 studies and more than 250,000 subjects demonstrates that intergroup contact typically reduces prejudice (mean r = -.21). Allport's original conditions for optimal contact -- equal status, common goals, no intergroup competition, and authority sanction -- facilitate the effect but are not necessary conditions. There are other positive outcomes of intergroup contact, such as greater trust and forgiveness for past transgressions. These contact effects occur not only for ethnic groups but also for such other groups as homosexuals, the disabled and the mentally ill. Intergroup friendship is especially important. Moreover, these effects typically generalize beyond the immediate outgroup members in the situation to the whole outgroup, other situations, and even to other outgroups not involved in the contact. They also appear to be universal -- across nations, genders, and age groups. The major mediators of the effect are basically affective: reduced anxiety and empathy. And even indirect contact reduces prejudice -- vicarious contact through the mass media and having a friend who has an outgroup friend. Of course, negative contact occurs -- especially when it is non-voluntary and threatening. Criticisms of the theory and policy implications are also discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Bringing together acculturation theory and intergroup contact theory: Predictors of Flemings' expectations of Turks' acculturation behavior
AN  - 1417523620; 201332249
AB  - The present paper explores Flemish majority members' expectations concerning the acculturation of Turkish minorities. We studied two kinds of antecedents: majority members' perceptions of Turkish minorities' acculturation behavior and their experiences of intergroup contact. The possible mediating role of outgroup affect was also investigated. 247 Flemish high school students completed a survey. Data were analyzed using path analyses. Results show that positive contact experiences and perceiving that Turkish immigrants make efforts to engage in contact with the host group and/or to adopt the host culture are associated with less negative affective reactions towards Turkish migrants. Perceiving that Turkish immigrants maintain their heritage culture is associated with more negative affective reactions. Our results further revealed that increased negative affective reactions are associated with less support for culture maintenance and for contact with the host group but with a higher demand for host culture adoption. The present results also show that expectations of contact engagement and expectations of host culture adoption cannot be considered as equivalent. This implies that results from studies using Berry's conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Berry, 2001) and results from studies using Bourhis' conceptualization of acculturation expectations (Bourhis, Moiese, Perreault, & Senecal, 1997) are not directly comparable. Our data also clearly disconfirm the orthogonal structure of the fourfold acculturation model for majority members' acculturation expectations, suggesting that relying on the specific dimensions defining acculturation expectations may constitute a more valid approach to understand ongoing acculturation processes.

T1  - Representation of Africa Online: Sourcing Practice and Frames of Reference
AN  - 964195768; 201207476
AB  - The dominant perspective on the representation of Africa in the Western media claims that Western media coverage is bias and crisis oriented, and the liberal perspective claims that the coverage of Africa is not as negative as is often assumed. However, there is a paucity of literature on the representation of Africa online. This research inquiry is relevant because literature claims that the Internet has the potential to resolve the journalistic predicament of representing other culture through political participation and deliberation. But this requires a reorientation of the sourcing practice of news organization to embrace sensitivity to and knowledge of African cultures. Moreover, the journalistic predicament can be resolved or not depending on the newsgathering approach adopted by the news organization. Literature has identified two approaches, that is, "gatekeeping," used mainly by dominant traditional media, and "gatewatching," used by alternative media in their quest to counter mainstream ideology. This study examines the impacts of the gatewatching approach adopted by the Africa Have Your Say (AHYS) website on its representation and frames of reference of Africa. It uses onsite observation, in-depth interviews, and textual analysis to gather data. The study found that although the sourcing practice at the AHYS is elaborate and complex, the gatewatching approach makes its susceptible to second-level agenda setting. Hence, its frame repeats the attributes and tone used by the mainstream traditional media. However, a minority of users did not repeat this frame in their comments.

T1  - Racial Disparities in Health: How Much Does Stress Really Matter
AN  - 887500749; 201118200
AB  - Despite the widespread assumption that racial differences in stress exist and that stress is a key mediator linking racial status to poor health, relatively few studies have explicitly examined this premise. We examine the distribution of stress across racial groups and the role of stress vulnerability and exposure in explaining racial differences in health in a community sample of Black, Hispanic, and White adults, employing a modeling strategy that accounts for the correlation between types of stressors and the accumulation of stressors in the prediction of health outcomes. We find significant racial differences in overall and cumulative exposure to eight stress domains. Blacks exhibit a higher prevalence and greater clustering of high stress scores than Whites. American-born Hispanics show prevalence rates and patterns of accumulation of stressors comparable to Blacks, while foreign-born Hispanics have stress profiles similar to Whites. Multiple stressors correlate with poor physical and mental health, with financial and relationship stressors exhibiting the largest and most consistent effects. Though we find no support for the stress-vulnerability hypothesis, the stress-exposure hypothesis does account for some racial health disparities. We discuss implications for future research and policy. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Influence of Media Role Models on Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Identity
AN  - 881469083; 201116381
AB  - The current investigation examined the influence of the media on gay, lesbian, and bisexual (GLB) identity using both survey and in-depth interview approaches. In Study 1, 126 GLB survey respondents (11 unreported) in Texas indicated that the media influenced their self-realization, coming out, and current identities by providing role models and inspiration. In Study 2, 15 interviewees (6 women and 9 men) revealed that media role models serve as sources of pride, inspiration, and comfort. Our findings suggest that increasing the availability of GLB role models in the media may positively influence GLB identity. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social Integration Of Roma People -- The Importance And Remit Of Roma Media: A Case Study
AN  - 881469255; 201116442
AB  - The improvement of the social status of the Roma as a highly deprived social group is a priority of the countries signatories of the Roma inclusion 2005-2015. The Roma population, outstandingly more than all others, faces numerous problems. The state institutions in the Republic of Serbia have been actively involved in the process of social integration of the Roma through numerous actions and measures of positive discrimination, exclusively aimed at the Roma (employment, education etc.). Special attention is paid to developing and supporting the media in the Roma language. As the researches have shown, the media using Roma language contribute significantly to building up and maintaining the cultural identity of the Roma, as well as to promoting an improved image of this social group.

T1  - Are Sports Overemphasized in the Socialization Process of African American Males? A Qualitative Analysis of Former Collegiate Athletes' Perception of Sport Socialization
AN  - 835111527; 201100443
AB  - Scholars have noted that an elevated level of sports socialization in the family, neighborhood, and media exists within the African American community, creating an overrepresentation of African American males in certain sports. As a result, African American males may face consequences that are distinctly different from the consequences of those who are not socialized as intensively toward athletics, such as lower levels of academic achievement, higher expectations for professional sports careers as a means to upward mobility, and lower levels of career maturity. This study examines the sport socialization of African American male former collegiate athletes through in-depth ethnographic interviews. The results show that the respondents' perceptions were that their socializing agents and socializing environment emphasized athletics above other roles, other talents, and the development of other skills.

T1  - Troubling Subcultural Theories on Race, Gender, the Street, and Resistance
AN  - 758121809; 201056899
AB  - The article examines the linkage made between the urban street, racial authenticity, resistance, and black style within fashion and subcultural theories. A conceptualization that has located the urban street as a site of racial and political authenticity for the black subject; making a series of political and visual associations between the urban street, formations of race and resistance and concepts of black style. This article traces the development of this linkage by drawing upon three case studies: Tom Wolfe's essay 'Radical Chic' (1989[1970]), the media image of the Black Panthers, and fashion images from Harper's Bazaar (UK) 1968- 9. These case studies illustrate how fashion commentary, fashion theory, documentary photography, and social protest impacted upon the visualization of the black body within 1960s fashion photography and subsequently. Furthermore, this linkage, between the street authenticity and black style is premised by drawing upon the work of British subcultural theorists - on the assumption of a masculine political subject. In accepting uncritically this discursive positioning the author asserts that subcultural and fashion theorists continue to structurally exclude black woman. By drawing upon the work of Judith Butler and Jacques Derrida, the author questions the continuing use of the concepts of race, resistance, and black body stylization to analyze concepts of black femininity with fashion theory and fashion photography.

T1  - Straight Eye for the Gay Guy: Composing Queerness
AN  - 754038505; 201049660
AB  - Drawing on the work of Didier Eribon and his theorization of the construction of gay male subjectivity, this article examines different 'texts,' broadly defined, that grapple specifically with straight men attempting to represent male homosexuality: Norman Mailer's essay, 'The Homosexual Villain'; the Bravo reality television series Boy Meets Boy, and Michael Griffith's short story, 'Hooper Gets a Perm.' These texts represent attempts by straight authors to grapple with queer experience in ways that move the imagination of queers beyond simple stereotypes or uncritical explorations of the sexual 'other.' In the process of examining these texts, the following questions are addressed: What happens when a straight man attempts to represent a gay man? Does he 'get it right,' and is such a question even useful? More specifically, what is the value in having straights imagine queerness? Is such an imagining possible? Is such desirable? And, if so, what are the contours of such an imagining--as well as its possibilities and limitations, pedagogically, personally, and politically? Ultimately, I contend that the straight imagining of queerness offers rich potential for mutual understanding; furthermore, attempting to understand what goes into the making of those representations tells us much about how queerness circulates in our culture as a subject, a figure of discussion, contention, and representation.

T1  - Inter-ethnic relations in Mongolia and Inner Mongolia
AN  - 754046068; 201053306
AB  - The article deals with the development of minority policies in Mongolia since independence from China, and focuses on the effects that these policies have had on inter-ethnic relations. The main groups studied are the Khalkha Mongols, the Kazakhs, the Tuvans and the Han Chinese. The definitions of these groups as either undesten or yastan have also varied over time, which has created theoretically interesting complexities. The article contains a sociolinguistic study of the inter-ethnic relations, with particular emphasis on education, culture, media and publishing. Furthermore, the tendency of the Tuvans to identify ethnically with the Mongols rather than with the Kazakhs is analyzed from the point of view of a sub-minority-majority identification theory. In Inner Mongolia, the inter-ethnic relations are problematic, and there are also severe tensions between the Mongols of Inner Mongolia and those of Mongolia. These ethnic policies have also played an important role in the development of the inter-state relations between Mongolia and the People's Republic of China. Adapted from the source document.
