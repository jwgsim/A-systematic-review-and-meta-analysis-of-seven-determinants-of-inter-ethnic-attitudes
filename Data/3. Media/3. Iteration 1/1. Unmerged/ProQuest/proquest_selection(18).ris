T1  - ‘Re-educating the Roma? You must be joking. . .’: Racism and prejudice in online discussion forums
AN  - 2478227891
AB  - This article explores prejudicial and racist discourse in reader comments in internet news discussion forums. Based on data from an online debate among Czech commenters on the mainstream iDnes.cz news site, it seeks to contribute to the existing critical linguistic approaches to discursive strategies of othering. Analysing user comments referencing a news article on a sensitive social topic, namely the complicated reception of Central European Roma immigrants in the UK, the paper focuses on three salient themes found in the data: (a) the re-education of the ethnic minority; (b) the users’ perception of the media as politically correct and siding with the outgroup; and (c) the outgroup’s negative stereotype associating it with criminality. The paper argues that the discourse on these topics simultaneously relies on and reinforces the negative stereotype of the ethnic group, while revealing a complicated relationship between three stakeholders: the ingroup, represented by the commenters; the outgroup, made up of members of the ethnic groups; and the media, as representatives of the authorities and the elites. The findings reveal how quasi-humorous comments that involve such stereotypical representations contribute to the normalization of everyday racism against ethnic outgroups.1

T1  - Sedative effects of intergroup contact on support for ethnic activism among Kosovo Albanians in Switzerland: The interplay of ethnic, national, and dual identification
AN  - 2419853175
AB  - A large body of research has demonstrated that intergroup contact is a powerful tool for reducing prejudice among majority group members. Yet, research among minority group members has revealed a more complex picture. The present contribution advances recent research on sedative effects of intergroup contact on support for ethnic activism, by investigating how identity dynamics undermine ethnic minorities' claims for better conditions and equal rights. More precisely, we disentangled the mediating roles played by reduced ethnic and increased national identification as a consequence of intergroup contact, while considering the moderating role of dual identification. Results from a cross‐sectional study among an understudied immigrant minority, Kosovo Albanians in Switzerland, indicate that dual identification moderated the sedative effect of intergroup contact on support for ethnic activism via decreased ethnic identification, while no support for conditional processes of intergroup contact via increased national identification were found. Intergroup contact was linked to reduced ethnic identification, which in turn related to increased support for ethnic activism, but only when dual identification was low. Conversely, when dual identification was high, ethnic identification was unrelated to support for ethnic activism, and intergroup contact reduced ethnic activism directly. To conclude, we discuss the mobilizing role of dual identification, and reflect on how ethnic and national components of dual identities affect the politicization of stigmatized minorities.

T1  - Fusion of “You and Me”: Cultural Mixing Promotes Intergroup Psychological Compatibility
AN  - 2429062890
AB  - Previous research has mainly examined individuals’ attitudes to cultural mixing per se, and rarely examined the attitudes to the outgroup involved in cultural mixing. Exposure to ingroup–outgroup cultural mixing may be an indirect intergroup contact, which can promote individuals’ psychological compatibility toward the corresponding cultural outgroup. We measured Chinese Yi undergraduates’ experience of Yi-Tibetan cultural mixing in Study 1 and found it was significantly correlated with psychological compatibility toward Tibetans. We then used a between-subjects design and experimentally manipulated Yi participants’ exposure to cultural mixing to verify the causal effect of exposure to Yi-Dai cultural mixing on psychological compatibility toward Dai (the Yi and Dai are two of the 55 ethnic minorities in China from different provinces and have their own unique culture; Study 2) and the mediating role of perceived connection (Studies 3 and 4). These findings suggest that exposure to cultural mixing facilitates intergroup psychological compatibility, and this beneficial effect is mediated by perceived connection.

T1  - How to Enhance the Effects of Mediated Intergroup Contact? Evidence from Four Countries
AN  - 2334265612
AB  - We bridge the theorizing on mediated and imagined contact and integrate these two contact forms in one sequence within a single design. We experimentally examine whether (1) encouraging people to imagine a positive intergroup encounter prior to reading a personal story of an outgroup member as well as (2) mediated contact with an outgroup member similar or dissimilar to the ingroup prototype, improve outgroup attitudes. We also test the affective and cognitive mediators through which these effects emerge. Data from four different countries that test attitudes toward four distinct immigrant groups find that although imagined contact and similarity do not consistently improve outgroup attitudes, enhanced interest in the story of an outgroup member and positive emotions mediate the effects from similarity, and - in two countries - from imagined contact. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.

T1  - Marry who you love: Intergroup contact with gay people and another stigmatized minority is related to voting on the restriction of gay rights through threat
AN  - 2312955855
AB  - The study examined factors associated with discrimination against gay people in a public referendum aimed at the restriction of gay rights. We tested whether positive and negative intergroup contact with gay people and intergroup contact with another stigmatized minority, the Roma, were associated with how the heterosexual majority voted in the referendum (i.e., discrimination). We tested two mechanisms underlying the link between intergroup contact and discrimination—the mediation by intergroup threat and the mediation by outgroup attitudes. We found that negative contact with both gay people and the Roma was associated with a higher probability of gay discrimination while positive contact was associated with a lower probability of gay discrimination. Intergroup threat, not intergroup attitudes, mediated the link between intergroup contact and discrimination. In the case of contact with gay people, intergroup contact was linked to discrimination through threat from gay people. In the case of contact with Roma, intergroup contact was linked to discrimination through the generalization of threats from the Roma to gay people but not via the generalization of outgroup attitudes. Our research brings novel evidence that contact with one minority can affect discrimination against another minority in both positive and negative way and that perceived threat, but not attitudes, plays a key role in majority's decision to discriminate against gay people.

T1  - "When birds of a different feather flock together" – intercultural socialization in adolescents' friendships
AN  - 2317026993
AB  - Intercultural friendships are a powerful form of intergroup contact to reduce prejudice (Pettigrew, 1998). Little is known about if and how intercultural friendships may also foster intercultural competence. An important prerequisite for the development of intercultural competence is that adolescents reflect on cultural variations. We refer to the degree to which adolescents discuss cultural variations in intercultural friendships as intercultural socialization and explore the following research questions: (1) Does intercultural socialization in friendships mediate the relation between age, intercultural friendship characteristics (friendship group composition, and length, quality, and interaction frequency of the closest intercultural friendship), and adolescents' intercultural competence? (2) Do these relations depend on the adolescents' self-identification with majority and minority culture(s)? The sample included 571 adolescents in Germany (48% female, Mage = 13.69 years, 52% identifying only as members of the cultural majority, 48% (also) as members of a cultural minority. Intercultural competence was measured using a self-report questionnaire and open-ended questions capturing the adolescents' interpretation of and reaction to intercultural situations. Quantitative measures tapped into friendship characteristics (friendship group composition, and length, quality, and interaction frequency of the closest intercultural friendship). To test our model, we employed multigroup path analysis with latent variables in Mplus. Results showed that intercultural socialization linked age and intercultural friendship characteristics with adolescents' intercultural competence. The relations partly varied depending on student's cultural self-identification. We conclude that intercultural friendships are associated with important skills that are needed in increasingly multicultural societies if students experience and discuss cultural variations in these friendships.

T1  - Receptivity to dating and marriage across the religious divide in Northern Ireland: The role of intergroup contact
AN  - 2287776732
AB  - Intergroup contact has long been recognized as an important factor in promoting positive intergroup attitudes. However, in operationalizing intergroup attitudes, previous studies have rarely investigated attitudes toward one of the most intimate forms of contact, romantic relationships. In this study (N = 176), we expand the intergroup contact literature to examine the association between intergroup contact and, arguably, a litmus test of intergroup attitudes: receptivity to intergroup romance. We do so in Northern Ireland, a context that is historically and presently characterized by sectarian division and tension between Catholics and Protestants. Our findings reveal that intergroup contact is positively associated with receptivity to both dating and marrying an outgroup member. These associations are mediated by ingroup norms toward outgroup romances. General outgroup attitudes were also found to be positively associated with contact but, in contrast to romantic attitudes, this association was shown, for the first time, to be simultaneously mediated by ingroup norms, anxiety, empathy, and trust. In addition, strength of ingroup identification played a moderating role, with a stronger positive relationship between contact and both romantic and general outgroup attitudes among higher identifiers. The findings highlight the importance of examining attitudes toward intergroup romantic relationships, as well as understanding the different mediating and moderating mechanisms which may account for how contact influences general attitudes and romantic attitudes. In the wake of the UK vote to leave the European Union, they also serve as an important reminder of how intergroup contact can be effective in promoting peace in Northern Ireland.

T1  - Secondary transfer effect of positive and negative online contact between groups involved in high-intensity conflict
AN  - 2170891467
AB  - Israeli Jews and Palestinians are involved in a high-intensity, overt, violent conflict, in which Israeli Palestinians can be considered a mediating group, which shares a citizenship with Israeli Jews and an ethnicity with non-Israeli Palestinians. The current research examines (1) the primary effects of online contact between Israeli Jews and Israeli Palestinians on attitudes towards the Israeli Palestinians; (2) the Secondary Transfer Effect (STE) of online contact between Israeli Jews and Israeli Palestinians on attitudes of the former toward non-Israeli Palestinians. The study was conducted through an online survey of 450 Israeli Jews aged 18–35. It revealed direct positive effect of online contact with Israeli Palestinians on attitudes towards them, if this contact was defined by respondents as positive, and negative effect if the contact was defined as negative. We found evidence of STE of online contact with Israeli Palestinians (primary out-group) on attitudes toward non-Israeli Palestinians (secondary out-group) for positive contact, but no evidence of STE was found when the contact was negative. The relationship between the frequency of online positive contact with the primary out-group and attitudes toward the secondary outgroup was fully mediated by attitudes toward the primary, encountered out-group, namely, via a process of attitude generalization. This paper adds to a growing body of research on STEs of intergroup contact considering a previously unexplored STE of positive and negative online contact. The study revealed that the potential of Internet and online contacts might be used to increase solidarity and understanding within and between nations.

T1  - Deviance Credit: Tolerance of Deviant Ingroup Leaders is Mediated by Their Accrual of Prototypicality and Conferral of Their Right to Be Supported
AN  - 2017679473
AB  - Leaders often deviate from group norms or social conventions, sometimes innovating and sometimes engaging in serious transgressions or illegality. We propose that group members are prone to be more permissive toward both forms of deviance in the case of ingroup leaders compared to other ingroup members or outgroup members and leaders. This granting of “deviance credit” is hypothesized to be underpinned by perceptions of an ingroup leader's prototypicality of the group (“accrual”) and belief that occupancy of the role confers a right to be supported (“conferral”). Analyses of data from four studies demonstrate that both accrual and conferral (1) mediate evaluations, inclusion and punishment of deviant leaders, and (2) they make independent contributions to deviance credit. Implications for leadership, marginalization, corruption, innovation, and transformation are discussed.

T1  - Imagined intergroup contact promotes support for human rights through increased humanization
AN  - 1993909001
AB  - Dehumanization concerns the denial of others' human uniqueness (animalistic dehumanization) or human nature (mechanistic dehumanization). Imagined intergroup contact has been suggested to be an effective technique for reducing dehumanization. We examined whether this intervention might primarily work by increasing the type of humanness the group specifically lacks. Study 1 revealed that after imagining contact with an animalized out-group (i.e., Gypsy people), participants attributed higher levels of human uniqueness. Study 2 replicated this finding, eliminating improved intergroup attitudes as an alternative explanation. Further, it demonstrated that imagined contact increased support for human rights, and that this was mediated by increased adscription of human uniqueness. Study 3 confirmed previous evidence by showing that after imagining contact with a mechanized out-group (i.e., Japanese people), participants attributed higher levels of human nature that explains support for human rights. Overall, imagined contact specifically works at increasing the type of humanness the group is typically denied.

T1  - Race, Ethnicity, Risky Lifestyles, and Violent Victimization: A Test of a Mediation Model
AN  - 1934663620
AB  - Empirical studies have established that Blacks and Hispanics are two of the most violently victimized racial/ethnic groups in the United States, but the mechanisms that underlie these disparities in victimization risk are not well understood. This study tests a mediation model developed from criminal opportunity theories that may explain the disparities. Using data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, the results show that Black and Hispanic adolescents were twice as likely as their White counterparts to be violently victimized, and these disparities remained after controlling for demographic characteristics and prior victimization. As to the hypothesized sources of these disparities, there was mixed evidence regarding the mediation model. Although risky lifestyles were significantly related to violent victimization and eliminated all disparities between Black and White youth, they failed to eliminate victimization disparities between Hispanics and White youth. The implications of these findings are discussed in light of theory and victimization prevention.

T1  - Homonationalism Before Homonationalism: Representations of Russia, Eastern Europe, and the Soviet Union in the U.S. Homophile Press, 1953-1964
AN  - 1891138908
AB  - This essay focuses on representations of Russia, the Soviet Union, and Eastern Europe in U.S. homophile periodicals from 1953 to 1964. Extending the application of Jasbir Puar's concept of homonationalism to the Cold War period, the essay examines 128 articles and other items that were published in ONE, Mattachine Review, and The Ladder and demonstrates that these periodicals often engaged in homonationalist discourses when constructing the Russian, Soviet, and Eastern European "other." Negative constructions of these regions were sometimes used to affirm the political alignment of the homophile authors with the American nation. At other times, negative constructions were used in comparative assessments that critiqued both the United States and the Soviet and Eastern European regions. In contrast, positive constructions of Russian, Soviet, and Eastern European peoples and cultures were used as evidence that non-heteronormative desires and bodies had legitimate places in many "primitive" cultures and existed across all nations and periods.

T1  - Imperial Queerness: The U.S. Homophile Press and Constructions of Sexualities in Asia and the Pacific, 1953-1964
AN  - 1891114456
AB  - This essay examines the ways in which U.S. homophile magazines represented and constructed Asia and the Pacific from 1953 to 1964. Through an analysis of 209 items that referenced Asia and the Pacific in ONE, Mattachine Review, and the Ladder, the essay argues that U.S. homophiles referenced the region in three primary ways: first, to create relationships, allies, and exchanges with people living in the region; second, to highlight the inferiority of the East and superiority of the West; and, third, to reveal the cross-cultural and transhistorical nature of homosexuality. These references were influenced by Orientalism, colonialism, and the Cold War, which framed Asia and the Pacific as both sexually and culturally backward, but also as a potential tourist destination for gay men and lesbian women.

T1  - Flagging White Nationalism 'After Cronulla': From the Beach to the Net
AN  - 1923057587
AB  - In this article, I use a case study analysis of two white nationalist movements online, in the Australian context, to consider whether the prevalence and everyday uses of social media by white nationalist groups today has impacted on race relations and multiculturalism in Australia 12 years after the Cronulla riots. Social media affordances present a set of conditions that were absent during the 2005 riot, and yet, are today mobilising distinct variants of white nationalism online. Rather than these expressions being locally situated, social media allows these performances to be connected up virtually, extending the white nationalists' capacity to occupy and terrorise a range of networked public and intimate spaces and influence mainstream political culture. Nonetheless social media affordances, which situate these movements in a virtual 'ecology of subcultures' also contributes to their instability and ambivalence, with the uncivil 'trolling' practices of online movements undermining broader social goals and contributing to even more extreme and unstable expressions online.

T1  - 'We're Not Multicultural, but ... '
AN  - 1923057176
AB  - This article reconsiders the 2005 Cronulla riots after ten years. We begin by examining three examples of events misread ten years ago, to illustrate some key changes that have since shaped Australian racism. The first two, concern the rallying call to 'Leb and wog bashing day' at Cronulla in December 2005, and the attack there on two Bangladeshi students. These are shown to be indicative in a shift in the focus of racist Othering in Australia, from the 'Arab Other' to the 'Muslim Other', as Islamophobia becomes increasingly mainstreamed in Australian culture following the trend throughout the global West. Second, the incongruous chivalry-cum-feminism of the beachgoers who participated in the riot and were interviewed in the 2006 Four Corners television documentary, Riot and Revenge, illustrates some key features of Islamophobia as it has developed and become entrenched: such as accusing Muslims of hyperpatriarchy, and purporting to 'rescue' Muslim women while targeting them for racist vilification. We trace these and related ideological elements of Islamophobia inherent in the Cronulla riots, and show how these have unfolded in the Australian mainstream in the ten years since, becoming further enfolded into the commonsense as part of the 'new normal'.

T1  - Media Representations of Racism and Spatial Mobility: Young Muslim (Un)belonging in a Post-Cronulla Riot Sutherland
AN  - 1923055625
AB  - Young Australian Muslims living in Sydney have been influenced by the Cronulla riot. Online surveys (n: 76) and interviews (n: 10) reveal the impact on their engagement with the Sutherland region around Cronulla, detectable a decade after this event. The exclusionary intent of the rioters and their sympathisers was a racist form of spatial management that had both specific and general aims. The Australian news media contribute to the ethnic purification that was originally intended by the Cronulla riots. This reduces mobility among an 'ethnic other' in accessing spaces that have been portrayed as 'racist' - or, in the case of young Muslims, 'Islamophobic'. Findings demonstrate the ongoing consequences of a wide-scale racist attack, like the Cronulla riot, on urban citizenship. Representations of the Cronulla riot are a repertoire of learning for young Sydney Muslims that rehearse what has been conceptualised as pedagogies of (un)belonging by Noble and Poynting [(2010). White Lines: The Intercultural Politics of Everyday Movement in Social Spaces. Journal of Intercultural Studies, 31, 489-505]. We have extended the application of this concept to a specific space and point to the means by which constructions of unbelonging are reinforced and made material. Processes of repetition and accumulations identified by Butler and Essed highlight how this enduring pedagogy of spatial unbelonging is maintained by media representations of places as Islamophobic.

T1  - Reviewing the Reviews: Discussions of Race by Film Reviewers
AN  - 1919461959
AB  - Color-blind racism has transformed how race scholars understand race relations in contemporary society. Previous researchers mainly utilized this theory to identify frames of color-blind racism in various social settings and interactions. What has received less attention, however, is how frames of color-blind racism are produced within material conditions in which social interactions and relations occur. In this study we use film reviews to exemplify how color-blind racism is produced in a specific materialist context-film reviews. Film reviews garner discussion among scholars for their impact on the box office revenues of films. Less attention is given to the content of these reviews and, particularly, how their writers address issues of race. This study provides a qualitative content analysis of film reviewer's discussions of race in their reviews of twenty-first-century films featuring black protagonists to illuminate some ways in which mainstream and niche media outlets discuss race. Results suggest that the source of the reviews influences how race is considered and communicated among film reviewers. Mainstream reviewers differ widely from niche reviewers in both content and delivery in their discussions of race.

T1  - Enforcement, Integration, and the Future of Immigration Federalism
AN  - 1931577502
AB  - The federal government has a monopoly over the terms of immigration law, and it superintends the nation’s singular immigration enforcement bureaucracy. But our federalism nonetheless provides a vital playing field for sharp debates over the status of immigrants in American life. The forms of state and local involvement in immigration policy are varied, but they fall into two basic categories of mutually dependent and re-enforcing policies: enforcement federalism and integration federalism. Whereas enforcement federalism concerns the extent to which localities should assist or resist federal removal policies, integration federalism encompasses measures designed to assist immigrants, regardless of status, to plant roots and acculturate to life in the United States. 
Both forms of immigration federalism take shape through a wide variety of intergovernmental relations, not only between the federal government on the one hand and states and localities on the other, but also between states and the cities within them - an increasingly important dimension of immigration federalism today. These relations have important legal characteristics, and constitutional and statutory law bring them into being and mediate them. But the nature of any given intergovernmental dynamic will be shaped just as much by a combination of ideology and institutional imperatives. These elements can either unite the center and the periphery in common cause or produce the sort of conflict that has made immigration federalism a high-profile issue for decades. 
Given the density of the intergovernmental dynamics that shape the country’s immigration policy, developing a comprehensive strategy for immigration federalism requires more than a predilection toward or away from centralization of government authority. It requires a clear view on the appropriate metes and bounds of immigration enforcement, as well as a set of beliefs about the proper place in the social order of immigrants with different legal statuses. While this essay remains largely (though not entirely) agnostic on these questions, it offers four basic principles to frame any future federalism agenda. 
First, when it comes to enforcement federalism, the federal government ought to acknowledge the reasons that localities might resist federal enforcement efforts, at least as a matter of politics, and if only to ensure that federal policy is subjected to accountability checks by competing, external pressures. Second, whatever the value of resistance to enforcement, a federalism agenda should include efforts by all levels of government to identify a manageable equilibrium that reconciles the federal government’s constitutional and statutory responsibilities for maintaining an enforcement regime with the local politics of immigration and the lived realities of immigrant communities. Third, when it comes to integration federalism, the problem of illegal immigration must be solved, and only the federal government can do so decisively. Federalism can only mediate the political conflict over status and help set the terms for its ultimate resolution. And yet, the structural reasons that have given rise to integration federalism should re-enforce the country’s commitment to locally driven integration policy, supported by a national-level commitment to information sharing, coordination, and resource support. Finally, because both enforcement and integration policy require systemic flexibility, it is important not to confuse arguments on the merits of immigration policy with structural claims. In other words, scholars, advocates, or policymakers should exercise humility and circumspection when developing conversation-stopping claims that a certain intergovernmental relation is required by law, especially in a context as charged as immigration policy.

T1  - Racial phenotypicality bias in educational expectations for both male and female teenagers from different socioeconomic backgrounds
AN  - 1928612896
AB  - In three experiments (N=56, 99, and 225), we showed that racial phenotypicality bias characterizes educational expectations for Chilean mestizo students: participants displayed more positive educational expectations for light complexioned than for dark complexioned high school students. In Study 1, with male high school target students, the relation between racial phenotypic appearance and educational expectations was mediated by differences in perceived competence. Study 2 suggests that the gender of the target student did not influence the occurrence of racial phenotypicality bias. Study 3 showed that racial phenotypicality bias occurs in both university students and high school teachers' judgements. Although socioeconomic background of the target student partially explained the effects of racial phenotypic appearance (especially in teachers), the latter exerted an additional and independent influence on educational expectations. These results underline the fact that effects of racial phenotypicality bias should not be overlooked in the educational domain. As mediational analyses suggested, these effects only partly occur because of stereotypical associations between racial phenotypic appearance and socioeconomic background, but also because of stereotypical associations between racial phenotypic appearance and attributed competence.

T1  - Perceptions of diversity and attitudes of tolerance in the 'fragmented' U.K.
AN  - 1869136069
AB  - Relying on a quantitative survey (n = 1497) and semi-structured interviews (n = 30) conducted in the U.K., we explore British nationals', Romanian and Turkish migrants' attitudes of tolerance and the factors influencing them in the current socio-political context in the U.K. The quantitative data reveal the role of younger age, diverse networks, higher education, attachment to city/region and supranational identifications in more open attitudes towards diversity. The qualitative findings illustrate how diverse these three groups' attitudes of tolerance can be and how they are affected by their position and status in the U.K. The British' attitudes show their tolerance can reflect diverse forms of acceptance of ethnic and cultural differences but can also draw lines in terms of civic values opposing 'those who contribute to society' versus those who 'live as parasites'. The Turks are in favour of diversity with the expectation of receiving more civic rights and facing less prejudice. The Romanians tend to have a more ambiguous relation to diversity given their position of stigmatised migrants in the U.K. Our analysis reveal how inclusive or exclusive people's (sub- and supra-)national identities can be and how these frame their attitudes of tolerance.

T1  - Andalusia at the crossroads of Europeanness: immigration as a performance of coloniality
AN  - 1862143851
AB  - The semantics of cultural diversity, based on the political discourses of immigration as they appear in integration and anti-racist policies in Andalusia, underline the sense of Otherness of immigrant groups. In this article, Castaño, Martínez and Periáñez focus on the most relevant texts in the Planes Integrales para la Inmigración en Andalucía (Comprehensive Plans for Immigration in Andalusia). To date, these texts have formed the most significant discursive framework for representations of the third sector, trade unions and public agencies involved in the management of diversity. The key ideas in the plans revolve around transnational political references in the context of the European Union (EU). They impose a sense of Europeanness on Andalusia that is in opposition to its historical heritage, endogenous diversity and cultural specificity, and thus steer the imaginary of Andalusia's identity towards a Eurocentric idea that enhances the region's peripheral position. Immigration is regarded in the hegemonic media discourse and the social imaginary as a risk and a social problem. Integration policies, despite being couched in anti-racist rhetoric, are specifically targeted at immigrants, further enhancing the idea of Otherness. The notion of interculturality is the leitmotiv of these policies. In practical terms, however, action is limited to empty measures in the field of education. These policies, in sum, neutralize, rather than reinforce, the sense of equality on which interculturality is based. The examination of the intertextuality of Andalusian, Spanish and European discourses reveals the conformity of the discourse of Andalusia's coloniality within the framework of the EU.

T1  - Race and place at the city limits: imaginative geographies of South Central Los Angeles
AN  - 1827658053
AB  - In the early 1990s, a new cycle of films emerged that depicted complex portrayals of the lives of African-Americans in the neighbourhoods in which they lived. This so-called 'hood genre was quite radical in its foregrounding of structural racism and police violence. But Hollywood's marketing of these films muted this radical content by directly contradicting explicit signifiers in the films' story worlds. While many of the 'hood films take place on the urban fringe and in suburbs, their promotional materials worked to confine the action, to a mythic 'inner city'.
This essay studies the two most popular films of the genre, Boyz n the Hood and Menace II Society, to illustrate how 'paratexts' redistricted 'hood films. Through a comparative analysis of the films and their promotional materials, this essay argues Hollywood marketed a racialized 'imaginative geography' for this important genre of African-American cinema.

T1  - The Power to be Moral: Affirming Israelis' and Palestinians' Agency Promotes Prosocial Tendencies across Group Boundaries
AN  - 1817461022
AB  - Based on recent extensions of the needs-based model of reconciliation, we argue that in conflicts characterized by mutual transgressions, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, group members prioritize their agency-related over morality-related needs. Optimistically, however, two studies conducted among Israeli Jews (Study 1) and West Bank Palestinians (Study 2) found that addressing group members' pressing need for agency by affirming their in-group's strength, competence, and self-determination brought their moral considerations to the fore, leading to stronger prosocial tendencies across group boundaries. These studies suggest that group members need to feel secure and agentic in order to allow their otherwise unprioritized moral needs to come into play. Practically, our insights regarding the positive effects of agency affirmation can be used in the planning of interventions by dialog group facilitators, mediators, or group leaders who wish to encourage members to relinquish some power in order to exhibit greater morality toward their out-group.

T1  - Crossing over, coming out, blending in: A trans interrogation of the closet
AN  - 1834955074
AB  - This paper investigates the discursive and material impact of 'coming out' on trans (sexual/gendered) identities and bodies. By drawing on the lived experiences of local trans subjects, the centrality of disclosure within larger lbgti discourses on liberation is troubled. Trans lives often run against the grain of a clear demarcation of a public inside and outside and, as this paper demonstrates at the hand of autobiographic narratives and photography, the very position of being trans(sexual/gendered) escapes the delineations of visibility and readability that discourses surrounding the closet largely maintain. 
By pitting the secrecy of passing (as a cisgendered subject) against the disclosure of 'coming out' as trans, the identities of trans men and women are discursively constructed (be it in academic discourses or even in the popular media) as necessarily visible and knowable. This idea is undermined by the actual fact that the successful gender transitioning of a trans subject largely renders their transness invisible. At the same time, emphasis on trans visibility may present a positive move towards lobbying for the equality and freedom of trans people. Yet, the notion of 'progress', of a move from concealment to open celebration, can in effect give rise to a teleological conception of full public disclosure that ignores the complexities of trans lives, and the extreme conditions of precarity that they are often subjected to. This paper argues for a conception of 'being trans' as something that is neither completely open and visible, nor totally secret, but rather as something that is wrought by continuous processes of concealment and exposure.

T1  - A Multicultural Nation and its (Muslim) Other? Political Leadership and Media Reporting in the Wake of the 'Sydney Siege'
AN  - 1801919020
AB  - This article explores public reactions to an event dubbed the 'Sydney siege', through an analysis of its media coverage. The event, where a Muslim man held 18 hostages in a Sydney café, was closely followed during its 22 hour duration and triggered an avalanche of public commentary. We analyse media articles, political leaders' media statements and transcripts of press conferences published within the week of the siege. Using NVivo software, we code the key themes arising from the data and employ in-depth textual and discourse analyses of the most prominent themes: multiculturalism, Islam/Muslims and 'community/solidarity'. Using the theoretical framework of the nation as an imagined community which needs its 'Others', we find that the 'Sydney siege' lead to emphasising hegemonic ideas of the Australian national identity and values that mark the boundaries of nationhood, community belonging and solidarity. Such ideas placed Muslims precariously at the national margin, applying a simplistic binary of the 'good ones' worthy of inclusion into the 'good nation' and the 'bad ones' to be excluded. We conclude that the public discourse following the Sydney siege affirmed Australian multiculturalism in a broad sense but also strongly implied the Otherness of Muslims.

T1  - Local Kids, 'Refugees' and Publics of Privilege: Children's Mediated and Intercultural Lives in a Regional Australian City
AN  - 1801919006
AB  - This paper considers contradictions and complexities around mediated and intercultural relationships between local children, primarily of Anglo-Australian descent, and 'refugees', in a regional Australian primary school community. It examines two different spaces in which local children engage with asylum seekers on a daily basis - the prolific 'speech communities' around refugees which circulate in public culture, and lived practices of 'everyday multiculturalism'. Young people are shown to draw on negative tropes around 'refugees' to anchor themselves in a local cultural order. These speech communities, however, differ significantly from the forms of everyday multiculturalism which take place between local children and asylum-seeker youth. This raises questions about how narratives around refugees, privilege and morality become embedded in local cultural identities, and what this might mean for children's attempts to belong within such contexts. These practices are discussed here through long-term ethnographic fieldwork, the importance of which is highlighted for making sense of young people's prejudices and racism towards refugees in economically insecure communities.

T1  - Media and the politics of belonging: Sudanese Australians, letters to the editor and the new integrationism
AN  - 1807164673
AB  - Nolan, Burgin, Farquharson and Marjoribanks focus on media as a significant site through which a politics of belonging is played out, focusing particularly on coverage of Sudanese Australians. To this end, they analyse letters to the editor that concern Sudanese Australians in three Victorian newspapers in 2007, a highly significant year in which this group became the focus of significant levels of (predominantly negative) media coverage. Through textual and thematic analysis, the authors demonstrate how such letters worked to reiterate and extend a politics of 'integrationism' that, without entirely departing from Australia's commitment to multiculturalism, has rearticulated the latter along neo-assimilationist lines. In doing so, they show how, in many letters, Sudanese Australians are problematized for their failure or refusal to 'integrate' in ways that involve an explicit or implicit process of racialization. In the process, the article also critically considers the important role performed by media in the politics of belonging, particularly through their reiteration and contestation of the politics of race and multiculturalism in Australia. Rather than simply a matter of reproducing a hegemonic politics, it shows how such processes, despite the marked limitations of their framing within a 'race debate', also serve to demonstrate significant fault lines in the politics of belonging.

T1  - The Psychosis of Whiteness: The Celluloid Hallucinations of Amazing Grace and Belle
AN  - 1795681419
AB  - Critical Whiteness studies has emerged as an academic discipline that has produced a lot of work and garnered attention in the last two decades. Central to this project is the idea that if the processes of Whiteness can be uncovered, then they can be reasoned with and overcome, through rationale dialogue. This article will argue, however, that Whiteness is a process rooted in the social structure, one that induces a form of psychosis framed by its irrationality, which is beyond any rational engagement. Drawing on a critical discourse analysis of the two only British big budget movies about transatlantic slavery, Amazing Grace and Belle, the article argues that such films serve as the celluloid hallucinations that reinforce the psychosis of Whiteness. The features of this discourse that arose from the analysis included the lack of Black agency, distancing Britain from the horrors of slavery, and downplaying the role of racism.

T1  - The effect of terrorist events on media portrayals of Islam and Muslims: evidence from New York Times headlines, 1985-2013
AN  - 1804188363
AB  - This article examines whether media portrayals of Islam and Muslims are overwhelmingly negative, whether they have evolved over time, and what factors most consistently affect their tone. We analyse every fourth New York Times headline about Islam or Muslims between 1985 and 2013. We find that headlines have not been predominantly negative. In addition, New York Times headlines about Islam and Muslims have become more positive over the long term, even after the 9/11 attacks. Most counter-intuitively, we find that terrorist attacks have had a systematic positive effect on headline tone. During the first four weeks after each Islamist terrorist attack on an American target, the tone of New York Times headlines became significantly more positive compared to the four weeks prior to the attack. However, over the subsequent few months, coverage reverted back toward the tone that prevailed during the weeks before the event.

T1  - Nobody's business? White male privilege in media coverage of intimate partner violence
AN  - 1772298168
AB  - Portrayals of celebrities perpetrating Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) are ideal for understanding the association between gender and racial privilege in representations of social problems. Unlike prior scholarship on framing of IPV, with celebrity perpetrators, race can be analyzed as an important aspect. Using 330 news articles about 66 celebrities, I find patterns of reporting consistent with male privilege that sanctions men's violence against women, whereas the differential treatment of Black men fosters a racialized interpretation that pathologizes Black men. Black men's IPV is more often criminalized, with criminal imagery included 3 times more often in articles about Black celebrities than White celebrities. By presenting violence as an escalation of mutual conflict and excusing it due to mitigating circumstances, such as inebriation, White men's violence is justified 2½ times more often than Black men's IPV. These findings contribute to sociological understandings of racial privilege in the social construction of IPV.

T1  - Educational performance of children of migrant parents in Ghana, Nigeria and Angola
AN  - 1784151304
AB  - There is no empirical research on the school performance of children who live separated from their parents in sub-Saharan Africa-a major migrant sending region in the world. This study uses survey data from junior and secondary school children and youths in Ghana (N = 2760), Angola (N = 2243) and Nigeria (N = 2168) to examine how different transnational family formations such as internal or international parental absence accompanied by migration or divorce, who is the migrant parent and who is the caregiver, the stability of the caregiving arrangement and remittances relate with the school performance of children who stay behind. School performance is measured through an index of grades in language, mathematics and science. The results show that international parental migration (Ghana), the internal parental migration accompanied by divorce/separation (Nigeria) and migration of both parents (Ghana and Nigeria) are likely predictors for decreased school performance. No effects are observed when parents are abroad and divorced/separated, when only one parent migrates, when children are in a stable care arrangement or when children receive remittances or not. The analyses show that the overall relationship between parental absence and education varies by the transnational dimension being analysed and by context.

T1  - The Globality of Whiteness in Post-Racial Visual Culture
AN  - 1784138917
AB  - This essay examines the spatial contours of post-racial visual culture. It argues that the 'post-racial' names the conditions under which racism operates flexibly within and beyond the logics of the colour line, while routinely disavowing its properly racial character through the symbolic deployment of multicultural humanitarianism. Even as it works through the figure of the 'post-racial' to bracket an engagement with the racialized rationale for the 'nongeneralizability of human value', the current US racial order has renovated the social structures that shore up whiteness as the privileged form humanity takes. The essay's point of departure is the iconic HOPE poster, produced by Shepard Fairey in 2008. It locates the poster's public display within a visual field subjected to neoliberal processes central to the constitution of a post-racial whiteness. It identifies two key moments in these processes. The first moment abstracts historical practices of materialist antiracism, such that racism becomes visualized as a manifestly individual subjective affair. In the second moment, post-racial visual culture repackages the visual logic of racial reference by displacing anti-black racism into morally benevolent categories suitable for humanitarian intervention, whose additional dematerialization is propped up by its migration to a digital terrain. To make this argument, the essay first offers a genealogy of the HOPE poster as it emerges from street art practices of commodity activism that obscure the structures of racial capitalism. It then treats the poster's central role in the 'KONY 2012' campaign, which redeployed this abstraction to recode the power of sight as a privileged form of US humanitarian violence. It concludes by considering the refusals by activists in the Occupy Wall Street movement to countenance a revised HOPE poster, even as the post-racial figure of 'the protestor' was lauded in corporate media.

T1  - Ethno-Class Distinctions and Reality (TV)
AN  - 1773421221
AB  - This article offers a cultural-sociological analysis of interpretations by viewers from different classes on the most popular reality show in Israel, namely, Big Brother. The findings of this study show dramatic differences in viewing practices according to class and ethnic distinctions of the viewers. Viewers from the upper socioeconomic class primarily addressed the way in which the subjects from the low socioeconomic class and marked ethnic groups appear in their eyes: that is, the processes affiliated with Othering. These ethno-class distinctions were translated into unique viewing practices: the identification of what are called, "cult moments" or "grotesque moments." These moments are depicted as ridiculing the "exaggerated" behavior of members of the low socioeconomic class and specific ethnic groups. Viewers from the low socioeconomic class offer more imminent (and less distant) perspectives on the Big Brother program. They relate to a broad spectrum of content that was broadcast in the program, identify with the participants from their group, criticize the judgments and the cultural hierarchies of marked group members, and describe how political anger accompanies their viewing of the reality program. The discussion section suggests the connection of these subjective interpretations and widespread cultural scenarios about class and ethnic identities.

T1  - Bad Sex, Good Love: Homonormativity in the Swedish Gay Press, 1969-86: Gay Lesbian Quarterly
AN  - 1754110811
AB  - We discuss "love" as a rhetorical strategy in the Swedish gay press, 1969-86, in relation to shifting meanings of sex and love. During this period, meanings of homosexual subjectivity were rapidly changing at several societal levels. New ideals of openness and monogamous love became more dominant and tended to exclude expressions of sexual practices based primarily on pleasure. Using the analytical terms unconditionedversus conditioned, we discern a shifting relative strength between discursive constructions of unconditioned sex/sex conditioned on love, and love for love's sake/love conditioned on coupledom.

T1  - "Of the two the Jew is - (Curtain falls.)" Sammy Gronemann's dramaturgy of the German-Jewish encounter in Palestine/Israel (1936-1952)
AN  - 1784140401
AB  - This paper presents the latest research on Sammy Gronemann (1875-1952), a key figure of early German Zionism and Hebrew Theatre. His transition from Germany to the Mandate of Palestine in 1936 influenced his literary oeuvre and transformed its technique of inter-cultural mediation and its satirical humour. In Palestine/Israel Gronemann became a successful playwright, contributing to the emerging modern Hebrew culture by writing its first milestone in comedy, King Solomon and Shalmai, the Cobbler (1942). My reading focuses on its dramaturgical strategy, whose roots I analyse and describe as 'dialectical empathy' in a comedy of errors between the stock-characters of a Jew and a Nazi from 1937 (Jacob and Christian).

T1  - The French secular hypocrisy: the extreme right, the Republic and the battle for hegemony
AN  - 1784145163
AB  - The success of the extreme right in France in the past two decades has not been limited to its electoral rise. A more long-lasting victory has taken place in the ideological field, where the discourse of the extreme right now occupies a prominent place in the mainstream liberal democratic agenda. Increasingly, its ideas are seen in the media and in the platforms of mainstream parties as 'common sense' or at least acceptable. The growing acceptance of this 'common sense' is the result of very carefully crafted strategies put in place by extreme-right thinkers since the 1980s. For over three decades now, in order to change perceptions and renew extreme right-wing ideology, New Right think tanks such as the French GRECE believed it was necessary to borrow the tactics of the left and, more specifically, the Gramscian concept of hegemony: cultural power must precede political power. With the use of contemporary examples, Mondon's article demonstrates the continuing impact these ideas have had on the Front national and French politics and society, and how this change originated in the association of populist rhetoric with the neo-racist stigmatization of the Other.

T1  - Ethnic Nationalities and the Peace Process in Myanmar
AN  - 1778375060
AB  - Myanmar is comprised of eight major ethnic groups: Bama/Myanma, Chin, Kachin, Kayin, Kayah, Mon, Rakhine, and Shan. In Myanmar's transition to democracy, each ethnic nationality plays a different role. The Bama/Myanma group is largely represented by the military, the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party, and the main opposition party, the National League for Democracy. Though others do join the Bama/Myanma-led parties, most ethnic minorities either form or join other ethnic-based political parties. After rounds of meetings and negotiations, some noticeable progress has been made in the peace process. Nonetheless, challenges remain, including an evident lack of trust between the ethnic armed groups and the government, especially the military. Though efforts continue to be made toward a nationwide cease-fire, both sides have accused each other of trying to delay the peace process. On the other hand, Lian Sakhong, a NCCT member and a supreme council member of the Chin National Front, said, they are truly committed to peace. They're truly, truly committed to a national cease-fire agreement.

T1  - Teaching & Learning Guide for 'The Conflictual Model of Analysis in Studies on the Media Representation of Islam and Muslims: A Critical Review'
AN  - 1735658446; 201537275
AB  - 'The Conflictual Model of Analysis in Studies on the Media Representation of Islam and Muslims: A Critical Review' was published in Sociology Compass 9/5 (2015) pp. 321-335, DOI: 10.1111/soc4.12264. This Teaching and Learning Guide is designed to accompany this article. In brief, the article examined the extent to which various studies on the media representation of Islam and Muslims use the conflictual model analysis that underpins theoretical frameworks, such as Orientalism, Clash of Civilisations, Cultural Racism and Islamophobia. It argued that in the context of a complex multicultural society, conflictual model of analysis is inadequate because it simply employs a binary way of thinking as clearly indicated in 'the West versus Islam' paradigm. In response to the inadequacy of this model of analysis, the article proposed an adoption of an alternative dialogical model of analysis in the light of the political theory of recognition. This guide provides useful information regarding the use of this article for teaching and learning purposes. It includes recommendation of readings, online resources, sample syllabus, focus questions and project idea. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Revolutionizing Cultural Pluralism: The Political Odyssey of Louis Adamic, 1932-1951
AN  - 1767325309; 201605921
AB  - Between May and September 1949, Nevada's ardent anti-communist Democratic senator Patrick A. McCarran chaired a subcommittee created to expose Soviet sympathizers within American ethnic communities. They targeted Slovene immigrant and best-selling author Louis Adamic because of his continued support for Yugoslav Communist guerrilla fighter and eventual dictator Josip Broz Tito. Over the previous two decades, Adamic had gained widespread acclaim for arguing that capitalist greed fomented working-class acts of sabotage, challenging Anglo-Saxon hegemony, and detailing the tyranny of the Serbian monarchy in Yugoslavia. By the time of his death in 1951-which his local New Jersey coroner ruled a suicide, but others insist was murder-Adamic had written thirteen books, over five hundred articles, and a number of pamphlets. His works appeared in magazines such as The Nation, New Republic, Harper's, and the The Saturday Evening Post. Academics assigned his books in their classes, Treasury Department officials used his stories on radio programs during World War II to sell war bonds, and presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman met with him at the White House to discuss immigrant patriotism and Tito's regime, respectively. Anti-Communists had no desire to put Adamic's work and activism into perspective. Affiliating with Communists, they insisted, made him a subversive.3. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - An Investigation of Body Appreciation, Ethnic Identity, and Eating Disorder Symptoms in Black Women
AN  - 1680153140; 201513917
AB  - Positive body image, such as body appreciation or acceptance, has gone largely unexamined in women of color in comparison with more pathological body attitudes. In an effort to promote and extend positive body image research, this study examined the reliability and validity of the Body Appreciation Scale (BAS) in Black college women, as well as the relation between ethnic identity and body appreciation. Participants were 228 Black college women (M age = 19.89, SD = 4.57). The relation between BAS scores and measures of appearance evaluation, self-esteem, Western beauty ideal internalization, eating disordered behavior, and teasing was examined to investigate convergent and divergent validity. Results supported the construct validity of this measure. Similar to previous research, a confirmatory factor analysis supported a unidimensional factor structure. Ethnic identity was moderately, positively associated with body appreciation. Western beauty ideal internalization mediated the relation between ethnic identity and eating, weight, and shape concerns. Overall, findings support the use of the BAS with Black college women.

T1  - Portraits of (Un)Settlement: Troubling Multicultural Masculinities in Dominique Hui's Quiet North and Kent Monkman's Shooting Geronimo: Gay Lesbian Quarterly
AN  - 1755543646
AB  - This essay considers the production of racialized masculinities in the contemporary artwork of the Singaporean-born queer diasporic artist Dominique Hui and the queer Aboriginal/Cree artist Kent Monkman. Recent debates in antiracist feminist, queer, and Native feminist scholarship illuminate how diasporic and Indigenous groups are unevenly positioned within a framework of neoliberal multiculturalism and settler state colonialism in the Americas. Accordingly, there are important distinctions in the way that queer diasporic and queer Native artists respond to and challenge hetero- and homonormative models of citizenship in Canada. I examine how Hui's and Monkman's works reflect and mediate the interactions of multiple racialized masculinities in an identity-driven and individualized culture of neoliberalism and global consumer capitalism. Overall, I suggest that applying Native feminist critiques to a relational analysis of queer diasporic and Indigenous masculinities can unsettle and imagine new possibilities for "multicultural" solidarity in Canada -- and beyond.

T1  - The Distributions of Whiteness
AN  - 1761679862; 201602184
AB  - At some point whiteness became less rigid and more adaptive. Rather than continue to scoff at the idea that it was not alone in the world, it learned to acknowledge the presence of particularities and indeed regard itself as a particularity as well. In gestures of unprecedented self-deprecation, it would even prostrate itself on silver screens, television shows, and comedic stages. Yielding to the most lacerating academic scrutiny, it would offer itself as the basis for an eponymous field of study to emerge. And yet despite-or perhaps even because of-its newfound sense of humility, one cannot help but feel that a sleight of hand has occurred. Notwithstanding its 'newfound introspection,' whiteness has yet to demand the one thing required of genuine self-criticism-redistribution. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Can a Mestica be a Haafu? Japanese-Brazilian Female Migrants and the Celebration of Racial Mixing in Contemporary Japan
AN  - 1667946886; 201509659
AB  - This paper reveals how young Japanese-Brazilian female migrants living and working in 'contact zones' construct and negotiate their identities where they are categorised and expected to carry out certain behaviours/performances. It does so by drawing on interviews of Japanese-Brazilian models working in Japan. After arriving in Japan, Japanese-Brazilian female migrants learn that being mestica in Brazil can be valorised as 'haafu', and they aspire to work as haafu moderu ('fashion model') for Japanese print media. It will be shown that the labelling of Japanese-Brazilian fashion models as haafu functions as a mode of inclusion in Japanese society, but it also functions as a mode of exclusion if they fail to perform the haafu that mainstream Japanese expect.

T1  - Immigrants' Participation in Voting: Exposure, Resilience, and Transferability
AN  - 1667952309; 201509658
AB  - Resilience, exposure and transferability are the most common explanations of immigrant political mobilisation in the context of the host society. They are based on assumptions about socialisation and institutionalisation, which are common to native-born groups as well. They lead to hypotheses about the impact of 'cultures of voting turnout.' This paper tests these hypotheses through cross-classified multilevel logistic regression analysis of immigrants' voting intentions. The method is new to the analysis of voting behaviour, and allows the comparison of immigrants of multiple origin groups in multiple host countries. This paper provides support for exposure effects: living in a society where most people cast ballots in national elections increases the odds that immigrants are willing to vote. Transferability is not evident, as coming from a culture of high turnout actually lowers the probability of voting. Such impact is not mediated by the length of stay or by the political opportunity structure specific to immigrants, but is stronger in systems of compulsory voting. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Digitally Enhanced? Mediated Migration and 'Fourth Wave' Chileans in Australia
AN  - 1660021072; 201505585
AB  - This paper examines the contemporary experience of migration for Chileans arriving in Australia in the last two decades. It specifically explores the increasing role of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) and its mediating effects on experiences of departure, arrival, 'being' and 'belonging'. In doing so, the paper considers some of the tensions between 'hyper-digital' transnationalism and dominant discourses of nationalism. The findings indicate diversity of experience, but highlight that these recent Chilean migrants utilise ICT to suspend and manage physical relocation and to engage both on and offline with wide and shallow networks of Chileans and non-Chileans in local and transnational spaces. At the same time, they reflect a more cultural, issues-based orientation towards the structural and discursive dimensions of migration in both 'home' and 'host' countries suggesting that ICT is imbricated in wider processes of distancing the 'migrant' from the national core. This highlights some of the possibilities and limitations of 'hyper-digital' transnationalism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Work Attitudes of Mexican Americans: A Decade of Improvement
AN  - 1700676681; 201525345
AB  - Weaver compared the work attitudes of Mexican Americans and Euro-Americans with data from 19 nationwide public opinion surveys. He found Mexican Americans productive, cooperative, and networking with a strong sense of work ethic and job satisfaction. Since 2000, the Mexican American population has grown by 57% to 32.9 million. It is more native born, more proficient in English, better educated, more often in important jobs, and has spread across the country. Yet, many live in poverty, and their labor force participation and median household income have declined. To investigate whether their work attitudes have been affected, Weaver's study was replicated with data from three recent nationwide public opinion surveys to compare 326 Mexican Americans and 2,166 Euro-Americans. The results showed Mexican American work attitudes had become even more favorable. The findings placed beyond doubt the question of whether the work attitudes of Mexican Americans limit their contributions to organizational effectiveness.

T1  - Narcocorridos and newbie drug dealers: the changing image of the Mexican Narco on US television
AN  - 1660023694; 201505667
AB  - As a Spanish-language broadcast programme based on a sympathetic Mexican character who also happens to be a drug kingpin, La Reina del Sur negotiates the perilous terrain of the European drug trade and an omnipresent hostility directed at Mexicans. As cable programmes with the industrial freedom to venture into spaces in between prosocial and antisocial, Weeds and Breaking Bad attempt to incorporate a more nuanced and culturally informed characterization of the Mexican drug dealer - one that notably impacts the relationship of the white protagonists to their new occupations as producers and dealers of illegal substances. These three series - produced independently of one another and distributed on three different networks - have crossed paths in a manner that can be revealed through the intricacies of a controversial and complex cultural artifact: the narcocorrido.

T1  - Doing the Business: Variegation, Opportunity and Intercultural Experience among Intra-EU Highly-Skilled Migrants
AN  - 1559005599; 201431995
AB  - Focusing on the working experiences of the French highly skilled in London's financial and business sectors, this paper examines the impact of ongoing pan-European variegation on intra-EU highly skilled migration in two key respects: firstly, in its role as a driver for mobility, through its association with divergent opportunity structures across different nations and regions; and secondly, as a potential obstacle to the successful realization of such opportunities, post migration, where mobility exposes the highly skilled migrant to new and embedded forms of difference. Such differences necessitate adaptations, and the acquisition of new inter-cultural competencies, that go on to mediate the experience, evaluations and outcomes of such opportunity-driven mobilities. In unpacking the particularities associated with the mobilities of specific populations (the French), to specific places (London) we seek to contribute to a people and place-sensitive understanding of the relationship between spatial mobility and social mobility. Policy Implications EU policymakers need to consider the nature and impact of ongoing variegation on highly skilled mobility within Europe and the problems of non-transferability of human capital that this may produce. Highly skilled migration is crucial to sustaining the global talent pool that defines the London economy. Regional interests need to work with businesses and national policymakers to support and develop the opportunities, currently associated with London, for talented migrants to enhance their human capital. Businesses need to enhance the inter-cultural competencies of all staff to facilitate working practices for effectiveness, productivity and fairness. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - From 'De-wogged' Migrants to 'Rabble Rousers': Mapping the Indian Diaspora in Australia
AN  - 1551001240; 201429015
AB  - This article maps the trajectory of Indian migration broadly, and specifically to Australia, to first highlight the heterogeneity of the Indian diaspora, and second, to comprehend the impact of this heterogeneity on the homeland alongside recent events involving the diaspora, such as the highly publicised attacks on Indian students in Melbourne in 2009-2010. While there is abundant literature on the history of Indian migration, as well as on diasporic identity formations in a globalising context, the Indian-Australian migrant subject is a recent subject of media and academic interest. The 'new racisms' perspective is used to examine the mediation of the student attack issue through the comments of 'integrated' Indian-Australians in a random sample of Australian media outlets. Feature articles, news items and opinion pieces appearing in the media covering the student attacks are examined for mentions of, and comments from a carefully selected group of professional Indians living in Australia who are often cast as a 'model minority'. Conclusions are then drawn on how the remediation of India and its newly assertive commercial media offered by these comments effectively redraws a nation previously receiving limited coverage (literally and discursively) in Australia. What is significant here is not merely the 'de-wogged' views of a seemingly integrated minority, but also how oppositional readings (by way of diasporic cultural production) signal a way forward for the Indian diaspora's representation in Australia, as well as for its relations with both the home and host societies.

T1  - Organising Muslims and Integrating Islam: Applying Organisational Sociology to the Study of Islamic Organisations
AN  - 1541997748; 201426945
AB  - Since 9/11, Islamic organisations have been expected to function as integration facilitators, as 24-hour contact partners for politics and media, and as counter-terrorism activists. How does this affect these organisations? And what are their desires for their members in this context? In contrast to existing studies, this research closely examines the perspective of Islamic umbrella organisations vis-a-vis their changing political and institutional environments. It analyses their organisational behaviour from an innovative research perspective based on organisational sociology. Through a comparative analysis of three major Islamic umbrella organisations in Germany, distinct patterns of organisational behaviour emerge. While politicians wish for organisational adaptation to their expectations, the study also reveals a potential for decoupling and protest behaviour due to conflicting member interests and a perceived lack of external resource opportunities. Organisational protest is mainly directed at the securitisation and islamification of integration debates, and the often rather symbolic politics of cooperation and recognition. At the same time, legitimacy and efficiency considerations can explain why Islamic organisations attempt to overcome internal disputes when trying to satisfy political expectations. The paper also outlines open research questions and critically discusses possible future developments within this emerging organisational field. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The weight of words: the freedom of expression debate in Norway
AN  - 1542001773; 201426842
AB  - A confluence of interests and forces among Norwegian political, media and legal elites since the Rushdie affair and the 'Mohammed cartoon crisis' have created conditions in which minority protections against racist and discriminatory speech as guaranteed by Norwegian law, and Norwegian obligations under international law, have been rendered all but ineffective -- in the name of stronger protections for freedom of expression. In the event, Islamophobia and anti-Muslim racism have not only often gone unchallenged, but have been amplified and disseminated both through the extreme rightwing presence on the internet, and in mainstream and respected Norwegian print media. The ideology of Anders Breivik, perpetrator of the massacre of 22/7/2011, was not isolated, but forms part of a larger and by many accounts growing phenomenon. Successive government commissions on freedom of expression in Norway have only exacerbated this tendency. This article explores the philosophical and political underpinnings of the freedom of expression debate in Norway and warns about the threat to liberal democracy and equal citizenship from the sanitising and mainstreaming of virulent far-right racism and extremism.

T1  - Challenging a culture of racial equivalence
AN  - 1531932711; 201423378
AB  - We live at a time when our understandings and conceptualizations of 'racism' are often highly imprecise, broad, and used to describe a wide range of racialized phenomena. In this article, I raise some important questions about how the term racism is used and understood in contemporary British society by drawing on some recent cases of alleged racism in football and politics, many of which have been played out via new media technologies. A broader understanding of racism, through the use of the term 'racialization', has been helpful in articulating a more nuanced and complex understanding of racial incidents, especially of people's (often ambivalent) beliefs and behaviours. However, the growing emphasis upon 'racialization' has led to a conceptualization of racism which increasingly involves multiple perpetrators, victims, and practices without enough consideration of how and why particular interactions and practices constitute racism as such. The trend toward a growing culture of racial equivalence is worrying, as it denudes the idea of racism of its historical basis, severity and power. These frequent and commonplace assertions of racism in the public sphere paradoxically end up trivializing and homogenizing quite different forms of racialized interactions. I conclude that we need to retain the term 'racism', but we need to differentiate more clearly between 'racism' (as an historical and structured system of domination) from the broader notion of 'racialization'.

T1  - Tuning in to the RTLM: Tracking the Evolution of Language Alongside the Rwandan Genocide Using Social Identity Theory
AN  - 1512220743; 201409983
AB  - Transcripts from radio broadcasts that aired in pre-, early-, and late-genocide Rwanda were content analyzed from a social identity theory perspective to examine whether language use was consistent with theoretical predictions. The data yielded by these analyses (N = 59) are noteworthy because the broadcasters on this station were eventually charged with war crimes for inciting and endorsing the violence between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups. The results from this study found that the transcripts contained language in support of theory such that the Tutsi out-group was increasingly dehumanized as the conflict escalated, the Tutsi were blamed for their fate-while the Hutu were presented as victims of the violence, and an overt prejudice that was initially directed at Tutsi rebel group grew to include all Tutsi people near the end of this conflict. These data provide compelling support for the communication processes that arise within intergroup conflict situations and support the continued application of social identity theory to real-world situations.

T1  - GLOBALIZATION: CULTURAL TRANSMISSION OF RACISM
AN  - 1767328537; 201605960
AB  - Globalization is examined by theorists such as, Iammanuel Wallerstein, Anthony Giddens, Martin Wolf, Thomas Friedman, Manuel Castells, David Held, Anthony McGrew, and Paul Hirst. However, globalization remains a significant subject area to analyze, theorize, and to empiric. In general, globalization is a contested topic within the field of social sciences through its various meanings. The topic of cultural transmission is a component of globalization; however, this topic has not been examined within all forms of transmission. For example, a critique of cultural transmission is examined through the transmission of racial bias, stereotypes, and prejudice. As a result, there are three central components of this literature review: description of globalization, description of racial bias, and the interconnectedness of cultural transmission through globalization in the form of racial bias. In addition, racial bias transmission is examined through the use of the mass media. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Mediating Role of Racial Socialization Processes on the Relations Between Organized Activity Involvement and Black Racial Identity
AN  - 1728660817; 201534244
AB  - The aim of the study was two-fold: First, the researcher sought to examine the direct links between organized activity involvement and multiple domains of Black racial identity (i.e., assimilation, miseducation, self-hatred, anti-white sentiment, Afrocentricity, multi-culturalist inclusivity) as evident on the Cross Racial Identity Scale (CRIS). Second, given the possibility racial socialization may occur in organized activity contexts, the researcher investigated various forms of racial socialization (i.e., alertness to racism, racial and religious coping, cultural legacy, cultural pride, interracial coping) as potential mediators of these activity-identity links. All study data was gathered from students at a Historically Black College or University. Evidence for direct and partially mediated associations between organized activity and racial identity were reported. Results are discussed and recommendations for future research are offered.

T1  - Multicultural attitudes mediate the relation between personality and perceived ethnic outgroup distance in the Netherlands
AN  - 1559008029; 201432206
AB  - We focus in the current study on associations between personality, multicultural attitudes, and perceived ethnic outgroup distance in the Netherlands. Data were collected among four different ethnic groups (from low to high in terms of ethnic hierarchy): Turkish/Moroccan-Dutch, Antillean/Surinamese-Dutch, Mixed Western immigrants, and Dutch majority group members. We found support for a mediation model in which in all groups multicultural attitudes mediate the relation between personality traits, education level, and age as antecedents, and outgroup distance as outcome; age was the only antecedent that also had a direct effect on outcome. Education was positively related to multiculturalism in the groups high in the hierarchy and unrelated in the groups low in the hierarchy. The association between multicultural attitudes and outgroup distance was negative and stronger for the groups higher in the ethnic hierarchy; hierarchy was unrelated to outgroup distance. Groups higher in the hierarchy scored lower on multicultural attitudes. It was concluded that multicultural attitudes and outgroup distance are important for understanding intergroup dynamics in ethnically diverse societies. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - A Reflection on a Participatory Video Project: Possibilities and Challenges for Promoting Participatory Cultures among Adult Learners
AN  - 1680153927; 201514105
AB  - The recent media environment offers a great opportunity for people to create and share messages through ubiquitous connections. In doing so, they may be participating in shaping their cultures. This potential, however, is crippled for some because not everyone has proper media production skills, especially those who may need the skills most to bring out their experiences and perspectives through media. Therefore, it is necessary to provide people with educational opportunities to develop their media production skills. Within this context, I conducted a video project with a group of adults for 5 weeks in order to offer them an opportunity to develop their video production skills and express their common concerns through video, in hopes of promoting participatory cultures. In this article, I reflect on the processes and outcomes of the project and elucidate the challenges that I encountered. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Finally a 'Taste for Diversity'? National Identity, Consumer Discrimination, and the Multi-ethnic German National Football Team
AN  - 1550999914; 201429055
AB  - Persistent immigration towards industrialized countries has challenged traditional conceptions of citizenship. In Germany, immigration has visibly changed the ethic fabric of the national football team, which is one of the few national post-war icons. Although some commentators consider the team to be a role model for successful integration of immigrants, unanimous approval of a multi-ethnic team would be surprising, given substantial xenophobic tendencies in Germany. Therefore, by analysing regional TV ratings, we examine consumer discrimination against the presence of ethnic out-group players in the national football team and explore how such discrimination relates to discriminatory attitudes. We find some but limited evidence for consumer discrimination but also for a trend towards a 'taste for diversity', suggesting that the audience gets used to a multi-ethnic team. While identity politics seems to be important for sport consumption, the links between sport, identity, consumer discrimination, and discriminatory attitudes seem more complex than initially assumed.

T1  - Co-ethnic preferences in a cooking game: a study based on Come Dine With Me in Sweden
AN  - 1520341125; 201412850
AB  - This study examines ethnic preferences using data from the television cooking show Come Dine With Me in Sweden. Amateur chefs compete by hosting dinner parties. Contestants rate each others' performance and the host with the highest ratings wins a cash prize. The show gives an unorthodox opportunity to study ethnic preferences in a high-stakes game environment. The analysis of the collected data shows that native Swedish contestants rate co-ethnic hosts significantly more favourably than they rate other hosts, demonstrating the existence of co-ethnic preferences. This observation seems to be an outcome of own-group favouritism rather than dislike against other groups. Also, the observed co-ethnic preference is assumed to be subtle or non-conscious based on the nature of the analysed data. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1512220470; 201408869
AB  - This article examines sources of migrant social capital (i.e. social networks and institutional assistance) that facilitated destination selection among African American migrants to a US southern metropolitan area-Charlotte, North Carolina. Charlotte is an emerging magnet city in the net in-migration of blacks to the US South since the 1970s. While research on black migration to the South suggests that family ties assist migrants in selecting destinations, scholars speculate that family ties are less important for migrants of high socio-economic status, who are born outside the South or who move to urban areas. Using qualitative narrative interviews with non-southern-born black migrants to Charlotte, this study identifies other sources of assistance that route blacks to their destination-employers, educational institutions (especially historically black colleges) and the ethnic media. Working-class migrants relied primarily on family and friends when selecting their destination, but middle-class migrants relied on a broader range of sources. Implications for theory about how class shapes the destination selection process are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Of saints and sinners: How appeals to collective pride and guilt affect outgroup helping
AN  - 1504424035; 201405307
AB  - We examined how appeals to collective guilt and pride can motivate people to help members of a disadvantaged outgroup. Results from two experiments supported the prediction that appeals to collective pride are more effective than appeals to collective guilt in prompting high identifying group members', but not low identifying group members' willingness to help the outgroup. Study 2 demonstrated that, as expected, pride appeals generated more empathy for the disadvantaged group than guilt appeals, particularly among high identifiers, and empathy mediated the relationship between emotional appeals and helping. The results complement existing research on collective guilt by demonstrating how high identifiers can be persuaded to help members of a disadvantaged outgroup even in the context of historical harmdoings.

T1  - PUBLIC TALES WAG THE DOG
AN  - 1520342602; 201413439
AB  - This essay examines the case of Kelley Williams-Bolar-an African American single mother from Akron, Ohio-who in 2011 was arrested, charged with a felony, and jailed for sending her two daughters to a predominantly White suburban public school in Copley Township without meeting the township's residency requirements. This essay closely examines the case with particular attention paid to the important but often unacknowledged intersections of race, gender, economic privilege, spatial containment, and racialized criminalization that shaped the case. The Williams-Bolar case became a public site of contesting narratives, some obscuring these intersections, others acknowledging them. Those who supported Copley Township's prosecution of Williams-Bolar relied on a law and order mandate and fiscal responsibility that supported the dominant racial narrative while appearing to be race, gender, and class neutral. But many were critical of Williams-Bolar's arrest and the story used to justify it. Their response was a massive and heated online challenge that inspired existing and newly outraged parents and educational activists from a wide range of backgrounds, triggering petitions signed by hundreds of thousands of people requesting that the Governor of Ohio pardon Williams-Bolar. This essay places the case in the context of what I call the 'invisible intersections of colorblind racism,' the racial privileges of housing and educational resource hoarding via private property taxes for suburban upper-middle-class Whites and the expanded application of the criminalization of the Black poor to Black mothers who receive state assistance by the judicial system, in political discourse and mass media narrative. Williams-Bolar's supporters used the power of social media to build community activism and to generate alternative narratives that countered the discursive and structural forces that were at work. Finally, this article considers the value and impact of alternative narratives about Williams-Bolar and her actions as generated by supporters. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Reconstructing Moral Identities in Memories of Childhood Language Brokering Experiences
AN  - 1494751562; 201401986
AB  - Language brokering is a common phenomenon, whereby children of immigrant parents mediate both verbally and with written documents between their parents and other different language speakers or writers, converting meanings in one language into meanings in another. This paper explores some of the moral identities -- the interplay between moral ideals and individuals' personal identities -- adults construct from their memories of their activities as child language brokers. Qualitative research on adults who were, and to a large extent still are, language brokers for their parents, found that in the context of parent-teacher meetings, some individuals recast their behaviours in a manner that rendered themselves as good, honest, ethical and well-behaved students. This paper argues that the moral identities individuals construct from memories of their childhood experiences have social and cultural dimensions, and are contingent upon the context and the situation. The paper also has policy implications with regards to the status of the child, and the relationship of that status to cultural context and expectation, given that the circumstances of their lives cannot be removed. Regarding policy, this research could inform practitioners, schools, and the general public about the impact of language brokering experiences on children, and may help in some way to alleviate the stress/burdens associated with language brokering. Additionally, it could bring about increasing understanding of how people establish identities based on their lived experiences. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Diaspora, Digital Media, and Death Counts: Eritreans and the Politics of Memorialisation
AN  - 1463011631; 201345755
AB  - This article analyses a war memorial established on a website by Eritreans in diaspora as an example of how diasporas are transforming the ways national politics are conducted and understood. Establishing a war memorial is normally the prerogative and responsibility of the state. In performing this task the Eritrean diaspora makes visible the failure of the state to make public important national information and to hold itself accountable to the Eritrean people. The establishment of the memorial online by the diaspora, furthermore, works to de-centre the state, symbolically at least, as the embodiment of the nation and creates an opening for alternative visions of the nation and state-citizen relations. The Internet is making possible innovative forms of diaspora political engagement and activism that challenge conventional relations of citizenship and sovereignty. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - From Love to Melancholy: The Evolution of the Black Bohemian Identity in Black Indie Love Films From Gen-X to Gen-Y
AN  - 1463008585; 201345747
AB  - The Black bohemian is a largely overlooked character in both "Black" and White Hollywood despite an established subculture that has existed for years. This article looks at how Black American bohemian identity in two independent love films has evolved from the segregated world of Generation-X in Love Jones to the integrated world of two young millennial Black bohemians in Medicine for Melancholy. Using the markers of culture, space, and politics, this article posits that while we can read major superficial changes in the way Black bohemian identity has evolved between Generation-X and Generation-Y using these two films, on a fundamental level, Hollywood has not changed in its depictions of alternative Black life and love and continues to rely on the cliche tropes of a monolithic Black identity.

T1  - Ka Tzij: The Maya diasporic voices from Contacto Ancestral
AN  - 1448995932; 201342824
AB  - This article explores the ways in which the Los Angeles-based Maya radio show Contacto Ancestral challenges the processes of Americanization carried by local and national state entities and reinforced through mainstream Spanish and English-language media. It specifically addresses how the program carves an audible space in the city's airwaves, and on the World Wide Web, to reaffirm a Maya identity that also vindicates indigenous cultural, political and economic rights. In doing so, Contacto Ancestral creates a space from which Mayas can maintain an audible local and hemispheric memory, which is simultaneously attuned to contemporary Pan-Indigenous, immigrant and human rights movements. Through the constructions of an audible "community archive," to use cultural studies scholar Ann Cvetkovich's term, Contacto Ancestral preserves the voices and everyday histories of specifically Maya, but also indigenous and non-indigenous diasporic communities in the United States. Thus, the staff members, and listeners, of Contacto Ancestral provide a model for the affirmation of diverse diasporic and transnational identities. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Community Worker Perspectives on the Use of New Media to Reconfigure Socio-spatial Relations in Belfast
AN  - 1315600584; 201308326
AB  - Cyber enthusiasts as far back as Rheingold have suggested that cyberspatial technologies such as the Internet have the potential to transform space-time relations and create new social spaces, thus ameliorating social conflict in contested areas. However, a more sceptical view of cyberspatial communication is provided by Hampton, who argues that on-line interactions cannot be artifically separated from their off-line contexts. This article will analyse whether these technologies are changing the nature of territorial disputes and patterns of social interaction between Protestant and Catholic interface communities in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Interviews were conducted with nine community workers to investigate this issue. Focusing on the possibility of using social media to facilitate intergroup contact, the paper argues that on-line interactions alone do not appear to have the potential to build mutual understanding and trust between rival interface communities. Indeed, community workers fear that may young people use these sites to exacerbate intercommunity tensions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racializing Redemption, Reproducing Racism: The Odyssey of Magical Negroes and White Saviors
AN  - 1322717898; 201310768
AB  - Recent research on the intersection of race and media describes a trend of progressive, even antiracist, narratives that showcase close inter-racial friendships and camaraderie on the silver screen. Films in which one character saves or helps another from some unholy or disastrous plight are common in films like The Green Mile (1999), Bruce Almighty (2003), Amistad (1997) and The Blind Side (2009). While these films present a stark change from the patently racist and on-screen segregationist history of Hollywood cinema, these films often trade on racist meanings and expectations. Many of these films are what critics call "Magical Negro" or "White Savior" films -- cinema in which implicit and explicit racial stereotypes are employed to structure the inter-racial interactions where one character labors to redeem another. In comparing these two genres, this article provides an overview for how both cinematic forms reproduce racist messages by naturalizing the supposed cerebral rationality, work ethic, and paternalistic morality of select White characters while normalizing Black characters as primordially connected with nature, spiritually connected to the carnal, and possessive of exotic and magical powers. Together, these films subversively reaffirm the social order and relations of racial domination by reproducing centuries' old understandings of racial difference. Adapted from the source document.

In India, unexpectedly, the resulting competitive setting produced multiple channels targeting various local ethnicities from below along with national-level expansion involving transnational corporations from above in a process now known as localization. While the plurality of channels translates into growth of the public sphere, this paper examines the reasons behind the uneven growth of community media, which cannot be explained by the community's size or economic resources. Some community channels extend their reach into the national arena while others lag in media development implying unequal political participation in the communicative system. What are the institutional reasons behind such variations in a multiethnic setting? The paper also examines whether the development of ethnic media reflects the redistribution of power taking place in the political arena or is it an independent development with implications of its own.

T1  - Low Expectations or Different Evaluations: What Explains Immigrants' High Levels of Trust in Host-Country Institutions
AN  - 1347781752; 201318886
AB  - Several recent studies show that immigrants exhibit higher levels of trust in public institutions than natives. This study uses pooled data from the European Social Survey to examine possible reasons for this 'over-confidence' of immigrants, arguing that it is largely the relatively lower expectations of immigrants from countries with poorer institutional performance that account for this difference. The eminent role of expectations is also underscored by the finding that low social standing matters less for the level of trust of immigrants than it does for natives. The 'frame of reference effect' weakens over time and with increased acculturation in the country of residence, suggesting that expectations are less-strongly based on experiences in the country of origin the better integrated an immigrant is in the country of residence. Small parts of Immigrants' higher trust levels and of the dual frames of reference effect are mediated by the more conservative value orientations of immigrants from countries with lower political stability, who appear to regard stability and conformity more highly. However, the overall pattern of effects indicates that lower rather than different expectations explain Immigrants' higher levels of institutional trust. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Photographing Handsworth: photography, meaning and identity in a British inner city
AN  - 1283644041; 201303284
AB  - 'If you say "Handsworth",' the novelist Salman Rushdie remarked in 1986, 'what do you see? Most people would see fire, riots, looted shops ... and helmeted cops ... a front page story.' In the 1980s, 'front page' images of violence and disorder had come to define areas of black settlement such as Handsworth. However, for both Stuart Hall and Paul Gilroy, photography has the potential of unearthing alternative histories of black people in Britain. Connell explores how this might work in practice by taking Handsworth, an inner-city area of Birmingham, as its case study. Following the Handsworth riots in 1985, a photograph of the 'black bomber' appeared on the front page of every national tabloid newspaper, and Handsworth became conceptualized by the media as 'Frontline Britain'. At the same time, there are numerous examples of photographs from within Handsworth that attempt to present a different view of the community: images taken at high-street portraiture studios, community photography projects and the documentary work of the professional photographers Vanley Burke and Pogus Caesar. What such images offer the historian, it will be shown, is not clear cut. Photographs from within Handsworth are suggestive of possible themes in any alternative history of race in Britain, particularly in their emphasis on everyday life. However, Connell shows that it is also necessary to understand what is often the unacknowledged politics behind these images, something that makes them-in differing ways-as problematic as the stereotypical narratives presented on the front pages of tabloid newspapers.

T1  - Immigration and National Identity in Obama's America: The Expansion of Culture-War Politics
AN  - 1373427616; 201328768
AB  - The culture-war issues salient in US politics in the 1990s and early 2000s were typified by debates over the legality and morality of abortion and same-sex marriage. Immigration, in contrast, has been an intermittent issue, not as polarized as many others. That changed with the candidacy and then election of Barack Obama to the presidency. While anti-abortion and "pro-family" activism has continued, there is a new public focus on a vision of "America" that depends upon a conflation of race, religion, and national identity. This has helped transform immigration into a highly charged, highly polarized culture-war-style issue and has facilitated the lasting resonance of the construction of Obama as Muslim, as born in Kenya, as not a citizen, and as both a socialist and a fascist simultaneously. Drawing on popular media discourse and material from Tea Party and immigration reform web sites, I explore the construction of American national identity in terms of its ethno-cultural articulations.

T1  - Limits to Speech? The Racialised Politics of Gendered Violence in Denmark and Finland
AN  - 1364699968; 201323454
AB  - The 'crisis of multiculturalism' discourse characterises the current political and media debates in many European countries. This paper analyses how liberal arguments, especially gender equality and freedom of speech, are used to promote nationalist and racialising political agendas in Denmark and Finland. It detects the powerful emergence of a nationalist rhetoric, based on the 'politics of reversal' and a re-articulation of liberal notions, in the Nordic countries, which have been known for their collectivist welfare state models and commitments to social equality. Through an analysis of case studies in both countries, the paper shows how debates about gendered violence in Muslim families turn into attempts to broaden the discursive space for racialising speech and to individualise racism.

T1  - Deportation as a Process of Irreversible Transformation
AN  - 1023030514; 201223921
AB  - Based on life stories from 24 deported Jamaican immigrants and extensive examination of secondary data from nearly 1 million historical newspaper pages in The Gleaner's online archives (years 1834 to 2008), this article argues that the deportation of Jamaican immigrants from the US is an emblematic case of transformation which is, in fact, irreversible. In the literature, the term 'transformation' is used to describe the radical changes and rapid adjustments which immigrants are forced to make in order to become American. This article contributes to the forced-return migration literature by pointing out that some immigrants' identities are transformed from 'voluntary migrant' to 'deportee', and their transformation into deportees is a process which can begin soon after immigrants make attempts to achieve their American dreams of socio-economic mobility. In the absence of the requisite familial support and financial and human capital, some immigrants experience sharp socio-economic decline, run foul of the law, are removed from the US and irreversibly prevented by force of law from returning. On the migrants' return to Jamaica, the deportation process does not end, as local media and countrymen facilitate the irreversible identity transformation process which was started in the US by referring to subjects as 'deportees' and associating them with a lack of capital and an involvement in criminal activity.

T1  - Does diversity damage corporate value? Measuring stock price reactions to a diversity award
AN  - 1037875401; 201231034
AB  - Corporate decision-makers have increasingly adopted an approach to firm governance that places share value above other concerns, including meeting the needs of employees. Decision-makers' concerns about shareholder interests may potentially impede internal commitments to implementing diversity-friendly practices and policies. This study analyses how recognition for a company's diversity efforts impacts corporate share price. We rely on data of share price fluctuation following the receipt of Fortune Magazine's 'Best Companies for Minorities' Award. We find that companies recognized for their diversity efforts are penalized with a significant decline in share price, though this negative effect is mediated by the ethnic composition of the company's workforce.

T1  - NEIGHBORHOOD DISORDER AND INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY CAPACITY: HOW INCIVILITIES INFORM THREE DOMAINS OF PSYCHOSOCIAL ASSESSMENT
AN  - 919903559; 201201717
AB  - This article examines contextual models to bring together the disorder and community capacity perspectives, since both are grounded in social (dis)organization theory and cumulative causation. We analyze how individual and neighborhood characteristics, social and physical disorder, and crime affect three individual community capacity outcomes: city quality of life, neighborhood safety, and household moving intentions. The "broken windows" downward spiral suggests that neighborhood incivilities may decrease multiple psychosocial assessments, or, individual community capacities. Consistent with prior research, we find that social and physical disorder decreases all three outcomes. Second, we find that both disorders also mediate neighborhood effects, including socioeconomic status and residential stability. Third, these direct and indirect disorder effects are not altered by prior victimization or neighborhood crime rates. Reducing disorder will, in turn, improve three distinct domains and geographic scales of individual community capacity, and can also reduce the adverse effects of other local area capacity deficits.

T1  - Mobilising Images: Encounters of 'Forced' Migrants and the Bangladesh War of 1971
AN  - 1081863488; 201235318
AB  - In trying to outline the relationship between mobilities and cosmopolitanism, the nation state is always posited by scholars against cosmopolitanism. Mobility of images however, instead of denationalising spaces in fact fortifies the stereotypes of different territories. The cosmopolitan outlook that is deemed to be inherent to critical mobilities can identify with these mobile images and ideas precisely because of what is already perceived about a certain country. The article examines how the mobile images of the 'Help Bangladesh' poster and the concert in 1971, reinforces a certain representation of East Pakistan/Bangladesh as only poor and starving. It is this fixing of the image of the nation through mobile images which also comes into play when considering the concept of 'forced' migration. In trying to unpick and critique the so called the disjunction between the idea of 'forced' migration and migration by 'choice', in this article I focus on the encounter between middle class refugees, the poor and the raped migrant woman of the Bangladesh war of 1971 and the resulting displacement. The documentary Muktir Gaan (Songs of Freedom 1995) -- billed as a documentary and a 'road movie' imbued with adventure, eroticism, pain and prospect of freedom -- is the lens through which the paper highlights the encounter between different 'forced' migrants as a result of war and its resultant implications for a sociology of mobilities. It also allows an examination of the political economy of different 'forced' migrants, their classed and gendered locations. By focusing on romanticism linked to the idea of the adventure of war, the paper reveals who can be mobile or not and the conditions under which this mobility is made possible. In the process, the paper questions the potential of a global economy of signs to nurture a transnational civil society and global public. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1030869035; 201227781
AB  - This paper offers a translation of key texts by the contemporary Mouvement des Indigenes de la Republique(MIR) and its key intellectuals: Sadri Khiari and Houria Bouteldja. Following Khiari, post-colonial situations are best understood as recompositions: territorially mediated re-articulations of colonial pasts with other social relations. To respond to the complexities of this post-colonial recomposition, MIR propose an ambitious politics of "autonomy" and "mixity". "Autonomy" (externally in relationship to the state and organized politics and internally for feminist groups) is seen as an indispensable precondition for a socio-politically mixed, and potentially universalizing, political formation politics. More counter-colonial than post-colonial in orientation (Hallward), MIR attempt to give direction to three decades of revolt emanating from France's racialized popular neighbourhoods, including the uprising of 2005. I argue that MIR's interventions take up themes from the analyses by Frantz Fanon, Albert Memmi and Suzanne and Aime Cesaire to make countercolonial critique "live" in France today.

T1  - Evidence That Gendered Wording in Job Advertisements Exists and Sustains Gender Inequality
AN  - 925714343; 201206801
AB  - Social dominance theory (Sidanius & Pratto, 1999) contends that institutional-level mechanisms exist that reinforce and perpetuate existing group-based inequalities, but very few such mechanisms have been empirically demonstrated. We propose that gendered wording (i.e., masculine- and feminine-themed words, such as those associated with gender stereotypes) may be a heretofore unacknowledged, institutional-level mechanism of inequality maintenance. Employing both archival and experimental analyses, the present research demonstrates that gendered wording commonly employed in job recruitment materials can maintain gender inequality in traditionally male-dominated occupations. Studies 1 and 2 demonstrated the existence of subtle but systematic wording differences within a randomly sampled set of job advertisements. Results indicated that job advertisements for male-dominated areas employed greater masculine wording (i.e., words associated with male stereotypes, such as leader, competitive, dominant) than advertisements within female-dominated areas. No difference in the presence of feminine wording (i.e., words associated with female stereotypes, such as support, understand, interpersonal) emerged across male- and female-dominated areas. Next, the consequences of highly masculine wording were tested across 3 experimental studies. When job advertisements were constructed to include more masculine than feminine wording, participants perceived more men within these occupations (Study 3), and importantly, women found these jobs less appealing (Studies 4 and 5). Results confirmed that perceptions of belongingness (but not perceived skills) mediated the effect of gendered wording on job appeal (Study 5). The function of gendered wording in maintaining traditional gender divisions, implications for gender parity, and theoretical models of inequality are discussed.

T1  - Perspective Taking Combats Automatic Expressions of Racial Bias
AN  - 919901886; 201201746
AB  - Five experiments investigated the hypothesis that perspective taking -- actively contemplating others' psychological experiences -- attenuates automatic expressions of racial bias. Across the first 3 experiments, participants who adopted the perspective of a Black target in an initial context subsequently exhibited more positive automatic interracial evaluations, with changes in automatic evaluations mediating the effect of perspective taking on more deliberate interracial evaluations. Furthermore, unlike other bias-reduction strategies, the interracial positivity resulting from perspective taking was accompanied by increased salience of racial inequalities (Experiment 3). Perspective taking also produced stronger approach-oriented action tendencies toward Blacks (but not Whites; Experiment 4). A final experiment revealed that face-to-face interactions with perspective takers were rated more positively by Black interaction partners than were interactions with nonperspective takers -- a relationship that was mediated by perspective takers' increased approach-oriented nonverbal behaviors (as rated by objective, third-party observers). These findings indicate that perspective taking can combat automatic expressions of racial biases without simultaneously decreasing sensitivity to ongoing racial disparities.

T1  - Towards understanding what Australia's Muslims really think
AN  - 887496956; 201118180
AB  - Over the past decade, issues concerning Islam and Muslims have featured prominently in public and media discourse. Much of this discourse is stereotypical, anecdotal and often unsubstantiated. Indeed, relative to the extent of comment on Islam and Muslims, few factual data exist on what Muslims really think. This article presents the views and opinions of the Queensland Muslim community based on the findings of a survey conducted at the 2009 Muslim Eid Festival in Brisbane. The findings of this research contradict many of the assumptions made about Australia's Muslims concerning their views and opinions on a range of social and political issues. The research shows that Muslims highly value Australia's key social and political institutions, including its democracy, judiciary, education and health-care systems. However, Muslims do express a lack of trust in certain institutions, namely the mass media. Also, consistent with the views of people globally, Muslims are deeply concerned about conflicts in the Middle East as well as the environmental crisis. This article suggests the need for a shift in public discourse to more accurately reflect the commonality, rather than incongruity, between Muslim views, opinions and concerns and those of the wider society.

T1  - Stretching capabilities: children with disabilities playing TV and computer games
AN  - 1037878228; 201231252
AB  - Intervention studies show that if children with disabilities play motion-controlled TV and computer games for training purposes their motivation increases and their training becomes more intensive, but why this happens has not been explained. This article addresses this question with the help of ethnographic material from a public project in Sweden. By applying interactional constructionism to detailed instances of play situations, the article specifies the social dynamics as well as identificatory attractions of these games for children with disabilities.

T1  - Enduring Pictures in Our Heads: The Continuance of Authoritarianism and Racial Stereotyping
AN  - 964198493; 201207413
AB  - This study highlights the importance of examining the influence of personality measures, specifically authoritarianism, on negative racial stereotyping, even in an era of alleged color blindness. The authors examine the relationship of various demographic variables and authoritarianism with negative racial stereotyping in a sample of White urban respondents. Current literature suggests that age, sex, marital status, religious identification, religious service attendance, education level, income, political affiliation, level of authoritarianism, and the demographic composition in an individual's local population all affect racial stereotyping. The evidence presented, using path analysis, suggests that some demographic characteristics influence the level of negative racial stereotyping. While the effects of most included demographic characteristics were statistically significant, others, which continually resurface in the literature, remained insignificant (such as the demographic composition of the respondent's area). The results of this study challenge the loss of traditional prejudice with color blindness and point to the importance of authoritarianism as a mediating factor in negative racial stereotyping. The authors conclude the greatest indicators of negative racial stereotyping included in this study are authoritarianism, education, and income, while many other demographics-such as marital status, religious identification and attendance, and political affiliation-have indirect influences through authoritarianism.

T1  - News Effects on Bonding and Bridging Social Capital: An Empirical Study Relevant to Ethnicity in the United States
AN  - 868009856; 201112931
AB  - In an effort to advance decades of mass Communication Research on social capital and related indicators of social ties and civic engagement, this study provides an empirical assessment of social capital's often discussed, but rarely tested, bonding and bridging dimensions. It examines how usage patterns of traditional news media (i. e. , newspaper and TV news) and online news media (i. e. , Internet news) are associated with bonding and bridging neighborliness, as defined by ethnicity. Analysis of data from a 2007 national survey demonstrates that traditional news media use -- but not online news media use -- is significantly associated with bonding neighborliness and bridging neighborliness. In addition, the relationship between traditional news media use and bonding neighborliness, as well as that between online news media use and bonding neighborliness, is more positive for Whites and Asians than for Blacks and Latinos. Results are discussed in terms of bonding and bridging social capital, ethnic media portrayals, and journalism and ethnicity in the United States.

AB  - This article analyzes the television series "The Book of Daniel", a program that shows in full relief the ways that current discourses of religion and sexuality converge to produce a particular type of gay subject. This subject, primarily male, might be understood as bound through an innate identity and commitment to the sanctity and reproduction of heteronormative institutions such as the church and state, which renders him assimilable into the social order. As homosexuality, per se, is no longer "outside" the normative order the program constructs an unstable, nonbinary, and nonheteronormative other who is best understood as queer.

AN  - 964189957; 201207397
AB  - This is an introduction to a collection of articles -- "Affecting Global Movement: The Emotional Terrain of Transnationality" -- that explores discourses of emotion related to global movement. Research on migration rarely captures the affective and emotional dimensions of global processes. This issue is part of an emergent body of scholarship that bridges work on transnational migration with examinations of affect and emotion. Here, we discuss several common themes that the papers collectively address: how emotion shapes, negotiates, and mediates connectedness and disconnectedness along lines of nation, community, and/or kin; the relationship between emotionality and materiality; and the emotional aspects of structural power dynamics in diverse contexts. Such study can inform and aid in the development of policies that incorporate emotional experiences, thereby improving transnational lives. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Fleeting Substantiality: The Samoan Giant in US Popular Discourse
AN  - 1504421486; 201405482
AB  - In this article I draw examples from the broader terrain of academic and popular literature, news media, television, and film to explore questions regarding representations of Samoans, and especially Samoan men, in the United States. The mediated accessibility of Samoans, via televised sports and entertainment, combines with their relative geographic and demographic inaccessibility to produce popular images of a population that the vast majority of Americans know very little about. Such representations are gendered in particular ways, such that the archetypal Samoan body in US popular discourse is now masculine, rather than feminine. I discuss how popular representations of Samoan men may be similar to representations of black men-the latter so central to discourses of race in the United States-as well as how are they different, particularly in light of the discursively slippery histories of representing Pacific peoples as both noble and ignoble "savages." The main narrative component of discourses about Samoan men, body size, is critically engaged; additionally, the article argues that the added element of (indigenous) culture-thought to be outside or anterior to Western modernity-grant to Samoans an exoticness not normally granted to black Americans. This essay attempts to expose, engage, and examine these active processes of representation and myth creation-what visual theorist Clyde Taylor might term mythogenesis-to better understand the discursive terrain that Samoans negotiate, often ambivalently in the United States.

T1  - Burekalism -- A Slovenian View Of Bureks And Burekpeople
AN  - 1266150034; 201300428
AB  - Burekalism is a style of thought based on an ontological and epistemological distinction made between a population and place defined by the burek and a population and place not defined by the burek, or in other words: between "immigrants" and "Slovenians". And further, burekalism is a style of domination of a population defined by the burek by a population not defined by the burek. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Hypersexual Black Women in the Ecuadorian 'Common Sense': An Examination of Visual and Other Representations
AN  - 1081867903; 201235348
AB  - In this essay, I contribute to the examination of racism and discrimination in Andean societies, and particularly in Ecuador, by focusing on the reproduction of stereotypical representations of black women as hypersexual beings in ordinary Ecuadorian society. I pay careful attention to visual images and their accompanying written texts in the Ecuadorian press and in other media. This allows for a consideration of ideological continuities across different periods of Ecuadorian history. Stereotypes about blackness, black bodies, and black sexuality abound in Ecuador. They share similarities with comparable representations in other Latin American contexts or on the transnational scene. They work to evoke black uncontrolled sexuality as the trope per excellence for 'savagery' at the same time that they suggest black female body's availability for white-mestizo male consumption/penetration. I propose an analysis of the recurrence of these images with respect for the specificities of the recent history of the Ecuadorian national context. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Indian Students in Melbourne: Challenges to Multiculturalism
AN  - 1081863863; 201235370
AB  - The migration experiences of Indian students challenge traditional frameworks of multiculturalism in Australia. First, unlike earlier groups of migrants, Indian students pay to study hoping to become migrants. Indian families contributed AU$2.9 billion in educational fees, living expenses and tourism in December 2010 and generated 28,975 full-time equivalent jobs. Second, the students' narratives are largely centred on mobility and acquiring greater options rather than settlement. Third, Indian students come from a country that is an important trading partner for Australia. And last, like other migrants, the students live in transnational families that go beyond the traditional national framework of multiculturalism. This study draws on 35 open-ended individual and group interviews with Indians who arrived on student or spouse visas in 2005 or later and 12 persons who occupy leading positions in Indian community organisations, media and local government. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Rural as Racialized Plantation vs Rural as Modern Reconnection: Blackness and Agency in Disney's Song of the South and The Princess and the Frog
AN  - 758124785; 201057089
AB  - The plantation trope in the American minstrelsy tradition reflected simultaneously competing and complementary representations of the rural ideal and racialized African American characters. This trope longed for an earlier and simpler time with strange embodiments of African Americans, and persisted for decades. Disney's Song of the South draws extensively on these competing idealizations of the pastoral and the African American. In contrast, Disney's The Princess and the Frog draws on a broad pastoral trope wherein the rural ideal provides a place for characters to reconnect with their true selves and change their lives for the better. While the 1946 film casts African Americans as comforting the white man in distress, the 2009 film casts African Americans as their own agents of positive change. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Asian American television activity: Is it related to outgroup vitality
AN  - 818801924; 201072799
AB  - Applying a uses and gratifications and social identity gratifications approach, the present study explores Asian American television viewing. Specifically, Asian Americans report on the quantity of television they watch, what shows they watch, why they watch, and whether their uses are related to their perceptions of Caucasian vitality. The data reveal that using television for entertainment and to escape/relieve boredom were the most important television uses for this group of Asian Americans. At the same time, these two uses were significant predictors of how vital Asian Americans perceived Caucasians. Although selecting and avoiding television for ethnic identity gratifications were not important relative to other gratifications, television selection for identity gratifications was important to Asian Americans who highly identify with their ethnic group.

T1  - Immigration in the 2008 Virginia presidential election: A cultural issue remains puissant despite an economic crisis
AN  - 754048532; 201054353
AB  - In 2006 and 2007, many analysts expected that immigration would be one of the top domestic issues in the 2008 campaign. However, in the 2008 presidential general election, immigration issues were never a major topic between candidates John McCain and Barack Obama. This was partially because McCain has more moderate views toward immigration reform than the passionate anti-immigration faction of the Republican Party. Prior research suggests that an issue in a presidential campaign can remain influential even when the media and campaigns are not discussing or addressing the issue, even when the candidates or parties do not differ greatly on the issue. In a survey of Virginia residents conducted just before the November election, immigration attitudes were a differential factor between McCain and Obama. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - 'Reasonable accommodation' in Quebec: the limits of participation and dialogue
AN  - 754044619; 201053351
AB  - This article explores the Bouchard-Taylor Commission, a 2007-8 government consultation that was established in Quebec to study interculturalism, secularism and national identity, in response to what had become known as the 'reasonable accommodation debates' on the extent to which minority and immigrant cultural practices could be accommodated. The focus of this exploration is on two aspects of the Commission: the citizens' forums that were a part of its deliberative process; and the ways in which it responded to the idea of crisis. Through an analysis of aspects of the Commission's final report, the ways in which the Commission was structured and the media representations of the Commission, this article argues that, despite the spirit of equality and fairness to which the commissioners were committed and the praise it received from some members of immigrant and minority groups, the Commission ended up reinforcing the racialised hierarchies and exclusions that it wanted to redress.

T1  - Ecological context and immigrants' earnings: English ability as a mediator
AN  - 743067064; 201043403
AB  - Labor economic literature has demonstrated a consistent positive association between immigrants' earnings and their level of proficiency in the host society's language. Sociological literature, on the other hand, has explicated that immigrants' abilities to speak the host society's language are affected by structural/ecological factors which shape the linguistic environment of immigrants. This study proposes a logical extension of the two literatures by suggesting that structural /ecological factors affect immigrants' earnings indirectly by affecting their ability to speak the host society's language. Using individual and aggregate data from the U.S. Census 2000, we found that structural/ecological factors such as group size, segregation, and linguistic heterogeneity affected immigrants' earnings not only directly but also indirectly via their impacts on immigrants' English ability. English ability is a key mediator through which structural forces shape individual immigrant's economic assimilation outcome. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Illiberal and Unmodern: Conservative columnists on Indigenous self-determination in Australia and Canada
AN  - 754044646; 201053361
AB  - Conservative newspaper columnists have played a critical role in helping to create public ideas conducive to the most recent assault upon the unremarkable liberal principle of Indigenous self-determination. This was begun by Australia's conservative Liberal government in the mid-1990sand is continued by the Labor government today. This paper discusses the creation of those ideas as part of a regressive discourse of neo-assimilation circulating in the media and public sphere more widely. It examines comparable, recent opinion columns from the Australian and Canadian press to illustrate the transnational continuity of this discourse. Specifically, I describe three key, interlocked rhetorical tactics that are used by conservative columnists in both countries to defame Indigenous self-determination as a failed, anti-modern and anti-democratic ideal.

T1  - Respect for persons in the intergroup context: Self--other overlap and intergroup emotions as mediators of the impact of respect on action tendencies
AN  - 743053513; 201031477
AB  - Two studies examined self--other overlap and intergroup emotions as mediators of the effects of respect for persons on action tendencies towards outgroup members. In contexts of both mild (Study 1) and more severe (Study 2) intergroup conflict, respect for persons predicted action tendencies towards outgroup members: those who value the intrinsic worth of others (high respect for persons) expressed less negative and more positive action tendencies towards outgroup members than did those with low respect for persons. These effects were obtained while controlling for Social Dominance Orientation and Agreeableness (Study 1). Further, the effects of respect for persons on action tendencies were shown to be partially mediated by self--other overlap and intergroup emotions. The findings support previous work in suggesting that respect for persons is an important predictor in intergroup contexts, and they highlight potential mechanisms through which respect might operate.

T1  - Becoming Polish in London: negotiating ethnicity through migration
AN  - 1792350877
AB  - This paper explores how migrants negotiate and construct their identity in London. In particular it discusses how they position themselves in relation to other ethnic groups - English people and other migrant and ethnic minority groups within British society. The discussion draws upon qualitative research with recent Polish migrants in London. In addition to key informants from a range of community and voluntary groups, 3 focus groups and 30 individual interviews were carried out with migrants across various locations in the city. Participants were drawn from a range of occupations and included equal numbers of men and women. Rather than attempting to select a representative sample, the research sought to capture the range and diversity of Polish migrants. The paper examines how ethnic identity is mediated through language, gender, whiteness and European-ness. Using Goffman's concepts of 'normality' and 'stigma' the paper also discusses the ways in which participants engage with Polishness through multifaceted and complex interactions with or, indeed, avoidance of 'Poles abroad'.

T1  - 'London the Leveller': Ghanaian Work Strategies and Community Solidarity
AN  - 743057935; 201031844
AB  - In Britain, there is much concern in policy and public discourse about immigrant integration and social cohesion. But how do immigrants themselves perceive the process of settlement in the UK? This question is examined through exploration of the work strategies developed by Ghanaian immigrants in London in their quest to live a decent life. We explore three issues: how Ghanaians negotiate relations of power in developing viable work strategies in London; how those strategies are shaped or mediated by family, community ties and social networks; and how Ghanaians themselves define and live 'integration' and cohesion. Our results indicate that some Ghanaians experience a 'levelling' process in their work lives in London, where they continually juggle between job exploitation, racism and inadequate pay. In addition, Ghanaians maintain strong family and community ties, a tradition carried over from Ghana. Distinct from the idea that weak ties outside one's community are likely to provide the most relevant and adequate information and resources, we found that weak ties within the community provide the same function. Finally, immigrants tend to define 'integration' differently to 'sense of belonging'. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Potential Roles of Self-Fulfilling Prophecies, Stigma Consciousness, and Stereotype Threat in Linking Latino-a Ethnicity and Educational Outcomes
AN  - 60356523; 201017486
AB  - Acculturation and ethnic identity may be associated with Latino-as' educational outcomes and be relevant to their lower levels of academic achievement. This article explores how these relationships might be mediated by considering several empirically supported and theory-based social psychological processes-the self-fulfilling prophecy, stigma consciousness, and stereotype threat. These processes suggest specific mediational mechanisms that remain largely unexamined, thereby offering novel directions for research and the potential to enrich understanding of the relationship between Latino-a ethnicity and academic performance. Consideration of these mediational mechanisms suggests that some groups within the Latino-a population face even greater challenges with regard to educational achievement. Accordingly, the particular difficulties encountered by Latinas and the children of families of migrant workers and new and undocumented immigrants are discussed. In addition, the potential relevance of education policies to the operation of the reviewed processes is explored. Adapted from the source document.
