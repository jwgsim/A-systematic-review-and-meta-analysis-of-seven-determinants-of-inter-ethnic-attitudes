T1  - A New Second-Generation Mindfulness-Based Intervention Focusing on Well-Being: A Randomized Control Trial of Mindfulness-Based Positive Psychology
AN  - 2699221673
AB  - Second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) align well with positive psychology philosophy and practices, but trials of SG-MBIs have largely focused on ill-being. This study developed a mindfulness-based positive psychology (MBPP) intervention integrating positive psychology with an SG-MBI to enhance well-being. A randomized control trial was performed to compare MBPP with a waitlist condition among 138 Chinese participants. The results showed that MBPP significantly reduced negative emotions for subjective well-being and significantly improved environmental mastery for psychological well-being. Improvements in self-compassion and negative attitudes but not avoidance, mediated changes in well-being. Changes in positive emotions, positive relations, and awareness were associated with the amount of meditation practice. These findings showed that MBPP is promising for improving well-being and that the positive psychology components play important roles. Broadly, the study illustrated that positive psychology and SG-MBIs can be effectively integrated, and it supported the further application of SG-MBIs from the positive psychology perspective.

T1  - Fraternity Membership and Negative Racial Attitudes among U.S. College Students
AN  - 2689912123
AB  - Over the years, race‐related incidents involving Greek letter organizations (GLOs), especially fraternities, continue to arise despite the ensuing controversy and negative media attention that inevitably follow such incidents. The present study examines whether there is an association between GLO membership and negative ethnoracial attitudes given a range of relevant psychological, sociological, and political theories about ethnoracial attitudes. Building on insights from microclass research on attitudinal structuring and drawing on the National Longitudinal Study of Freshmen (N = 2,817), results of linear regression models indicate that GLO membership is associated with heightened negative ethnoracial attitudes, particularly among white male students. Moreover, a measure of ethnoracial group affiliation partially mediates this effect. This latter finding suggests that among the various ethnoracial attitude theories, group position theory may be better formulated to explain an association between GLO membership and negative ethnoracial attitudes, given its consideration of both ingroup boundary formation and organizations. The results also support microclass processes and suggest future research to more clearly account for pre‐occupational structuring that later feeds into occupational processes.

T1  - Looking at the ‘field’ through a Zoom lens: Methodological reflections on conducting online research during a global pandemic
AN  - 2661420697
AB  - For many social science scholars, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to re-think our approaches to research. As a result of new social distancing measures, those of us who conduct in-person qualitative and ethnographic research have faced significant challenges in accessing the populations and fields we study. Technology served as an incredibly useful tool for social interaction and research prior to the pandemic, and it has since become even more important as a way to engage with others. Although not all types of social research, or even all projects, lend themselves to online activities, digital communication platforms like Zoom, Skype, and Facebook have allowed many of us to continue our studies from a distance—in some cases, significant temporal and spatial distances away from our research sites. As such, it is important to consider how these different methodological approaches challenge our understandings of fieldwork. While the disadvantages of not physically accessing the places we study are clear, can mediated approaches offer (any) hope of the immersion we experienced with in-person fieldwork? If many of us are able to continue ethnographic research (in some form) without co-locating with our participants in our field sites, how are our studies fundamentally affected, as well as the ways we conceptualize the ‘field’ more largely? This paper explores these methodological and epistemological questions through reflections on conducting online research during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

T1  - Let's talk about the Israel–Palestine conflict: Does exposure to political comedy about the Middle East influence policy attitudes?
AN  - 2667100557
AB  - ObjectiveThe research considers the impact of exposure to political comedy focused on the crisis in the Middle East on viewers' attitudes toward the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.MethodsData from a four‐group experiment were analyzed (N = 240; August 2021). Video stimuli were drawn from Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah, Late Night with Seth Meyers, and Full Frontal with Samantha Bee.ResultsThe results suggest that exposure to this critical content has a limited but significant effect on issue attitudes. Specifically, subjects exposed to satire about the conflict in the Middle East were significantly less likely to suggest that the United States is too supportive of the Palestinians and were marginally less likely to suggest that the Hamas response to the crisis goes too far, that the Israeli government is making a sincere effort to bring about peace, and that there is a way for Israel and an independent Palestinian state to coexist peacefully.ConclusionThe implications of the findings and the potential influence of satire on foreign policy issue attitudes are discussed.

AB  - Purpose>The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of civil liberties, global health security, median age and population size on the spread of COVID-19 across the globe.Design/methodology/approach>This study was done by taking data from 166 different countries from the Economist Intelligence Unit, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, World Bank, Johns Hopkins University and United Nations Population Division (UNPD). After conducting all the necessary standard econometric tests, the study was analyzed using the ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.Findings>The finding of the study indicated that COVID-19 tests per million people (LTT/PM), Population Size (LPOP), Civil Liberty Index (CLI) are statistically significant and positively affect the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases; on the other hand, the Health Security Index (HSI) negatively affects the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.Practical implications>In emergency circumstances, the government ought to have a special responsibility to align civil rights with the protection of public health cautiously. However, measures to restrict civil liberties must be proportionate.Originality/value>Besides other variables, the study included and considered civil liberties as a significant factor to affect the spread of COVID-19, which is a new contribution to the existing body of knowledge in the field.

T1  - “Why should Facebook (not) ban trump?”: connecting divides in reasoning and morality in public deliberation
AN  - 2655995341
AB  - The divides between social groups in American society today extend from political opinion to lifestyle and emotions. A less explored area, however, is how these divides relate to potential divides in morality. The Habermasian conceptualization of the public sphere prioritizes deliberative reasoning as a way to solve moral conflicts. In contrast, this study argues that divides in reasoning and opinion are associated with divides in morality. To make the argument, this study focuses on the case of public debates over whether social media companies should deplatform Trump and his supporters in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection. Public comments were obtained from a dataset compiled and released by Facebook Oversight Board. First, I used structural topic modeling to identify the reasoning and used the dictionary based on the Moral Foundations Theory to gauge moral foundations in each document. Then, I used statistical analysis to examine whether there was a correlation between specific reasoning and moral foundations. The results show that the pro- and anti-deplatforming camps in the debate are divided not only in reasoning, but also in morality. Supporters of deplatforming argue that it would fulfill tech companies’ public responsibility, and protect society at large. These arguments are correlated with the care foundation. In contrast, opponents argue that deplatforming Trump violated freedom of speech. This argument is correlated with the fairness, loyalty, and authority foundations, but not the care foundation. The findings support my argument that divides in reasoning should be analyzed with consideration of morality.

T1  - Media Representations of Lesbians, Gay Men, and Bisexuals on Dutch Television and People’s Stereotypes and Attitudes About LGBs
AN  - 2635108024
AB  - This study investigates stereotypical portrayals of lesbians, gays, and bisexuals (LGBs) on Dutch television and whether these portrayals relate to people’s attitudes towards LGBs. Previous research shows that television programs in the U.S. contain many stereotypical portrayals of LGBs. These portrayals are both negatively and positively related to people’s attitude towards LGBs. Because the Dutch culture is relatively accepting of LGBs it is interesting to see if they are portrayed differently than in the U.S. A content analysis showed that there are stereotypical representations on Dutch television but there are also people who ‘just happen to be gay’. A survey among 272 participants showed that people who more frequently watch programs with stereotypical portrayals of LGBs do not have a more positive or negative attitude than people who do not. A mediation analysis showed that people who watch more television in general have a more stereotypical view of gay men, which is related to more negative attitudes towards LGBs.

T1  - When Does Infrastructure “Qualify for [Artistic] Attention”? The “ABCs” of Contemporary Art in Post-Liberalization India
AN  - 2635982524
AB  - The period between “liberalization,” or the 1991 opening of India's economy to foreign direct investment, and the 2008 onset of the Great Recession was one of unprecedented change in the forms of Indian art and the infrastructures that supported its understanding, presentation, and circulation. This period of efflorescence—of multiplying growth in and transformation of a set of interlocking artistic and social forms—poses methodological challenges similar to those identified by George E. Marcus and Fred R. Myers in their 1995 volume, The Traffic in Culture: Refiguring Art and Anthropology. Marcus and Myers’ call to focus on appropriation, boundary-making, and circulation, though meant to submit the Western art world to critique, coincides quite clearly with three particularly salient changes seen in Indian contemporary art in the period: the turn to unconventional material as artistic media (appropriation); the deliberate integration of artistic work with the materialities of everyday life (boundary); and the development of entirely new curatorial infrastructures and frameworks (circulation). The present essay examines these changes through Mumbai-based artist Navjot Altaf's post-1996, ongoing collaborative work with adivasi (indigenous) artists in the Central Indian region of Bastar. Eventually registered as the NGO Dialogue Interactive Artists Association (DIAA), the collective's activities have ranged from parallel exhibitions of “art” and “craft” to site-specific, cross-disciplinary engagements with play structures (Pilla Gudi) and water taps (Nalpar) built upon collective practices meant to bridge the considerable social distance between urban upper-class and adivasi artists. DIAA's work with water, like other artistic engagements with infrastructure, highlights the social, aesthetic, material, and political aspects of the built networks that sustain everyday life. Their critique leveraged Marcus and Myers’ ABCs, incorporating critical acts of appropriation, the active violation of social and geographical boundaries, and, above all, demonstration of a concern with circulation.

T1  - More Than Politics: How Personality Trait and Media Technology Use Affect Vote Likelihood During the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election: PROD
AN  - 2631515237
AB  - Considerable work has been devoted to studying voter behavior in U.S. presidential elections by analyzing their political participation and attitude toward political advertising. Less is known about how other factors may alter voter behavior like personality traits and use of information and communication technology (ICT). This study analyzes vote likelihood among American young voters and their parents (N = 674) after they watched four presidential campaign commercials . It proposes a hierarchical mediation model highlighting the need for cognition (NFC) impact on vote likelihood through the mediation of power use of ICT applications, political participation and trust in negative advertising. This study has revealed both the direct effect of NFC on vote likelihood, and the indirect relationship between NFC and vote likelihood that is mediated by power use of ICT applications. The findings should enrich the literature of vote likelihood by highlighting the effects of need for cognition and ICT usage.

T1  - Exploring tensions in Holocaust museums' modes of commemoration and interaction on social media
AN  - 2655165316
AB  - Digital technologies and social media platforms have been used in museum communication for over a decade now, and Holocaust museums have increasingly adopted them in their modes of commemoration and provision of educational content. Nevertheless, very limited research has been conducted into the potential of social media as new memory ecologies. In this exploratory study, we conceive social media platforms as socio-technical-ecological systems whereby users develop and engage with memory practices of the Holocaust. We adopt a networked socio-ecological approach to analyse how a sample of Holocaust museums (N = 69) develop practices of digital Holocaust memory in social media. The institutions are analysed in terms of "size" (small, medium, or large), how they differ in their attitudes towards these practices, and to what extent they circulate Holocaust memory on social media. The study adopts multiple quantitative approaches and combines the results of a survey with a set of social media metrics analysing how museums engage on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube in terms of generated content, interactivity, popularity, and type of content. Results show that museums have an overall positive attitude towards social media although some concerns were expressed, mostly by smaller institutions; they tend to use mostly Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, and to share educational content and information about the museum's activities. However, despite a tendency to aggregate a large number of fans and followers, especially in the case of larger institutions, interaction with users remains limited. Prospects for more interactive participation and its implications are also discussed.

T1  - Loneliness and psychological distress before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: Relationships with social media identity bubbles
AN  - 2672382213
AB  - Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being and mental health are a concern worldwide. This article is based on two longitudinal studies that investigated the role of social media use in loneliness and psychological distress before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study 1 utilized nationally representative 3-point longitudinal data (n = 735) collected in 2017–2020 on the Finnish population. Study 2 utilized 5-point longitudinal data (n = 840) collected in 2019–2021 representing the Finnish working population. We analyzed the data using multilevel mixed-effects regression analysis. A longitudinal analysis of Study 1 showed that perceived loneliness did not increase among the Finnish population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stronger involvement in social media identity bubbles predicted lower loneliness during the pandemic. Study 2 results showed that since the outbreak of the pandemic, psychological distress has increased among lonely individuals but not among the general working population. Involvement in social media identity bubbles predicted generally lower psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it did not buffer against higher psychological distress among lonely individuals. The findings suggest that perceived loneliness is a risk factor for prolonged negative mental health effects of the pandemic. Social media identity bubbles can offer meaningful social resources during times of social distancing but cannot protect against higher psychological distress among those who perceive themselves as often lonely.

T1  - Trial and error: hate speech prosecution and its (unintended) effects on democratic support
AN  - 2616790576
AB  - Due to its controversial nature, hate speech prosecution of anti-immigration politicians is likely to affect citizens’ democratic support. Using a web experiment in which participants are exposed to a manipulated television news story about hate speech prosecution, we test these potential effects in the Dutch context. We demonstrate that effects on democratic support are driven by (dis)agreement with ideas expressed by the prosecuted politician in his alleged hate speech rather than by identification with his party. While a decision to not prosecute a politician does not seem to affect democratic support, a decision to prosecute a politician for hate speech decreases democratic support among citizens with anti-immigration attitudes, and increases democratic support among citizens with pro-immigration attitudes. Decisions to prosecute politicians for hate speech thus have important effects not just on supporters of the politician’s party, but also on other groups in society.

T1  - Living in a 'free jail': Asylum seekers' and local residents' experiences of discomfort with asylum seeker accommodation
AN  - 2621878372
AB  - This paper shows how asylum seeker accommodation produces a politics of discomfort among both asylum seekers as well as local residents. The paper compares two collective asylum centres located in the city of Augsburg, Germany, one of which is a nationally renowned refugee integration project, the 'Grandhotel Cosmopolis', the other, a state-run asylum centre. Data was obtained through participant observation and semi-structured interviews between September 2016 and November 2017. Drawing on carceral geographies, the paper identifies three mechanisms through which the material and institutional standards of asylum accommodation generate discomfort among and between asylum seekers and local residents, which are self-mortification, depersonalization and role-breakdown. Through the sharing of rooms and facilities, asylum accommodation contributes to asylum seekers' self-mortification, referring to changes in the conceptions and beliefs of oneself. The comparison of the two cases highlights how large asylum centres depersonalize asylum seekers by creating images of a homogenized 'mass' and contribute to role-breakdown, meaning a reduction of individuals' identities performed with regard to work, home or family life. National discourses of asylum seekers as dangerous merged with the space of asylum accommodation, thereby preventing social interaction 'as neighbours' between asylum seekers and local residents. Overall, the paper exposes how a politics of discomfort utilizes affect as a governmental device, thereby turning asylum accommodation into a carceral space by creating social distance and 'moral closure'.

T1  - When cultures clash: Links between perceived cultural distance in values and attitudes towards migrants
AN  - 2578689090
AB  - Migration elicits mixed reactions from the host‐society. Negative responses towards migrants seem to emerge when migrants are perceived as culturally different. We investigated when and why perceived cultural distance (PCD) is associated with negative migrant attitudes by focussing on differences in cultural values. We expected that PCD in social values (focus on relationships and society) should be more strongly associated with attitudes towards migrants than personal values (individual needs and gains) and should be mediated by symbolic threat. In two quasi‐experimental studies (N = 200, N = 668) with Dutch participants (host‐society), we simultaneously tested effects of respondents’ perception of Dutch values, their perceptions of migrant values (of Moroccan, Syrian, Polish ethnic origin), and PCD between Dutch‐migrant value on attitudes. For all migrant groups, PCD in social values was associated with more negative attitudes, less tolerance, and less policy support regarding migrants; this was mediated by symbolic threat. These links were weaker for personal values.

T1  - Indonesia’s rise in digital democracy and youth’s political participation
AN  - 2563952850
AB  - The platform of digital media has particularly reshaped the political structure of Indonesia. The public is using social media applications for political participation and an expression of their political opinions. This survey was conducted in Indonesia to examine the impact of digital media among youngsters and their political engagement through digital platforms. The study was influenced by the phenomenon of massive student participation, which occurred in August 2019, in Indonesia as a reaction to a new corruption (KPK) law. The study opted for the public sphere theory of Jürgen Habermas; ‘The Public Sphere’. This correlates to the study objective whereby youth participate in political matters to learn and to discuss their common beliefs in the public spheres. The study design is quantitative and more than four hundred respondents were selected during the protests through random sampling techniques. The conclusion of the study demonstrates that youth participate in multiple activities, such as protests for new laws, which indeed strengthen democracy and contribute to the political structure of Indonesia. Therefore, youth participation through social media platforms shows their political participation in Indonesia. The study also suggests a few recommendations for youth to show their participation through online spheres.

T1  - Do I support that it's good or oppose that it's bad? The effect of support-oppose framing on attitude sharing
AN  - 2570235420
AB  - The rise of social media has led to unprecedented opportunities for individuals to share, or express, their attitudes on social and political issues. What factors affect whether individuals choose to share? This research identifies a novel determinant of attitude sharing-support-oppose framing, defined as whether individuals think of their own attitude in terms of what they support or what they oppose. Support-oppose framing is distinct from attitude valence, as the same attitude can be framed in terms of support (e.g., I support that this policy is bad) or opposition (e.g., I oppose that this policy is good). Seven experiments, two correlational studies, and one field study provide evidence for a support-oppose framing effect, whereby individuals are more likely to share attitudes framed in terms of positions they support rather than positions they oppose. This effect occurs via two pathways. In the first, support-framed attitudes are viewed as more value expressive, which facilitates greater attitude sharing. In the second, support-framed attitudes are believed to promote more positive impressions, which also leads to greater sharing. This effect is attenuated when individuals' typical impression-management goals are relaxed.

T1  - How happenings do (not) turn into events: A typology and an application to the case of 9/11 in the American and Dutch public spheres
AN  - 2552119194
AB  - Why do some happenings become incentives for cultural or political transformation (that is: turn into events), whereas others remain ordinary occurrences? The theoretical perspectives of cultural repertoires, cleavage structures, and discursive opportunities are prominent and fruitful approaches for explaining cultural or political behavior and attitudes, yet they do not have a satisfactory answer to this question. To fill in this gap, I introduce a typology that indicates how certain happenings merely reproduce existing trends, whereas other ones turn into motives to change them. This can be either because they are “focus events,” which confirm dominant cultural or political patterns, or because they are “shock events,” which form a break from them. I illustrate this typology by investigating the distinct meanings that 9/11 were accorded in the American and Dutch public spheres. This analysis shows that this happening became a “shock event” on the issue of safety in the American case, as it broke with the cultural repertoire of viewing the United States as a safe, militarily impenetrable nation. In contrast, 9/11 turned into a “focus event” concerning the issue of Islam in the Dutch case because it confirmed the discursive opportunities to problematize Muslims, which public actors in the Netherlands had already developed in the years leading up to 2001.

T1  - Using social media data for assessing children's exposure to violence during the COVID-19 pandemic
AN  - 2539557029
AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic brought unforeseen challenges that could forever change the way societies prioritize and deal with public health issues. The approaches to contain the spread of the virus have entailed governments issuing recommendations on social distancing, lockdowns to restrict movements, and suspension of services. Objective There are concerns that the COVID-19 crisis and the measures adopted by countries in response to the pandemic may have led to an upsurge in violence against children. Added stressors placed on caregivers, economic uncertainty, job loss or disruption to livelihoods and social isolation may have led to a rise in children's experience of violence in the home. Extended online presence by children may have resulted in increased exposure to abusive content and cyberbullying. Participants and setting This study uses testimonial-based and conversational-based data collected from social media users. Methods Conversations on Twitter were reviewed to measure increases in abusive or hateful content, and cyberbullying, while testimonials from Reddit forums were examined to monitor changes in references to family violence before and after the start of the stay-at-home restrictions. Results Violence-related subreddits were among the topics with the highest growth after the COVID-19 outbreak. The analysis of Twitter data shows a significant increase in abusive content generated during the stay-at-home restrictions. Conclusions The collective experience of the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures offers insights into the wide-ranging risks that children are exposed to in times of crisis. As societies shift towards a new normal, which places emerging technology, remote working and online learning at its center, and in anticipation of similar future threats, governments and other stakeholders need to put in place measures to protect children from violence.

T1  - Views on immigration in Japan: identities, interests, and pragmatic divergence
AN  - 2536666107
AB  - This paper explores how material-based and identity-based concerns influence views on immigration in Japan. Our analysis, based on in-depth interviews with 28 local residents and public and policy opinion leaders conducted in 2015 in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, found widespread opposition to immigration with the exception of the immigration of care workers. General opposition to immigration stemmed from identity-based concerns, while openness to and support for the immigration of care workers was related to material-based concerns. Our findings suggest that while the identities approach to understanding anti-immigration sentiment has explanatory power in Japan, material-based concerns can, when sufficiently strong, override identity-based concerns in a phenomenon we call ‘pragmatic divergence’.

T1  - From advocacy to acceptance: Social media discussions of protected bike lane installations
AN  - 2503612925
AB  - Many North American cities are building bicycling infrastructure. Lively discussions on social media, where people passionately support or reject bicycling infrastructure projects, provide a unique data set on attitudes towards bicycling infrastructure. Our goal is to analyse social media posts in Edmonton and Victoria, Canada as new bike infrastructure was implemented to understand the thematic and social elements of the conversation and how these changed over time. We collected Twitter messages (n = 13,121: 7640 in Edmonton; 5481 in Victoria) and compared three timeframes: before lanes opened (January 2015 to lane opening); the first riding season (opening to April 2017); and the second riding season (May 2017 to November 2018). For each timeframe, we evaluated word-combination frequencies (to understand the use of language) and social network structures (to understand which accounts were influential and how they interacted). We observed a change in the three time periods. Before the bicycling infrastructure was built, Twitter activity was focused on advocacy, which was especially strong in Victoria. The first riding season had the most social media activity, the most diverse perspectives and the most controversy. The second riding season held more support. Based on the Twitter activity, we found that Edmonton had more support from local businesses and traditional media, launching a connected network of infrastructure with less social media opposition. Our results suggest that attitudes associated with change in bicycling infrastructure may have a cycle, with initial negative responses to change, followed by an uptick in positive attitudes.

T1  - Parodies for a pandemic: coronavirus songs, creativity and lockdown
AN  - 2521842848
AB  - One of the common responses to the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdowns that have been a feature of almost all countries has been the making of what have come to be called parodies. These are songs with new lyrics set to the tunes of established and well-known popular songs. The new lyrics describe life during the pandemic, the experience of isolation during lockdown, the importance of wearing masks and washing hands, the importance of social distancing when one is out. The pandemic parodies are a comment, sometimes jocular sometimes more anguished, on the new normal. They are posted on social media sites, mostly YouTube but also other sites such as TikTok, and invite comments from their audience about everything from the quality of the recording to the accuracy of the lyrics in reflecting people’s lives during this time. Some of these parodies are by semi-professional singers, others by amateurs. Most of the parodists are white males and most of the songs parodied are from the 1970s and 1980s, part of the cultural capital of Generation X. This article argues that calling these songs parodies invites misunderstanding. They function more like the ballads of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when new lyrics would be written to be sung to well-known tunes. Often these lyrics would be commentaries on significant public or political events. This article argues that the pandemic parodies function similarly only now rather than the new lyrics being sold in the streets by hawkers, the songs are available on the web. At a time when the popular music industry is undergoing a fundamental transformation as a consequence of the impact of new technologies such as streaming, these pandemic parodies suggest another transformation in the production and consumption of popular music.

T1  - How COVID-19 Pandemic Lockdown Has Affected Sports Practice
AN  - 2562270133
AB  - The recent pandemic generated by COVID-19 has changed how sports are habitually practised, necessitating a form of at-home sport to enable practitioners to continue exercising and training. This also touches upon how sports are 'delivered', with home-based consumers having control over the times, ways and spaces given to sport, as transmitted by digital means. During lockdown, opportunities to take advantage of apps and content and/or follow online lessons on social networks notably intensified. These changes in sports practice generate a series of research objectives, to determine: how digital media has created a new environment for socializing and sports practice; how digital devices are used to play home sports; and which players encourage people to exercise at home. With these objectives in mind, a two-phase research was launched at the SapienzaSport centre. The first questioned a group of about 600 practitioners, with a relatively high cultural and socioeconomic level along with access to digital opportunities, to investigate their sports habits during lockdown. The goal was to focus on those not negatively affected by the digital divide. The second phase aimed at studying the subsequent implications, starting from September 2020 (when sports-related activities resumed in Italy), while understanding whether and in what way doing physical activity had changed. In this paper we report and analyse the main results.

T1  - Online Repression and Self-Censorship: Evidence from Southeast Asia
AN  - 2470862138
AB  - Governments around the world have crafted new laws to threaten, arrest, prosecute and incarcerate online political activists. While the primary effect of online repression is to silence criticism and forestall collective action, a secondary effect is to induce self-censorship among the masses. Yet scant research examines how self-censorship works, nor discusses its implications for entrenching authoritarianism and encouraging democratic backsliding. This article proposes a simple expected utility model of self-censorship, arguing that citizens will more likely self-censor when the expected costs of online political expression outweigh its benefits. Analysing the fourth wave of the Asian Barometer survey of 10,216 respondents across eight Southeast Asian countries, I find that higher income politically engaged social media users are indeed less likely to express their political opinions. Additionally, this correlation holds in states where online repression is most severe, but is non-existent in countries where online repression is moderate or low.

T1  - Responsibilization and Sexual Stigma Under Austerity: Surveying Public Support for Government-Funded PrEP in England
AN  - 2449451437
AB  - IntroductionUnder austerity, governments shift responsibilities for social welfare to individuals. Such responsibilization can be intertwined with pre-existing social stigmas, with sexually stigmatized individuals blamed more for health problems due to “irresponsible” sexual behavior. To understand how sexual stigma affects attitudes on government healthcare expenditures, we examine public support for government-provisioned PrEP in England at a time when media narratives cast the drug as an expensive benefit for a small, irresponsible social group and the National Health Service’s long-term sustainability was in doubt.MethodsThis paper uses data from an original survey (N = 738) conducted in September 2016, when public opinion should be most sensitive to sexual stigma. A survey experiment tests how the way beneficiaries of PrEP were described affected support for NHS provision of it. Contrary to expectations, we found that support was high (mean = 3.86 on a scale of 1 to 5) irrespective of language used or beneficiary group mentioned. Differences between conditions were negligible.DiscussionSexual stigma does not diminish support for government-funded PrEP, which may be due to reverence for the NHS; resistance to responsibilization generally; or just to HIV, with the public influenced by sympathy and counter-messaging.Social policy implicationsHaving misjudged public attitudes, it may be difficult for the government to continue to justify not funding PrEP; the political rationale for contracting out its provision is unnecessary and flawed. With public opinion resilient to responsibilization narratives and sexual stigma even under austerity, welfare retrenchment may be more difficult than social policymakers presume.

T1  - The segregated gun as an indicator of racism and representations in film
AN  - 2427422574
AB  - Film emphasizes an ironic history of racism in gun control and ownership and a justification for seeking justice among the Black community, but film also perpetuates structural racism and bias, segregating Black from White, and failing to promote equality, solidarity, and progress. The gun is both a symbol of structural racism, and an expression through which critical attitudes and political statements can carry greater meaning and lead to positive action, empowerment, and desegregation. The symbolic meaning of guns in the hands of Blacks as violent, exceptional or some other stereotypical character trope is illustrated using three selected films including: Django Unchained, John Q., and Proud Mary. This paper is divided into three acts: Act I: The gun as symbol of structural racism in film; Act II: Stereotypical characters and their guns; Act III: Desegregation of the gun in film. These sections illustrate the meaning and representation of the gun as a theatrical object in film, and when in the hands of stereotypical character tropes, has perpetuated racist beliefs and attitudes that have not been adequately addressed in the film industry. To desegregate the gun in film, filmmakers need to critically examine the overt and hidden film texts and how the gun, and the characters wielding it, are perceived among audiences.

T1  - Could a rising robot workforce make humans less prejudiced?
AN  - 2453786249
AB  - Automation is becoming ever more prevalent, with robot workers replacing many human employees. Many perspectives have examined the economic impact of a robot workforce, but here we consider its social impact: How will the rise of robot workers affect intergroup relations? Whereas some past research has suggested that more robots will lead to more intergroup prejudice, we suggest that robots could also reduce prejudice by highlighting commonalities between all humans. As robot workers become more salient, intergroup differences-including racial and religious differences-may seem less important, fostering a perception of common human identity (i.e., panhumanism). Six studies (ΣN = 3,312) support this hypothesis. Anxiety about the rising robot workforce predicts less anxiety about human outgroups (Study 1), and priming the salience of a robot workforce reduces prejudice toward outgroups (Study 2), makes people more accepting of outgroup members as leaders and family members (Study 3), and increases wage equality across ingroup and outgroup members in an economic simulation (Study 4). This effect is mediated by panhumanism (Studies 5–6), suggesting that the perception of a common human ingroup explains why robot salience reduces prejudice. We discuss why automation may sometimes exacerbate intergroup tensions and other times reduce them.

T1  - Ten Years of Messaging about the Affordable Care Act in Advertising and News Media: Lessons for Policy and Politics
AN  - 2448094838
AB  - Messaging about the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has seemingly produced a variety of outcomes: millions of Americans gained access to health insurance, yet much of the US public remains confused about major components of the law, and there remain stark and persistent political divides in support of the law. Our analysis of the volume and content of ACA-related media (including both ads and news) helps explain these phenomena, with three conclusions. First, the information environment around the ACA has been complex and competitive, with messaging originating from diverse sponsors with multiple objectives. Second, partisan cues in news and political ads are abundant, likely contributing to the crystallized politically polarized opinion about the law. Third, partisan discussions of the ACA in political ads have shifted in volume, direction, and tone over the decade, presenting divergent views regarding which party is accountable for the law's successes (or failures). We offer evidence for each of these conclusions from longitudinal analyses of the volume and content of ACA messaging, also referencing studies that have linked these messages to attitudes and behavior. We conclude with implications for health communication, political science, and the future outlook for health reform.

T1  - Using counterframing strategies to enhance anti-stigma campaigns related to mental illness
AN  - 2506548116
AB  - Rationale and methods: Despite the prevalence of media-based anti-stigma campaigns, there is little empirical evidence of their effectiveness and little guidance regarding which communicative strategies can bolster their message. Using a Belgian sample (N = 737) recruited in March–April 2019, the current experimental study manipulated a campaign message using counterframing strategies. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to investigate the effectiveness of the resulting nine variants. Results: Campaign effectiveness was most increased by stating that people with a mental illness are "not free-riders or poseurs", or by redefining them as "go-getters" who are "certainly not abnormal or crazy". These variants decreased desired social distance, and significantly reduced stereotype endorsement for people with a high need for cognitive closure. Whereas several campaigns decreased attitudinal stigma for people with a high need for cognitive closure, they inadvertently increased it for people with a low need for cognitive closure. Conclusion: This study indicates that small changes in the body copy can impact a campaign's destigmatizing potential. As such, empirical testing is essential to avoid ineffective or counter-productive anti-stigma interventions. Moreover, this study demonstrates that refuting stigmatizing statements can be a valid strategy in anti-stigma interventions, even though previous literature has argued against it.

T1  - 'I don't think there are great sex differences there': Processes of discursive bridging and othering in a discussion of gendered norms related to alcohol, sexual behaviour, and aggression
AN  - 2444101188
AB  - Background Existing research indicates that sexual behaviour and aggression are particularly important to the reproduction of gendered drinking norms, both in the media and in face-to-face interaction. However, research has yet to understand in more detail the discursive processes whereby actors negotiate gendered norms related to alcohol, sexual behaviour, and aggression. This article examines how actors make symbolic distinctions between themselves and others in discussing alcohol, aggression, and sexual desire, and analyses the similarities and differences within and across gender that they identify in this process. Methods The study relies on individual qualitative interviews with 25 Swedish women and men. To elicit participants' normative positions, we used a newspaper article as a probe during the interviews. Results Findings show that participants highlight similarities between women and men, and variation and individual differences among men and among women in discussing alcohol's effects on sexual desire and 'sexually active behaviour'. Differences, by contrast, are most salient when they discuss alcohol and aggression and seek to distance themselves from 'shabby bar men', rural men, and male football hooligans who drink and fight, outgroups that are marked as working-class in the participants' narratives. Conclusion Two general discursive patterns were identified: discursive bridging across gender and discursive othering across class. For the participants, drinking norms are not as much about general gender differences as they are about the 'dysfunctional' drinking of certain groups of working-class men. These findings contribute to a more specific understanding of the reconstitution of gender boundaries in relation to drinking norms.

T1  - The Negative Associations Between Materialism and Pro-Environmental Attitudes and Behaviors: Individual and Regional Evidence From China
AN  - 2406004316
AB  - Previous studies have shown that materialism is related to environmentalism, but unstable findings still exist. To clarify the relationships between materialism and pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors, the present study addressed some methodological issues and provided both individual- and regional-level evidence from China. Using data from the World Value Survey and the Chinese General Social Survey, we observed that materialism was negatively associated with pro-environmental attitudes (Study 1, n = 2,300; Study 2, n = 3,672) and pro-environmental behaviors (Study 2). Moreover, we found that pro-environmental attitudes partially mediated the association between materialism and pro-environmental behaviors in Study 2. We further searched for additional regional evidence in Study 3, and we found that the more materialistic regions are, the more energy is consumed. Results indicate that materialism is associated with decreases in pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical implications of the research findings.

T1  - How China’s image affects Chinese products in a partisan-motivated US market
AN  - 2427491398
AB  - By proposing a dual-perspective model of attitude formation related to Chinese products, the survey of 592 adults investigated how Americans’ evaluation and purchase intention of Chinese products can be influenced by China’s image driven by a synergy of US politics and mass media. Younger people and minorities had better evaluation of and more intention to purchase Chinese products. A better country image of China contributed to more positive products beliefs and stronger purchase intention. Republicans engaged in partisan-motivated reasoning in their purchase intention, while Democrats converged with nonpartisan audiences. More social media use resulted in stronger purchase intention, while partisan media failed to make an impact on product beliefs and purchase intention. The findings suggested that although Americans’ judgment and purchase intention of Chinese products is affected by individual’s preexisting perception of China, only Republicans are prone to partisan-motivated reasoning of Chinese products. Social media use could lead to more acceptance of Chinese products, but conservative and liberal media seem to make little impact on this matter.

T1  - A Cultural Theory of Partisanship and Policy Attitudes
AN  - 2381951962
AB  - ObjectivePolitical parties provide an important function for a public that is generally seen as not consistently ideological by guiding its thinking about policy issues. In this article, we examine whether the four cultural worldviews derived from grid‐group cultural theory—hierarch, egalitarian, individualist, and fatalist—are predictive of partisan attachments and perceptions of climate change risk among the public.MethodsData come from an original survey of the U.S. public conducted in 2011 and 2012. We use regression analysis to examine partisanship and perceived climate change risk; ordered logit to examine party attachment; and mediation analysis to examine the mediating effect of partisanship on cultural worldviews and climate change risk.ResultsWe find that the group‐oriented cultural types (egalitarians and hierarchs) are more likely to have stronger party attachments than the nongroup‐oriented cultural types (individualists and fatalists). In addition, we find that the mediation effect of party is more pronounced among the group‐oriented types than the nongroup oriented.ConclusionGrid‐group cultural theory is predictive of both partisanship and policy attitudes and partisanship mediates the influence of cultural worldviews on climate change risk, particularly for those types with group orientations.

T1  - Effects of network heterogeneity on social media on opinion polarization among South Koreans: Focusing on fear and political orientation: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2365035439
AB  - Recent studies have shown mixed findings regarding the relationship between network heterogeneity on social media and opinion polarization. Focusing on individual-level variables (i.e., individuals' political orientation, fear of a risky situation, and fear of an out-group), the objective of this study was to investigate opinion polarization over North Korean issues that have brought out threats to South Koreans and tangled with political orientations in the nation. Our analysis indicated that network heterogeneity on social media could decrease polarization. Moderation effects of political orientation and fear of political opponents in the relationship between network heterogeneity and polarization were also found. Findings of this study extend previous discussions regarding the relationship between network heterogeneity and polarization in the context of social media by concentrating on North Korea's threatening situation.

T1  - Political Opinion Formation as Epistemic Practice: The Hashtag Assemblage of #metwo
AN  - 2511154119
AB  - The article contributes to the literature on the political use of hashtags. We argue that hashtag assemblages could be understood in the tradition of representing public opinion through datafication in the context of democratic politics. While traditional data-based epistemic practices like polls lead to the ‘passivation’ of citizens, in the digital constellation this tendency is currently challenged. In media like Twitter, hashtags serve as a technical operator to order the discursive fabrication of diverse publicly articulated opinions that manifest in the assemblage of tweets, algorithms and criticisms. We conceptualize such a critical public as an epistemic sensorium for dislocations based on the expression of experienced social imbalances and its political amplification. On the level of opinion formation, this constitutes a process of democratization, allowing for the expression of diverse opinions and issues even under singular hashtags. Despite this diversity, we see a strong tendency of publicly relevant actors such as news outlets to represent digital forms of opinion expression as unified movements. We argue that this tendency can partly be explained by the affordances of networked media, relating the process of objectification to the network position of the observer. We make this argument empirically plausible by applying methods of network analysis and topic modelling to a dataset of 196,987 tweets sampled via the hashtag #metwo that emerged in the German Twittersphere in the summer of 2018 and united a discourse concerned with racism and identity. In light of this data, we not only demonstrate the hashtag assemblage’s heterogeneity and potential for subaltern agency; we also make visible how hashtag assemblages as epistemic practices are inherently dynamic, distinguishing it from opinion polling through the limited observational capacities and active participation of the actors representing its claims within the hybrid media system.

T1  - Reflective Photobooth – a way to visualise, and challenge perceptions and representations of distanced social groups
AN  - 2359452951
AB  - Taken-for-granted knowledge about people from other social groups is a key challenge for overcoming stereotypes. This article describes a novel arts-based research method to visualise participants’ frames of distanced social groups and aims to trigger reflections among them. The Reflective Photobooth invites participants to dress up as members of distanced social groups, stage a scene, produce pictures, answer prompting questions, and discuss their visualisations. We argue that the artistic re-enactment that underlies the visualisation process can attract diverse groups of participants to engage with research topics, create places for the articulation of critical statements against existing societal clichés and stereotypical media representations, and trigger reflections among participants about taken-for-granted knowledge. The method was tested within the Frame-a-Farmer project, in which the social distance between consumers and food producers in modern agrifood systems was addressed. Results indicate that despite the method bearing some risks and facing some challenges, three promising areas of future application could be identified: (i) raising awareness among large groups of people, (ii) collecting stories or topical vignettes, and (iii) deconstructing taken-for-granted knowledge and societal clichés.

T1  - The immigrant labeling effect: The role of immigrant group labels in prejudice against noncitizens: GPIR
AN  - 2323389808
AB  - Five experiments (N = 2,251) and a meta-analysis examine how group labels shape Americans’ levels of prejudice, behavioral intentions, and policy preferences toward immigrants living in the US without authorization. These studies extend research documenting how the perceived negativity of group labels (e.g., those describing gay people) affects people’s downstream attitudes. To this end, Study 1 examines the perceived negativity of the five most commonly used labels to describe unauthorized immigrants. Study 2 found that relatively negative (vs. neutral) labels (e.g., illegal aliens vs. noncitizens) engendered more prejudice, punitive behavioral intentions, and greater support for punitive policies. Study 3 replicates these effects and examines the role of familiarity. People who personally knew members of the group were more positive towards them overall, but were nevertheless susceptible to the labels’ influence. Studies 4 and 5 provide additional replications and explore prejudice as a mediator of behavioral intentions and policy preferences.

T1  - Moral foundations explain unique variance in political ideology beyond resistance to change and opposition to equality: GPIR
AN  - 2323388916
AB  - Moral foundations theory (MFT), while inspiring much empirical work, has been the target of both methodological and theoretical criticism. One important criticism of MFT is that, in its attempt to explain variability in political ideology, it only repackages the core motives (resistance to change and opposition to equality) and does not actually provide additional explanatory potential. Indeed, some previous studies show that moral foundations do not explain variability in ideology beyond other relevant variables, and that the relation between moral foundations and political orientation is mediated by other ideological variables. In the present research, we examined whether moral foundations can explain variability beyond the core motives in samples from Turkey and the United States. Contrary to some previous findings, we found that moral foundations explain unique variance in general, social, and economic conservatism. These findings suggest that the moral foundations proposed by MFT cannot be reduced to other variables that have been used in the literature to measure ideological proclivities.

T1  - Seeker Are You Protected? Social Media and Protection Granted to Women in Sri Lanka
AN  - 2292913231
AB  - Facebook, which revolutionized social networking, offers solid platforms for women freely to express and give life to their opinions on any subject they desire, from fashion to human rights, feminism to politics. As a result, a number of issues have arisen regarding the safety of social exposure, chief amongst them being the preservation of privacy. This study examines privacy concerns of female Facebook users in Sri Lanka (age group of 20-30) and the possible judicious measures that can be taken by government organizations regarding this matter. During the course of this research, a mixed methodology was adopted in data collection, which included 118 surveys and interviews. The general concern of Facebook privacy, attitudes and expectations was evaluated through the survey. Interviews were conducted with the goal of bringing attention to and evaluating the existing privacy protection mechanisms provided for Facebook users. The willingness displayed by many females to disclose personal views and information on Facebook has become a phenomenon which demonstrates breaking the silence and absolute freedom of expression. The survey revealed that a majority of the survey participants were pessimistic about Facebook security, even after the application of strict privacy settings. This paper concludes with a discussion of the proposed privacy protection, through amendments and reforms, which is viewed as part of the government's legal responsibility to uphold Facebook privacy and affirms the matriarchal cultural values of Sri Lanka, where the general expectation of young females is to raise a family that upholds virtue and family values. In turn, female mental and social security and the prevalence of freedom of expression ensure gender equality in Sri Lanka.

T1  - A test of positive and negative extended intergroup contact in a Chinese minority with perceived group norms and intergroup anxiety as mediators
AN  - 2253806274
AB  - This article is aimed to examine the effect of Uyghur's (minority group) positive and negative extended contact with Han (majority group) within the background of China. One affective (intergroup anxiety) and two cognitive (perceived in‐group and out‐group norms) variables were tested as potential mediators. A sample of 875 Uyghur minority college students ranging in age from 17 to 25 years completed self‐reported measures of direct contact, positive and negative extended contact, intergroup anxiety, perceptions of in‐group and out‐group norms, out‐group attitudes, and contact intentions. Results revealed that both positive and negative extended contact were associated with out‐group attitudes and contact intentions, over and above the effect of direct contact. The effects of both forms of extended contact were mediated by intergroup anxiety, perceived in‐group, and out‐group norms. Notably, positive extended contact exerted larger effects than negative extended contact. This research highlights the significance of considering both positive and negative extended contact and the potential of extended contact as a means to ameliorate intergroup relations from the perspective of minority groups.

T1  - Social Control Meets New Public Management: Examining the Diffusion of State Prison Privatization, 1979‐2010
AN  - 2236093123
AB  - While the merits and perils of privatization have remained a contentious and often polarizing debate, privatization of public services remains commonplace throughout the world. For instance, over the last several decades, U.S. governments at all levels have routinely pursued contracting arrangements for corrections management, known popularly as prison privatization. In this article, state prison privatization (SPP) is examined in three ways. First, we use an externally focused policy diffusion framework to help explain the adoption of SPP‐enabling legislation across U.S. states. Second, we explore the extent to which the American Legislative Exchange Council has influenced the adoption of prison privatization legislation. Third, we explore the role of state wealth inequality in determining a state's propensity to adopt prison privatization policies. Examining state‐level data from 1979 to 2010, this article finds empirical support for each of these key theoretical assertions.

Por ejemplo, durante las últimas décadas, los gobiernos de los EE. UU., en todos los niveles, han seguido de manera rutinaria los acuerdos de contratación para la gestión de correcciones, conocidos popularmente como privatización de prisiones. En este artículo, la privatización de prisiones estatales (SPP) se examina de tres maneras. Primero, usamos un marco de difusión de políticas con enfoque externo para ayudar a explicar la adopción de la legislación habilitada para SPP en todos los estados de EE. UU. En segundo lugar, exploramos hasta qué punto el Consejo de Intercambio Legislativo de los Estados Unidos ha influido en la adopción de la legislación sobre privatización de prisiones. En tercer lugar, exploramos el papel de la desigualdad de riqueza estatal en la determinación de la propensión de un estado a adoptar políticas de privatización de prisiones. Al examinar los datos a nivel estatal de 1979 a 2010, este estudio encuentra apoyo empírico para cada una de estas afirmaciones teóricas clave. Además, encontramos evidencia de que el efecto de difusión externa puede variar según la orientación política del estado.Alternate abstract:社会控制遇上新公共管理：检验1979‐2010年间各州监狱私有化扩散尽管私有化的优缺点仍然充满争议，且时常出现极化，但公共服务的私有化依然在全球都很普遍。例如，过去几十年来，美国各级政府都例行公事地为惩戒管理，即被广为知晓的监狱私有化，安排了外包。本文中，国家监狱私有化（SPP）经过了三种方式的检验。首先，笔者使用聚焦于外部的政策扩散框架，以帮助解释SPP立法在美国各州的广泛采纳。其次，笔者探索了美国立法交流委员会在何种程度上影响了监狱私有化立法的采纳。再次，笔者探索了财富不平等在确定各州采纳监狱私有化政策时的倾向一事上所产生的作用。通过检验1979‐2010年间的州级数据，笔者发现，外部扩散效果可能会因该州的政治倾向而产生差异。

T1  - The Discursive Appeal to Solidarity and Partisan Journalism in Europe’s Migration Crisis
AN  - 2300632050
AB  - The article analyses the discursive appeal to solidarity in the mass media during the unfolding of Europe’s migration crisis. Solidarity was claimed by numerous actors in the public discourse to legitimise political decisions and mobilise public opinion. While it seems that the call for solidarity was shared by many actors, media studies show the ‘partisan journalism’ of media outlets. Thus, the political orientation of media outlets influences their coverage of public debates. Hence, to what extent do different quality newspapers cover the same solidarity claims in times of crisis? In order to answer this question, the crisis coverage of two German and two Irish newspapers with centre-left and centre-right political orientations is examined via the discourse network methodology. Germany is selected due to high political parallelism and a strong affectedness by the crisis, while Ireland is selected because of low political parallelism and a weak affectedness by the migration crisis. The findings demonstrate that partisan journalism persists during Europe’s migration crisis. Especially German party actors are present in both countries, underpinning the central position of Germany. Regarding the appeal to solidarity, political solidarity claims prevail in all four newspapers, indicating the political-institutional asymmetry in the Common European Asylum System. The study contributes to the strategic framing of concepts in public debates and demonstrates that the left-right distinction of media outlets is hardly affected by the migration crisis.

T1  - Police use of force and its video coverage: An experimental study of the impact of media source and content on public perceptions
AN  - 2179661695
AB  - Purpose To explore the influence of media source, suspect's alleged criminal activity, and the rater's socio-demographic attributes on public ratings of video incidents of police use of force (PUF). Methods A national online sample of 581 adults viewed and evaluated four different PUF videos in a 3 × 3 experimental design.Study participants were randomly assigned to experimental conditions involving differences in (1) media sources and (2) suspect's alleged criminal activity.The dependent variables included ratings of the credibility of the video's media source (i.e., trust in the source and accuracy of its video account) and the officer's conduct (i.e., excessive force, justifiable force).The independent and moderating variables included the experimental conditions, personal salience of PUF incidents, the rater's use of different media sources, and other socio-demographic attributes. Results Three major results were found in this study: (1) video accounts of PUF are rated as more trustworthy when the video is attributed to “national TV news” source than “social media” outlets, (2) ratings of excessive force are more likely in PUF incidents when they involve a more dangerous offender (i.e., an alleged murder vs. shoplifter), and (3) the impact of the individual's socio-demographic characteristics on these public perceptions are strongly moderated by the personal salience of PUF incidents to the rater and their pattern of daily usage of conventional and social media. Conclusions The visual content in short, video clips of PUF incidents strongly influences public attitudes about the officer's conduct as excessive and unjustifiable.However, by the timely release of the video images and framing them within their wider context, police departments may better demonstrate transparency and help overcome various cognitive biases that may underlie adverse public reactions to PUF incidents.

T1  - An East–West comparison of healthcare evaluations in Europe: Do institutions matter?
AN  - 2126428316
AB  - Differences in welfare attitudes of Eastern and Western Europeans have often been explained in terms of legacies of communism. In this article, we explore evaluations of healthcare systems across European countries and argue that East–West differences in these evaluations are explained by differences in the current institutional design of healthcare systems in the two regions. The empirical analysis is based on the fourth round of the European Social Survey, applying multilevel and multilevel mediation analysis. Our results support the institutional explanation. Regional differences in healthcare evaluations are explained by institutional characteristics of the healthcare system, that is, lower financial resources, higher out-of-pocket payments, and lower supply of primary healthcare services in Eastern compared to Western European countries. We conclude that specific aspects of the current institutional design of healthcare systems are crucial for understanding East–West differences in healthcare evaluations and encourage research to further explore the relevance of institutions for differences in welfare state attitudes across socio-political contexts.

T1  - Media Use and Satisfaction with Democracy: Testing the Role of Political Interest
AN  - 1967238023
AB  - In the process of political communication, media use has strong influences on citizens’ attitudes toward politics. However, the importance of political interest in shaping the relationship between media use and satisfaction with democracy has not been extensively studied. This study makes a contribution to identify the role of political interest in mediating the effects of media use on satisfaction with democracy. Consistent with the virtuous circle theory, the findings from this study show that there are significantly positive associations between reading a newspaper, listening to the radio, and using the Internet for political information and political interest. Citizens who are more interested in politics also tend to be more satisfied with democracy. By contrast, in accordance with the media malaise theory, our results also show that reading a newspaper, listening to the radio, and using the Internet for political information are negatively related to satisfaction with democracy. Distinct from existing literature, our findings indicate that the indirect positive effects of media use mediated by political interest are outweighed by the negative direct effects of media use on satisfaction with democracy. Hence, the relative magnitudes of direct and indirect effects are critical for the overall effects of media use on satisfaction with democracy.

T1  - Constructing and contesting threat: Representations of white British Muslims across British national and Muslim newspapers
AN  - 2072252717
AB  - White British Muslims pose a challenge to racialised representations of British Muslims as non‐white, foreign and Other. By drawing on tools from Critical Discourse Analysis to develop Social Representations Theory on a micro‐analytic level, and making connections with other relevant social psychological theories on intergroup relations, this article examines the constructions of white British Muslims as a threat in six national and two Muslim British newspapers. It looks at how discourses are used to create, perpetuate and challenge the ‘hegemonisation’ of social representations in majority and minority press. The findings show that white British Muslims are portrayed as a threat not just despite of, but because of, their position as part of the ‘white British’ ingroup. Consequently, the threat they pose often leads to their Muslimness being emphasised. This was, at times, contested, however, either through direct challenges, or by making the threat ambivalent by drawing on their whiteness.

T1  - Precursors and Outcomes of Students' Attitude towards Social Media Advertising; the Case of the University of Semnan
AN  - 2175284301
AB  - Introduction: By the increasing expansion of the Internet on various issues of life, the way of exchanging transactions through the Internet is taken attention Very much by organizations and their customers. On the other hand, in today's business world, most marketers are trying to gain a better understanding of the attitudes and emotions of their customers. Attitudinal structures are useful tools for understanding the behavior of buyers and consumers in the market. The effect of advertising on customers is largely due to the attitude of consumers towards advertising, because it is believed that a strong attitude toward advertising affects consumer behavior. The paucity of research in the field of social media advertising that integrates attitudes and advertising and the implications and attitudes of consumers towards advertising is a challenge for individuals to understand the trends and criteria associated with these structures. Therefore, the present study seeks to identify and investigate the effective factors on the attitude toward social media advertising and its impact on informational and behavioral responses of consumers. Theoretical Framework Attitude is considered to be the expression of goodwill or the rejection of an object, idea or person. Also, attitude is described as a person's position based on his or her own assessment of the tendency or orientation towards a person, personality or object and depends on the experiences and motivation of the individual. In addition, the attitude is based on the motivation of the particular stimulus in the form of an idea, person or product is different, so that the formation of a highly dependent on situation of wanted phenomenon. Therefore, the individual learns from his or her attitude and influences from advertising, because it stimulates individuals to move their thinking towards an optimal attitude (Raza et al., 2018). The general attitude towards advertising is defined as the emotional response of the audience members to advertising. In marketing management, the attitude towards advertising is very important, because the attitude of consumers is a major factor in influencing consumers' buying intent (Can & Kaya, 2016). If customers have a positive attitude towards social media advertising, this will lead to customer shopping behavior (Mir, 2015). The degree to which an individual believes that with using the system of mental effort will be free is called the perceived ease of use (Hansen et al., 2017). However, habitude is used as a result of cognitive processes or harassing acts that apparently cannot explain irrational and uncontrollable aspects of media addiction (LaRose et al., 2009). Psychological Dependence expresses the severity of the links between a person and the social media (Park et al., 2010). In this research, we tried to identify and examine the factors influencing the attitude toward social media advertising. The current research model is a new model based on the reformations made to the previous models and tested for the first time. In the present research, informational and behavioral responses are considered as two consequences and the effect of attitudes toward social media advertising is considered. Methodology Considering the fact that here in this research we are attempting to test the factors affecting the University of Semnan’s students’ attitude towards social media advertising, informational and behavioral responses of users, and develops applied knowledge about the attitude toward advertising and the impact between variables, in terms of purpose, is an applied research. Also, this research is conducted in real-world situations and regarding this fact is a field research, and because of the causal relationship between perceived ease of use, habitude and psychological dependence, based on the data collection, the research is a correlation type. The statistical population of this study is 325 MSc & Ph.D. Student at Semnan University. To determine the sample size, the Cochran formula was used for a limited population. Findings and Results Some of the primary results indicate that the perceived ease of use has a positive and significant effect on the habitude and attitude towards social media advertising. Also, the habitude has a positive and significant effect on psychological dependence. However, no significant relationship was found between habitude and attitude. Finally, there was a positive and significant relationship between attitude toward social media advertising and informational and behavioral responses. Conclusions and Suggestions The attitudes of consumers and their behavior are in strong relationships. This means that the impact of advertising on consumer attitudes has a number signals for consumer behavior how to act. As a result, people who have a more positive attitude toward social media advertising are more likely to click on ads. This means that users have a positive attitude towards social media advertising and are considered it to be a good phenomenon. Several studies have shown that consumers' attitudes toward advertising are the intermediary between the beliefs of consumers about advertising and their behavioral responses. In addition, there is a strong relationship between attitude and behavioral responses to Internet advertising. Therefore, to the extent that the attitude towards Internet advertising is more positive, the probability of responding to a positive behavior toward advertising will increase. Therefore, research findings are recommended to social media users who are more focused on attracting attention to advertising texts and to receive relevant information from social media ads. According to research findings, social media users are advised to focus more attention on advertising text messages and to receive relevant information from social media ads. Also, social media users are advised not to miss the lack of attention in the media that are less prioritized. Therefore, it is suggested that when social media users find a good attitude toward social media ads, they are more likely to engage in advertising messages and obtain information about advertised products or brands.

T1  - Perceived peer and school norm effects on youth antisocial and prosocial behaviours through intergroup contact in Northern Ireland
AN  - 2064683544
AB  - In adolescence, youth spend a high proportion of their time with their peers and in school; it is hardly surprising therefore that perceptions of peer and school norms have a strong influence on their attitudes and behaviours. These norms, however, do not always influence youth in the same way. Building on past research, the present study examines the role of peer norms and school norms in influencing the quantity and quality of intergroup contact, as well as the impact of such contact on positive and negative intergroup behaviours. Youth (aged 14–16) living in Northern Ireland (N = 466, evenly split by religion and gender) were recruited through their school as part of a two‐wave study and completed a series of survey measures including intergroup contact (quality and quantity), norms (peer and school), and participation in sectarian antisocial behaviour and outgroup prosocial behaviour. Mediation analysis was conducted in Mplus. Controlling for wave 1 responses on contact and behavioural outcomes, findings demonstrate that more positive peer norms are associated with less participation in antisocial behaviour and more participation in prosocial outgroup behaviours through increased and better quality intergroup contact. Positive school norms were also associated with increased prosocial behaviour, but only though better quality contact. Findings demonstrate the relative importance of peer norms compared to school norms for this age group. The results have implications for school‐based interventions that aim to improve intergroup relations and highlight the importance of peer networks to promote more positive outgroup behaviours in divided societies such as Northern Ireland.

T1  - Rethinking the Debate Over Recent Polling Failures
AN  - 2015014168
AB  - In Inventing American Religion (2015), sociologist Robert Wuthnow's prescient history and harsh critique of the survey industry, he called for a frank national dialogue "about what is being tapped in polls and whether the investment is worth it." He estimated that more than 1,200 unique firms and institutions had conducted 37,000 separate public opinion polls in the United States through 2012, mostly since the 1990s. According to my count of that same polltracking service Wuthnow cited, an additional 12,000 polls were conducted in the four-year election cycle that followed, concluding in 2016 with Donald Trump's electoral college upset. While the unexpected result prompted some industry flagellation and introspection (e.g., Cohn, 2017; Kennedy et al., 2017; Silver, 2017) a broader dialogue about opinion polls is long overdue. What, if anything, are we actually learning from all these surveys? I argue as others have (e.g., Lepore, 2015; Zukin, 2015) that yes, there is a crisis in public opinion research, but it is not strictly speaking the one that has received most of the attention from scholars and journalists. I am referring of course to hotly contested disputes about the impact of declining response rates, strategies for selecting and modeling representative samples from various panels of Internet respondents, and implications of the rising use of multiple survey modes (for an overview, see Kennedy et al., 2017). These changes may have far-reaching implications. But no, my question for those of us who study public opinion is not about the limits of our methods or our abilities to accurately and reliably forecast elections. Rather, in this article I ask, as Wuthnow does, whether we ought to demand both less and more from the millions spent on survey research each election cycle: we should be less concerned with forecasting errors and more troubled by ingrained practices in the use of surveys that reveal less about public attitudes than they should.

T1  - "If You're a Parasite, Then You're Not Normal": Exploring Perceptions of Normality with Individuals who have Experienced Depression
TT  - "Si eres un parásito, entonces no eres normal": explorando las percepciones de normalidad con individuos que han experimentado la depresión
AN  - 2140800419
AB  - Investigaciones sociológicas previas han demostrado que lo que se denomina cordura o salud mental se describe según un ideal social. Los problemas de salud mental han sido teorizados como una desviación de tales normas. La depresión, en particular, ha sido objeto de la contemplación sociológica, con respecto a su divergencia de una normatividad social occidental centrada en la funcionalidad, la adaptación y la productividad. Esta investigación se suma a este cuerpo de trabajo sobre la depresión como la desviación de las normas sociales, queriendo abordar una brecha dentro de la literatura, mediante la exploración de las formas en las que el estado "post-depresivo" se puede definir de acuerdo con las normas sociales. Se pretende analizar los vínculos entre "post-depresión" y la normalidad, desde la perspectiva de individuos que han padecido depresión. Se realizaron 46 entrevistas semiestructuradas con individuos canadienses que han experimentado depresión. Los resultados de nuestro análisis de contenido muestran que la ausencia de depresión a menudo es sinónimo de normalidad y se caracteriza por las siguientes dimensiones: una actitud positiva; el potencial para tomar decisiones; funcionalidad y rendimiento; autogestión; una relación positiva con los demás; y la noción de proyectos significativos. Nuestros resultados muestran que los participantes no definen la ausencia de depresión después de los indicadores psiquiátricos o clínicos, tal y como se registra en el DSM, y que no consideran que sea un retorno a un estado previo a la depresión. Por el contrario, la post-depresión es idealizada, percibida como un estado de conformidad infalible con las expectativas y normas sociales.Alternate abstract:Previous research in sociology has shown that what is considered as sanity or mental health is described according to a social ideal. Mental health problems have been theorized as a deviance from such norms. Depression, in particular, has been the object of sociological contemplation due to its divergence from a Western social normativity focused on functionality, adaptation and productivity. This research adds to this body of work on depression as a deviation from social norms. It seeks to address a gap within the literature, by exploring the ways in which the "post-depressive" state may be defined in accordance with social norms. As such, it analyzes the links between "post-depression" and normality, from the perspective of individuals having lived with depression. 46 semi-structured interviews were conducted with Canadians individuals who have experienced depression. Results from our content analysis show that the absence of depression was often synonymous with normality and characterized by the following dimensions: a positive attitude; the potential to take action; functionality and performance; self-management; a positive relationship with others; and the notion of meaningful projects. Our results show that participants do not define the absence of depression following psychiatric or clinical indicators, as recorded in the DSM, and that they do not consider it to be a return to an anterior, pre-depression, state. Rather, post-depression is idealized, perceived as a state of unfailing conformity to social expectations and norms.

AN  - 2063292907
AB  - Making the work of security organizations known to school children is a means of mitigating feelings of insecurity provoked by the diffusion of information on terrorist attacks in communications media and through social media. Whilst there is a longer tradition of projects to educate school children on the police and the armed forces, no comparable projects have been found on the intelligence services. With the objective of filling this gap, the authors designed and produced two animated educational videos for Spanish school children on the Spanish intelligence service: The National Intelligence Center (CNI). In this paper, the impact of the videos is measured in relation to the knowledge, the stereotypes, and the attitudes of school children towards the CNI. To do so, two questionnaires were administered to 1,092 school children aged 8 and 12, before and after viewing the videos. The results of the questionnaire prior to screening the videos showed that the school children held no knowledge of the intelligence services, and expressed highly developed stereotypes, and moderately negative attitudes towards them. Student-t tests for related samples were used to confirm the responses, on the basis of which it was found that the videos modified both knowledge and stereotyping, as well as attitudes towards the CNI. Specifically, following the screenings the knowledge of the school children improved, stereotyping diminished, and positive attitudes increased.Alternate abstract:Dar a conocer a los escolares las organizaciones de seguridad es un medio para reducir la inseguridad generada por la difusión de los atentados terroristas en los medios de comunicación y redes sociales. Mientras que hay una mayor tradición en proyectos para educar a los escolares sobre la policía y los militares, no se han encontrado proyectos análogos sobre los servicios de inteligencia. Con el objetivo de suplir esta carencia, los autores diseñaron y produjeron dos vídeos animados educativos destinados a escolares españoles sobre el servicio de inteligencia español, el Centro Nacional de Inteligencia (CNI). Este artículo mide cuál es el impacto de los vídeos en el conocimiento, los estereotipos y las actitudes de los escolares hacia el CNI. Para ello, se aplicaron dos cuestionarios a 1.092 escolares de 8 a 16 años, antes y después de la visualización de los vídeos. Los resultados previos a la visualización mostraron un conocimiento nulo, alto grado de estereotipos y actitudes moderadamente negativas hacia los servicios de inteligencia. Se comprobaron las respuestas mediante pruebas T para muestras relacionadas, a partir de las cuales se obtuvo que los vídeos modificaban el conocimiento, los estereotipos y las actitudes hacia el CNI. Específicamente, tras la visualización mejoró el conocimiento de los escolares, disminuyó el grado de estereotipos y aumentaron las actitudes positivas.

T1  - The Relation between Ethnic and Civic Views on Citizenship, Attitudes towards Immigrants and Sympathy for Welfare Recipients
AN  - 1980696333
AB  - In this study we investigate the relationship between different definitions of national citizenship, sympathy for welfare recipients, and how this relation is mediated by attitudes towards immigrants. We make use of the 2008 wave of the Belgian Political Panel Survey 2006-11, in which over 4,800 18-year-old adolescents were questioned. The results demonstrate that an agreement with both ethnic and civic definitions of national citizenship is related to reduced sympathy for welfare recipients, although the association with an ethnic view on citizenship is clearly dominant. Furthermore, these relations are almost entirely of an indirect nature: ethnic and civic citizenship attitudes are associated with negative views on immigrants, which, in turn, is the key variable that is associated with reduced sympathy for welfare recipients.

T1  - Neighborhood Priority or Desegregation Plans? A Spatial Analysis of Voting on San Francisco’s Student Assignment System
AN  - 1962127592
AB  - In 2011, San Francisco held an unprecedented citywide vote on its public schools’ student assignment policy. Proposition H provides a unique opportunity to learn more about the public’s desire for “neighborhood schools,” as compared to their interest in maintaining districtwide desegregation efforts. This paper takes the approach of applying geographic information system tools and regression analysis to understand the relationships between neighborhood, race, income, and attitudes toward student assignment systems. By comparing the election results with demographics and school quality data, we identify patterns of support for the narrowly defeated proposition. Support for a shift toward neighborhood-based schools was higher in census tracts with high-performing schools, more school age children, high median income, or a large fraction of foreign-born residents, and lower in tracts with a high percentage of Latinos. The shifting race- and class-based politics of the city foreshadow expected demographic shifts in the US.

T1  - Media Use, Democratic Values, and Political Participation: Empirical Evidence from Taiwan
AN  - 1925773882
AB  - This paper extends understanding of the relationship between media use and attitudes toward democratic values. We employ the two-step estimation approach to examine the relationship between media use and attitudes toward democratic values as well as consequential association with political participation. The empirical results show that media use to obtain news information is positively related to attitudes toward democratic values. The findings also note that attitudes toward democratic values are positively associated with engagement in politics. The results support the argument that media use is significant for shaping citizens' attitudes toward democratic values by providing information about public affairs and expanding citizens' understanding about democratic politics. As such, media use facilitates democratic socialization and leads to more involvement in political behaviors.

T1  - #SayHerName: a case study of intersectional social media activism
AN  - 1916702297
AB  - Social media activism presents sociologists with the opportunity to develop a deeper understanding of how groups form and sustain collective identities around political issues throughout the course of a social movement. This paper contributes to a growing body of sociological literature on social media by applying an intersectional framework to a content analysis of over 400,000 tweets related to #SayHerName. Our findings demonstrate that Twitter users who identified with #SayHerName engage in intersectional mobilization by highlighting Black women victims of police violence and giving attention to intersections with gender identity. #SayHerName is a dialogue that centres Black cisgender and transgender women victims of state-sanctioned violence. Additionally, #SayHerName is a space for highlighting Black women victims of non-police violence. Therefore, we propose that future research on social media activism should incorporate intersectionality as a basis for understanding the symbols and language of twenty-first century social movements.

T1  - Meanings of (dis)connection: Exploring non-users in isolated rural communities with internet access infrastructure
AN  - 2069970116
AB  - While public policy worldwide has focused on providing digital connectivity infrastructure in remote areas, there remain people who are digitally excluded. Hence, it is important to explore why people, despite having access to a digital connection, do not go online. As the third part of a three-year project on digital inclusion in isolated communities in Chile, this study draws on findings from focus groups conducted with non-Internet users who live in three remotes but digitally connected villages, to unravel the elements associated with their decision to remain digitally excluded. The main findings indicate that strong ties within the community shelter their sense of isolation providing a feeling of closeness, whereas the internet is perceived as disruptive. In addition, negative attitudes about the Internet emerge from the discussions: the internet is associated with addiction and isolation. Finally, the absence of digital skills makes smartphones and computers unknown entities, a black box people feel unable to or overwhelmed at the thought of learning how to use. However, many are facing a hard choice due to their need to remain in contact with those outside the community as well as promote and develop their small business ventures. Therefore, there is a cultural construction of the internet as a required form of progress that nonetheless does more harm than good to a tight-knit community.

T1  - Accepted monitoring or endured quarantine? Ebola contacts' perceptions in Senegal
AN  - 1912585894
AB  - During the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic, transmission chains were controlled through contact tracing, i.e., identification and follow-up of people exposed to Ebola cases. WHO recommendations for daily check-ups of physical symptoms with social distancing for 21 days were unevenly applied and sometimes interpreted as quarantine. Criticisms arose regarding the use of coercion and questioned contact tracing on ethical grounds. This article aims to analyze contact cases' perceptions and acceptance of contact monitoring at the field level. In Senegal, an imported case of Ebola virus disease in September 2014 resulted in placing 74 contact cases in home containment with daily visits by volunteers. An ethnographic study based on in-depth interviews with all stakeholders performed in September -October 2014 showed four main perceptions of monitoring: a biosecurity preventive measure, suspension of professional activity, stigma attached to Ebola, and a social obligation. Contacts demonstrated diverse attitudes. Initially, most contacts agreed to comply because they feared being infected. They adhered to the national Ebola response measures and appreciated the empathy shown by volunteers. Later, acceptance was improved by the provision of moral, economic, and social support, and by the final lack of any new contamination. But it was limited by the socio-economic impact on fulfilling basic needs, the fear of being infected, how contacts' family members interpreted monitoring, conflation of contacts as Ebola cases, and challenging the rationale for containment Acceptance was also related to individual aspects, such as the professional status of women and health workers who had been exposed, and contextual aspects, such as the media's role in the social production of stigma. Ethnographic results show that, even when contacts adhere rather than comply to containment through coercion, contact monitoring raises several ethical issues. These insights should contribute to the ethics debate about individual rights versus crisis public health measures.

T1  - That Man Behind the Curtain: Investigating the Sexual Online Dating Behavior of Men Who Have Sex With Men but Hide Their Same-Sex Sexual Attraction in Offline Surroundings
AN  - 1923040648
AB  - This study investigates how men who have sex with men (MSM) use chat and dating sites based on theories of stigma-related offline behavior and online self-disclosure. We hypothesize that hidden MSM (those who self-label as heterosexual or who hide their same-sex sexual attraction from family, friends, acquaintances, or a female romantic partner) differ from open MSM in how they behave on gay chat and dating sites and in offline gay venues. Drawing on a survey of 12,002 MSM, we show that hidden MSM tend to mask their identity on gay chat and dating sites while avoiding offline gay venues. They also focus more strongly on online sexual activities (e.g., masturbating during online chats) when using gay chat and dating sites. However, they spend the same amount of time on these sites, and they use them to initiate offline sexual encounters as often and as fast as open MSM.

T1  - The opportunities and challenges of diversity: Explaining its impact on individuals and groups
AN  - 1891309316
AB  - Demographic trends reveal that modern societies have become increasingly diverse. Within the social sciences, these changes have been reflected in concerns about the implications of social diversity. Although early research noted that diversity may have negative consequences for societies and individuals, more recent scholarship has indicated that diversity is not always translated into negative outcomes. These inconsistent findings initiated a scholarly debate concerning the impact of many different forms of diversity for a host of social outcomes. It is now clear that the boundary conditions of these effects are yet to be fully understood. This Special Issue offers a collection of research advances identifying mediating and moderating variables addressing when and why diversity impacts intergroup relational outcomes. By focusing on different levels of diversity (i.e., in the society and in groups), this research also sheds light on the effectiveness of ideologies and policies for managing diversity.

T1  - "BUT AREN'T WE ALL POOR?" HOW WHITES' PERCEPTIONS OF ECONOMIC GROUP THREAT INFLUENCE RACIAL ATTITUDES IN MICHIGAN
AN  - 1836863641
AB  - This paper presents a test of the power threat hypothesis (Blalock 1967) through an investigation of the role that whites ' perceptions of economic conditions have on their racial attitudes. This relationship is analyzed using data from Michigan 's State of the State Survey in 2009 when economic conditions were fairly had. Findings support the power threat hypothesis and demonstrate that whites who had more negative perceptions of their own or community financial status were more likely to have negative racial attitudes. Additionally, education and political affiliation were found to he important factors in mediating the relationship between whites ' perceptions of economic conditions and racial attitudes, with conservative, less educated whites exhibiting more negative racial attitudes than liberal more educated whites. These findings suggest a need for future research examining if and why marginalized whites invest in symbolic racial privilege at the expense of their own economic realities.

T1  - Personality's effect on European identification
AN  - 1809233785
AB  - A superordinate identity improves intergroup relations and bolsters support for the political system. Yet, why do only some identify superordinately? I argue that personality is an important determinant. I test this using an original survey in the United Kingdom, where European Union integration has increased the salience and feasibility of the "European" identity option in addition to a national one. Several Big Five traits matter: openness and extraversion increase identification with Europe while agreeableness decreases it. Mediation analysis subsequently shows that personality's effects also travel through the mechanisms of risk aversion, knowledge, and ideology. Results imply that certain predispositions prompt some to be more receptive than others to seeing themselves in superordinate terms and that European identification may be at least partly more primordial than previously thought.

AN  - 1807164669
AB  - Loughlin's article assesses the activities of The Link, a British pro-Nazi organization promoting Anglo-German conciliation in Northern Ireland in the years leading up to the Second World War. It situates the Ulster branch of the movement within the context of the domestic politics of the region, the British state, Anglo-Irish relations and wider European developments. As a field of activity for The Link, Northern Ireland posed unique and complex problems. The regional branch's prospects for development were complicated, for instance, by how, for nationalists, the aggression of Nazi domestic and foreign policies was reflected in the Northern Ireland government's domestic policies, and also in the way in which Nazi policy towards religion alienated the region's Catholic and Protestant communities. Loughlin also illustrates how the government's approach towards the local Jewish community and Jewish refugees-in a region largely without the levels of antisemitism found in both British and southern Irish public opinion-was informed by a combination of sympathy and local political considerations. Perhaps most uniquely, he illuminates the singularity of the Ulster branch within The Link organization, especially the attitude of its chairman, Admiral Sir Barry Domvile, who regarded Northern Ireland as an obstacle to the establishment of an effective Anglo-Irish defence policy and wished to see the region united with Eire.

T1  - Mass media, new technology, and ideology: An analysis of political trends in China
AN  - 2427491720
AB  - Based on a nationwide survey, this study examines the mediated constructions of political ideology and its antecedents in contemporary China. The empirical findings offer insights into China’s future by examining political beliefs in the country. Our study found that most of the respondents share an inclination toward Liberalism, indicating that the general public harbors expectations not only for expansion of market competition to ensure the country’s successful entry into the world economic system in the age of globalization, but also for deepening political reforms, increased supervision of political power, and growing access to democratic participation. The study also investigated the relationship between media use and political ideology, as the former, together with new technology, predicts the latter to varying degrees. In addition, social psychological factors such as the motivation to use the Internet and trust in media were found to play significant roles in these complex relationships. Individuals’ social interactions and their political cognitions also help to explain the complexity of political ideology in a transitional society.

T1  - Masking fears: SARS and the politics of public health in China
AN  - 1733940856
AB  - This paper examines shifts in attitudes to mask-wearing during and in the aftermath of the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 2002-2003. In the PRC, as throughout East Asia, face masks were widely adopted as a practical preventative measure. However, the ubiquitous image of the masked Chinese citizen in both the Chinese and international media also acquired a political resonance. Masks were equated with the Party's attempts to censure dissent and 'cover up' the epidemic. A perceived lack of government transparency, at least in the initial phase of SARS, recalled earlier public health incidents and episodes of public dissension, notably the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Drawing on samples of qualitative data from a broad range of Chinese and English language sources, the paper shows how debates about mask-wearing in China during SARS became intertwined with political concerns, reflecting a tension between the Party's liberalizing policy -- epitomized by the country's admission to membership of the World Trade Organization in December 2001 -- and real anxieties about the consequential 'fall-out' of this new openness. The paper concludes by arguing for an approach to public health which incorporates a critical capacity, particularly in relation to the ways in which political contexts may determine responses to epidemic episodes.

T1  - Xenophobia across the class divide: South African attitudes towards foreigners 2003-2012
AN  - 1784417787
AB  - In May 2008 anti-immigrant riots in South Africa displaced more than a hundred thousand people. Despite the media attention that the riots attracted, there has been no study that presents trend data on anti-immigrant sentiment for the period after 2008. This paper uses data from the nine rounds of the South African Social Attitudes Survey over the period 2003-2012 to fill this gap and test the success of government commitments to reduce anti-immigrant prejudice. The results reveal that attempts to combat xenophobia have been ineffectual, with anti-immigrant sentiment prevalent and widespread in 2012. Afrophobia was observed, with a majority of citizens identifying foreign African nationals as the group they least wanted to come and live in South Africa. The government is advised to urgently address the alarming and widespread pervasiveness of anti-immigrant sentiment in South Africa.

T1  - Divide and Rule, Unite and Resist: Contact, Collective Action and Policy Attitudes among Historically Disadvantaged Groups
AN  - 1710568945
AB  - Racial segregation encourages members of historically advantaged groups to form negative intergroup attitudes, which then motivate practices of discrimination that sustain inequality and disadvantage. By implication, interventions designed to increase intergroup contact have been proposed as a means of reducing dominant group prejudices and promoting social change. In this article, we highlight another mechanism through which segregation shapes intergroup relations, namely, by inhibiting political solidarity between historically disadvantaged groups. Building on a field survey conducted in postapartheid South Africa, we demonstrate how challenging this form of segregation may reveal alternative mechanisms through which intergroup contact facilitates social change. Notably, we report evidence that positive contact with Black residents of an informal settlement in Pietermaritzburg was associated with Indian residents' support for political policies and forms of collective action that might improve conditions in that settlement. In addition, we show that such support was partly mediated by perceptions of collective discrimination.

T1  - Extended contact through cross-group romantic relationships
AN  - 1709474886
AB  - Cross-group romantic relationships are an extremely intimate and often maligned form of intergroup contact. Yet, according to intergroup contact theory, these relationships have the potential to improve the intergroup attitudes of others via extended contact. This study combines the interpersonal and intergroup literatures to examine the outcomes associated with knowing a partner in a cross-group romantic relationship. Results suggest that cross-group romantic partners encounter greater disapproval toward their relationships than same-group partners and, as a result, their relationships are perceived more negatively. Nevertheless, extended contact with cross-group partners, controlling for participants' cross-group friendships and romantic relationships, predicts more positive attitudes toward cross-group dating and positive intergroup attitudes in general, mediated by perceived ingroup norms toward cross-group relationships.

T1  - MARTA SERVICE CUTS IN HOTLANTA: USING THE REGIME THEORY AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE FRAMEWORK TO ANALYZE TRANSPORTATION RACISM IN HOTLANTA
AN  - 1842827806
AB  - We are faced with critical transportation issues in our metropolitan cities. Transportation provides access to opportunity and serves as a key component in addressing poverty, unemployment, and equal opportunity goals. Transportation equity is about access, opportunity, and fairness. Atlanta is experiencing transportation racism/transportation discrimination in its decision-making process of MARTA service cuts. Americans must invest in public transportation to assist us in reducing our dependence on imported oil. Atlanta, Georgia ranks as the 40th largest city in the United States and the sixth largest in the southeastern region. Over the last three decades, Atlanta's metropolitan population has increased to over three million people. Hotlanta has become a very popular city to host conventions which attracts over three million attendees/visitors for these conventions. However, a very good transportation system is needed to allow these tourists to have mobility while they are visiting the city for conferences. Surprisingly, in 2012 Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) is cutting bus services and increasing their fares due to projections that sales tax revenues will increase the $30 million short fall in the next five years. The sales tax is MARTA's main source of funding. This means the agency will have to make cuts to ensure it has the $40 million in operation reserves required by law. MARTA can only spend half of the sales tax revenues on operations. This article uses the regime theory and the environmental justice framework to examine MARTA's service cuts in Atlanta. The authors use a transportation equity analysis to examine the MARTA service cuts on transit-dependent riders. The authors reviewed several newspaper articles, journal articles, reports, and websites on MARTA's transportation equity issues. A survey was conducted on transit riders to see how transit-dependent riders feel about MARTA's service cuts. The authors offer recommendations on how MARTA can maintain services without increasing their fares.

T1  - "The Contact Hypothesis" and Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Parenting
AN  - 1674198756
AB  - "The contact hypothesis" refers to the value of heterosexuals' interpersonal contact with gay men and lesbians in lowering negative attitudes toward them. With the increasing number of same-sex parented families worldwide, in spite of a generalized lack of appropriate social and legal protection, the issue of attitudes toward gay and lesbian parents gains special relevance. A sample of 1690 Portuguese heterosexual individuals were asked about their interpersonal contact experiences with gay men and lesbians, their attitudes toward them and toward same-sex parenting. Results revealed that women and non-religious participants were significantly more likely to have gay and lesbian acquaintances and friends, feel more comfortable in their company, and hold less negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians, and gay and lesbian parenting. A path analysis model revealed that interpersonal contact experiences were not directly linked to attitudes toward same-sex families, but were mediated by homonegativity and comfort with gay men and lesbians. These findings extend previous knowledge about the value of interpersonal contact, by highlighting the roles of homonegativity and positive affect as mediators of contact experiences on attitudes toward same-sex parented families.

T1  - Why the Media's Role in Issues of Race and Ethnicity Should be in the Spotlight
AN  - 1662632686
AB  - In everything from the policies that regulate media industries to the practices of the organizations that produce the messages to the usage patterns of the consumers that choose them, mass media are implicated in real-world interracial/ethnic dynamics. Yet, despite the obvious associations between media and issues of race and ethnicity, a comprehensive effort aimed at documenting and addressing these links has not been undertaken. The current issue, Media Representations of Race and Ethnicity: Implications for Identity, Intergroup Relations, and Public Policy, endeavors to do just that. The merits of such an effort are articulated in this introduction to the volume alongside a review of the current state of the research in this domain.

T1  - Media-Induced Elevation as a Means of Enhancing Feelings of Intergroup Connectedness
AN  - 1662632631
AB  - The majority of research on media counter-stereotyping of race/ethnicity has tended to employ positive portrayals or counter-stereotypical exemplars as a primary strategy in eliciting positive attitudes among White participants. In contrast, this article reports the results of an experiment on the unique role of affective responses to media messages as a mechanism in inducing greater feelings of connectedness with a diversity of racial/ethnic groups. Our focus is on the affective response of elevation specifically, which refers to feelings of being moved, touched, and inspired by images of people engaged in morally beautiful acts such as love, generosity, and kindness. Results show that the experience of elevation in response to inspiring videos was associated with heightened feelings of overlap between the self and humanity, with this overlap associated with greater feelings of connectedness with those from a diversity of racial/ethnic groups. This connection was also associated with more favorable attitudes.

T1  - Beliefs about group malleability and out-group attitudes: The mediating role of perceived threat in interactions with out-group members
AN  - 1700674930; 201525085
AB  - Recent research suggests that inducing fixed (rather than malleable) beliefs about groups leads to more negative attitudes toward out-groups. The present paper identifies the underlying mechanism of this effect. We show that individuals with a fixed belief about groups tend to construe intergroup settings as threatening situations that might reveal shortcomings of their in-group (perceived threat). In the present research, we measured (Study 1) and manipulated (Study 2) participants' lay theories about group malleability. We found that the extent to which individuals had an entity (versus an incremental) group theory influenced the level of threat they felt when interacting with out-group members, and that perceived threat in turn affected their level of ethnocentrism and prejudice. These findings shed new light on the role of lay theories in intergroup attitudes and suggest new ways to reduce prejudice. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Media, race and crime: Racial perceptions and criminal culpability in a multiracial national context
AN  - 1667948676; 201510473
AB  - This study contributes to the limited literature on race and crime in a multicultural Asian context. Based on a survey in Singapore, where multiracialism is a fundamental political pillar and yet discourse about race is mostly shunned, the findings suggest a relationship between media consumption and racial perceptions. Respondents who consume more race-specific media have less negative racial perceptions of their own race, and more negative racial perceptions about other races. Respondents who consume more crime-related media content on TV, newspapers, and social networking sites tend to be more racially prejudiced against other races. Those who pay more attention to crime-related media content hold more negative racial perceptions of other races, and have harsher criminal culpability judgments of other races while holding a diminished culpability judgment of one's own race.

T1  - Organized crime and group-based ideology: The association between masculine honor and collective opposition against criminal organizations
AN  - 1700674062; 201524908
AB  - What is the role of culture in establishing young people's pathways into gang membership? Italian criminal organizations (COs) exhibit adherence to codes of honor and masculinity, important values in the context where they originated. Here it is proposed that the embedding of these values at an individual level may lessen young people's group-based opposition to such organizations, and indirectly, create a space in which such organizations can persist and recruit. In a study of young Southern Italians (N = 176; Mage = 16.17), we found that those who endorsed ideological beliefs related to the honorableness of male violence reported lower intentions to engage in antimafia activities. Consistent with the hypothesized mechanisms, this relationship was mediated by more positive attitudes toward COs, and lower reported vicarious shame in relation to the activities of COs. Directions for future research and implications for research on gangs are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - The managed prosumer: evolving knowledge strategies in the design of information infrastructures
AN  - 1551000528; 201429537
AB  - This paper contributes to the reworking of the traditional concepts and methods of Science and Technology Studies that is necessary in order to analyse the development and use of social media and other emerging information infrastructures (IIs). Through long-term studies of the development of two contrasting IIs, the paper examines the prosumer-management strategies by which vendors manage their relationships with their diverse users. Despite the sharp differences between our cases -- an online-game with social network features and traditional enterprise systems -- we find striking homologies in the ways vendors manage the tensions underpinning the design and development of mass-market products. Thus their knowledge infrastructures -- the set of tools and instruments through which vendors maintain an adequate understanding of their multiple users -- change in the face of competing exigencies. Market expansion may favour 'efficient' quantitative user assessment methods and the construction of abstract user categories for designing new generic solutions and services around market segments. However where a product extends into new and unfamiliar user markets the growing social distance between developer and user may call for 'richer' direct ways of knowing the user. We note the emergence of collective fora, which can provide a space for independent action and innovation by users. However, these were managed communities. Certain user relations functions were pushed out to the community or third-party organizations and at other times pulled back in-house -- for example, to increase vendor direct control. This picture is far removed from the visions of seamless integration of producers and users encouraged by notions such as prosumer. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Religious Affiliation and Attitudes Towards Gay Men: On the Mediating Role of Masculinity Threat
AN  - 1559006880; 201431865
AB  - Previous research suggests that people from some religious backgrounds hold more negative attitudes towards gay men than others do. The current research focuses on psychological variables as an alternative explanation to religious affiliation, testing whether masculinity beliefs regarding gay men and their perceived threat to one's masculinity can explain such between-group differences in negative attitudes. With a sample of 155 male heterosexual university students (Muslims and Christians in Germany), we found that Muslims held more negative attitudes towards gay men than Christians did. Yet, this relation was partially mediated by beliefs about the masculinity of gay men and the experience of masculinity threat imposed by gay men, substantially reducing the effect of religious affiliation on antigay attitudes. In sum, similar psychological processes explained antigay attitudes of both Muslims and Christians. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Attitudes towards English in Norway: A corpus-based study of attitudinal expressions in newspaper discourse
AN  - 1680154508; 201515345
AB  - This article explores some dimensions of how the role of the English language in Norway has been discursively constructed in newspapers during recent years, based on the analysis of data from the five-year period 2008-2012. The analysis is conducted using a specialised corpus containing 3,743 newspaper articles which were subjected to corpus-based macro-analyses and techniques, as well as manual micro-level analyses and categorisation. The main focus of the analysis is on the manifestation of attitudes through various ways of expression, such as the occurrence of lexical sequences and conceptual metaphors related to language. The results show that even though positive perceptions of English were quite frequent in the data, the main part consisted of expressions where English is seen in a negative light. Hence, a fairly negative attitude towards the role of English is predominant, as illustrated by the most frequent conceptual metaphor, LANGUAGE IS AN INVADING FORCE, where English is at war with and seen as representing a threat to the Norwegian language.

T1  - Achieving twelve-months of intergroup bias reduction: The dual identity-electronic contact (DIEC) experiment
AN  - 1559005365; 201432223
AB  - This longitudinal experiment addresses a critical gap in the intergroup relations literature by showing that the theory-driven nine-week dual identity E-contact (DIEC) intervention is successful in maintaining a reduction in intergroup bias twelve months post-intervention. Here, 92 Muslim and 96 Christian students completed measures of affective intergroup bias, intergroup anxiety, and outgroup knowledge twelve months after completing either the DIEC or control program. In line with predictions, these main effect analyses revealed that the affective intergroup bias reduction observed among DIEC participants, compared to control participants at two weeks post-intervention was maintained at twelve months post-intervention. Additional analyses investigating religious group differences revealed however that this bias reduction was confined to Muslim DIEC students only. Finally, outgroup friendship was found to continue to moderate, and intergroup anxiety continue to mediate, the effects of the DIEC program on intergroup bias reduction for Muslim students -- even with a twelve month absence of cooperative intergroup contact or dual identity curricula. This final and significant piece of empirical information is definitive in addressing the dearth of long-term intergroup bias reduction literature. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - The Subjective Group Dynamics of Inter- and Intragroup Criminality in the News: The Role of Prior Television News Viewing as a Moderator
AN  - 1680151028; 201514672
AB  - Participants read a crime news story featuring two perpetrators. Building on subjective group dynamics, we predicted that a perpetrator would be evaluated differently depending on the partner's ethnicity and participants' prior media use. Results show that heavy news consumers were more likely to (a) give a harsher sentence to a white perpetrator acting with a white (vs. Latino) partner, and (b) develop more negative attitudes toward Latinos when members of that group were portrayed in intergroup criminal partnerships. The implications of intergroup portrayals for perceptions of the ingroup, as well as the outgroup, and the moderating effects of news viewing on such effects, are discussed. .

T1  - Unpacking the Use of Social Media for Protest Behavior: The Roles of Information, Opinion Expression, and Activism: PROD
AN  - 1372783007
AB  - Recent studies have shown a positive link between frequency of social media use and political participation. However, there has been no clear elaboration of how using social media translates into increased political activity. The current study examines three explanations for this relationship in the context of citizens' protest behavior: information (social media as a source for news), opinion expression (using social media to express political opinions), and activism (joining causes and finding mobilizing information through social media). To test these relationships, the study uses survey data collected in Chile in 2011, amid massive demonstrations demanding wholesale changes in education and energy policy. Findings suggest that using social media for opinion expression and activism mediates the relationship between overall social media use and protest behavior. These findings deepen our knowledge of the uses and effects of social media and provide new evidence on the role of digital platforms as facilitators of direct political action.

T1  - Predictors of Collective Guilt after the Violent Conflict
AN  - 1417523563; 201335027
AB  - After a violent conflict many post-conflict communities remain ethnically divided and normalization of the inter-group relations is hindered not only by in-group norms and interpretation of past events, but also by collective guilt. Although collective guilt has proved to be an important indicator of post-conflict social repair, more research is needed to define its predictors. This study, conducted in an ethnically divided community, confirmed that collective guilt acceptance and collective guilt assignment in our sample are typical for the post-conflict pattern of intergroup relations -- people readily assign guilt to the outgroup but are unwilling to accept the guilt of their in-group. This suggests that the process of community social reconstruction has not considerably progressed. Our findings also suggest that the two aspects of collective guilt -- assignment and acceptance -- are predicted by similar sets of variables. Both collective guilt assignment and collective guilt acceptance are influenced by identification with in-group which influence is fully or partially mediated with the justification of the in-group's wrongdoings. This indicates that in the post-conflict setting relationship towards the in-group may be more important for experiencing collective guilt than the relationship towards the out-group. Relationship towards out-group, although not crucial, also plays a role in experiencing collective guilt. Specifically, both affect towards and cognitions about out-group members predict collective guilt assignment (with cognition being stronger predictor than positive affect), whereas only (absence of) positive affect predicts acceptance of collective guilt and the cognitive aspect is not predictive.

T1  - Romaphobia Among Serbian Adolescents: The Role of National In-group Attitudes and Perceived Threat
AN  - 1283642562; 201303381
AB  - This study employed the integrated threat theory to examine Serbian adolescents' attitudes towards the Roma. The sample consisted of 687 secondary school students (mean age 17), of whom 53% were females. In a survey-based study, we assessed adolescents' national in-group attitudes (i.e., nationalism), their feelings toward the Roma, and their perception of economic and symbolic threat. Findings suggest that perceived threat to either real resources or worldviews of the dominant group was related to more negative attitudes towards the Roma minority. Further, Romaphobia was positively related to adolescents' nationalism and this relationship was partially mediated by perceived economic and symbolic threat. The theoretical and educational implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Completing the Implicit Association Test Reduces Positive Intergroup Interaction Behavior
AN  - 1364701252; 201323151
AB  - It is frequently suggested that increasing awareness of intergroup bias and limited control over biased responses can improve intergroup interaction behavior. Some uses of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) epitomize this approach to improving intergroup relations. However, if completing the IAT enhances caution and inhibition, reduces self-efficacy, or primes categorical thinking, the test may instead have negative effects. Two experiments demonstrated that when White individuals completed a race-relevant IAT prior to an intergroup interaction (as compared with when they did not), their interaction partner left the exchange feeling less positively regarded. No such effect was evident when White individuals completed a race-irrelevant IAT (Study 1) or an explicit prejudice measure (Study 2) before the exchange, or when their interaction partner was White (Study 1). Mediation analyses (Study 2) suggested that White participants who completed the IAT communicated less positive regard because they adopted a cautious approach to the interaction, limiting their self-disclosure.

T1  - Masbirim Israel: Israel's PR Campaign as Glocalized and Grobalized Political Prosumption: PROD
AN  - 939162274
AB  - In 2010, Israel's Ministry of Information and Diaspora Affairs launched a new campaign: Masbirim Israel. Its purpose was to "recruit" Israeli citizens to the task of improving the nation's public image in the world. It was the first time a well-organized campaign was launched, systematically employing new-media tools and calling on Israeli citizens to independently take part in improving their country's international image -- all at the behest of a government ministry. The executive authority in effect delivered some of its responsibilities and obligations to private hands. This article discusses prosumption in the political sphere and expands the idea of prosumption to a domain in which the state itself is the producer and its citizens are the consumers. Prosumption is perceived as acts conducted by citizens who operate to fulfill aims (i.e., produce products) that traditionally have been in the purview of the state. The article presents two arguments: First, the campaign is an expression of the idea of prosumption in the political sphere. By integrating Israel's citizens in the process of public relations (PR), they become prosumers in the sense that they participate in the production of a public good that traditionally has been supplied by the state. Second, the Masbirim Israel campaign is an expression of a glocalized and grobalized condition in Israeli reality, as it reflects trends of neoliberal values and practices of privatization and expresses the political opinions of (extreme) nationalism and particularism to nonformally "recruit" its citizens to the national PR effort.

T1  - Improving implicit and explicit intergroup attitudes using imagined contact: An experimental intervention with elementary school children
AN  - 1023028882; 201223708
AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of imagined intergroup contact (Crisp & Turner, 2009) on elementary school children's explicit and implicit intergroup attitudes. Italian 5th-graders participated in a 3-week intervention involving imagining meeting an unknown immigrant peer in various situations. Approximately 1 week after the last session, they completed measures of self-disclosure and behavioral intentions toward immigrants. Furthermore, they were administered a measure of implicit prejudice. Results showed that those taking part in the intervention, compared to participants in a control condition, revealed more positive behavioral intentions and implicit attitudes toward immigrants. Moreover, self-disclosure mediated the effect of imagined contact on outgroup behavioral intentions. Theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed.

T1  - Perceived out-group (dis)continuity and attribution of responsibility for the Lebanese Civil War mediate effects of national and religious subgroup identification on intergroup attitudes
AN  - 1023028874; 201223691
AB  - Successful reconciliation between groups following a violent conflict requires psychological change. We test a model predicting intergroup attitudes towards Muslims in Lebanon among Maronite (Christian) Lebanese youths. Identification with both their religious subgroup and with the superordinate national group predicted attitudes towards Muslims, in opposite directions. These effects of levels of identification on intergroup attitudes were mediated by attributions of responsibility for the war (Muslim responsibility) and perception that the current generation of out-group members is different from the war generation (perceived out-group discontinuity). Identification with Lebanon fosters positive attitudes towards Muslims by lowering Muslim responsibility for the war, and by increasing perceptions of foreign responsibility and perceived out-group discontinuity. In contrast, increased identification with their own religious subgroup undermines attitude change by increasing Muslim responsibility for the war and lessening perception of out-group discontinuity. Representations of the past have implications for attitudes towards former enemies and reconciliation in the present. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - News use and political socialization among young Jordanians: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1907814848
AB  - This study examined the relationship between young Jordanians' (N = 321) news use and their feelings toward the Jordanian and US governments. Consumption of traditional news delivery formats (such as print newspapers, radio broadcasts and interpersonal sources) was measured, as was reliance on new media formats such as blogs, text messaging and podcasting. Political socialization measures were indices of political trust and appraisals of the US government. Results suggest that young Jordanians in the sample rely mostly on TV news, newspapers and interpersonal contacts for current events information, and that TV news use and reliance on interpersonal sources were associated with negative views of the US government.

T1  - Attitudes influence implicit racial face categorization in a perceptual task: GPIR
AN  - 1907333120
AB  - Perceptual mechanisms have been proposed for the categorization of racial faces. Social cognitive mechanisms involved in the categorization of racial faces, however, remain unclear. The present study investigated whether and how attitudes influence racial face categorization by measuring reaction times to judge orientations of own-race or other-race faces. Study 1 showed that, in a task of judging orientations of Caucasian and Asian faces, European Americans responded faster to own-race (Caucasian) faces than to other-race (Asian) faces. Study 2 showed that Han Chinese responded faster to own-race (Han Chinese) faces than to other-race (Uigur Chinese) faces. In addition, we found that, in both experiments, own-race advantage in reaction times was eliminated by inducing negative attitudes toward own-race faces using a negative association priming procedure. Moreover, the mediation analysis in Study 2 showed that the priming effect was mediated by attitude bias toward own-race faces. Our findings provide evidence for categorization of racial faces in a perceptual, race-irrelevant task, which, however, is strongly modulated by attitudes toward target faces.

Female students viewed gay men and lesbians in similar ways. Male students, on the other hand, held more negative attitudes toward gay men than toward lesbians. Participants reported widespread experiences of homophobic behaviors in their schools, especially verbal abuse. Students' perceptions of a homophobic school climate and respondent sex predicted homophobic attitudes among participants. Homophobic school climate mediated the relationship between respondent sex (male) and homophobia against gay men.

T1  - COMMUNITY PERCEPTIONS AND TREATMENT-SEEKING BEHAVIOUR REGARDING REPRODUCTIVE TRACT INFECTIONS INCLUDING SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS IN LAO PDR: A QUALITATIVE STUDY
AN  - 857656859; 21211093
AB  - Summary              Creating community awareness of reproductive tract infections (RTI), including sexually transmitted infections (STI), and how to prevent them is essential to minimize their spread. Data on people's views about RTI/STI are entirely lacking in Laos. The aim of this study was thus to explore people's perceptions, treatment-seeking behaviour and understanding of information about RTI/STI, in urban and rural communities in two provinces in Laos. Fourteen focus group discussions and 20 in-depth interviews were held with 76 women and 56 men, selected purposively to provide diversity of socio-demographic backgrounds. Qualitative content analysis was employed for the data analysis. The major finding was that both male and female participants had a variety of misconceptions about the causes and symptoms of RTI/STI and their cure, and a reluctance to seek health care, which could cause delay in appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The most common treatment-seeking behaviour was self-medication through private pharmacies, following advice mostly given by friends and drug sellers. The main reasons for not going to health facilities were fear of social discrimination or shyness of genital examination. Complaints were also made about clinicians' negative attitudes towards 'dirty disease'. Although condom use was mentioned as a way to prevent RTI/STI, an unwillingness to use condoms was commonly expressed. The main media sources of RTI/STI information were radio and television, and access to health information was more difficult in rural areas. The health messages provided were mostly  understood, except for some technical terms. The findings indicate that strengthening health education and promotion through interventions at the community level is recommended to improve quality of RTI/STI management. Health education messages should be more accessible in rural areas. There is also an urgent need to improve communication between RTI/STI patients and clinicians. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Effects of Death Reminders on Sex Differences in Prejudice Toward Gay Men and Lesbians
AN  - 881465439; 201116485
AB  - Terror management research shows that death reminders (mortality salience) increase prejudice toward worldview violators. Two studies investigated whether death reminders exacerbated differences in heterosexual men's and women's reports of sexual prejudice (negative attitudes based on sexual orientation). Results showed that following death reminders, sex differences in anti-gay discrimination and affective prejudice toward gay men (but not toward lesbians) were larger, and that these increased sex differences were mediated by gender role beliefs. The current studies suggest that researchers may attenuate the effects of death reminders by lessening the perceived worldview violation in addition to alleviating the existential terror of death.

T1  - Living local: some remarks on the creation of social groups of young Jews in present-day London
AN  - 881466622; 201116405
AB  - This article looks at the formation of social groups of young Jews in present-day London. In order to analyse the creation of these groups, the focus is on the level of voluntary grassroots groups, which allows for an in-depth analysis of the creation and maintenance of the groups, as well as an analysis of the membership. However, as important as who participated as a member of the groups is to understand, understanding which Jews did not participate in the groups is also important, as this gives an insight into the faultlines and cleavages of Jewish identities in the present. The findings indicate that young Jews in London gather along the lines of a shared inner-Jewish ethnic subgroup and within this subgroup with co-ethnics who share similar attitudes, values and motivations. Furthermore, the findings indicate that present-day London Jews live within a heavily nationalised if not localised framework, because the goals of the groups are mainly local with a few national features.

T1  - National Identity in the Political Discourse in Slovakia
AN  - 905650545
AB  - The present paper seeks to integrate social identity theory and theory of social representations, in the attempt to describe the links between the national identity and Slovakia's attitudes towards the Other. The paper's position is founded in the assumption that national identity is constructed and deconstructed discursively through the means of socialisation (media, education, legislation and everyday practices). Slovakia has recently adopted several controversial acts that substantially regulate the aforementioned means of socialisation, and are said to be designed to protect the nation, national identity and integrity, which itself implies perception of a threat of some kind. It is hypothesized that rhetoric of such laws constructs national identity as one that is threatened by the Other, while overemphasizing the presence of intergroup threat and conflict. Such discourse thus makes people defend themselves and re-evaluate their national identity, by reaffirming who they are in the respective intergroup affairs. The conflicts not only heighten identification with a group but also create antagonistic intergroup attitudes. Through a brief discourse analysis of the abovementioned laws (Act on the State Language, Act on Citizenship and Patriotism Act) the paper aims to analyse social representations of nation and national identity in the political discourse and their potential impact on intergroup relations between the so called 'Old Slovaks' (ethnic Slovaks) and the Other. We thus seek to test the extent to which Slovakia adheres to the universalistic principles of equality and justice, or to which it heightens social significance of ethnicity and creates division within society.

T1  - Anti-Muslim Attitudes in The Netherlands: Tests of Contradictory Hypotheses Derived from Ethnic Competition Theory and Intergroup Contact Theory
AN  - 1018358094; 201212882
AB  - In this study, we set out to explain anti-Muslim attitudes in the Netherlands. Although the presence and immigration of Muslims have become widely discussed, there is little systematic evidence about the determinants underlying anti-Muslim attitudes. Using data from the Social and Cultural Developments in the Netherlands (SOCON) survey (2005, 2006), containing a more detailed measurement of anti-Muslim attitudes, we tested two contradictory mechanisms, derived from ethnic competition theory and intergroup contact theory. Results from hierarchical structural equation modelling indicate that the relative outgroup size induces both intergroup friendship contact as well as perceptions of ethnic threat. However, only the latter turned out to affect anti-Muslim attitudes directly. Moreover, our findings revealed that contact with colleagues belonging to ethnic minority groups reduces negative attitudes towards Muslims and mediates the effect of individual-level determinants on anti-Muslim attitudes. The complementary nature of both ethnic competition theory and intergroup contact theory is illustrated by negative correlation between both mediating mechanisms, as well as the support for a curvilinear relationship between outgroup size and perceived ethnic threat.

T1  - Muslim Women in Canada: Autonomy and Empowerment
AN  - 835111538; 201100525
AB  - This paper presents the findings of an exploratory study of Muslim women in Canada to illustrate the great diversity and complexity of Muslim women's lives. Drawing upon existing literature, newspaper articles, and Canadian Muslim associations and their documentation, this paper contextualizes the pluralistic manifestations of Islam(s) in Canada and demonstrates how these shape Canadian Muslim women's experiences. This is achieved by providing a sketch of Muslim women's places within the dynamics of Canadian diasporic Muslim communities; the choices made for public or religious education; the political and social activities of Canadian Muslim women; the reaffirmation for some of Islamic identity markers, and the recognition of Islamic Law within the Canadian legal system debate. In spite of all this diversity, some common challenges, like those of unemployment and discrimination, still remain issues to be addressed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - What will the others think? In-group norms as a mediator of the effects of intergroup contact
AN  - 758122763; 201056760
AB  - The influence of social norms in the context of intergroup relations has long been recognized by social psychologists, yet research on intergroup contact and social norms have usually remained disconnected. We explored the influence of direct and indirect friendship on attitudes towards ethnic minorities in Norway, and in particular the role of in-group norms about the social approval of intergroup contact as a mechanism that distinguishes direct from indirect contact. Using a sample of school students from 89 classrooms (N=823), we tested this hypothesis with both one level and multi-level structural equation modelling (ML-SEM), where the amount of contact of other classroom members was considered as a form of indirect contact. The results suggest that the intergroup contact of other in-group members (in-group friends or classmates) affects attitudes towards the out-group by changing the perception of in-group norms and by reducing intergroup anxiety. In contrast, direct contact (or contact at the individual level in the case of ML-SEM), improved attitudes only by reducing intergroup anxiety, and did not affect the perception of in-group norms.

T1  - A Tale of Two Counties: Natives’ Opinions toward Immigration in North Carolina<sup> 1 </sup>: IMR
AN  - 2558423079
AB  - This article compares native residents’ opinions and perceptions regarding immigration using a representative survey from a pair of matched North Carolina counties – one that experienced recent growth of its foreign-born population and one that did not. Drawing from several theoretical perspectives, including group threat, contact theory, and symbolic politics, we formulate and empirically evaluate several hypotheses. Results provide limited evidence that competition and threat influence formation of opinions about immigration, with modest support for claims that parents with school-aged children harbor more negative views of immigration than their childless counterparts. Except for residents in precarious economic situations, these negative opinions appear unrelated to the immigrant composition of the community. Claims that the media promotes negative views of immigration receive limited support, but this relationship is unrelated to the volume of local immigration. Finally, sustained contacts with foreign-born residents outside work environments are associated with positive views of immigration, but superficial contacts appear to be conducive to anti-immigration sentiments. Political orientation, educational attainment, and indicators of respondents’ tolerance for diversity explain most of the difference between the two counties in overall support for immigration.

T1  - Keeping the vermin out: Perceived disease threat and ideological orientations as predictors of exclusionary immigration attitudes
AN  - 743065620; 201043066
AB  - Integrating evolutionary and social representations theories, the current study examines the relationship between perceived disease threat and exclusionary immigration attitudes in the context of a potential avian influenza pandemic. This large-scale disease provides a realistic context for investigating the link between disease threat and immigration attitudes. The main aim of this cross-sectional study (N = 412) was to explore mechanisms through which perceived chronic and contextual disease threats operate on immigration attitudes. Structural equation models show that the relationship between chronic disease threat (germ aversion) and exclusionary immigration attitudes (assimilationist immigration criteria, health-based immigration criteria and desire to reduce the proportion of foreigners) was mediated by ideological and normative beliefs (social dominance orientation, belief in a dangerous world), but not by contextual disease threat (appraisal of avian influenza pandemic threat). Contextual disease threat only predicted support for health-based immigration criteria. The conditions under which real-life disease threats influence intergroup attitudes are scrutinized. Convergence and dissimilarity of evolutionary and social representational approaches in accounting for the link between disease threat and immigration attitudes are discussed.

T1  - The Contact Space: A Novel Framework for Intergroup Contact Research
AN  - 743057741; 201043757
AB  - This article presents a new framework for understanding research on the intersection between language, communication, and intergroup contact. Contact theory has described a variety of ways in which contact between groups can reduce prejudice and improve intergroup relations. However, the field has become fragmented by the study of a variety of forms of contact whose interconnections have not been elucidated, and it has paid insufficient attention to the language and communicative dynamics of the contact event itself. This article accounts for the variation in forms of contact studied by arraying them in two-dimensional space organized by (a) involvement of self in contact and (b) richness of self-outgroup experience. The former pertains to whether an individual is directly involved in interaction with an outgroup member (vs. merely observing such contact); the latter pertains to the multiplicity of channels and senses through which one experiences the outgroup member. These two dimensions are argued to be largely orthogonal. The two-dimensional space is used to organize mediators and moderators in the field, to specify in detail the intersection between contact and issues of language and communication, as well as to outline areas of particular promise for specific contact interventions.

T1  - Population Ratios and Prejudice: Modelling Both Contact and Threat Effects
AN  - 743049576; 201031772
AB  - Are small or large outgroup populations more closely related to an ingroup's prejudice? This paper addresses this question with national probability survey data from Germany focused on resident foreigners. Two interlocking processes underlie the complex relationship between population proportions and prejudice. Typically, larger outgroup population proportions simultaneously increase both threat and intergroup contact. The first process increases prejudice, the second decreases it. Using structural equation modelling, our analysis reveals that these two processes can be effectively combined into one complex model. Threat is perceptual; it involves what people think is the outgroup proportion and thus can be easily manipulated by political leaders and the mass media. Contact is experiential; it can reduce individual and collective threat as well as prejudice. The intricate relationship between threat and contact can be substantially altered by numerous moderators. Hence, rigid group segregation can limit contact, while unemployment can amplify threat. The paper provides evidence that reductions in prejudice have important consequences for intergroup relations. Adapted from the source document.
